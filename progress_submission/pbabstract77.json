Nine-month-old obese female SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats that received either nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, or enalapril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, for three months were compared with untreated SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats (controls). After one month, nifedipine significantly decreased body weight in obese females compared to either enalapril or controls. After three months of treatment, total, abdominal, and subcutaneous fat masses were decreased in obese females given nifedipine compared to either enalapril or controls. Enalapril treatment was associated with a redistribution of fat mass from abdominal to subcutaneous depots. Nifedipine reduced plasma triglyceride and fasting glucose levels and improved insulin response to an oral glucose load in obese females, whereas enalapril did not appear to affect glycemic control. Systolic pressure was not significantly decreased until after two months of treatment with nifedipine or three months of treatment with enalapril in obese females and may have coincided with improvement in insulin-resistance. Similarly, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were significantly lower in obese females given nifedipine. To determine how obese males responded to a calcium channel antagonist, six-month-old obese male SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats were treated for three months with either nifedipine or placebo (controls). Nifedipine-treated obese males showed a mild but significant decrease in weight gain that was due to a decrease in fat deposition in both subcutaneous and abdominal depots and systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced after one month of treatment. Nifedipine did not affect other plasma biochemical parameters in obese males. In conclusion, nifedipine improved systolic pressure and glycemic control in obese female SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats, effects that may be associated with a marked loss in body weight and fat mass and improved lipid metabolism. Nifedipine-treated obese males exhibited only a diminished weight gain that was not associated with changes in diabetic characteristics.", 
    "1": "Immunobullous diseases usually develop spontaneously, but drug-induced bullous disease develops in a small subgroup of patients. We examined a patient in whom bullous pemphigoid developed after she received enalapril for treatment of hypertension. IgG antibody directed against a 230 kd antigen was identified. The eluted IgG autoantibody was shown to bind to the basement membrane zone on split skin. This study demonstrates that drug-induced bullous pemphigoid autoantibody in this patient was directed against the same antigen as the spontaneous bullous pemphigoid antigen.", 
    "2": "An improved flow injection analysis (FIA) method has been developed for the determination of trace selenium in biological samples, and this method has been applied to investigate the effect of captopril, an antihypertensive drug having a thiol group, on selenium concentrations in the rat blood, liver and urine. After oral administration of captopril, selenium levels in the blood decreased, while those in the liver increased significantly. However, no pronounced effect was observed on the urinary excretion rate. The glutathione peroxidase activities in the blood and the liver were comparable to the changes in the selenium levels.", 
    "3": "A double-blind, randomised study of the antihypertensive efficacy of perindopril and ketanserin in 44 elderly noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients aged > or = 60 years was conducted. Blood pressure, blood biochemical and haematological parameters, plasma vasoactive hormones, urinary volume, electrolytes and microalbumin were measured at baseline, after a 4-week placebo period, and at intervals during 8 weeks of treatment with active drug. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram data were also obtained. Dosages of perindopril used were 2 mg once daily for 4 weeks doubling to 4 mg once daily if a target blood pressure of < or = 160/90 mm Hg was not reached. Dosages of ketanserin were 40 mg twice daily increasing to 80 mg twice daily. Both drugs caused a small but statistically insignificant reduction in blood pressure. Although the response rates (supine systolic blood pressure reduction of > 10 mm Hg) were 54% for perindopril and 45% for ketanserin, target blood pressure (supine blood pressure 160/90 mm Hg) was reached in only 21% of perindopril and 20% of ketanserin recipients. Plasma creatinine and 24-hour urine sodium excretion increased in patients receiving ketanserin therapy. Glycaemic indices and the lipid profile did not change in either group, except for a reduction in plasma triglycerides in the ketanserin group. No changes in urinary microalbumin, electrocardiogram, or echocardiographic cardiac parameters were observed. It is concluded that in the present study neither drug provoked a significant blood pressure lowering effect and that serum creatinine increased in the ketanserin group.", 
    "4": "1. The effects of CGS 22652, a thromboxane (Tx) A2 synthase inhibitor and TxA2/prostaglandin (PG) H2 receptor antagonist, on blood pressure (BP) were studied in conscious freely moving spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Three groups of 13 male SHR were subcutaneously infused from 5 to 11 weeks of age via osmotic minipumps with CGS 22652 at doses of 5 (SHRa) or 10 (SHRb) mg/kg per 24 h or with the vehicle only (SHRc). A fourth group (SHRd, n = 13) was orally treated from 3 to 11 weeks of age with CGS 22652 (30 mg/kg) given by gavage once a day. 3. CGS 22652 dose-dependently reduced the age-related increase in systolic BP. The pressor response to noradrenaline (200 ng/kg, i.v.) but not to angiotensin I or II was slightly (P < 0.05) diminished in 11 week old SHRb and SHRd compared to SHRc. Acute ganglionic blockade by trimethaphan (10 mg/kg, i.v.), as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by perindopril (2 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased BP to a similar extent in the four groups. After combined blockade of vasopressin receptors and of the autonomic nervous system and the administration of a direct vasodilator (hydralazine, 3 mg/kg, i.v.), the residual mean BP was identical in the four groups of rats. 4. Chronic treatment with CGS 22652 dose-dependent antagonized the TxA2/PGH2 receptors but did not modify the TxA2 synthesis. The urinary sodium excretion did not differ between groups. 5. In conclusion, at the doses used, CGS 22652 given either orally or subcutaneously exhibited only TxA2/PGH2 receptor blocking properties in SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "An erythrocyte (RBC) model based on whole blood was used to investigate the effect of cardiovascular drugs on the uptake of adenosine in vitro. Fresh whole blood obtained from healthy volunteers was allowed to equilibrate with various concentrations (5-1000 microM) of a tested agent. (2-3H)-Adenosine was used as a substrate, and the reaction was terminated after 2 sec of incubation at room temperature by rapid addition of a \"Stopping Solution\" which was a mixture of erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, dipyridamole, and EDTA. The mixture was centrifuged (1760 g, 4 degrees C, 10 min), and the radioactivity of an aliquot of the supernatant was determined by a scintillation counter. The results showed that dipyridamole was the most potent agent tested (IC50 = 0.2 microM). Amongst the calcium antagonists studied, isradipine was most potent, followed by verapamil, clentiazem, diltiazem, and then nifedipine. The racemates of two metabolites of diltiazem, MX and MB, were more potent than the parent drug. The antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone and sotalol, the two new lipid peroxidation inhibitors, U-74389F and U-78517F, and the anxiolytic agent, alprazolam, were as active as verapamil. The beta-receptor antagonist propranolol and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, were practically inactive. In addition, the model was stereoselective such that the S(-)-enantiomer of verapamil was considerably more potent than the R(+)-antipote, whereas d(+)-sotalol was practically inactive compared to racemic sotalol.", 
    "6": "Some of the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors occur through nonangiotensin II-mediated mechanisms. One of these is through decreased kinin degradation, leading to enhanced production of vasodilator arachidonic acid metabolites. It was reasoned that if ACE inhibition also leads to an increase in the production of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2, then maneuvers that selectively inhibit thromboxane production without reducing prostaglandins (PG) E2 + PGI2 might enhance the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibition. This double-blinded, randomized, crossover study was therefore undertaken to determine: (1) if captopril increases platelet and/or renal thromboxane production; and (2) if low-dose aspirin enhances the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Patients with mild essential hypertension and no other significant medical problems were studied. In a double-blinded, random order, patients took captopril alone (25 mg every 12 h) for 2 wk and captopril plus aspirin (75 mg/day) for another 2 wk. Active treatment periods were preceded by 2 wk of single-blind placebo. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 53 yr and an average mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 114 +/- 8 (+/- SD) mm Hg were studied. Serum thromboxane B2 was higher (P < 0.05) during treatment with captopril/placebo (600 +/- 46 (+/- SE) pg/mL) than during the two washout periods combined (420 +/- 57 and 553 +/- 78) and was lowest (P < 0.0005) during treatment with captopril/aspirin (302 +/- 36). Captopril treatment significantly increased the urinary excretion of PGE2 (P = 0.038). Captopril/placebo significantly lowered MAP (P < 0.05) to 105.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg compared with the washout period. However, the addition of aspirin to captopril caused no additional lowering of MAP (105.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg). It was concluded that treatment with captopril does increase platelet thromboxane production. However, lowering platelet thromboxane with low doses of aspirin may not enhance the antihypertensive effect of captopril.", 
    "7": "The effects of long-term oral administration of quinapril on the occurrence of stroke and on mortality were investigated in young salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SPs) during the treatment period (8th-34th week of age) and up to 6 weeks thereafter. Simultaneously, blood pressure, saline intake, diuresis, and proteinuria were investigated at regular intervals, and cerebrovascular, renal, and cardiac lesions were assessed after death. Untreated SHR-SPs served as controls. Quinapril completely suppressed stroke and mortality, afforded only limited protection v blood pressure rise, and prevented any increase in saline intake, diuresis, and proteinuria both during and after the treatment period. Quinapril long-lastingly prevented vascular fibrinoid necrosis development at the cerebral, but also at the renal and cardiac levels. In the kidneys, vascular intimal and medial hyperplasia were strongly reduced, as were the glomerular and tubulo-interstitial lesions. At the cardiac level, intimal and medial hyperplasia were slightly reduced but infarction and fibrosis were hardly affected. As the renin-angiotensin system is highly stimulated in SHR-SPs and as angiotensin II (AII) is responsible for fibrinoid necrosis formation, vessel obstruction, and stroke in these animals, we conclude that the long-lasting protection afforded by quinapril v stroke and mortality in SHR-SPs both during and after the treatment period is mostly due to the drug-induced interruption of the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The metabolic and cardiovascular effects of nitrendipine and cilazapril in patients who have elevated blood pressure and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were compared. After at least 6 weeks of a washout period, 20 NIDDM patients who had diastolic blood pressure in the range of 90-105 mm Hg received a single-blind placebo for 4 weeks and then were randomized to receive 20 mg nitrendipine once daily and 5 mg cilazapril once daily each for 12 weeks according to a crossover, double-blind procedure. Nitrendipine and cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure levels 12% and 13%, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) levels 13% and 12%, and raised whole glucose disposal levels 18% and 19.5%, respectively. Only nitrendipine reduced glucose-stimulated insulin levels. Nitrendipine is as effective as cilazapril in lowering diastolic blood pressure and LVMI levels and in increasing glucose disposal levels in these patients.", 
    "9": "The usefulness of the captopril test as a simultaneous screening method for primary aldosteronism (PA) and renovascular hypertension (RVH) was evaluated in 111 patients with essential hypertension, and in 79 patients with secondary hypertension, which included 16 patients with PA and 18 with RVH. Plasma renin activity (PRA, ng/mL/h) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC, ng/dL) were determined before and 90 min after administration of 50 mg of captopril in the supine position on a normal NaCl diet. A cutoff point or a discriminant function in the screening was determined by discriminant analysis. A quadratic discriminant function of PRA and PAC after the captopril test identified patients with PA with a false negative rate of 6.3% (1/16), and a false positive rate of 0.6% (1/174) which was significantly lower than that of 3.4% at the basal state (P < .05). In the screening for RVH, the criterion of a postcaptopril PRA of greater than 10.6 ng/mL/h had a false negative rate of 5.6% (1/18) and a false positive rate of 15.1% (26/172). This false positive rate was also significantly lower than that using a criterion for precaptopril PRA of 2.21 ng/mL/h (P < .05). Accordingly, the captopril test was a useful method in the simultaneous screening for PA and RVH, and it may be particularly applicable in specialized hypertension clinics.", 
    "10": "The mortality associated with coronary atherosclerosis has decreased by 30% to 40% in the last few decades. This reduction has followed major pharmacological and biotechnological advances and can possibly be attributed to better management of risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and to more effective therapy of its late manifestations. Nevertheless, the coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem. It is responsible for 40% to 45% of deaths in our population and, although it becomes manifest later than previously, its incidence and prevalence may not have declined significantly. Recent studies suggest that progression of coronary atherosclerosis can be delayed, that regression can also occur, and that this can lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality. Several types of interventions have been performed in these studies. Some of them such as a drastic modification in lifestyle, the administration of one or several hypocholesterolemic agents or partial ileal bypass have achieved these results by markedly lowering LDL or raising HDL cholesterol. Other manipulations of plasma lipoproteins are also possible, such as the administration of specific protein or enzyme inhibitors, anti-oxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Calcium antagonists and possibly angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors slow the progression of early coronary lesions and prevent the appearance of new lesions. These interventions, in addition to influencing the size of the atherosclerotic plaque, can have other important effects. They can contribute to the preservation of integrity and function of endothelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "To investigate the contribution of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system to ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction, we examined the effects of 3-week treatments with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril, and a selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, TCV-116, on haemodynamics and ventricular angiotensin II contents in myocardial-infarcted rats. TCV-116 reduced mean aortic pressure, and prevented the increase of right and left ventricular weight, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume of myocardial-infarcted rats, to a similar extent to delapril. Thus, AT1 receptor-mediated action of angiotensin II plays a central role in the development of ventricular dilatation. Angiotensin II contents in the right and non-infarcted left ventricles (6.0 +/- 1.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.7 pg/g tissue, respectively, mean +/- S.E.M.) of myocardial-infarcted rats were not different from those of sham-operated rats. However, angiotensin II contents in the infarcted scar (21.7 +/- 3.5 pg/g) of myocardial-infarcted rats were 4.2-fold higher than those in the left ventricle of sham-operated rats. Delapril reduced angiotensin II contents in the right and non-infarcted left ventricles, and the scar by 48, 81 and 60%, respectively, but did not reduce plasma angiotensin II in myocardial-infarcted rats. TCV-116 also decreased angiotensin II in the right and non-infarcted left ventricles by 57 and 56%, respectively, while increased plasma angiotensin II by 4.3-fold. Thus, the prevention of ventricular dilatation by these two agents was associated with the decrease in ventricular angiotensin II contents. These observations suggest that the cardiac renin-angiotensin system rather than the circulating system may play an important role in ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction.", 
    "12": "The hypotensive and hormonal responses of an AT1-subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist, SR 47436, were investigated and compared with those of DuP 753 (losartan), the leading AT1-receptor antagonist, and captopril and enalapril, two major angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in conscious, sodium-replete and sodium-depleted non-human primates.", 
    "13": "Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious, chronically instrumented sodium-replete (n = 3-5) and sodium-depleted (n = 4) cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Plasma renin activity (PRA), active renin and angiotensin II plasma concentrations were determined.", 
    "14": "SR 47436 induced a dose- and time-related fall in blood pressure in sodium-depleted monkeys; the blood pressure-lowering effect was obtained at a range of doses from one-third to one-tenth the equihypotensive dose of DuP 753 after intravenous and oral administrations. The hypotensive effect obtained with SR 47436 was similar to that of captopril and was sustained in sodium-replete monkeys, although it was weaker and less long-lasting than that of enalaprilat. In both sodium-depleted and sodium-replete monkeys the AT1 antagonist and ACE inhibitors caused similar increases in PRA and active renin. However, although angiotensin II levels increased after SR 47436 or DuP 753 treatment, they decreased after treatment with enalaprilat. Modest decreases in the heart rate sometimes accompanied the hypotension, irrespective of the compound tested.", 
    "15": "These data demonstrate that the AT1 antagonist SR 47436 is an effective hypotensive agent in both sodium-replete and sodium-depleted monkeys, with an intrinsic potency three to 10 times that of DuP 753 and similar to that of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "16": "Through the multiple actions of angiotensin II (AII), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin II acts by binding to specific membrane-bound receptors, which are coupled to one of several signal transduction pathways. These AII receptors exhibit heterogeneity, represented by AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes. The AT1 receptor mediates the major cardiovascular action of the RAS. This receptor has been cloned from multiple species, disclosing features consistent with a transmembrane, G-protein-linked receptor. Further AII receptor heterogeneity is evident by the cloning of isotypes of the AT1 receptor. Blocking the interaction of AII with its receptor is the most direct site to inhibit the actions of the RAS. Many AII receptor antagonists, including peptide analogs of AII and antibodies directed against AII, possess unfavorable properties that have limited their clinical utility. The discovery and further development of imidazole compounds with AII antagonist properties and favorable characteristics, however, has promise for clinical utility. The leader in this field is a selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (previously known as DuP 753 or MK-954). Losartan was demonstrated to be an effective antagonist of many AII-induced actions and an effective antihypertensive agent in many animal models of hypertension (HTN). Losartan also demonstrated secondary benefits in preventing stroke, treating congestive heart failure (CHF), and delaying the progression of renal disease in animal models. Clinical studies confirm the AII antagonist action of losartan and suggest that losartan will be effective in the treatment of essential HTN. AII antagonism is likely to provide useful treatment in essential HTN and CHF, conditions in which the RAS is known to play a major role. The utility of AII antagonism may extend beyond that of HTN and CHF, as suggested by the potential usefulness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the treatment or prevention of many other diseases. The key advantage AII antagonists provide over ACE inhibitors is that they may avoid unwanted side effects, related to bradykinin potentiation with the latter drugs. The AII antagonists will help determine the role of the RAS in physiologic regulation and in the pathophysiology of various disease states.", 
    "17": "Alterations in the right ventricular function may or may not contribute to progressive cardiac dysfunction after left ventricular infarction. Ligation of the left coronary artery (LCAL) was lethal within 24 h for 25% of 100 rats, whereas none of 21 sham-operated rats died. No rats died during the following 4 weeks, after which the ischaemic area of the left ventricular wall appeared fibrotic and weighed 0.041% of the body weight. Simultaneously, the weight of the right ventricle increased from 0.037 to 0.072% of the body weight. The hypertrophied right papillary muscle had a depressed force of contraction and prolonged contraction and relaxation phases. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) started early (24 h) prevented hypertrophy and normalized the contractile pattern under basic conditions. However, isoprenaline stimulation revealed that the relaxation phase was still prolonged. Concentration-effect curves for Ca2+ indicated that the pathological relaxation observed in the hypertrophied muscles and during isoprenaline stimulation of myocardium in ACEI treated animals could be due to insufficient re-uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The results support the idea that the development of right ventricular hypertrophy may contribute to pathophysiological consequences of an infarct in the left ventricle. ACEI started after 24 h prevented hypertrophy, whereas ACEI started after 14 days did not. ACEI was unable to normalize completely the balance between energy demand and energy delivery.", 
    "18": "1. In order to determine whether the renin-angiotensin system is involved in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, we investigated and compared the effects on infarct size of two different drugs which interfere with this system, i.e., an angiotensin II (AT1) antagonist, EXP3174, and an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalaprilat in a canine model of ischaemia-reperfusion. 2. EXP3174 (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v. followed by 0.02 mg kg-1 h-1 for 5.5 h) and enalaprilate (0.3 mg kg-1, i.v. followed by 0.06 mg kg-1 h-1 for 5.5 h) were used in doses inducing a similar level of inhibition (87 +/- 4 and 91 +/- 3%, respectively) of the pressor responses to angiotensin I. Control animals received saline. 3. Infarct size and area at risk were quantified by ex vivo dual coronary perfusion with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and monastral blue dye. Regional myocardial blood flows (ischaemic and nonischaemic, endocardial, epicardial) were assessed by the radioactive microsphere technique. 4. Both EXP3174 and enalaprilat induced a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. However, non significant changes in regional myocardial blood flows, whether ischaemic or nonischaemic, were observed after administration of either the ACEI or the AT1 antagonist. 5. The size of the area at risk was similar in the three groups. By direct comparison, there were no significant differences between infarct sizes in the three groups. Furthermore, there was a close inverse relationship between infarct size and transmural mean collateral blood flow in controls, and none of the treatments altered this correlation. Thus, neither EXP3174 nor enalaprilat limited infarct size. 6. These results indicate that activation of the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute to myocyte death in this canine ischaemia/reperfusion model.", 
    "19": "The effect of enalaprilat on the membrane potential of cultured neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells was investigated using the current clamp method. The NG108-15 cell line characteristically differentiates into neurons after addition of 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP to the culture medium. First it was found that enalaprilat inhibits both sodium and calcium currents in the cell membrane of differentiated NG108-15 cells. At concentrations between 10 and 100 microM, this inhibitory effect was reversible and transient, and occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Prolonged washing with normal saline (> 20 min) was needed to completely reverse the inhibitory effect of enalaprilat. The higher the concentration of enalaprilat, the greater its suppressant action on the membrane potential, and at high concentrations (100 microM), enalaprilat caused the peak membrane potential to disappear. When cells were incubated with enalaprilat, 100 microM, for longer periods, however, this inhibitory effect appeared to become irreversible. These findings suggest that enalaprilat has an inhibitory effect on the electrophysiological activity of neurons especially on membrane calcium currents.", 
    "20": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have provided a remarkable improvement in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension and congestive heart failure. The cardiac renin-angiotensin system is one of the major targets of ACE inhibitor therapy since recent studies show that the human heart contains high affinity angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors and ACE activity. However, it is not clear why ACE inhibitors are more effective than other vasodilators in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. This gap in knowledge led us to study the biochemical mechanism of Ang II formation in the human heart. Such studies have only recently been addressed. So far, two Ang II-forming enzymes (ACE and human chymase) have been identified. Unlike in the rat heart, the minor (10%) component of Ang II-forming activity in the left ventricle is due to ACE, whereas the major (80%) component is due to human chymase. This novel cardiac serine proteinase has been purified from the human left ventricle and characterized, and recently, the cDNA and the gene for this enzyme have been cloned. Biochemical characterization revealed that human chymase is the most efficient and specific Ang II-forming enzyme described thus far, but the cellular and regional distribution of two Ang II-forming enzymes seem to be quite different. ACE is localized mainly in endothelial cells and its expression level is higher in atria than ventricles whereas chymase is localized in the interstitial region of the myocardium and its expression is higher in ventricles than atria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "This study aimed to determine the density of vascular beta-adrenergic receptors in cultured endothelial cells and to study the regulation of endothelial receptors after exposure to catecholamines and the ACE inhibitors, lisinopril and ramiprilat. Membranes from bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) showed saturable binding of the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). The beta-receptor density and binding affinity were comparable in both types of endothelial cells. Isoproterenol induced significant down-regulation of beta-receptors (-50%; P < 0.01). Incubation (24h) with the ACE inhibitors lisinopril 10(-5) M (+28.8%; P < 0.05) and ramiprilat 10(-5) M (+33.7%, P < 0.09) augmented the beta-receptor density in BAEC, but lower ACE inhibitor doses had no affect. Incubation with lisinopril 10(-5) M for 24 h resulted in significantly lower cAMP baseline levels, but did not affect cAMP concentrations after stimulation with isoproterenol. These results indicate that down-regulation of endothelial beta-receptors occurs during prolonged exposure to beta-stimulation, and that high concentrations of ACE inhibitors may affect the density of endothelial beta-receptors.", 
    "22": "ACE inhibitors may influence the actual concentrations of the peptides angiotensin I, angiotensin II and bradykinin. Since all three peptides are able to modulate catecholamine release, a change in noradrenaline and adrenaline release should be expected when angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) is inhibited. Furthermore, converting enzyme inhibitors may also act indirectly on sympathetic membranes affecting, for instance, the reuptake mechanism of noradrenaline. It was shown that chronic ACE inhibition did not change biosynthesis, storage or release of catecholamines. However, the reuptake of noradrenaline was slightly but significantly diminished by ramipril. Whereas Ang I exerted no facilitating action on noradrenaline, bradykinin stimulated noradrenaline release dose-dependently, almost during converting enzyme inhibition. It is concluded that bradykinin may compensate for the lack of effect of converting enzyme inhibitors on catecholamine release.", 
    "23": "We investigated the effects of inhibition of both nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on agonist-induced relaxations in the coronary system. Chronically instrumented conscious dogs (n = 4) were prepared for the measurement of coronary blood flow (CBF), coronary diameter of the left circumflex artery (LCX), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine, adenosine and bradykinin were performed after intracoronary pretreatment of either vehicle, L-NAME (6 mg.kg-1), captopril (1 mg.kg-1) or both L-NAME+captopril. Acetylcholine bradykinin and adenosine caused dose-dependent increases in CBF and LCX. HR increased concomitantly. Captopril potentiated the vasodilating effects of bradykinin and acetylcholine on LCX and CBF significantly (P < or = 0.05) and those of adenosine slightly. L-NAME caused vasoconstriction, hypertension and bradycardia. The effects of acetylcholine on CBF were abolished during L-NAME treatment while bradykinin and adenosine responses were markedly reduced. When captopril and L-NAME were given simultaneously, the vasodilator responses to bradykinin but not to acetylcholine or adenosine were partially restored (P < or = 0.05). We conclude that in vivo, (a) adenosine possibly elicits endothelium-dependent dilation; (b) adenosine and bradykinin act in part independently of the L-arginine/NO pathway; (c) vasodilation to acetylcholine is potentiated by acute ACE inhibition via NO-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "24": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, moexiprilat and ramiprilat, relaxed preconstricted endothelium-intact bovine coronary artery rings and enhanced the relaxant response to bradykinin. The relaxation was observed in the presence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and without previous exposure to bradykinin. ACE inhibitor-dependent relaxation was attenuated by the selective B2-kinin receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, and completely abolished by removal of the endothelium. Bradykinin or moexiprilat also significantly increased the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content of these coronary segments, an effect which was abolished by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), or by removal of the endothelium. NNA also diminished the relaxant response to moexiprilat, but only partially inhibited that to bradykinin, suggesting that the ACE inhibitor-induced relaxation was predominantly mediated by endothelial NO release, whereas bradykinin acted in part by another endothelium-dependent mechanism. These findings indicate that ACE inhibitors can elicit endothelium-dependent relaxations presumably by facilitating the accumulation of endothelium-derived kinins in or at the vessel wall. This local mechanism may significantly contribute to the antihypertensive action of these compounds in vivo.", 
    "25": "Part of the vasodilator response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors depends on stimulation of bradykinin receptors, but in most studies the anticipated increase in plasma kinin concentration during ACE inhibition was not detected. We investigated the role of local ACE inhibition on endothelial control of vascular tone. Rings of bovine coronary, renal and tail arteries, as well as human coronary arteries, were mounted in organ chambers so that the isometric force could be recorded. The ACE inhibitors, captopril, fosinoprilat, enalaprilat, lisinopril, and ramiprilat alone had no affect on the vascular tone of bovine coronary arteries with endothelium. However, these ACE inhibitors did potentiate relaxations to bradykinin and the slowly degradable bradykinin derivative [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-bradykinin (3 x 10(-11) M). A similar response was observed in human coronary arteries. The response was not observed in rings of any vessel without endothelium, or after incubation with nitro-L-arginine (10(-4) M), or the bradykinin2-receptor antagonists Hoe 140 (10(-8) M). The sensitivity to bradykinin was higher and the potentiating effect of ACE inhibition larger in the bovine coronary artery than in the renal and tail artery. Thus, ACE inhibition causes selective coronary vasodilation by potentiating the bradykinin-induced release of nitric oxide from the endothelium. The related mechanism underlying these effects must occur at the surface or within the arterial wall and seems to be independent of the degradation of the kinins.", 
    "26": "The tools which have led to a better understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining the tone of peripheral arteries in cardiovascular disease consist of highly specific and sensitive methods to measure the different components of the renin-angiotensin system and in specific probes used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system at several points of the enzymatic cascade. The therapeutic efficacy of these more and more specific probes undoubtedly provides strong circumstantial evidence that angiotensin II plays an important role in determining peripheral vascular tone. While this has considerably increased our understanding of the regulatory mechanism involved in blood pressure maintenance in normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients, the role of the renin-angiotensin system as an aetiological factor in the development of essential hypertension still remains unclear.", 
    "27": "A series of peptide analogs and fragments of bradykinin were designed and synthesized on solid supports using Boc and Fmoc strategies, and on polyethylene pins using Fmoc strategy. The peptides were purified, characterized and tested for their inhibitory effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme. The inhibition of the converting enzyme. The inhibition of the enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically using Furylacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly as the substrate. Apparent Ki's were determined for the substrates, which exhibited significant inhibition in the initial screening assay using 10 microM of the peptide inhibitor. Short peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of bradykinin were found to be poor inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. However, bradykinin-like peptides with modifications at their amino terminus are effective inhibitors. The best inhibitor found in this study, Ala2,6-des-Pro3-bradykinin, has an apparent Ki of 30.2 nM, compared to an apparent Ki of 94 nM for des-Pro3-bradykinin, which was reported to be a better inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme than captopril.", 
    "28": "The effects of N-[8-amino-1(S)-carboxyoctyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (AB-47, CAS 120008-53-9), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular, autonomic systems, isolated smooth muscles and other functions were investigated in various experimental animals. AB-47 had no effect on central nervous, autonomic systems and isolated smooth muscles. AB-47 (10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly lowered femoral blood pressure without affecting respiration and heart rate in anesthetized rats. However, AB-47 had no effect on the contractile tension of mammalian isolated atrium and aorta. AB-47 had no effect on gastrointestinal transit in mice. Very slight injury of gastric mucosa was observed 4 h after the oral administration of AB-47 in rats but AB-47 did not damage the small intestinal mucosa. AB-47 had no effect on the contraction of rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation induced by electrical stimulation. AB-47 did not affect the incidence of acetic acid-induces writhings. AB-47 potentiated carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. The potentiation of edema may be due to an accumulation of bradykinin induced by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), because ACE is the identical enzyme with kinase II. The pretreatment of AB-47 for 7 days (1, 3, 10 mg/kg/d p.o.) inhibited the cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (isoprenaline). This result suggests that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system directly or indirectly participates in the cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The study aimed to evaluate the safety and reliability of captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) for diagnosing functionally significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) in hypertensive patients with a solitary kidney. Radionuclide studies were carried out using 100 MBq 99Tcm-mercaptoacetyl triglycine (MAG3), 1 h after administration of 50 mg captopril, and repeated in baseline condition when abnormalities were observed in the provocative study. Scintigraphic diagnosis of RAS was based on analysis of captopril-induced changes of the radiorenographs. Overall, 12 patients with a solitary kidney were investigated, and scintigraphic results compared to angiographic findings. All five patients with positive CRS showed an RAS > 50%, whereas only one of the seven patients with negative CRS was affected by RAS. A significant fall in mean arterial pressure was recorded after captopril administration (123 +/- 12 mm Hg before versus 108 +/- 11 after), but no serious side effects were observed. Our results demonstrate that captopril-induced modifications of the renogram could effectively be used to diagnose the presence of RAS. Captopril renal scintigraphy may therefore be suggested as a reliable and safe noninvasive approach to evaluate hypertensive patients with a solitary kidney.", 
    "30": "The cardiac renin-angiotensin system is activated in experimental heart failure, but it is unknown at what stage of heart failure it becomes activated, and whether activation is related to ventricular dysfunction and dilatation. Changes in activity of cardiac, renal, and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were therefore examined at different stages of experimental heart failure, with simultaneous measurements of left ventricular pressure, systolic dP/dt, and inner ventricular radius.", 
    "31": "Heart failure was induced by experimental infarction in 17 normotensive male Wistar rats; 14 rats were sham operated. Rats were killed 3, 5, or 80 d after infarction. In an isolated heart perfusion, left ventricular pressure and systolic dP/dT were measured. ACE activity was determined in samples of the left and right cardiac ventricle, kidney, and plasma. Radius of the ventricular cavity was planimetrically determined in transverse sections of the left ventricle.", 
    "32": "At the different stages both left ventricular pressure and systolic dP/dT progressively decreased and inner radius of the left ventricle increased in all heart failure groups. ACE activity in the left ventricle increased significantly in all heart failure groups and correlated inversely with left ventricular pressure (R = -0.81; p < 0.001) and dP/dt (R = -0.85; p < 0.001). ACE activity in the kidney was only increased 80 d after the induction of heart failure [17(SEM 1) v 11.2(0.5) nM His-Leu generated per min.mg-1, p < 0.01], while plasma ACE activity was not increased in any heart failure group.", 
    "33": "Cardiac ACE is activated in the early stage after induction of heart failure and is related to the amount of dysfunction. ACE in the kidney is activated only in the chronic stage. The cardiac renin-angiotensin system therefore already appears to be an important neurohumoral adjustment in the early stage of heart failure and is thereby a suitable target for early intervention by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "34": "Heart rate variability has attracted attention as an index of the effects of the autonomic nerve system on the heart rhythm. Heart rate variability (HRV) is low in patients at risk for sudden death. We evaluated the effects of caffeine, whole-day work without sleep and drugs on HRV. Caffeine had no effects on HRV or ventricular extrasystoles in young adults but aggravated those in obese middle-aged subjects. Whole-day work without sleep increased blood catecholamines and decreased HRV. These findings also suggest the usefulness of HRV as an index in health management. Tofisopam, enalapril and aprindine significantly improved HRV. These drug may be useful for maintaining normal autonomic nerve activity and preventing autonomic nerve diseases or sudden cardiac death in this stressful society.", 
    "35": "Left ventricular pressure overload results in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) which is considered an adaptive mechanism of the heart to normalize systolic wall-stress. Impairment of both contractility and relaxation occurs, implying that the hypertrophied myocardium is very sensitive to ischaemia, alterations in coronary haemodynamics and to mechanisms incompletely understood. Experimental data from papillary muscles and isolated coronary perfused hearts (renovascular hypertensive rats) demonstrated respectively: a decrease in velocity of shortening, an increase in isometric timing parameters, and an increase in developed pressure. In contrast, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure, normalized to developed pressure, was decreased for large balloon volumes, suggesting an impairment of systolic function at major loading in LVH. In humans, left ventricular systolic dysfunction occurs later (congestive heart failure) when ejection fraction is impaired. Increases in total minimal vascular coronary resistances observed both in humans and in animals could be related to structural and functional alterations in coronary microvessels. Studies of LVH regression under treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and beta-receptor blockers have confirmed that only drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system or the sympathetic nervous system are effective in maximizing the reversal of LVH.", 
    "36": "The unique efficacy of converting-enzyme inhibitors in inducing regression, or preventing the occurrence, of ventricular hypertrophy associated with systemic hypertension has for many years pointed to a possible direct effect of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Over the last 10 years evidence has been forthcoming about direct trophic effects of angiotensin II in several experimental systems, and we now have conclusive evidence for the existence of a local, intracardiac renin-angiotensin system. This system is capable of local synthesis of all components of the renin-angiotensin system, and has been demonstrated to be capable to cleave, via the classic pathway, angiotensin peptides from the precursor, angiotensinogen. Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of regulatory response and modulation of activity of the local system in response to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, and differential regulation of expression of specific components under pathological conditions. There is, thus, fairly solid evidence for participation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. Whether this participation is causative in character, or only a secondary event, and what precisely are the stimuli that modulate the activity of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system, are questions that are still poorly understood, but being actively researched.", 
    "37": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), as detected by electrocardiography or echocardiography, constitutes a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Antihypertensive drugs that modulate the sympathetic or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems or the intracellular free Ca concentration (i.e. beta-blockers, postsynaptic alpha 1-blockers, centrally acting adrenergic drugs, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors) can prevent or cause regression of LV mass after short-term therapy, this effect being more pronounced with ACE inhibitors. Diuretics and arterial vasodilators also cause regression of LVH provided that they are used for long enough to effect long-term control of arterial pressure. However, clinical studies also indicate that despite their equipotent blood-pressure lowering effects, there are marked differences not only in the ability of the different types of antihypertensive drugs to prevent or reverse LV mass but also within the same class of pharmacological drugs. Decreased LV mass in hypertensive patients may be associated with an improvement in diastolic function and has not been found to produce adverse effects on LV systolic performance.", 
    "38": "The case reported here illustrates the life-threatening aspects of angioedema and the need to thoroughly investigate the possible causes of this clinical finding. As discussed, the causes of angioedema are numerous. Commonly implicated in drug-induced angioedema are antihypertensive ACE inhibitor drugs, as was originally thought with this patient. Because of her skin lesions and macrocytic anemia, further studies were done. These studies led to a diagnosis of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome, an uncommon to rare form of acquired angioedema, urticarial vasculitis, arthritis, and obstructive airway disease associated with the production of autoantibodies to C1q. It is an autoimmune disorder related to but separate from SLE.", 
    "39": "The aim of this review is to compare the prevalence of complications and response to different treatment for hypertension in African and European Americans. African Americans when compared to European Americans respond less favorably to beta-blockers (BB's) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI's). Nevertheless the observed response of African Americans to ACEI's and BB's is significant and these agents are very effective in this subgroup. African American race is not a clinically significant predictor of poor response to any class of antihypertensive therapy and there is little justification to use racial profiling as a criterion for choice of medication. Evidence to restrict or defer usage of BB's and ACEI's in African Americans is lacking. The mortality from hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and the incidence of hypertensive renal disease is higher in African Americans which leads some investigators to postulate that hypertension in African Americans is intrinsically different from whites. They therefore search for a separate etiology and suggest specific approaches to treatment. Awareness of racial differences in hypertension outcomes evolved in the U.S. in an historical context that does not fully appreciate that race is often a surrogate for many social and economic factors that influence health status and health care delivery in the U.S. Poor outcomes in African Americans occur in many diseases including hypertension.", 
    "40": "The Syst-Eur trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that examines the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can prevent or delay cardiovascular complications in elderly patients (> 60 years) with isolated systolic hypertension. On March, 1st 1993 a total of 1395 patients with a sitting systolic blood pressure on placebo averaging 160-219 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg were randomised into this trial. The placebo and active treatment groups were similar at randomisation with respect to age (72 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD), percentage of women (68%), percentage of patients with cardiovascular complications (30%) and sitting blood pressures (175 +/- 12/85 +/- 6 mmHg). The fall in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline to 2 years was significantly more pronounced (p < 0.001) in the actively treated (-22 +/- 18/-6 +/- 9 mmHg) as compared with the placebo treated Syst-Eur patients (-10 +/- 20/-1 +/- 9 mmHg). Active treatment consists of nitrendipine if necessary associated with a converting-enzyme inhibitor and a thiazide. Whether treatment with these antihypertensive agents results in a clinically meaningful reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is the subject of investigation in this trial.", 
    "41": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are nowadays widely employed for the treatment of arterial hypertension. They exhibit comparable levels of efficacy and better tolerability when compared with the other antihypertensive agents. In mild arterial hypertension they have been shown to be more efficacious than nonpharmacological therapy that is recommended as the first-step therapeutic approach for most cases of this type of hypertension. Potential advantages for the control of associated metabolic risk factors and specific renal and cardiac effects make these drugs suitable for the first step pharmacological therapy on mild hypertension.", 
    "42": "Acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with the parenterally active angiotensin II antagonist saralasin has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure in a large fraction of patients with essential hypertension and to improve hemodynamics in some patients with congestive heart failure. It is now possible to antagonize chronically angiotensin II at its receptor using the non-peptide angiotensin II inhibitor losartan (DuP 753, MK 954). When administered by mouth, this compound induces a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II. This effect is closely related to circulating levels of the active metabolite E3174. Preliminary studies performed in hypertensive patients suggest that losartan has a blood pressure lowering action equivalent to that of an ACE inhibitor. Whether this compound will compare favorably with ACE inhibitors requires however further investigation.", 
    "43": "A variety of lifestyle modification and drug therapies can be used to treat hypertension. Hypertension awareness, as well as drug treatment, and control rates have improved progressively in the United States during the last three decades. The extent to which lifestyle modification interventions are being utilized to treat hypertension is uncertain. There has been a progressive shift from antihypertensive drug therapy with diuretics and beta blockers toward treatment with newer and more expensive agents such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The newer agents are well tolerated and effective in lowering blood pressure but their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease complications is less well documented. In order to reduce the burden of blood pressure-related cardiovascular disease in the general population, treatment of hypertension must be complemented by a parallel strategy to prevent hypertension.", 
    "44": "In non obese, nondiabetic patients, essential hypertension is associated with an insulin resistance that is peripheral in location and metabolically selective. The correlations between hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and blood pressure values do not prove that the relationship is a causal one. Different data support this hypothesis, however, the demonstration in humans that insulin resistance play a central role in the development of essential hypertension and coronary heart disease is still lacking. The relative current failure of coronary heart disease prevention in hypertensive patients may be related to the metabolic side effects of diuretics and beta-blockers. These drugs increase insulin resistance and lipid disorders. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists do not decrease insulin sensitivity neither alter lipid profile. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists have significantly improve compliance to pharmacological therapy, however their use has been associated with a dramatic cost increase and we do not yet know if they would reduce morbidity and mortality as well as or better than older and cheaper antihypertensive agents. Nonpharmacological interventions are usually very effective to reduce insulin resistance and the different cardiovascular risk factors present in most hypertensive patients. To improve patient's compliance to diet and regular exercise we have to develop new strategies.", 
    "45": "The effect of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system was evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats with reduced renal mass produced by right nephrectomy and infarction of two-thirds of the left kidney. Separate groups of rats were then administered the angiotensin receptor antagonists, A-81988 or losartan (DuP 753), the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, or vehicle (tap water) in their drinking water for 4 weeks. Tail cuff blood pressures and blood samples were obtained weekly. Excretory function during week 4 was evaluated using metabolic cages. Rats with reduced renal mass were characterized by a significant elevation in systolic blood pressure and urinary protein excretion along with a reduced urine osmolality. At 1 mg/kg/day, A-81988 prevented the hypertension and the development of proteinuria. A-81988 administration also improved urinary concentrating ability because urine osmolality was significantly higher in this group compared to untreated controls. The same dose of losartan or enalapril was ineffective at controlling the development of the hypertension, indicating that A-81988 is more potent in vivo. Despite the maintenance of systemic hypertension, losartan significantly blunted the proteinuria compared to vehicle-treated controls. At a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, losartan and enalapril also prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure and proteinuria and produced an increase in urine osmolality. These data support the hypothesis that angiotensin receptor antagonists have beneficial effects in forms of renal failure associated with proteinuria and diminished concentrating ability.", 
    "46": "Five patients developed hypertension after undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Three of four patients in whom serum renin was assayed had significant elevation, suggesting a possible renal-mediated etiology. Two patients required the addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to control hypertension while continuing the prolonged orthopaedic procedures. The need for careful blood-pressure monitoring of children undergoing orthopaedic surgery is emphasized in this article.", 
    "47": "The effects of repeated administration of quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) on the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and survival rate were examined, and compared with those of enalapril (10 mg/kg) in salt-sensitive Dahl (Dahl S) rats and 1% saline-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The Dahl S rats were treated with the drugs at 10 to 20 weeks of age and the SHRSP, at 8-19 weeks of age. (1) In the Dahl S rats, salt loading rapidly raised systolic blood pressure, which was around 220 mmHg at 10 weeks of age. Both quinapril and enalapril significantly prevented the development of hypertension (below 160 mmHg) and cardiac hypertrophy. Age-associated histopathological alterations in the kidney and mesenteric artery in Dahl S rats were suppressed by the drug treatment. (2) Salt-loaded SHRSP rapidly developed severe hypertension (270 mmHg at 12 weeks of age) accompanied with stroke signs, and 19 animals out of 20 died by the end of the experiment. Both quinapril and enalapril significantly inhibited the age-associated development of hypertension and markedly improved the survival rate (only two animals out of 16 died in both groups). These results suggest that quinapril has protective actions against age-associated development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, and as a result, it prolongs the life span.", 
    "48": "This is a descriptive report of the management techniques used effectively in the emergency department (ED) treatment of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in renal dialysis patients. Study design included a prospective case series of consecutive renal dialysis patients who presented to the ED of a regional dialysis center in acute CHF. Clinical presentation, ED management, and outcome were recorded. Forty-six patients (38 hemodialysis and 8 peritoneal dialysis) were included in this study. Presentation classifications for these patients were minimal distress (13 patients), moderate distress (16 patients), and severe distress (17 patients). In addition to supplemental oxygen, treatment focused on pharmacological preload and afterload reduction. Patients received sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) (30 patients), transdermal NTG (36 patients), captopril sublingual (10 patients) nifedipine oral (nine patients), nitroprusside (four patients), morphine sulfate (one patient), NTG infusion (one patient), and clonidine (one patient). There were no deaths in the study group, and 32 of the patients were able to be dialyzed and discharged, including seven patients in the severe group. Six patients required intubation, one of whom was extubated and discharged from the ED after dialysis. Intravascular access was obtained in 29 patients but was used in only six. All patients on nitroprusside drips were weaned during the course of their dialysis. Effective ED management of acute CHF in renal dialysis patients can be accomplished through preload reduction with nitrates and afterload reduction with captopril, nifedipine, and, in severe cases, nitroprusside.", 
    "49": "The renin-angiotensin system has long been known as a potent determinant of cardiovascular homeostasis and a powerful regulator of vascular hemodynamics. Over the last twenty years, it has become clear that components of the renin-angiotensin system are present in and, in many instances, synthesized in local tissues. The role of some of these local renin systems is now becoming clear, but the role, if any, of local production of angiotensin II in the heart and vasculature remains unknown. Recent evidence indicates that angiotensin II can serve as a growth factor for a variety of cell types including those in the cardiovascular system, and it thus appears possible that systemically or locally produced angiotensin II could subserve important functions in the determination of heart and vasculature structure. Clinical studies tend to corroborate this possibility. The potent effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, the demonstration that the administration of these agents following myocardial infarction reduces detrimental cardiac remodeling, and the finding that converting enzyme inhibition prolongs survival in congestive heart failure patients all point to an important role of angiotensin II on cardiovascular function and raise the distinct possibility that angiotensin II growth effects are involved in these beneficial responses. Additionally, recent data demonstrate conclusively that under certain circumstances and in certain cell types locally produced angiotensin II can serve as an autocrine growth regulatory factor, further adding support to the idea that local renin systems may play an important role in the determination of cardiovascular structure.", 
    "50": "Several important questions remain to be answered by future research. First, it is unclear whether any abnormal index of diastolic function can be used to estimate disease severity, or to prognostically identify patients who will subsequently develop systolic abnormalities or frank left ventricular dysfunction. A temporal relationship between the appearance of diastolic dysfunction and ultimate left ventricular decompensation may, theoretically, exist, but such a relationship has yet to be established. Second, a growing body of evidence indicates that pharmacologic therapy with Ca2+ channel antagonists, beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may acutely or chronically benefit certain patients with diastolic dysfunction. Whether the impact of early recognition and therapeutic intervention in patients with diastolic dysfunction can be translated into an improvement of quality of life or enhanced survival remains unknown. Third, recent evidence indicates that fundamental changes in the biochemistry of the cardiac myocyte may represent a final common pathway for the development of congestive heart failure resulting from intrinsic cardiac disease. Altered expression of genes coding for the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps in the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulatory proteins such as phospholamban, and the proteins composing the contractile apparatus have been identified that play critical roles in the pathophysiology of myocardial failure, and have important implications for potential pharmacologic therapy. Future research will more clearly elucidate these cellular and biochemical mechanisms of left ventricular failure. Lastly, although intravenous and inhalational anesthetics produce derangements in normal diastolic function to varying degrees, whether the effects of these agents on diastolic performance are exacerbated in disease processes manifested by abnormal diastolic mechanisms requires further evaluation.", 
    "51": "Intravenous injections of endotoxins from Escherichia coli or Salmonella minnesota stimulate drinking and reduce urinary excretion of water and solutes in rats. E. coli endotoxin (0.15 or 0.45 mg/kg i.v.) stimulated drinking without increasing plasma osmolality or sodium concentration, hematocrit, blood hemoglobin, or plasma protein concentration and without decreasing arterial pressure. Similarly, a dipsogenic dose of S. minnesota endotoxin (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) did not reduce arterial or venous pressures or change heart rate. Blocking the renin-angiotensin system with captopril or blocking histamine receptors with pyrilamine and cimetidine did not reduce drinking or urinary fluid retention caused by E. coli endotoxin. Injections of 10 or 450 ng E. coli endotoxin into a lateral cerebral ventricle increased body temperature but not water intake. In contrast to its stimulatory effect in water-replete rats, E. coli endotoxin (0.45 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited drinking in 24-h water-deprived rats. Thus we find no evidence to support the hypothesis that endotoxin causes thirst by changing known physiological signals of cellular or extracellular dehydration. The mechanism remains unknown.", 
    "52": "Besides cardiac volume overload, cardiac sympathetic activity and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are activated by arterial vasodilators such as minoxidil. To evaluate the possible involvement of the RAS in the development of minoxidil-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we assessed in normotensive rats minoxidil-induced changes in cardiac and plasma renin activity (PRA) and the potential of chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan to prevent minoxidil-induced cardiac hypertrophy. PRA increased in parallel with the increase in cardiac filling pressures and development of cardiac hypertrophy, whereas the increase in cardiac renin activity was delayed as compared with these changes. Losartan did not decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) but prevented the remodeling of the heart by minoxidil. In contrast, enalapril nearly normalized LVEDP but did not affect the hypertrophic response of the heart. The losartan data indicate that the RAS is involved in the minoxidil-induced cardiac hypertrophy either directly (e.g., by mediating the hypertrophic response of the heart to cardiac volume overload) or indirectly (e.g., by potentiating cardiac sympathetic activity). The ineffectiveness of enalapril has no obvious explanation but may possibly indicate ineffective blockade of angiotensin II formation in the heart in this model.", 
    "53": "The associations between insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension are well recognized. The insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia associated with hypertension is the result of increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and increased arterial wall smooth muscle reactivity. In insulin resistant states, intracellular calcium and sodium accumulation is thought to be the fundamental underlying abnormality. These is evidence that hyperinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. Therefore, therapeutic considerations in patients with insulin resistance should include nonpharmacologic methods for increasing insulin sensitivity as well as avoiding the deleterious effects on insulin action and lipid metabolism of various antihypertensive medications. Of the currently available antihypertensives therapies, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the alpha antagonists, and the calcium channel blockers are the most rational choices for treating patients with hypertension with evidence of coexisting insulin resistance.", 
    "54": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become commonly used medications for hypertension and congestive heart failure. These agents are noted for their low incidence of adverse effects; but in certain cases, these effects can be life-threatening. Severe hyperkalemia is one of the potentially dangerous effects of the ACE inhibitors. While cases of life-threatening hyperkalemia associated with the use of ACE inhibitors have been described previously, in no instance was dialysis required. Herein, we report a case of acute hyperkalemia in a patient with congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency, the resolution of which required hemodialysis. The hyperkalemia in this case occurred without an increase in the patient's azotemia. In addition, the patient did not respond to attempts to effect the intracellular shift of potassium. This suggested that there may have been a defect in internal potassium homeostasis.", 
    "55": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the process of late regional remodeling and the changes in regional diastolic function at the base and apex of the left ventricle in patients with chronic systolic dysfunction.", 
    "56": "Remodeling has been suggested to play an important role in the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. However, the regional difference in the process of late remodeling and its relation to diastolic function remain unclear.", 
    "57": "In 32 patients with previous myocardial infarction and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35%, left ventricular hemodynamic and angiographic data were studied before and 1 year after randomization to conventional therapy with placebo (n = 12) or enalapril, 10 mg twice daily (n = 20). Left ventricular regional wall dynamics were analyzed in the basal and apical regions by the area method.", 
    "58": "In the placebo group, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic regional areas increased significantly over time at the base but were unchanged at the apex. At the base, the diastolic left ventricular pressure-regional area relation shifted rightward and the regional stiffness constant decreased (6.9 +/- 4.3 to 5.0 +/- 3.1 x 10(-3) mm-2, p < 0.05), indicating an increase in regional distensibility. At the apex, however, the diastolic pressure-regional area relation shifted upward slightly, and the regional stiffness constant increased from 11.5 +/- 4.4 to 14.4 +/- 5.6 x 10(-3) mm-2 (p = 0.08). The regional peak filling rate was maintained at the base but decreased at the apex (1,014 +/- 436 to 762 +/- 306 mm2/s, p < 0.05); further, the changes in regional peak filling rate during follow-up were inversely related to the changes in the regional stiffness constant (r = -0.78, p < 0.001) at the apex. In contrast, in the enalapril group, end-diastolic and end-systolic regional areas significantly decreased over time both at the base and at the apex. Diastolic pressure-regional area relations shifted leftward, but the regional stiffness constant and regional peak filling rate did not change significantly either at the base or at the apex.", 
    "59": "These findings suggest that in patients with severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction, there was a regional difference in the process of late remodeling between the base and apex of the left ventricle, which was associated with nonuniform changes in regional diastolic function in the placebo group. The data also suggest that the nonuniform progression of regional remodeling and diastolic dysfunction was prevented by long-term enalapril treatment.", 
    "60": "In the present experiments the effect of long-term peripheral ischemia on the capillary of two hind limb skeletal muscles was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Furthermore, the effect of antihypertensive therapy on changes in capillarity and on the previously observed hyperreactivity of the ischemic vascular bed to vasoconstrictors was investigated in perfused hind limbs of rats after long-term treatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors captopril (0.5 mg/kg.h) or zabiciprilate (0.025 mg/kg.h), the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan (0.625 mg/kg.h), or the calcium antagonist felodipine (0.042 or 0.42 mg/kg.h). Skeletal muscle ischemia in the left hind limb was induced by partial ligation of the left common iliac artery. Long-term (4 weeks) ischemia increased significantly the capillary-to-fiber ratio in the soleus muscle, composed predominantly of type I fibers in spontaneously hypertensive rats, of the ischemic hind limb, whereas capillarity in the contralateral muscle was not affected. Furthermore, capillarity in the gastrocnemius muscle (type II muscle fiber part) of both the ischemic and contralateral hind limb did not change. Long-term treatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors during ischemia abolished the increase in the capillary-to-fiber ratio in the soleus muscle, whereas a comparable antihypertensive dose of felodipine had no effect. Greater blood pressure reductions by both losartan and felodipine prevented increases in capillarization in skeletal muscle ischemia. With respect to vascular hyperreactivity during ischemia, only treatment with losartan normalized reactivity of the ischemic vascular bed to vasoconstrictors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Norepinephrine stores in electrically driven guinea pig isolated atria were loaded with [3H]norepinephrine, and norepinephrine release was deduced from the radioactivity efflux. Electrical field stimulation of sympathetic nerve endings was applied during the refractory period of atrial contractions. The stimulation-induced release of norepinephrine was increased by angiotensin II (Ang II) (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L) in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum observed effect was a 55% augmentation. The effects of 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/L Ang II were abolished by 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/L of the subtype 1 Ang II receptor antagonist losartan, respectively. Losartan by itself (10(-6) mol/L) caused a 14% reduction of norepinephrine release. The subtype 2 Ang II receptor ligand PD 123319 (1-[[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)- 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid ditrifluoroacetate) in a concentration of 10(-4) mol/L had no detectable influence on transmitter release and did not antagonize the effect of Ang II. Angiotensin I (10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/L) increased norepinephrine release maximally by 23%. This effect was antagonized by 10(-5) mol/L losartan and did not appear in the presence of 10(-6) mol/L of the converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat. These results suggest that Ang II increases norepinephrine release by an activation of subtype 1 receptors, whereas angiotensin I is converted to Ang II to become effective.", 
    "62": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of prostaglandin I2 on several cardiovascular parameters and to compare the ability of prostaglandin I2 to modify angiotensin II-induced changes in these cardiovascular parameters in spontaneously hypertensive versus normotensive rats. Studies were conducted in adult, age-matched, indomethacin-, and captopril-pretreated spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats that had been prepared for assessment of arterial blood pressure, cardiac output (thermodilution), and renal and mesenteric blood flows (transit-time flow probes). In both normotensive and hypertensive rats, intravenous infusions of prostaglandin I2 (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg per minute) dose-dependently reduced mean arterial blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and mesenteric vascular resistance but not renal vascular resistance. Only minor differences were detected between normotensive versus hypertensive rats with regard to the effects of prostaglandin I2 on baseline cardiovascular parameters (ie, in the absence of angiotensin II). In both rat strains, an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (300 ng/kg per minute) increased mean arterial blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and renal and mesenteric vascular resistances, and these effects of angiotensin II were similar in the two strains in the absence of prostaglandin I2. In both strains, prostaglandin I2 inhibited angiotensin II-induced changes in mean arterial blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and renal and mesenteric vascular resistances. However, in the renal, but not mesenteric, vasculature of hypertensive rats, the ability of prostaglandin I2 to attenuate angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction was strikingly reduced. These results indicate that although in general spontaneously hypertensive rats respond normally to prostaglandin I2, in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats the ability of prostaglandin I2 to attenuate angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction is reduced. This selective renal defect may relate to the pathogenesis of high blood pressure in this genetic model of hypertension.", 
    "63": "We investigated functional changes in aortic preparations of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated in utero and subsequently up to 20 weeks of age with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ramipril (0.01 and 1 mg/kg per day) and perindopril (0.01 mg/kg per day). Early-onset treatment with the high dose of ramipril inhibited aortic ACE activity, prevented the development of hypertension, increased aortic vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L), decreased vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (10(-8) mol/L), and increased aortic cyclic GMP content by 160%. Low-dose ramipril inhibited aortic ACE activity and attenuated the aortic vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine but had no effect on blood pressure. Low-dose treatment with ramipril and perindopril resulted in a significant increase in aortic cyclic GMP content by 98% and 77%, respectively. Long-term coadministration of the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 abolished the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in aortic cyclic GMP. Our data demonstrate that long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors can alter vascular function of compliance vessels independently of the antihypertensive action. The increase in aortic cyclic GMP was due to bradykinin potentiating the action of the ACE inhibitors.", 
    "64": "Management of congestive heart failure in the past has focused on sodium and fluid restriction, rest, and digitalis glycosides. Now, significant new evidence justifies early and aggressive ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic LV dysfunction. ACE inhibitors reduce the likelihood of symptomatic heart failure in asymptomatic patients with reduced ejection fraction. Patients with reduced LV function following acute MI who receive ACE inhibitors have a decreased risk of death, a lower probability of developing systematic heart failure, and fewer MI recurrences. Hypotension and azotemia can be avoided by reducing the concomitant dose of diuretics and carefully titrating the ACE inhibitor dosage to target levels.", 
    "65": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been proposed to have a prostaglandin-dependent component to their hypotensive action. The aim of this study was to assess whether the structurally dissimilar angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril stimulate the synthesis of prostacyclin, whether their hypotensive action is blunted by indomethacin, and whether these biochemical or physiologic parameters differ for the two drugs, in white subjects with essential hypertension. Twelve patients were enrolled and 11 finished the study. The study consisted of a double blind, randomized, double-crossover design. All patients received either placebo or 50 mg indomethacin twice a day for 3 weeks; after 1 week of placebo or indomethacin either 50 mg captopril or 10 mg enalapril twice a day was added and continued for 2 weeks. Each patient received every possible combination. Neither captopril nor enalapril stimulated prostacyclin production as determined by measurement of the urinary excretion rate of its main enzymatic metabolite, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha. Although indomethacin reduced the urinary excretion of the enzymatic metabolite of prostacyclin by more than 50%, it did not influence the hypotensive effect of captopril or enalapril. We conclude that neither captopril nor enalapril have a significant prostacyclin-dependent component to their hypotensive action.",

    "67": "Twenty-five control rats (group 1) were observed without captopril administration after heterotopic cardiac transplantation, and the other 19 rats (group 2) were administered captopril (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) after heart transplantation. Graft survival 3 months after transplantation was significantly (P < .02) higher in group 2 (18 of 19, 95%) than that in group 1 (16 of 25, 64%). Cellular rejection grades of the heart allografts were significantly higher in group 1 than those in group 2 both at 3 months (grades, 2.5 +/- 0.4 vs 1.3 +/- 0.7; P < .01) and 6 months (grades, 2.4 +/- 0.9 vs 0.8 +/- 0.5; P < .05) after transplantation. The grades of graft CAD (vascular rejection) were also significantly higher in group 1 than those in group 2 both at 3 months (grades, 2.3 +/- 0.7 vs 0.9 +/- 0.9; P < .05) and 6 months (grades, 3.0 +/- 0.9 vs 0.9 +/- 0.3; P < .01) after transplantation.

In patients with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction, in whom there is less activation of the renin-angiotensin system, ventricular remodeling might be less rapid and the benefit of ACE inhibitors less discernible.", 
    "70": "One hundred eight patients enrolled in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Prevention Trial, with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35 but without clinical heart failure, underwent radionuclide ventriculograms, and 49 underwent left heart catheterizations. Measurements were made before and after double-blinded randomization to enalapril (2.5 to 20 mg/d) or placebo. Repeated-measures analysis of all time points showed significant differences for change in end-diastolic volume (EDV) between enalapril and placebo groups. Significant difference between the enalapril and placebo groups (P < .05) was present for change in EDV at 1 year within the catheterization study and at a mean of 25 months within the radionuclide study. Radionuclide EDV increased in placebo patients (119 +/- 28 to 124 +/- 33 mL/m2, mean +/- SD) and decreased in enalapril patients (120 +/- 25 to 113 +/- 25 mL/m2). Differences between the two groups were significantly less than previously described in patients with symptomatic heart failure (P < .02), with less increase in LV volumes in the placebo group and less decrease in volumes in the enalapril group.",

    "72": "Mitral annular calcium (MAC) is a condition that often occurs in patients with systemic hypertension. To evaluate the effectiveness of nifedipine in preventing MAC, 223 patients with systemic hypertension of recent onset and without MAC were selected and randomly enrolled in 3 groups: group 1 (76 patients) received nifedipine; group 2 (72 patients) received enalapril; and group 3 (75 patients) received atenolol. After 5 years, these treatments significantly reduced systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p < 0.05) blood pressure (BP) in 3 treated groups. M-mode echocardiography revealed MAC only in 2 patients in the nifedipine group (2.6%), in 13 in the enalapril group (18%) and in 15 in the atenolol group (20%). The degree of MAC was mild (< 5 mm) in the 2 patients in group 1, in 5 of the 13 in group 2, and in 6 of the 15 in the group 3, whereas it was severe (> 5 mm) in the remaining 8 in the enalapril group and in the other 9 in the atenolol group. There was also a significant correlation in the degree of MAC, left atrial enlargement and mitral regurgitation. In addition, atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular conduction defects were associated with severe MAC. These results indicate that nifedipine is an effective drug both in the long-term management of systemic hypertension and in preventing or delaying MAC.", 
    "73": "This trial investigated the effect of enalapril, administered early, on left ventricular (LV) volumes after myocardial infarction. Four hundred twenty-eight patients included in the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS II) were examined with echocardiography within 5 days, at 1 month and at 6 months after myocardial infarction. Enalaprilat (1 mg) or placebo infusion was initiated within 24 hours after infarction, followed by oral treatment to a target dose of 20 mg/day. A significant attenuation of LV dilatation was noted at 1 month in patients treated with enalapril compared with those receiving placebo. Changes in LV end-diastolic volume indexes during the first month were (mean +/- SEM) 5.7 +/- 1.0 ml/m2 for the placebo group and 1.9 +/- 0.8 ml/m2 for the enalapril group (p < 0.02). Changes in LV end-systolic volume indexes were 3.1 +/- 0.8 and 0.5 +/- 0.6 ml/m2, respectively (p < 0.02). The between-group difference was most marked in patients with anterior wall infarction (p < 0.005). Volume changes beyond the first month were similar in both groups but the differences observed at 1 month were maintained. The larger volumes in the placebo versus enalapril group were significant or borderline significant at 1 and 6 months. Thus, enalapril treatment initiated early after myocardial infarction and continued for 6 months can attenuate LV dilatation during the first month resulting in smaller LV volumes after 1 and 6 months.", 
    "74": "A study was designed to clarify the effects of captopril (CAP) or nitrendipine (NITR) on cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular expression of the laminin B2 or collagen (COL) gene in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Cardiac weight was significantly increased in 20-week-old SHRs. Gene expression of the alpha 1 chain of type IV COL determined by northern blot analysis decreased with age in Wistar-Kyoto rats and SHRs. Left ventricular laminin B2 mRNA was decreased at 12 weeks and increased again at 20 weeks in both strains. Daily oral administration of CAP (40 mg/kg, n = 5) or NITR (30 mg/kg, n = 4) to SHRs from 8 to 20 weeks decreased blood pressure to 142 mmHg (p < 0.01 vs 197 mmHg in controls, n = 5). Cardiac weight was 1.26 +/- 0.04 (SE) g in controls and was reduced to 1.03 +/- 0.05 g (p < 0.01) by CAP, but not by NITR (1.24 +/- 0.04). Left ventricular laminin B2 gene expression was attenuated by CAP and NITR to 41% and 32% of the control value, respectively. CAP significantly decreased left ventricular alpha 1 type IV COL mRNA to 11% of the control level, whereas NITR caused a reduction only to 75%. CAP also decreased alpha 1 or alpha 2 type I COL mRNA. These results suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent and/or cause regression of cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting the gene expression of extracellular matrix, and that angiotensin II may have a pivotal role in cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "75": "We evaluated the effect of enalapril on proteinuria in 20 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) and renal insufficiency. Patients were accepted into the study according to the following criteria: 1) a serum creatinine (s-Cr) level over 1.5 mg/dl or a creatinine clearance (Ccr) under 70 ml/min; and 2) urinary protein (UP) over 1.0 g/day, expect for the cases with uncontrollable hypertension. We measured total protein (TP), albumin, s-Cr, Ccr, UP, and Ht during the elanapril therapy. After enalapril therapy, UP slowly decreased, and TP and albumin levels increased. The levels of s-Cr and Ccr did not vary. None of the patients required discontinuation of enalapril therapy caused by side effects, such as anemia or hyperkalemia. In conclusion, enalapril has the effect of decreasing in proteinuria and increasing TP and albumin in patients with CGN and renal insufficiency irrespective of the original diseases.", 
    "76": "A new metallo-endopeptidase which hydrolyzes atrium natriuretic factor (ANF) has been isolated from human neuroblastoma NB-OK-1 cells. In the present study we show that this metallo-endopeptidase is also present in several other human neuroblastoma cell lines, which include CHP 100, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-BE(2), BE(2)-C and BE(2)M-17. Additionally, we show that this endopeptidase activity is reduced to about 20% of the control during retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation in the RA-sensitive SK-N-BE(2) cells, but not in the RA-resistant BE(2)-M17 cells. This suggests that the inhibition is related to neuronal differentiation and not to a direct effect of 5 microM RA on the enzyme activity. This new enzyme is clearly distinct from neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE,EC 3.4.15.1), since specific inhibitors for these endopeptidases (10 microM phosphoramidon and 1 mM captopril, respectively) had no effect on their activity. However, this enzyme was inhibited 100% by 10 mM o-phenanthroline showing an inhibitory spectrum similar to that of another novel metallo-endopeptidase recently isolated in our laboratory from Xenopus laevis skin secretion. Although the physiological function of this new enzyme in human neuroblastoma cells is not known at the present time, we suggest that it may participate in inactivation of neuropeptides such as atrium natriuretic factor (ANF), substance P, somatostatin-14 and bradykinin in vivo.", 
    "77": "N-[1(R,S)-Carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB) is a potent, substrate-related, specific inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.15, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of bioactive peptides including bradykinin, neurotensin, and proenkephalin, and prodynorphin-derived enkephalin precursors. The observation that this inhibitor causes a pronounced decrease in blood pressure after intravenous infusion into normotensive rats posed the question of the mechanism of this hypotensive response. It was suggested previously that cFP-AAF-pAB is an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and that this function can account for the hypotensive response to the inhibitor. We present here evidence that cFP-AAF-pAB has no intrinsic ACE-inhibitory activity. The previously observed inhibition is shown to be dependent on cleavage of the Ala-Phe bond in the inhibitor by endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase, EC 3.4.24.11), a contaminant of some ACE preparations.", 
    "78": "The two polymorphic modifications of fosinopril sodium have been characterized as to their differences in melting behaviour, powder X-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and solid-state 31P- and 13C-NMR spectra. The polymorphs were found to be enantiotropically related based upon melting point, heat of fusion, and solution mediated transformation data. Analysis of the solid-state FTIR and 13C-NMR data indicated that the environment of the acetal side chain of fosinopril sodium differed in two polymorphs, and that there might be cis-trans isomerization about the C6-N peptide bond. These conformational differences are postulated as the origin of the observed polymorphism.", 
    "79": "The role of ethanol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, were investigated for their effects upon angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (EC 3.4.15.1), since the enzyme plays a key role in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis by transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin II and degrading bradykinin. ACE was extracted from a 38,000 x g pellet of bovine lung homogenate with 0.05-M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer, pH 7.0/0.4 M NaCl/10 microM ZnCl2/0.5% Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme was preincubated with increasing concentrations of acetaldehyde (0.177-2.213 M) for 30 min at 0 degree C. Progressive inhibition of 41-84% was observed as enzyme aliquots were assayed with hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) as the substrate. The interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme with acetaldehyde was rapid under these conditions. Ethanol appeared to to have no effect upon enzymic activity at comparable concentrations. These results suggest that acetaldehyde-mediated ACE inhibition in vivo may play a contributory role in the development of vasodilation and facial flush reaction consequent to ethanol consumption, thereby accounting for localized hypotension.", 
    "80": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be limited by cough, for which the only consistently effective treatment is withdrawal of therapy. The effect of inhaled sodium cromoglycate (20 mg, 4 times daily) was examined in five patients who experienced cough following the introduction of an ACE inhibitor. In three patients inhaled cromoglycate suppressed the cough. Inhaled sodium cromoglycate may thus be of value in a proportion of patients with ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "81": "A total of 4676 patients and 1759 patients were treated with lisinopril and nifedipine respectively in a post-marketing surveillance study conducted in general practice in the UK. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Most of the lisinopril patients had hypertension, but a small number (180) had heart failure. Most of the nifedipine patients had uncomplicated hypertension, but some (22.57%) had other cardiovascular disease with or without hypertension. Lisinopril and nifedipine were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. During the study, 1.5% of hypertensive patients assigned to lisinopril died compared with 1.8% of patients assigned to nifedipine, and 15.1% of lisinopril patients compared with 19.7% of patients in the nifedipine group withdrew because of adverse events. Cough, malaise and fatigue, nausea and vomiting were more frequent causes of withdrawal from lisinopril than nifedipine. Conversely, headaches, pallor and flushing, oedema and palpitations caused more frequent withdrawals from nifedipine. Anaemia was more often encountered on nifedipine treatment than on lisinopril. In hypertensive patients, the frequency of first-dose hypotension was similar on both treatments. Serious events occurred in 0.8% and 0.5% of patients given lisinopril and nifedipine respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated by heart failure patients: 16 patients (8.88%) died and an incidence of 4.44% of serious adverse events was reported, a pattern to be anticipated in such patients; dizziness, giddiness, dyspnoea, cough, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent causes of withdrawal; the incidence of first-dose hypotension was low (2.22%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The method involves the use of lead nitrate as a titrant in aqueous medium with conductometric detection of the end point. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of the studied compounds and the results obtained were found to agree with those given using the official methods. The proposed method is simple, accurate and precise.", 
    "83": "The effect of early converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril on the extent of neurohumoral activation in acute myocardial infarction was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled double blind fashion. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor and noradrenaline on day 1, i.e. prior to randomization (n = 99), and on days 3 (n = 145) and 30 (n = 69) following myocardial infarction were determined. Enalapril did not significantly affect neurohumoral activation on day 3 (enalapril vs. placebo (mean (S.E.M.); atrial natriuretic factor: 35.3 (3.0) vs. 37.2 (2.9) pmol/l; noradrenaline: 2.82 (0.20) vs. 3.70 (1.02) nmol/l) or at 1 month (atrial natriuretic factor: 33.1 (3.0) vs. 32.4 (3.9) pmol/l; noradrenaline: 2.77 (0.25) vs. 2.82 (0.28) nmol/l). However, in myocardial infarction patients developing heart failure, a significant attenuation of the day 3 atrial natriuretic factor, but not of the noradrenaline response, was seen (atrial natriuretic factor: 47.0 (7.7) vs. 59.0 (6.4) pmol/l, P < 0.05; noradrenaline: 3.37 (0.42) vs. 6.59 (3.26) nmol/l, P = ns). In conclusion, enalapril did not significantly reduce neurohumoral activation in acute myocardial infarction, possibly because the activation in most patients is modest and confined to the early convalescent phase. However, in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure enalapril therapy was associated with a reduction in early plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels, compatible with decreased cardiac filling pressures.", 
    "84": "The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) prevents sudden cardiac death caused by lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias during acute ischemia. Hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used as a model of hypertensive LVH and those from Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were served as normotensive hearts. SHRs were divided into 3 groups, as follows: 1) SHRs with no treatment (SHR), 2) SHRs treated with captopril (SHR-C), 3) SHRs treated with hydralazine (SHR-H). The antihypertensive agents were given for 6 weeks, from 12 to 18 weeks of age. Experiments were performed at 18 weeks of age. Although blood pressure in SHR-C and SHR-H was equally lowered to normal level, only SHR-C showed regression of LVH. Lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced during 30 minutes after ligation of the left coronary artery were studied in the 4 groups (WKY, SHR, SHR-C and SHR-H). The incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (Vf) was significantly higher in SHR with LVH than in WKY. Treatment with captopril significantly reduced the incidence of VT/Vf although hydralazine failed to reduce the incidence. The electrophysiological study using conventional microelectrode techniques revealed that in SHR and SHR-H with LVH, action potential duration (APD) mas much more prolonged than in WKY while resting potential, action potential amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity of depolarization did not change significantly. The APDs in SHR and SHR-H with LVH shortened to a greater extent during simulated ischemia, while in SHR-C with regressed LVH APD shortened only a little similar to that in WKY. These results suggest that hypertrophied hearts have a greater susceptibility to lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias during acute ischemia because of greater APDs dispersion between the normal and ischemic zone. The reduction of electrical inhomogeneity in regressed hypertrophied hearts may prevent sudden cardiac death caused by lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "85": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known as a system which constricts vessels and enhances renal retention of sodium and water to raise the blood pressure. Recent studies have shown that the RAS is related to pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases: 1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been known to regress the cardiac hypertrophy, 2) high renin activity before treatment of hypertension has been reported to be one of the risk factors of myocardial infarction, 3) and there was a study that the gene expression of ACE was related to the susceptibility to myocardial infarction. Recently, in addition to the circulating RAS, the existence of the tissue RAS in various organs has been demonstrated. However, the existence of the tissue RAS in the human heart and its pathophysiological significance have not been fully investigated. To confirm the existence of the tissue RAS in the human heart, and clarify its pathophysiological role, we focused on the important elements of the system, renin and ACE, and studied the presence of renin and ACE mRNAs and their proteins in the human autopsied hearts. Samples were taken from the organs from 15 cases without heart disease. Renin mRNA was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In all of 15 cases, renin mRNA was detected in the right atrium, but not in the left ventricle. Renin protein was found both in the right atrium and the left ventricle by Western blot. In addition to renin, ACE mRNA was also detected both in the right atrium and left ventricle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "1. We examined the effect of spirapril, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the number of capsaicin-induced coughs in rats and compared with that of enalapril. 2. Chronic treatment with enalapril, at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o., significantly and dose-dependently enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. 3. Chronic treatment with higher dose of spirapril (3 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. However, lower dose (1 mg/kg, p.o.) of spirapril had no significant effect on the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. 4. These results suggest that cough induced activity, one of the most serious side effects associated with chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors, of spirapril is relatively lower than that of enalapril.", 
    "87": "The antihypertensive effects and tolerability of single daily doses of enalapril and extended-release nifedipine (nifedipine-ER) were compared in an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, 22-week treatment study involving 230 men and women (mean age, 55 years). Following a 3-week washout period, mean +/- SD blood pressure levels were 153 +/- 17/99 +/- 4 mmHg in the enalapril group (n = 117) and 157 +/- 17/100 +/- 5 mmHg in the nifedipine-ER group (n = 113). Beginning at 5 mg once daily for enalapril and 30 mg once daily for nifedipine-ER, the dosage was titrated every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, up to a maximum of 40 mg for enalapril and 120 mg for nifedipine-ER. The treatment goal (satisfactory response) was to lower trough sitting diastolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or by at least 10 mmHg to a level of < 100 mmHg. At a mean daily dose of 16 mg of enalapril and 57 mg of nifedipine-ER, more than three quarters of each treatment group achieved a satisfactory response. The mean reductions in trough sitting blood pressure levels at the end of 22 weeks of treatment were 15/11 mmHg for enalapril and 21/13 mmHg for nifedipine-ER. The difference between treatments was significant only for the change in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). However, enalapril was better tolerated than nifedipine-ER. The numbers of patients with adverse experiences and withdrawals from the study because of an adverse experience were significantly lower for enalapril than for nifedipine-ER (P < 0.05). The incidence of abnormal laboratory findings was small and considered of no clinical importance in either group. These data suggest that enalapril and nifedipine-ER had approximately equal efficacy as once-daily antihypertensive treatments, but enalapril was better tolerated.", 
    "88": "Thirty-nine patients with diabetes and hypertension were treated with indapamide for 24 weeks to study the effects of that drug on glucose and lipid metabolism. The drug was administered at a dose of 2 mg once per day in the morning as a single drug (26 patients) or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs (13 patients), including calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, an alpha-blocker, or a beta-blocker. Blood pressure was reduced in both groups during treatment, and no alteration of glycemic control or lipid metabolism was observed. One patient complained of a mild headache, but treatment was continued.

The study consisted of a 4-week placebo washout period, followed by 12 weeks of active treatment. Quinapril doses were titrated upward at 4-week intervals to three dosage levels. Patients who did not respond to 20-mg doses were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg quinapril daily or 20 mg quinapril plus 12.5 mg HCTZ daily until the end of the study. Quinapril was useful as monotherapy in 78% of the 256 patients (92.9% of patients who completed the study were evaluable): 73.3% of patients required only 10 mg, and their average blood pressure was similar to that of patients who required doses of greater than 10 mg. Only 12.2% of responsive patients required either 40 mg of quinapril or 20 mg of quinapril plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. Quinapril was equally effective and safe in elderly patients (> 60 years old) and in obese and nonobese patients. A low incidence of adverse effects in our patients confirms quinapril's safety, and no adverse changes were observed in laboratory tests.", 
    "90": "We assessed the therapeutic efficacy of a low-dose combination of metoprolol and captopril given orally to C3H/Hej mice that developed dilated and hypertrophied hearts after being inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were randomly assigned to one of six 8-week oral regimens: 1 mg/kg/day of metoprolol (group 1); 10 mg/kg/day of metoprolol (group 2); 1.2 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 3); 12 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 4); 1 mg/kg/day of metoprolol plus 1.2 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 5); or distilled water (control group). Group 4 exhibited a significantly lower survival rate and body weight than the control group (p < 0.01). Survival rates and body weights were similar in groups 1, 2, 3, 5, and the control group. Low-dose metoprolol plus captopril is superior to low-dose metoprolol, high-dose metoprolol, and low-dose captopril with regard to heart weight and the heart weight/body weight ratio. The left and right ventricular cavity dimensions as well as myocardial necrosis, calcification, and fibrosis were less severe in groups 4 and 5 than in the control group. The left ventricular free wall showed significantly more thinning in group 4 than in the control group (p < 0.01). Our results show that the administration of low-doses of metoprolol and captopril given in combination was effective in this animal model of congestive heart failure and was associated with a reduction in biventricular cavity dimensions and myocardial necrosis.", 
    "91": "We have evaluated the effect of enalapril in the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty by a randomized trial conducted on 95 patients. The treatment group (n = 46) received enalapril 10 mg/day besides aspirin with calcium blockers, beginning 24 hours before coronary angioplasty. The conventional medical treatment group (n = 49) received only aspirin and calcium blockers. Enrollment required the presence of angina pectoris and successful dilatation of all significant coronary narrowings. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Restenosis was identified by symptoms and exercise testing and confirmed by angiography. The incidence of angiographic restenosis was 34% in the enalapril group and 31% in the conventional treatment group. Long term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril in a dose of 10 mg per day does not prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty.", 
    "92": "Anti-arrhythmic effects of captopril (Cap) were studied in the anesthetized pigs using a reversible balloon catheter. Results showed that Cap did not exert any influence on the weight percentage of ischemic area to the whole left ventricle, on the levels of serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isozyme (CK-MB), nor on the incidence and duration of transient and persistent tachycardia, but reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (2/12, 1/12 in high-dose group pigs treated with Cap 6 mg.kg-1 in the first 10 min, 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 in the later 90 min and 12/21, 11/21 in control group treated with normal saline through the occlusion and reperfusion periods, respectively, P < 0.05). It was suggested that Cap did not exhibit direct (or non-specific, if any) effects on anti-arrhythmias.", 
    "93": "Many tests are available for the evaluation of renovascular hypertension; each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a screening test. The nonimaging tests include measurement of peripheral plasma renin activity, the captopril test, and renal vein renin sampling, all of which have inherent limitations. Screening tests also are available that provide more information as anatomic or physiologic images. Among the anatomic imaging methods, intravenous urography is the least accurate screening test, although it may provide other useful information. Magnetic resonance angiography may prove to be useful, although its use is limited by its high cost. The gold standard at present for diagnosing renal artery stenosis is contrast angiography, and improvements have been made using digital subtraction technology. However, its invasive nature and high cost do not warrant its routine use as a screening test in the evaluation of renovascular hypertension. Doppler sonography is a physiologic imaging test, and although it is limited because of its operator-dependent nature, it is most useful in the evaluation of patients with renal transplants. Captopril renal scintigraphy is another physiologic imaging test, and it has proven to be an excellent initial screening test that provides both diagnostic and prognostic information.", 
    "94": "We examined the antihypertensive response to enalapril and its relation to the changes of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (RAA) in essential hypertensive patients. The responders, whose blood pressure reduced after enalapril administration, had significant elevation of plasma renin activity after enalapril (7.5 +/- 4.0 to 31.9 +/- 10 ng/mL/h, p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the plasma renin activity of the nonresponders (3.0 +/- 1.0 to 5.6 +/- 1.9 ng/mL/h). Natriuretic response to acute salt loading was compared between the two subgroups. The natriuresis on acute salt loading of nonresponders was better than that of the responders (82.9 +/- 13.2 vs 44.5 +/- 5.7 mmol/4h, p < 0.05). These results imply that the RAA and extracellular fluid volume both contribute in different ways to the maintenance of high blood pressure in different subgroups of essential hypertension.", 
    "95": "The relationship between renin responsiveness to furosemide and the antihypertensive effect of captopril in patients with normal-renin essential hypertension were studied in 23 patients including nine men (mean age, 41 years) and 14 women (mean age, 40 years). Those who had an increment of more than 50% in plasma renin activity (PRA) two hours after an intravenous injection of 20 mg furosemide were classified as group A (n = 13) and the others were classified as group B (n = 10). Baseline PRA, plasma aldosterone and mean blood pressure (MBP) were not different between the two groups. Both groups showed no significant difference in natriuresis following furosemide administration. Significant change in MBP was observed after an oral dose of 100 mg captopril within four hours in group A, but not in group B. These data suggest that renin responsiveness to a single intravenous dose of furosemide can be a useful test for predicting the therapeutic response to captopril in patients with normal-renin essential hypertension. The furosemide test had a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 64%, a positive predictive value of 69% and a negative predictive value of 70%.", 
    "96": "The effects of four angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril, quinapril and alacepril, on the cough responses caused by citric acid and capsaicin inhalation were studied in normal and bronchitic guinea-pigs. After an oral dose of 10 mg kg-1, none of the ACE inhibitors had an effect on the citric acid-induced coughing response in normal guinea-pigs. Enalapril 10 mg kg-1 significantly increased the number of coughs caused by capsaicin inhalation. In bronchitic guinea-pigs, 10 mg kg-1 captopril and enalapril significantly increased the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. When administered daily for 8 days, captopril was the only ACE inhibitor which significantly increased the number of coughs due to citric acid inhalation. The present results indicate that the ACE inhibitors had different modes of cough augmentation.", 
    "97": "A 41,000 M(r) cytosolic protein (p41) in Dictyostelium discoideum was shown to be modified by ADP-ribosylation that was not regulated by nitric oxide (NO). This endogenous ADP-ribosylation was optimal at conditions distinct from those optimal for the NO-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of p41. These two activities were also differentially sensitive to reducing agents and modified different amino acids. The addition of haemoglobin, which sequesters NO, and of NO synthase inhibitors failed to block the endogenous ADP-ribosylation. P41 was purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was shown to be highly homologous to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Both endogenous and NO-stimulated activities ADP-ribosylated three isoforms of the protein, with pI values of 6.6, 6.8 and 7.0. In each case, the isoform with pI 6.8 was preferentially modified. Experiments using purified GAPDH indicate that both the endogenous and NO-stimulated ADP-ribosylation are self-catalysed modifications.", 
    "98": "To investigate the involvement of the sympathoinhibitory effect of imidapril and enalapril in their antihypertensive effect at a clinically reasonable dose, we studied whether some responses induced by the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) were affected by intravenous administration of imidaprilat and enalaprilat in curarized pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats. Imidaprilat and enalaprilat (both at 100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), which are active metabolites of imidapril and enalapril, respectively, suppressed the pressor responses to electrical stimulation (ES) of the spinal cord (T1-L7) and exogenous noradrenaline (NA). The pressor responses to NA were significantly suppressed after either alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors were blocked. Furthermore, imidaprilat (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) suppressed these reduced responses. When the reduced basal blood pressure was restored by vasopressin infusion, imidaprilat and enalaprilat (both at 100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) did not suppress the responses to ES and exogenous alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. They affected neither basal plasma concentrations of NA and adrenaline nor ES-induced increase of these catecholamines. These results suggest that the suppressive effects of imidaprilat and enalaprilat on the pressor responses to ES and alpha-adrenoceptors agonists are apparently observed in pithed SHR because of a reduction of vascular tone and that imidapril and enalapril do not lower the blood pressure through suppressing SNS.", 
    "99": "Ibopamine is an orally administered dopamine agonist which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite epinine by esterase hydrolysis. Ibopamine acts predominantly as a vasodilator and inhibitor of neuroendocrine activation in congestive heart failure, but also has mild positive inotropic effects at higher doses. The beneficial effects on cardiac and systemic haemodynamic parameters seen in short term studies have been maintained in predominantly noncomparative trials for up to 1 year, and improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and clinical symptoms have been observed in patients with congestive heart failure of varying severity. In double-blind studies conducted in small numbers of patients, the efficacy of ibopamine was comparable to that of digoxin, captopril, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Ibopamine can successfully replace treatment with intravenous dopamine in patients with severe heart failure, and is effective and well tolerated when administered in combination with digoxin, diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Ibopamine has shown no detrimental effects on renal function, few adverse effects on neurohormonal parameters and has demonstrated no significant proarrhythmic properties at therapeutic doses in patients with congestive heart failure. No adverse metabolic effects were observed during ibopamine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus, nor did ibopamine have detrimental effects in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While reliable evidence is required concerning effects on mortality before the role of ibopamine can be clearly defined, the drug appears to be a useful agent for combination with conventional therapies in treating patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "100": "The coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension often requires concomitant drug treatments. Thus, it is interesting to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new lipid-lowering agent fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive/cardiovascular drug treatments. A retrospective analysis was based on data from controlled clinical trials in which 1815 patients were treated with fluvastatin and 783 patients received placebo. The daily dose of fluvastatin was > or = 20 mg. At least one of the following drug treatments was taken by 445 of the fluvastatin-treated patients (24.5%) and 181 of those receiving placebo (23.1%): beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers (fluvastatin: n = 182; placebo: n = 84); diuretics (fluvastatin: n = 168; placebo: n = 72); calcium antagonists (fluvastatin: n = 161; placebo: n = 69); and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (fluvastatin: n = 101; placebo: n = 30). The majority of patients received monotherapy with one of the above-mentioned antihypertensive agents (fluvastatin: 69%; placebo: 65%). The efficacy of fluvastatin in modifying low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels was not consistently different in patients taking a given antihypertensive compared with the overall group and the patients not taking the antihypertensive agent. In patients taking fluvastatin and antihypertensives, confirmed (measured at two consecutive occasions) increases more than three times the upper limit of normal in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) occurred in only two patients. One case involved the concomitant use of a beta-blocker (ASAT and ALAT) and the other a diuretic (ALAT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "101": "Therapy after acute myocardial infarction offers the prospect of increased survival in carefully selected patients. Current recommendations favor the use of beta blockers and antiplatelet agents, but some positive effects have been seen with use of anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Further studies are needed to evaluate these drug classes in reinfarction prophylaxis and to define differences among the agents in each class.", 
    "102": "Thirty-five patients with mild hypertension (WHO Class I) participated in a double-blind cross-over study involving two 8-week periods of treatment with cilazapril 2.5-5 mg once daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg once daily, in each case preceded by a 4-week placebo period. Thirty-two patients completed the study, the aim of which was to compare the effects of the drugs on serum electrolyte levels, left ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias, as assessed by echocardiography and 48-h Holter monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.01) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures (comparisons with placebo periods). Cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide had opposite effects on ventricular ectopic activity. The beneficial effect of cilazapril on ventricular extrasystole counts correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with the reduction of left ventricular mass index. Hydrochlorothiazide had no effects on left ventricular mass or diastolic function. Serum potassium values were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by hydrochlorothiazide but there was no correlation between changes in potassium levels and changes in ventricular ectopic activity. The results of the study suggest that hydrochlorothiazide and cilazapril were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, but only cilazapril reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and suppressed ventricular ectopic activity.", 
    "103": "In severe heart failure with peripheral and enterohepatic congestion resistance to diuretics with inactivation of oral furosemide is a common finding. Impaired bioavailability is most likely related to pharmacodynamic and especially to pharmacokinetic reasons. To ensure efficient drug delivery and effective treatment with diuretics, venous access devices (port-systems) were implanted in 10 patients (eight men and two women, age between 57 and 80 years). All patients were in heart failure functional class III-IV and had a history of recurrent episodes of severe decompensation; none was suitable for heart transplantation. Injections of furosemide and other drugs were performed 1-4 times a day; one female patient performed the intravenous injections herself, in three cases the partners and in six cases the practitioner or an outpatient nurse performed the injections. All patients were treated on an outpatient basis, i.e., at home or in nursing homes. The port-implantation was followed up between 30 and 742 days (1-24 months); no serious complications were observed. Both patients and their partners were considered to well tolerate and accept the port-systems. Totally implantable venous access devices promise to reduce the number and severeness of cardiac decompensations in chronic preterminal heart failure by application of daily intravenous furosemide. This form of outpatient treatment will ameliorate the quality of life and stabilize the course of these severely and chronically ill patients.", 
    "104": "Several studies have shown that increased dietary calcium decreases blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We compared the effects of a high calcium diet and different antihypertensive agents on BP and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in lymphocytes of adult SHR. The calcium content of the normal chow was 1.1% and that of the high calcium chow was 2.5%. Antihypertensive drug treatments were performed by giving the animals trichlormethiazide (2 mg/kg/day), atenolol (25 mg/kg/day), and quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) in drinking water. Untreated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as controls. After 14 weeks of study systolic BP (SBP) and [Ca2+]i in blood lymphocytes, measured with a fluorescent indicator quin-2, were higher in untreated SHR than in WKY rats. Trichlormethiazide, atenolol, quinapril, and the high calcium diet all decreased BP in SHR, but only quinapril and calcium-rich diet concurrently reduced [Ca2+]i. We conclude that the reduction in [Ca2+]i during high calcium intake does not result from decreased BP itself. If the changes in lymphocyte [Ca2+]i reflect Ca2+ metabolism in other tissues as well, especially in vascular smooth muscle, the normalization of [Ca2+]i may be involved in the BP-lowering mechanisms of oral calcium loading and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in genetic hypertension.", 
    "105": "Recently, we have found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and renin are abundantly expressed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of dehydrated mice. Since potassium (K+) depletion also stimulates renin and induces hypertrophy of the JGA, we examined the ability of this maneuver to stimulate TGF-beta isoforms and renin in renovascular tissue and the JGA of young rats. Sprague-Dawley rats (50 +/- 5 g) were fed either a control diet or a potassium-deficient diet (< 0.05% K+) for 7, 16, or 21 days. As a control for TGF-beta and renin stimulation, an additional group of animals was fed a normal diet but was water deprived for three days. Potassium-depleted animals experienced severe growth retardation but kidney weight increased significantly. Potassium depletion induced both TGF-beta 2 and renin immunoreactivity in renal arterioles and the JGA but had no effect on TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 3 isoforms. To determine the role of circulating angiotensin II in the stimulation of TGF-beta 2 by potassium depletion, a group of potassium-depleted rats received enalapril (100 mg/liter) in the drinking water. The addition of converting enzyme inhibitor increased both the intensity of TGF-beta 2 and renin staining as well as the number of cells positively stained. Our results demonstrate that K+ depletion induces TGF-beta 2 and renin in renal arterioles and in the JGA. Furthermore, circulating angiotensin II is not responsible for the increase in the local expression of TGF-beta 2. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 2 may be an important mediator of JGA hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "106": "Post-infarction remodeling consists of changes in the size and shape of the left ventricular cavity taking place after myocardial necrosis. These changes in ventricular geometry involve the infarcted area as well as the myocardium situated at a distance from the infarct. The main factors of remodeling are the location, transmurality and extent of the necrosis, the current ventricular load, the patency of the artery responsible for the infarction, the distribution of coronary lesions and the absence of functional collateral circulation. Remodeling begins early and progresses during the weeks and months which follow the acute episode. Dilatation of the left ventricle is of poor prognosis, the principal complication being the development of congestive heart failure. Concerning treatment, the arterial recanalization obtained in the first hours is usually accompanied by a lesser ventricular dilatation. In case of extensive infarct with alteration of the global ventricular function, vasodilators, and notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, attenuate the remodeling process and improve the mid- or long-term prognosis.",

Our objectives were 1) to investigate the difference between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, delapril) and an angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (DuP753) in suppressing neointimal proliferation; and 2) to investigate the antiproliferative effects of these drugs given topically to the injured vessels. All these treatments effectively prevented neointimal formation (p < 0.01). Even a single topical application of either type of drug with F127 pluronic gel to be injured vessel after ballooning is found to be significantly effective probably due to the inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration (p < 0.01). Multiple systemic application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was more effective than that of DuP753 at the same blood pressure level. The effectiveness of topical application of these drugs suggests clinical usefulness after angioplasty or vascular surgery.", 
    "114": "Guinea pig serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities exceed ACE activities of other mammalian sera by as much as two magnitudes. To examine the possibility that guinea pig ACE has a superior catalytic efficiency, we purified it to apparent homogeneity and compared it to highly purified forms of ACE from human seminal plasma, rat lungs and rabbit lungs. The first 24 amino acid residues of guinea pig and rat ACE forms were 96% identical with the sequence of human ACE. Second order rate constants (kcat/Km) for guinea pig, human and rabbit forms of ACE on reaction with benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro were identical (1.6E-09 M-1 min-1). Their dissociation constants on reaction with the ACE inhibitor RAC-X-65 were within a narrow range (10-16 pM). Thus, the high ACE activity of guinea pig serum is owing to high enzyme concentration and not to superior catalytic efficiency.", 
    "115": "Infarct expansion (IE) and ventricular remodelling (VR) are interdependent pathophysiologic processes in the heart following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and may contribute to dilatation of the left ventricle, heart failure, left ventricular aneurysm and/or rupture, and poor prognosis. IE and VR are demonstrated by echocardiography, and are usually seen with large, transmural, anterior AMI, hypertension and persisting occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. All myocardial tissue components are involved in IE and VR, and local generation of growth factors, vasoactive mediators, oxygen-derived free radicals, and activation of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system may have pathophysiological significance. These mechanisms can provide the opportunity for therapy, and evidence suggests that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors can attenuate IE and VR.",

We observed that longer versions of P18 and the murine cytomegalovirus pp89-derived core peptide, pMCMV, which could stimulate T cell hybridomas in FCS, were not as sensitive to the ACE inhibitor captopril as P18. Using cell-free soluble murine class I MHC molecules and protease inhibitors, we found that there are pathways of differing efficiency that use enzymes other than ACE for the proteolytic processing of peptides in serum. The kinetics of the generation of T cell stimulatory activity among P18 variant peptides in serum differed with peptide length, and with the nature of amino and COOH-terminal extensions. Such processing occurs in human plasma as well as in FCS. The understanding of this processing, its kinetics, and its inhibitors can lead to better design of peptide-based therapies, including vaccines.",

Evaluation criteria were efficacy, clinical experience, safety, dosage interval, hepatic bioactivation, interactions, dosage forms and cost. A relative weight was assigned through a survey among the hospital's staff. Each alternative was evaluated in relation to all criteria. Sensitivity analysis was applied to validate the method.

It is concluded that ACE-inhibitors represent a new era in the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with isolated or for the main part systolic left ventricle dysfunction, and that ACE-inhibitor treatment must be regarded as a first line drug in this condition, along with diuretics and perhaps digoxin. Patients in NYHA class IIIb-IV should be referred to a specialist or hospital with regard to supplemental cardiological investigations and initiation of ACE-inhibitor treatment, if such treatment has not already ben started. Patients with slight to moderate heart failure (NYHA class II-IIIa) should be referred as well, unless it is known that the cause of heart failure is an ischaemic heart condition that does not require operation.

The objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize pharmacologically the alpha-adrenoceptor mediating norepinephrine-induced oscillations in tail artery; and (2) to investigate the relationship between blood pressure level, altered by treatments with hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, and the observation of norepinephrine-induced oscillations in tail artery. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and guanabenz potently stimulated oscillatory contractions in the tail artery while the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine were considerably less potent. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin demonstrated high affinity for the receptor mediating norepinephrine-induced oscillatory contractions. These results support the hypothesis that norepinephrine-induced oscillatory contractions in the tail artery from SHRSP occur primarily through stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Ramipril lowered blood pressure in SHRSP after 4 weeks of treatment during 6-10 weeks of life but did not alter the ability of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (10(-5) M) to induce contractile oscillations in tail arteries from SHRSP, indicating these oscillations are not a secondary effect of high blood pressure. These studies suggest that norepinephrine-induced oscillations in tail artery from SHRSP may be a vascular trait separate and distinct from blood pressure level and angiotensin II expression early in life.", 
    "127": "Prolonged treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor produces an induction of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme. Induction of angiotensin converting enzyme in tissues during prolonged treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is less well documented. We compared the effects of 1 h and 1 week treatment with ramipril (0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg) on angiotensin converting enzyme activity in the plasma, renal cortex and renal brush border membrane of Wistar rats. As an increase in activity could be masked by the inhibition due to the presence of ramiprilat which is the active form of ramipril, we eliminated the ramiprilat present in renal cortex homogenates with EGTA during brush border preparation. The 1-h treatment with ramipril induced a dose-dependent inhibition of plasma and renal cortex angiotensin converting enzyme activity. The 1-week treatment with ramipril produced an increase in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity, whereas renal cortex angiotensin converting enzyme activity decreased. The decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity persisted in the brush border membrane after elimination of residual ramiprilat with EGTA. Our results show that prolonged ramipril treatment produces opposite responses in plasma and renal cortex angiotensin converting enzyme activity, suggesting that plasma and epithelial angiotensin converting enzymes are subject to specific local regulatory factors.", 
    "128": "Survival after acute myocardial infarction has been enhanced by treatment with thrombolytic agents, aspirin, and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. However there remains a substantial subgroup of patients who manifest clinical evidence of heart failure despite the first two of these treatments, and for whom beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are relatively or absolutely contraindicated. These patients have a greatly increased risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic, arrhythmic, and haemodynamic events. In this selected high-risk subset of patients we investigated the effect of therapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor rampiril, postulating that it would lengthen survival. 2006 patients who had shown clinical evidence of heart failure at any time after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were recruited from 144 centres in 14 countries. Patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either placebo (992 patients) or ramipril (1014 patients) on day 3 to day 10 after AMI (day 1). Patients with severe heart failure resistant to conventional therapy, in whom the attending physician considered the use of an ACE inhibitor to be mandatory, were excluded. Follow-up was continued for a minimum of 6 months and an average of 15 months. On intention-to-treat analysis mortality from all causes was significantly lower for patients randomised to receive ramipril (170 deaths; 17%) than for those randomised to receive placebo (222 deaths; 23%). The observed risk reduction was 27% (95 % Cl 11% to 40%; p = 0.002). Analysis of prespecified secondary outcomes revealed a risk reduction of 19% for the first validated outcome (i.e., first event in an individual patient)--namely, death, severe/resistent heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke (95% Cl 5% to 31%; p = 0.008). Oral administration of rampiril to patients with clinical evidence of either transient or ongoing heart failure, initiated between the second and ninth day after myocardial infarction, resulted in a substantial reduction in premature death from all causes. This benefit was apparent as early as 30 days and was consistent across a range of subgroups.", 
    "129": "1. Much attention has been given to the effects of various classes of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure and haemodynamics. The effects of a single bout of exercise on post-exercise blood pressure have also been studied by several investigators. However, the combined effects of prior exercise and antihypertensive medication has drawn less attention. 2. We examined the separate and combined effects of a single bout of exercise and of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with a new ACE inhibitor (fosinopril, 20 mg day(-1)) on post-exercise blood pressure and systemic and regional haemodynamics. Ten patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were studied with a double-blind, randomized crossover, placebo- and rest period-controlled study design. 3. At rest, mean arterial pressure (MAP, -10 +/- 2 mm Hg), total peripheral resistance (TPR, -11 +/- 5%) and forearm vascular resistance (FVR, -17 +/- 8%) were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced during ACE inhibition as compared with the placebo phase. 4. During the placebo phase, MAP (-3 +/- 1 mm Hg), TPR (-10 +/- 4%) and FVR (-9 +/- 4%) were lower after exercise as compared with the control rest period. 5. During ACE inhibition, MAP (-3 +/- 1 mm Hg) and TPR (-8 +/- 4%) were lower, but FVR (+32 +/- 15%) was increased after exercise as compared with the control rest period. 6. Thus, blood pressure and TPR decreased similarly after exercise during the placebo phase and during ACE inhibition. However, differences in post-exercise forearm haemodynamics during the placebo phase and during ACE inhibition indicate that underlying regional haemodynamics are modified.",

The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a low dose combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (2.5 mg) and the extended release formulation of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist felodipine (5 mg) were assessed in a double-blind, double dummy placebo controlled, randomised, crossover study in 20 patients (mean age 55.4 years; range 46-69) with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension (supine diastolic > 90 mmHg < 115 mmHg after 4 weeks of single-blind wash-out on placebo). The four randomised, double-blind, crossover study phases evaluated the response to 4 weeks of once daily treatment with placebo, monotherapy with each drug and the combination. Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was performed for 24 h at the end of each phase. 2.

    "131": "As understanding of the mechanisms of congestive heart failure (CHF) has improved, it has become apparent that the previously applied stepped-care approach (ie, diuretic, digitalis, then vasodilator) is no longer valid. There is compelling evidence that use of vasodilators increases survival in CHF, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the vasodilators of choice. Use of an ACE inhibitor in patients with New York Heart Association classes II, III, and IV CHF improves survival over that achieved with use of placebo or direct-acting vasodilators. In patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, long-term administration of captopril improved survival and reduced morbidity and mortality from major cardiovascular events. Using an ACE inhibitor as preventive therapy in post-myocardial infarction patients without overt CHF but with evidence of muscle dysfunction (ie, left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or less) should be considered. The role of a newer vasodilator (eg, amlodipine besylate [Norvasc]) as an adjunct to therapy remains to be defined. If current theories on the pathophysiology of CHF are correct, continued interest in beta blockers is justified, especially in newer agents that have actual vasodilatory action in addition to their other beneficial properties.",

    "143": "To determine the contribution of kidney-derived renin and angiotensin converting enzyme to circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin peptides, we measured angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), Ang II, Ang-(1-9), and Ang I in plasma, kidney, lung, heart, aorta, brown adipose tissue, adrenal, pituitary, and brain of five groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats: control rats, rats given the converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg), rats nephrectomized 24 hours, rats nephrectomized 48 hours, and rats nephrectomized 48 hours and given ramipril. Plasma and tissues, apart from adrenal, showed a 63% to 98% reduction in Ang II, the ratio of Ang II to Ang I, or both after ramipril administration, indicating a major role for converting enzyme in Ang II formation. Nephrectomy caused a more than 95% decrease in plasma renin levels and a fourfold to eightfold increase in plasma angiotensinogen levels. Apart from plasma and brain, tissues showed a 59% to 78% decrease in Ang II levels after nephrectomy, indicating a major role for kidney-derived renin in Ang II formation. The persistence of Ang II in plasma and tissues of anephric rats indicates that Ang II may be formed by a process independent of kidney-derived renin; this process may be amplified by the increased plasma angiotensinogen levels that accompany nephrectomy. For lung, adrenal, and aorta, Ang II levels showed a further decrease when nephrectomized rats were given ramipril. However, for plasma and the other tissues, ramipril produced little or no decrease in Ang II levels of anephric rats, suggesting that Ang II may be formed by a pathway independent of converting enzyme. Such a pathway may involve the direct formation of Ang II from angiotensinogen by a non-renin-like enzyme.",

In the present paper we studied the mechanism by which hydrogen peroxide induces c-jun mRNA, an early response gene whose activation is required for mitogen-stimulated cell growth. Hydrogen peroxide induced c-jun mRNA in growth-arrested RASM cells in a time dependent manner. This stimulation was significantly inhibited by mepacrine, a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor. Arachidonic acid, a PLA2 product, also increased c-jun mRNA with a time course similar to that of hydrogen peroxide. The increases in c-jun mRNA induced by hydrogen peroxide and arachidonic acid were significantly reduced (55%) by down-regulation of protein kinase C with a phorbol ester. Furthermore, the effect of hydrogen peroxide on c-jun mRNA was also reduced by NDGA, an inhibitor of the lipoxygenase-cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system, suggesting that metabolism of arachidonic acid through this pathway is required for the induction of c-jun mRNA by oxidants. Both hydrogen peroxide and arachidonic acid significantly increased c-jun transcription as demonstrated by nuclear run-on assays. Together these observations suggest that: (1) the induction of c-jun mRNA by hydrogen peroxide is mediated by PLA2-dependent arachidonic acid release and metabolism through the lipoxygenase-cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system; (2) PKC appears to be involved in this signaling pathway and (3) the induction of c-jun mRNA by hydrogen peroxide in RASM cells is due to increased transcription.",

After an average follow-up period of 12.4 months, 30 patients (11 randomized to the placebo group and 19 to the enalapril group) could be restudied to assess the progression of ventricular dysfunction. After 1 year of follow-up, the changes in heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic pressure and right ventricular volumes were comparable in both groups. However, there were modest but opposite changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (+9 ml/m2 with placebo vs. -10 ml/m2 with enalapril, p < 0.05) and end-systolic volume (+5 ml/m2 with placebo vs. -13 ml/m2 with enalapril, p < 0.05).

The inability of the heart to act as a pump is determined in some patients by alterations to the architecture of the heart and changes in the extracellular space, particularly fibrosis. The degree to which the failure of the heart as a pump can be attributed to a reduced ability of the myocyte to contract is contentious. The origin of symptoms is still uncertain but does relate to identified changes in the lung, increased peripheral resistance and atrophy of skeletal muscle. The mechanisms of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are numerous and do not yet account easily for the clinical benefits. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to ascertain the proportion of patients who manifest progressive heart failure rather than deterioration due to further cardiac events. Understanding the pathophysiology of heart failure will allow therapy to be tailored to the requirements of the individual patient.",

With recognition of the high mortality rate that accompanies heart failure, the question has arisen whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may also improve survival. Early trials of the vasodilator combination hydralazine plus nitrates (V-HeFT trial) showed a strong trend toward a reduction in mortality, and a subsequent trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in a population of patients with end-stage heart failure (CONSENSUS trial) showed a highly significant reduction in the mortality. The SOLVD trial was begun in 1986 to determine whether enalapril could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild to moderate congestive failure (primarily New York Heart Association classes II and III), as well as in asymptomatic patients with a low ejection fraction. This report presents the results in patients with symptoms of congestive failure who were studied in the SOLVD treatment trial. A total of 2,569 patients were recruited into the trial, with an average follow-up period of 41.4 months.

Compared with placebo, enalapril significantly reduced the incidence of death due to progressive heart failure but apparently had no effect on sudden death.

    "158": "The rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in patients with chronic heart failure lies in their vasodilator action, antiischemic effect, ability to lessen left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and data showing their effect in preventing progression of myocardial dysfunction in animals with cardiomyopathy. Despite initial studies reporting improvement of the hemodynamic profile with nifedipine, further evaluation showed variable results, with hemodynamic worsening seen in up to 29% of patients. Longer-term controlled studies evaluating symptoms and clinical status demonstrated worsening chronic heart failure in approximately 25% of patients within 8 weeks of nifedipine therapy. Although diltiazem has a lesser myocardial depressant effect and its short-term use was associated with less frequent hemodynamic and clinical worsening, long-term exposure to the drug in a large group of patients with chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction resulted in an increased incidence of cardiac events, with worsening heart failure and death. The use of verapamil in a similar patient cohort showed the loss of its demonstrated protective effect in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure. In an attempt to improve the safety of calcium channel blockers, the following approaches were suggested: 1) use of second-generation drugs with less myocardial depressant effect; 2) concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent reported neurohormonal activation; and 3) development of drugs with favorable neurohormonal effects. These approaches led to mixed results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of the 254 patients randomized, 140 completed one of the trials or reached an end point and are the basis of this report. In both trials, there was a clear trend for an increase in exercise capacity in the milrinone-treated patients (+26 +/- 8% vs. +5 +/- 7% in MIL-1077 and +11 +/- 5% vs. +2 +/- 4% in MIL-1078). Symptoms of congestive heart failure were decreased in one trial but not the other. Quality of life, as assessed by a questionnaire, was not effected in either trial. There was an increased incidence of adverse events in milrinone-treated patients. Adverse events related primarily to hypotension and vasodilation led to discontinuation of drug in 18 milrinone-treated patients vs. 1 placebo-treated patient. Milrinone had little or no proarrhythmic effect and cardiovascular deaths were distributed equally between the milrinone and placebo groups. These data suggest that when used in combination with a converting enzyme inhibitor, oral milrinone improves exercise capacity but is associated with a high incidence of adverse events that appear to be related to excessive vasodilation.", 
    "160": "Although supported by 2 centuries of anecdotal clinical evidence, the safety and efficacy of the cardiac glycosides for the treatment of congestive heart failure due to systolic ventricular dysfunction had never been rigorously examined by prospective clinical trials until the past decade. A reevaluation of the appropriate role of these drugs in modern cardiovascular pharmacology was prompted by the introduction in the 1970s of new classes of drugs for the treatment of congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias. Concurrently, several reports appeared, questioning the routine prescription of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure, particularly in patients in sinus rhythm. The majority of clinical trials published since 1980, most of which examined patients with New York Heart Association class II and III congestive heart failure, indicate that digoxin with or without concomitant administration of a vasodilator lessens symptoms and reduces the morbidity associated with congestive heart failure, particularly in patients with more advanced symptoms and ventricular dysfunction. The data on efficacy are less clear in support of the routine prescription of digoxin in the treatment of mild (class I and II) congestive heart failure. Although most recent trials attest to the relative safety and efficacy of digoxin in patients with congestive heart failure whose serum levels are maintained between 1 and 2 ng/ml, there is no conclusive evidence as yet that cardiac glycosides improve survival, as has been documented for vasodilators and, in particular, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Digitalis Investigators Group (DIG) trial now underway should provide an answer to this question within the next few years.",

In addition to hypertension, which is encountered in almost 50% of patients, lipid abnormalities, comprising elevations of both LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglycerides, as well as decreases in the levels of HDL-cholesterol, contribute to the high prevalence of vascular disease. Elevated levels of serum lipoprotein(a) may add to this increased risk. Considering the apparent clustering of risk factors such as poor metabolic control, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, the attainment of optimal blood glucose control forms only one of the aims of treatment to prevent the neurological and vascular complications, which severely affect the quality of life. Dietary advice comprises the adoption of healthy eating habits and reducing the intake of refined sugars and saturated fat. The long-term metabolic effects of intensive dietary therapy, however, have been disappointing. This necessitates early pharmacological treatment in a considerable number of patients. With mild hyperglycaemia, the metabolic effects of sulphonylurea and insulin treatment were comparable, but insulin is superior to sulphonylurea in patients who are more hyperglycaemic (fasting blood glucose > 11 mmol/l). In addition to its effects on blood glucose control, insulin therapy favourably affects dyslipidaemia. Treatment can be safely instituted on an outpatient basis, and hypoglycaemic side-effects are infrequent. Combination therapy of insulin and sulphonylurea results in similar metabolic improvement when compared with insulin treatment alone, but with a lower dose of insulin and the need for only one injection in two-thirds of patients. Drugs such as ACE inhibitors, which have no metabolic side-effects, have become the therapy of choice when treating hypertension in diabetic patients.", 
    "164": "Hypertension frequently complicates diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular and microvascular complications. Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective antihypertensive agents and it has been suggested that they may improve glucose tolerance. We performed a double-blind, randomized study comparing treatment for 8 weeks with cilazapril, a new ACE inhibitor, or placebo on metabolic variables in 22 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. At week 8 no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, haemoglobin A1 and plasma lipids had occurred. The areas under the glucose [placebo (mean +/- SD): 10.7 +/- 3.27 and 10.6 +/- 2.53; cilazapril: 11.9 +/- 3.23 and 12.1 +/- 2.9 mmol/l per 180 min at 0 and 8 weeks, respectively] and insulin curve [placebo (median and range): 47.4 (31.4-165.1) and 65.3 (16.8-190.8); cilazapril: 51.1 (23.8-132.0) and 57.6 (29.0-150.1) mU/l per 180 min at 0 and 8 weeks, respectively] after a standardized oral liquid test meal were unaltered.

    "166": "Renin is a glycoprotein that is heterogeneous with respect to carbohydrate content and net charge. In an attempt to clarify the role of renin isoelectric heterogeneity in renal renin storage and secretion, the isoelectric profile of renal renin, secreted renin, and circulating renin were directly assessed and compared under basal and stimulated conditions by the use of an in vivo blood perfused rabbit kidney preparation. Under basal conditions, the kidney preferentially stored and secreted the relatively basic isoelectric forms of renin. Acute stimulation of renin secretion (reduced renal perfusion pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition) significantly increased the secretion of the relatively basic isoelectric forms but had very little effect on the secretion of the relatively acidic renin forms. Circulating renin was composed primarily of relatively basic forms, which increased disproportionately after stimulation of renin secretion. These findings suggest that the isoelectric heterogeneity of renin is important in the cellular processing of renin and can be explained by a two-pool model in which the relatively acidic isoelectric forms of renin are constitutively secreted (and not stored) and the relatively basic isoelectric forms represent a regulated pathway in which they are stored and rapidly released in response to acute secretory stimuli. Preferential hepatic extraction of the more basic isoelectric forms has previously been described. Data from this study suggest that the disproportionate increase in circulating basic forms of renin observed after acute stimulation reflects the net effect of preferential renal the more basic renin isoelectric forms. The disproportionate increase in relatively basic circulating renin forms after acute secretory stimulation results in an overall circulating renin activity with a shorter half-life.",

M17055 at doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day exerted a dose-related diuretic and antihypertensive effect during the treatment. The weight of the left ventricle normalized by body weight on the following day of the last dosage was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced by M17055 at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of M17055 on cardiac hypertrophy was more potent (P < 0.01) than that of captopril, when the comparison was performed at the doses of M17055 and captopril inducing the same extent of blood-pressure decrement. Vascular hypertrophy was evaluated by the media/lumen ratio (M/L) in the thoracic aorta and the first branch of the superior mesenteric artery. In the aorta, M/L was slightly, but not significantly, decreased by M17055 at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, whereas it was decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by captopril. In the mesenteric artery, the ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by M17055 at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day.

    "169": "An analysis of the hydrolysis kinetics of the synthetic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) substrate benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP) in the intact lung suggested that 12-15% of the BPAP was in a form that could not be hydrolyzed by ACE in the time course of a single pass through the lungs [C. A. Dawson et al. Am. J. Physiol. 257 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 26): H853-H865, 1989]. BPAP has been found to exist as a mixture of cis and trans isomers in a ratio of approximately 14:86 in aqueous solution at equilibrium. Thus, one possible explanation for the incomplete hydrolysis of BPAP on passage through the intact lung is that the trans form is the preferred substrate for ACE. To examine this hypothesis, we measured BPAP hydrolysis by ACE in vitro over a range of ACE concentrations and in the presence and absence of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin. In the presence of a sufficient concentration of ACE and in the absence of cyclophilin, hydrolysis of [3H]BPAP by ACE followed biexponential progress curves, consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of hydrolysis of the majority (approximately 87%) of the substrate is proportional to ACE concentration, whereas the hydrolysis rate of the remaining substrate fraction is independent of enzyme concentration. The addition of cyclophilin resulted in an increase in the ACE-independent rate constant, an effect that was reversed by the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporin A. These results suggest that the enzyme-independent rate constant represents the rate of cis-trans isomerization and that the enzyme-dependent rate constant represents the hydrolysis of the trans isomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In experiment 1 naive rats who were maintained on ad libitum food and water were given daily 40-min access to a 6% (w/v) alcohol solution and water. Daily intraperitoneal injections of captopril (10 mg/kg) reduced alcohol intake, but the combination of captopril (5 and 10 mg/kg) and hydrochlorothiazide (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) enhanced the reduction in intake. In experiment 2, captopril alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, and the combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide were again administered daily in the limited access procedure. Captopril (10 mg/kg) again reduced alcohol intake as did all three doses of hydrochlorothiazide (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg). Compared with the individual effects of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, Capozide exerted a supra-additive reduction in alcohol intake. These effects were not due to drug-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. Taken together these results demonstrate an enhanced potency of Capozide in suppressing alcohol intake and invite their testing in a population of hypertensive alcoholics and alcohol abusers.",

To address whether this association is of pathophysiological relevance the relationship between echocardiographically determined LVH and IGF-I levels was investigated in 49 patients with essential hypertension before and after one year of antihypertensive treatment with different regimens (nonpharmacological measures, bisoprolol, captopril). The control group consisted of 30 normotensive subjects without LVH.

    "176": "It has been previously shown that endogenous opioid peptides suppress human ACTH and gonadotropins secretion via hypothalamic mechanism. Since the angiotensin converting enzyme can participate in the metabolism of opioid peptides, this study examined the action of Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on corticotropin and gonadotropin (LH and FSH) release induced by the opiate antagonist naloxone in man. Seven male hypertensive volunteers (aged 30-52) were treated with A) saline; B) naloxone 8 mg iv as a bolus followed by an iv infusion of 4 mg/h; C) naloxone as above after pretreatment with captopril 150 mg/day for 15 days; D) captopril alone. Naloxone significantly stimulated ACTH and LH secretion when compared with the saline infusion. This stimulating effect was taken as an indirect evidence for a tonic opioid inhibition on pituitary hormones release. The pre-medication with captopril significantly enhanced the ACTH and LH response to the opiate antagonist naloxone, but captopril alone did not modify ACTH and LH values when compared to saline. The results would suggest that captopril interferes with the opioid regulation of human ACTH and LH secretion probably by blocking the proteolytic degradation of opioid peptides.", 
    "177": "The conventional pharmacokinetic profile of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, is a lipid-soluble and relatively inactive prodrug with good oral absorption (60 to 70%), a rapid peak plasma concentration (1 hour) and rapid clearance (undetectable by 4 hours) by de-esterification in the liver to a primary active diacid metabolite, enalaprilat. Peak plasma enalaprilat concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours after oral enalapril administration. Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug from tissue distribution sites. The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug accumulation on repeated administration but is thought to be of pharmacological significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment [particularly creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min (< 1.2 L/h)] results in significant accumulation of enalaprilat and necessitates dosage reduction. Accumulation is probably the cause of reduced elimination in healthy elderly individuals and in patients with concomitant diabetes, hypertension and heart failure. Conventional pharmacokinetic approaches have recently been extended by more detailed descriptions of the nonlinear binding of enalaprilat to ACE in plasma and tissue sites. As a result of these new approaches, there have been significant improvements in the characterisation of concentration-time profiles for single-dose administration and the translation to steady-state. Such improvements have further importance for the accurate integration of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to enalapril(at) in a concentration-effect model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The elderly is characterized by haemodynamic and neurohormonal features, which have to be pointed out: cardiac output and renal blood flow as well as hepatic blood flow are significantly lower than those of younger adults; great vessels compliance is diminished, baroreflex is impaired and cerebral autoregulation curve is shifted towards the right.

Two competitive enzyme immunoassays specific for either zabicipril or zabiciprilat have been developed using acetylcholinesterase (E.C. 3.1.1.7) as label. Antibodies were raised in rabbits after immunization with lysil derivatives of zabicipril or zabiciprilat coupled with bovine serum albumin. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates coated with a monoclonal antibody raised against rabbit immunoglobulin G, thus ensuring rapid separation of free and bound fractions of the tracer. The analysis does not require any extraction step. In the case of the assay of zabiciprilat, interference generated by endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was eliminated by the addition of perindoprilat, another ACE inhibitor. Perindoprilat was not recognized by the antibodies (cross-reactivity < 0.01%) and did not affect assay efficiency. The specificity of the assays was checked by high-performance liquid chromatography of human plasma samples obtained after oral administration of 2 mg of zabicipril.

Renal function was studied in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (119-128 days gestation), before and during treatment of the ewe with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, which crosses the placenta and blocks the fetal renin angiotensin system. 2. An i.v. dose of 15 mg (about 319 micrograms kg-1) of captopril to salt-replete ewes followed by an infusion to the ewe of 6 mg h-1 (about 128 micrograms kg-1 h-1) caused a fall in fetal arterial pressure (P < 0.01), and a rise in fetal renal blood flow (RBF) from 67.9 +/- 5.6 to 84.9 +/- 8.3 ml min-1 (mean +/- s.e. mean) (P < 0.05). Renal vascular resistance and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fell (P < 0.01); fetal urine flow (P < 0.01); fetal urine flow (P < 0.01) and sodium excretion declined (P < 0.05). 3. Ewes were treated for the next 2 days with 15 mg captopril twice daily. On the 4th day, 15 mg was given to the ewe and fetal renal function studied for 2 h during the infusion of captopril (6 mg h-1) to the ewe. Of the 9 surviving fetuses, 3 were anuric and 3 had low urine flow rates. When 6 micrograms kg-1 h-1 of angiotensin II was infused directly into the fetus RBF fell from 69 +/- 10.1 ml min-1 to 31 +/- 13.9 ml min-1, GFR rose (P < 0.05) and urine flow (P < 0.01) and sodium excretion increased in all fetuses. 4. It is concluded that the small fall in fetal arterial pressure partly contributed to the fall in fetal GFR but in addition, efferent arteriolar tone fell so that the filtration pressure fell further. Thus maintenance of fetal renal function depends on the integrity of the fetal renin angiotensin system. These findings explain why use of ACE inhibitors in human pregnancy is associated with neonatal anuria.",

Changes in the structural and functional integrity of endothelium have been recognized as relatively early features of delayed and progressive pulmonary vascular injury caused by the pyrrolizidine alkaloid, monocrotaline (MCT). Although a number of investigators have evaluated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the lungs of rats treated with MCT, the exact nature of changes in activity of this enzyme and the role they may play in MCT pneumotoxicity remain controversial. 2. We examined the direct effects of monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP), a toxic metabolite of MCT, on cultured endothelial cell ACE activity. Post-confluent monolayers of porcine or bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PECs or BECs, respectively) were treated with a single administration of MCTP at time 0; then they were examined for their ability to degrade the synthetic peptide, [3H]-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro. 3. In PECs, which are relatively insensitive to the direct cytolytic effects of MCTP, monolayer ACE activity was unchanged initially but gradually decreased within 4 days after treatment with a high concentration of MCTP (150 microM). This decrease was transient, and PEC monolayer ACE activity returned to the control value by 10 days post treatment. 4. BEC monolayer ACE activity was also unchanged initially but rapidly declined within 4 days after MCTP treatment and remained depressed throughout the post treatment period. BECs were quite sensitive to the cytolytic effects of MCTP and the decline in ACE activity occurred coincident with the decrease in monolayer cellularity and appearance of marked cytotoxicity. 5. We conclude that high concentrations of MCTP decrease endothelial ACE activity. The decline in ACE activity is delayed and the magnitude and duration of the decrease corresponds to the degree ofMCTP-induced cytotoxicity. This suggests that altered endothelial ACE activity is unlikely to be a direct effect of MCTP on the enzyme but may reflect the delayed cell injury which results from exposure to this compound.",

Captopril increased exercise duration at 1 mV ST segment depression, time to angina and total exercise time (p < 0.01). In double-blind essay, captopril group results were similar to the pilot essay. In comparing results between placebo and captopril groups the most relevant differences were: significant increment in the time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression (p < 0.01), to angor (p < 0.05) and total exercise duration (p < 0.01).

    "208": "We have isolated a potent inhibitor of enkephalin-degrading enzymes from the bovine spinal cord, and determined its amino-acid sequence and inhibitory activity against enkephalin-degrading enzymes. This new substance, isolated and identified from the bovine spinal cord, is composed of a heptapeptide (Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr). The inhibitory activity (IC50) of this new substance against enkephalin-degrading enzymes, purified from monkey brain, are 3.3 micrograms.ml-1 against aminopeptidase, 1.4 microgram.ml-1 against dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, 2.4 micrograms.ml-1 against angiotensin converting enzyme, and 10 micrograms.ml-1 against enkephalinase. This new substance showed no inhibitory activity against enkephalin-degrading enzymes purified from kidney, blood, etc. According to the above results, this substance is thought to be a new neuromodulator derived from the spinal cord. Because it was derived from the spinal cord, we have named it \"Spinorphin\". The discovery in the bovine spinal cord of endogenous heptapeptide, Spinorphin, with inhibitory activity on enkephalin-degrading enzymes raises a number of pertinent questions which cannot be adequately dealt with in this study. It will now be possible, however, to test the very hypothesis that this new peptide act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators at synaptic junctions.", 
    "209": "Inhibition of the metallopeptidase neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 (NEP) protects endogenous natriuretic peptides and potentiates their vasodepressor effects. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) attenuates the formation of angiotensin II and enhances the vasodepressor effect of endogenous kinins. A combination of NEP inhibition and ACE inhibition can potentially interact to shift the balance of vasoactive peptides toward vasodilation. This potential interaction was examined in conscious cardiomyopathic hamsters with low cardiac output and compensated heart failure. Neither the selective NEP inhibitor SQ 28,603 nor the selective ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (each at 30 mumol/kg, i.v.) caused significant changes in left ventricular end diastolic pressure or left ventricular systolic pressure when administered separately. However, the combination of these inhibitors, each at that dose, caused significant peak decreases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure of -12 +/- 1 and -18 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively. In separate cardiomyopathic hamsters, this same combination of treatments resulted in significant decreases in mean arterial pressure (-13%) and total peripheral resistance (-37%) and an increase in cardiac output (36%) as compared with vehicle effects (P < .05). At 90 min after administration of SQ 28,603 alone, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was double that in the vehicle group. In the group receiving the combination of inhibitors, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at 90 min was maintained at the high basal levels associated with this model despite the decrease in cardiac filling pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "210": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is present in tissues composed largely of fibrillar collagen such as heart valves, the adventitia of great vessels and intramyocardial coronary arteries, and the scar that follows myocardial infarction. We tested the hypothesis that such tissue ACE is related to fibrous tissue formation and that its appearance is independent of circulating renin and angiotensin peptides. For this purpose we selected experimental models that simulate primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism, each of which are associated with the appearance of myocardial fibrosis. ACE in the excised heart and aorta was localized by in vitro autoradiography with [125I]351A, while fibrosis was identified by light microscopy in sections stained with collagen specific picrosirius red. Tissue was obtained at 2, 4, and 6 weeks from various experimental groups: unoperated, untreated, age- and sex-matched controls; age- and sex-matched uninephrectomized control rats on a high sodium diet; and rats that had received either aldosterone (ALDO) or angiotensin II (AII). Compared with controls, we found ACE binding (1) unchanged after 2 weeks of ALDO, but increased in the adventitia of intramural coronary arteries after 4 weeks, in keeping with the perivascular fibrosis that appeared in each ventricle; (2) markedly increased after 6 weeks of ALDO, where it not only involved coronary vessels but also microscopic scars that appeared in atria and ventricles; (3) increased in the coronary adventitia and sites of scarring, each of which were present 2 weeks after AII; and (4) markedly increased after 4 and 6 weeks of AII as fibrosis became more extensive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "211": "The tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) have been demonstrated in sensory airway nerves of animals and man and are thought to be neurotransmitters of local axon reflexes, generated by stimuli such as cigarette smoke, dust, histamine, and bradykinin. We previously showed that intravenous SP and NKA caused bronchoconstriction in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats. Pharmacologic studies suggested that this occurred by an indirect mechanism, probably mediated by acetylcholine and serotonin. In this study, we demonstrate that the bronchoconstriction caused by SP and NKA in Fisher 344 rats is accompanied by a dose-dependent release of histamine and serotonin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In rats depleted of mast cell mediators by pretreatment with compound 48/80, the effects of SP and NKA on lung resistance and serotonin in BAL fluid were abolished. Local instillation of NKA in the airways caused a significant dose-dependent increase in BAL histamine. After pretreatment with thiorphan, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the bronchoconstriction and the histamine and serotonin release in BAL fluid caused by SP and NKA were enhanced. After pretreatment with a combination of thiorphan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, NKA and SP were almost equipotent in causing bronchoconstriction and serotonin release in the airways. This study indicates that mast cells are largely involved in the bronchoconstrictor effect of intravenously administered neurokinins in rats. As in the guinea pig, NEP is involved in the termination of the bronchoconstrictor effect of tachykinins. Moreover, NEP also affects the airway histamine and serotonin release caused by these tachykinins in the Fisher 344 rat.",

At 90 minutes, mean arterial pressure was reduced comparably after both drugs (86 +/- 15 to 76 +/- 18 mm Hg for nifedipine vs 95 +/- 19 to 77 +/- 18 mm Hg for captopril, p = NS between groups by analysis of variance), as was wedge pressure (11 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 13 +/- 9 to 9 +/- 5 mm Hg for captopril). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced more (p = 0.01) after nifedipine than after captopril (1,549 +/- 468 to 1,067 +/- 291 dynes s cm-5 vs 1,632 +/- 559 to 1,436 +/- 392 dynes s cm-5).

Forward stroke volume increased after nifedipine (58 +/- 14 to 70 +/- 16 ml, p < 0.001) but not after captopril (58 +/- 17 to 59 +/- 16 ml). Thus, cardiac output increased after nifedipine (4.4 +/- 0.9 to 5.5 +/- 1.2 liters/min, p < 0.001) but decreased after captopril (4.8 +/- 1.2 to 4.3 +/- 1.0, p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "213": "This study examined the effects of conventional doses of oral captopril on the renal responses to oral furosemide in ambulant patients with stable chronic heart failure. Twenty-five men (mean age 63 years) were randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 received placebo on days 1 and 2 before furosemide. Group 2 received placebo on day 1 before furosemide and captopril thereafter (i.e., captopril before furosemide on day 2). Urine was collected after either placebo or captopril and after furosemide (taken after placebo or captopril pretreatment). Captopril by itself did not affect renal function. Captopril did, however, significantly affect the renal response to furosemide. The increase in urine flow rate after furosemide in group 2 was decreased from 225% with placebo to 128% with captopril (p < 0.02). The increase in sodium excretion after furosemide was decreased from 623% with placebo to 242% with captopril (p < 0.001). Pretreatment with captopril abolished the increase in creatine clearance after furosemide. The increase in urinary albumin excretion (used as a marker of glomerular function) after furosemide was also significantly blunted by captopril. Conventional doses of captopril acutely inhibit the natriuretic and diuretic responses to furosemide at the glomerular level in ambulant patients with stable chronic heart failure.", 
    "214": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Within the past two years, four new agents in this class-benazepril, fosinopril, quinapril and ramipril--have been approved in the United States for use in the treatment of hypertension. These agents have been shown to be as effective as the older angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in treating hypertension and, in limited trials, congestive heart failure. The side effect profiles of the new agents are similar to those of other agents in this class that do not contain a sulfhydryl group. Fosinopril has a unique route of elimination that may make it the preferred agent in patients with renal failure. Otherwise, the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have no proven clinical advantages over other available agents. However, at moderate to high doses, the new agents may be substantially less expensive.", 
    "215": "Reduction of hypertension, whether systolic and diastolic or isolated systolic, is associated with significant reductions in mortality and morbidity rates even in older asymptomatic patients, particularly those less than 80 years old. The increased availability of antihypertensive preparations makes it possible to individualize the choice of therapy to meet the particular needs of the older patient. Although most presently available antihypertensive agents are effective, each one possesses different properties and none is free of side effects. We review the indications for and the action and side effects of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and adrenergic blocking drugs, and we offer treatment suggestions for hypertension associated with other diseases such as diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular insufficiency, depression, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Orthostatic hypotension is particularly serious in older patients because it may precipitate falls. It is also possible that the relationship between blood pressure levels and mortality and morbidity risks is not linear but J-shaped, both low and high levels increasing risks. Caution in treating hypertensive elderly patients will minimize the incidence of side effects.",

Compared with control, serum insulin concentration increased in 33 patients with essential hypertension at 3 hour postload (P < 0.05) and in 17 patients with simple obesity at 1 hour postload (P < 0.05) during OGTT, 19 patients with acromegaly also had their insulin concentration increased at 1.3 hour postload (P < 0.05) during OGTT. The correlationships between diastolic blood pressure and integrated area under the curve for serum insulin concentration (r = 0.3838, P < 0.05) were observed in 33 patients with essential hypertension. Serum insulin concentration decreased in 10 patients with essential hypertension at 1 and 2 hour postload during OGTT after antihypertensive treatment with captopril or captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The results indicated that the patients with essential hypertension, simple obesity and acromegaly are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic after an oral glucose load.", 
    "217": "By using two similar dietary and pharmacological patterns of potassium depletive treatment, two experimental groups--KD2 (n = 6) and KD3 (n = 6)--with cumulative potassium deficit not significantly different, were obtained. The basal values of plasma potassium concentration and PRA, as well as the expression of renal hypokalemic dysfunction were not significantly different. Paired studies in the absence and presence of indomethacin (KD2 group) or enalapril (KD3 group) were performed. The aim of the research was evaluation of the effective roles of prostanoid and angiotensin (AT) II systems in renal hypokalemic dysfunction. The results show that: 1) AT II and cortical vasodilating prostanoids exerted opposite effects on the preglomerular arteriolar tone; 2) medullary prostanoids antagonized the vasopressin effects. Therefore, in potassium depletion the decreased synthesis of cortical and medullary prostanoids, in the face of the increased generation of AT II, contributed to reducing the glomerular filtration rate and facilitate the expression of vasopressin action. These components of the renal hypokalemic dysfunction probably exert a protective role with regard to the urinary chloride and potassium losses.",

The recruitment of a total of 1500 patients (750 per treatment group) has been planned for this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of oral treatment with zofenopril calcium (7.5-30 mg twice a day) on the combined short-term total mortality and occurrence of severe refractory congestive heart failure in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). Secondary end-points of the study include recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, progression of congestive heart failure as well as long-term mortality. Patients are initially treated in hospital within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms of AMI and their active follow-up continued for 6 weeks. In addition, the patients will be passively followed for a total of 12 months from the index AMI to assess their vital status and the occurrence of congestive heart failure. The study data will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis. An international independent Policy and Safety Monitoring Board is acting as the overall supervisory body and is responsible for the ethical conduction of the trial. A Scientific Committee is responsible for the scientific aspects of the trial and for the regular review of the progress of the study. We assume that the rationale and design of the SMILE trial will provide reliable information on the ability of ACE-inhibitors to reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "220": "To assess possible roles of the renal kallikrein-kinin system in the development of renal impairments in diabetes mellitus, we determined daily excretion of urinary total and active kallikrein in uninephrectomized Wistar-Kyoto rats made diabetic by streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) as a bolus injection. We also evaluated the effect of captopril (50 mg/kg/day) administered orally on the development of diabetic renal impairments in the streptozotocin-treated rats. Active kallikrein was determined by its kininogenase activity, and generated kinins were radioimmunologically measured. Total kallikrein was also determined by measuring kininogenase activity after inactive kallikrein had been activated with trypsin (200 micrograms/ml). Urinary active kallikrein excretion was significantly reduced in streptozotocin-treated rats whereas urinary total kallikrein excretion was unchanged, resulting in the decreased ratio of active to total kallikrein compared to that in the controls. These reductions were preceded by the increased excretion of urine protein measured as an index of renal impairments. The administration of captopril for 12 weeks attenuated the development of diabetic renal impairments evaluated by urine protein excretion in streptozotocin-treated rats, although it did not induce significant changes in urinary total and active kallikrein excretion, and the ratio of active to total kallikrein. Thus the results of this study indicate that the renal kallikrein-kinin system might not play major roles in the development of diabetic renal impairments in the rat, although the pathophysiological relevance of impaired activation of renal kallikrein system to the development of diabetic renal impairments remains to be determined. In addition, they suggest that the renoprotective effects of captopril may be independent of the activation of renal kallikrein system in streptozotocin-treated rats.", 
    "221": "The prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors contributes in everyday practice to the normalisation of blood pressure (BP) in individuals with essential hypertension (HT). Inhibition of the circulating renin angiotensin system (RAS) is accompanied, acutely, by a fall in BP. The effects of ACE inhibitors in the longer term is more complicated, including inhibition of tissue RAS and, finally, an action on the vascular structure itself which is apparently of fundamental importance. ACE inhibitors contribute to improving compliance of major arteries and to decreasing arteriolar resistance while leaving regional blood flow unaffected. There are additional beneficial modes of action such as the reversibility of endothelial dysfunction or inhibition of the cell migrations which are a prelude to atherosclerosis. These effects may be linked to the therapeutic group, but certain ACE inhibitors with particular tissue tropism have a more effective action regarding tissue RAS. This might be associated with a more significant fall in HT-related cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "222": "The previous study demonstrated that there are two stages in acute posthemorrhagic reaction (blood loss 1.5% of body weight) when cardiac output remains low: 1) increase of lung inactivation of norepinephrine (LIN) during the first 5 min after hemorrhage; 2) decrease of LIN 10 min after hemorrhage. The present study investigated effect of captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) at the second stage of this reaction. Captopril prevented posthemorrhagic decrease of LIN. It is proposed that angiotensin II inhibits LIN in hemorrhage.", 
    "223": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been treated for several years on empiric basis, until the results of the major clinical trials have made possible a pathophysiological approach to the treatment of patients with CHF. Studies from our laboratories have demonstrated that hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to acute volume expansion are markedly impaired in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and mild heart failure (NYHA Class I) and that pretreatment with ACE-inhibitors is able to prevent these abnormal responses. New insights into a more pathophysiological approach to CHF treatment are now possible by the development of new noninvasive techniques for the study of cardiac function. In particular, through radionuclide techniques we were able to demonstrate that patients with CHF show an exercise induced hemodynamic response different from that of normal subjects. Both ACE-inhibitors and digitalis were able to restore a normal response to exercise in patients with CHF.", 
    "224": "Attempts to rationalise the treatment of hypertension on the basis of pathophysiological and clinical characteristics of patients, such as renin profile and age, have had minimal success in the past. More recently it has been found that the response to ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists might be predicted on the basis of the ability of the kidney to produce kallikrein. Urinary excretion of active kallikrein is considered an index of the activity of the renal-kallikrein system and this system is thought to play an important role in modulating the effects of ACE inhibitors. In patients with low urinary kallikrein excretion the efficacy of ACE inhibitors is blunted and, on the contrary, that of calcium antagonists seems to be enhanced. Among ACE inhibitors the choice of a specific drug might also-based upon the effects of the molecule on the tissue renin-angiotensin system. In this regard lipophilic ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril, may produce a therapeutic effect at doses which are better tolerated due to greater tissue penetration.", 
    "225": "Mortality of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is high; > 40% of deaths are sudden, most often due to sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA). In such patients frequent ventricular premature beats (VPB) and non sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) are common. The relationship between VA and an increased risk for sudden death has been reported for patients with recent myocardial infarction. Although such relationship is uncertain for patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy, many authors have reported an association between the frequency and the complexity of VA and the risk of sudden death. Many factors are responsible for VA in CHF: structural abnormalities, electrolyte imbalance, hemodynamic impairment, pharmacologic therapy and abnormal activation of neurohormonal system. ACE inhibitors have reduced VA in several experimental models, suggesting that these drugs decrease heart vulnerability to arrhythmogenic stimuli such as reperfusion and electrical stimulation. Many clinical trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors decreased VPB frequency and the prevalence of NSVT. Although ACE inhibitors decrease VA frequency, the reduction in cardiac mortality observed in CONSENSUS31 and in SOLVD32 trials was due only to a decrease in the progression of CHF. Recently the results of V-HeFT II33 trial have shown that the reduction in VA prevalence observed in patients treated with enalapril paralleled a reduction of sudden death. Factors that may contribute to the reduction in VA by ACE inhibitors include: increase in serum potassium; unloading of the ventricle; decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. However, the most important factor seems related to their interference on neurohormonal system whose abnormal activation is the main mechanism of CHF progression.", 
    "226": "Ventricular failure is accompanied by a series of neurohormonal responses that result in vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction develops and is mediated by norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin. Vasoconstriction maintains blood pressure but contributes to deterioration in ventricular function. Baroreceptor dysfunction contributes to the syndrome by failing to ameliorate the sympathetic overstimulation. Drug therapy has historically included positive inotropes until recent data suggested that these drugs contributed to worsened survival. The role of digitalis glycosides in patients with ventricular failure who are in normal sinus rhythm remains a subject of scrutiny. Thus far, no long-term oral positive inotrope has replaced digoxin. Vasodilator therapy and interference with the neurohormonal response have become the major approaches to pharmacologic management of ventricular failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown convincingly that they improve survival, slow the course of disease progression, and block the neurohormonal response to ventricular failure. New treatments for ventricular failure must be directed at long-term gain rather than short-term hemodynamic results.", 
    "227": "Ventricular remodeling is a pathologic change in the size and shape of the heart after myocardial infarction. Human and animal studies have described the mechanisms responsible for the thinning and enlargement that progresses for years beyond the initial infarction. As a result of elevations in preload and afterload, ventricular pressures increase, and changes occur in both the infarcted and uninfarcted regions of the ventricle, increasing overall heart size. Recent investigation has demonstrated that the initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs after myocardial infarction reduces both systolic and diastolic wall stresses, thereby averting changes in heart size. These findings are significant, as increases in heart size and ventricular volumes have proved to be powerful predictors of early mortality after myocardial infarction.", 
    "228": "The treatment of coronary atherosclerosis requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of plaque rupture. The rupture of lipid-laden, macrophage-rich plaques initiates unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Plaque rupture occurs when the circumferential tension on a plaque exceeds its tensile strength, an event that cannot be predicted by coronary angiography. The incidence of plaque rupture appears to be reduced in patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapy, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, possibly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antioxidants. Not all ruptured coronary plaques produce an acute coronary syndrome. The consequences of plaque rupture depend on the extent of thrombus formation over the fissured plaque. This is determined by flow characteristics within the vessel as well as the activity of the thrombotic and fibrinolytic systems. Recent advances in cardiovascular molecular biology, coronary diagnostic techniques and cardiac therapeutics have opened windows of opportunity to study and modify the factors leading to plaque rupture. The local modification of gene expression to alter plaque composition and to elucidate and subsequently inhibit the prothrombotic and fibrinolytic defects that promote coronary thrombosis may, in future, prevent plaque rupture and its consequences. The application of such a concerted interdisciplinary approach promises a paradigm shift in the management of coronary artery disease toward the prevention of plaque rupture and its sequelae.", 
    "229": "Diuretic drugs have historically been developed for the treatment of sodium and water retention in edematous disorders. The latter have traditionally been an amalgam of congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis and chronic renal failure. With a > 50-year tradition of this approach to development, diuretic drugs have not been evaluated specifically for their safety and efficacy profile in patients with congestive heart failure. Yet, they are the most frequently prescribed drug class for this disorder. Furthermore, they remain the only drug class in congestive heart failure not subjected to large scale clinical trials. Sodium and water retention within this group of patients is related primarily to functional rather than to structural renal abnormalities. The reduction of glomerular filtration rate, increase in aldosterone secretion and abnormal profile of atrial natriuretic factor, all produce sodium retention and can be related to the severity of heart failure. Diuretic drugs have not been scrutinized in a manner similar to that of other drugs for the management of heart failure. Controversy persists regarding direct vascular effects, objective end points of assessment and the magnitude of adverse effects such as activation of neurohormonal pathways. These issues may be addressed by the establishment of reasonable objective end points, better stratification of patients in clinical trials and prospective trials in large clinical series. Even mortality studies should be considered.",

A very different pattern of response to captopril was observed among the different species. 4. There was no relationship between serum ACE activity and the response to captopril. 5.

    "234": "Angina pectoris in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), with or without heart failure, is important clinically and socioeconomically. In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), more than 36% of the patients had angina pectoris. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival and reduce the incidence of new, acute ischaemic events in these patients, they have no significant impact on the incidence of anginal attacks. Treatment of these patients must, therefore, primarily rely on nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. The beta-blockers, by lowering heart rate, improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during exercise, and are among the most effective anti-anginal agents available. In addition, by reducing resting heart rate and by preventing excessive catecholamine stimulation of the myocardium, beta-blockers may slow the progression of ischaemic LVD. This may contribute to the improved survival observed when these agents are used following myocardial infarction. By reducing cardiac sympathetic stimulation, however, beta-blockers may depress right and left ventricular pump function. This depression is generally of no clinical consequence when the ejection fraction remains above 40%, but when the ejection fraction is below 35%, only 30% of patients without heart failure and 10% of those with heart failure seem to tolerate a full dose of beta-blocker. This limits their therapeutic use in angina in this setting. Moreover, beta-blockers do not act on the mechanisms underlying some anginal attacks, namely the vasoconstriction of large coronary vessels at the level of atherosclerotic plaques and the reflex vasoconstriction of small coronary arterioles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "235": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diagnosed by ECG and echocardiography, is commonly associated with coronary heart disease. Hypertensive patients with LVH and myocardial ischaemia may be at particular risk. The prevalence of ischaemia in hypertensive LVH was addressed in THAMES (Tenormin in Hypertension and Myocardial Ischaemia Epidemiological Survey), which comprised 205 men with hypertension. Echocardiography revealed LVH (defined as a left ventricular mass index > or = 130 g m-2) in 140 patients (68%). Of these patients with LVH, myocardial ischaemia was diagnosed on exercise ECG testing in 24%, and by thallium scintigraphy in 14%. Although not proven, a logical approach would be to improve the prognosis by reversing LVH and reducing ischaemia. A recent meta-analysis has indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the most effective drugs in reversing LVH. But beta-blockers may still be a logical first choice of drug, because of their valuable anti-ischaemic properties.", 
    "236": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking drugs are widely used throughout the world, and serious adverse reactions are relatively uncommon. Many of those that do occur, including bronchospasm and peripheral ischaemia, are due primarily to blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Recently developed beta-blockers with enhanced beta 1-selectivity and partial beta 2-agonist activity appear, in general, to have lesser effects upon airways function and vascular resistance, but none are regarded as being entirely 'safe' in patients with asthma. In the treatment of hypertensive patients with co-existing airways disease there are now effective alternatives to the beta-blockers, including calcium antagonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, in the presence of ischaemic heart disease, beta-blockers have specific advantages and may still be considered necessary in patients with airways disease. In this situation, agents with beta 2-agonist activity are preferable to 'conventional' beta-blockers. However, there is still some risk that bronchospasm may occur in certain individuals, and the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta 2-agonists might be impaired. In patients with peripheral vascular disease, beta-blockers with beta 2-agonist activity are less likely to worsen the symptoms and signs of peripheral ischaemia, and may reduce the prevalence of peripheral coldness, a common adverse effect of beta-blockers. There is concern that beta-blockers may have significant central effects, including impairment of memory and concentration, although these are difficult to quantify. A number of pharmacologically unpredictable adverse reactions may occur rarely, including skin reactions, alopecia and arthropathy.",

Their amino acids were sequenced as Ser-Val-Ala-Lys-Leu-Glu-Lys for C105, Ala-Leu-Pro-His-Ala for C107, Gly-Val-Tyr-Pro-His-Lys for C111, and Ile-Arg-Pro-Val-Gln for C112. Their ACE inhibition activities were measured for synthetic peptides. The IC50 of these peptides were estimated to be 82, 79, 1.6, and 1.4 microM, respectively. Carboxyl-terminal amino acid(s) were considered to be essential for their expression of ACE inhibition for C105, C107, and C111, while the amino terminal tripeptide Ile-Arg-Pro of C112 was presumed to inhibit ACE after the removal of a dipeptide from C112 with ACE digestion. Presumed original proteins of these peptides are discussed.",

SC-52458 was a potent inhibitor of [125I]AII binding to AT1 receptors in rat adrenal cortex and uterine smooth muscle membranes (IC50 values of 2.8 and 6.9 nM, respectively). Contraction of rabbit aortic rings by AII was antagonized by SC-52458 in a competitive and reversible manner (pA2 of 8.18). SC-52458 had no effect on the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or renin in vitro. In normotensive rats, administration of SC-52458, either intravenously (i.v.) or by gavage, inhibited the pressor response to AII. Daily treatment with SC-52458 at 20, 30, and 50 mg/kg by gavage for 4 days decreased blood pressure (BP) in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Further studies in renal-artery ligated rats and sodium-deficient dogs demonstrated that oral administration of SC-52458 decreased BP and that this activity was correlated with significant plasma levels of the compound. SC-52458 is an orally active, competitive AT1-receptor antagonist with antihypertensive properties.", 
    "239": "Spiraprilat, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was compared with enalaprilat for its ability to improve left ventricular (LV) function and metabolism in anesthetized open-chest dogs with a new model of acute LV failure (ALVF) induced by embolization of the left coronary artery with 50 microns plastic microspheres followed by intravenous (i.v.) infusion of methoxamine. With this procedure, LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased from 4.2 +/- 0.7 to 12.8 +/- 1.3 mm Hg and remained at approximately 12 mm Hg throughout the experiment. Cardiac output (CO) decreased from 1.25 +/- 0.12 to 0.79 +/- 0.06 and 0.55 +/- 0.02 L/min at 30 and 90 min after methoxamine infusion, respectively. LVdP/dtmax and dP/dt/P decreased, while total peripheral resistance (TPR) increased. These hemodynamic changes indicated establishment of stable ALVF of a moderate degree. Moreover, decreases in myocardial lactate consumption and contents of creatine phosphate in the myocardium indicated the existence of moderate ischemia. The new ACE inhibitor, spiraprilat, as well as enalaprilat (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) effectively decreased mean aortic pressure (30%), LVEDP (20%), and TPR (30%) and increased stroke volume (SV) CO, and dP/dt/P. Both agents decreased myocardial oxygen consumption (20%) and caused a significant increase in myocardial creatine phosphate contents. These data indicate that the beneficial effects of both inhibitors extended not only to LV function but also to myocardial energy metabolism in ALVF.",

Eight healthy men were studied in a randomised, 4-period crossover study in which placebo, enalapril (10 mg), losartan (20 mg) and losartan (100 mg) were given double-blind on separate occasions. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during sequential infusions of ANG I, ANG II, and bradykinin into the brachial artery 4-6 h after dosing. Analysis of variance for repeated measures indicated that losartan inhibited constriction to ANG I and ANG II (both p < 0.02) in a dose-dependent manner without significantly influencing vasodilator responses to bradykinin. Enalapril (10 mg) inhibited AI similarly to losartan 100 mg without significantly influencing responses to angiotensin II, and augmented vasodilator responses to bradykinin (p < 0.0001). In human forearm vasculature, oral losartan (20-100 mg) inhibits vasoconstriction to ANG I and ANG II without significantly influencing bradykinin-induced vasodilation, whereas enalapril selectively inhibits ANG I-induced vasoconstriction while potentiating the vasodilator effect of bradykinin.",

    "242": "In a randomized double-blind study, the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerance of the imidazoline receptor agonist, moxonidine, were compared with those of the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Included in the trial were 50 ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, who were treated for 4 weeks with either 0.2-0.4 mg moxonidine, or 25-50 mg captopril daily. Both substances clearly reduced hypertension; no statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups. Under moxonidine, the mean blood pressure while seated decreased from 176/101 mm Hg to 155/91 mm Hg by the end of treatment; under captopril the corresponding figures were 170/99 and 150/89 mm Hg. Minor transient side effects, for the most part with a doubtful relationship to the treatment, were seen in 5 patients (20%) of the moxonidine group, and in 8 patients (32%) of the captopril group. Thus, in this study, moxonidine and captopril proved to have equivalent antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability.",

We have found that this compound is without effect on ACE purified from pig kidney, at a concentration some 1000-fold greater than the Ki reported for inhibition of the enzyme from lung. However, preincubation of CPP-A-A-F-pAB with neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 (E-24.11) does result in potent inhibitory effects on ACE. We have shown this to be due to formation of a fragment, CPP-A-A, the structure of which is closely related to ACE inhibitors such as enalaprilat. CPP-A-A was found to be a potent inhibitor of pig ACE. Under the conditions used it had an IC50 value of 1.6 x 10(-8) M, compared with the value obtained for captopril of 7.5 x 10(-10) M. These results have important implications for studies of E-24.15 when using CPP-A-A-F-pAB in vivo or in crude tissue extracts where E-24.11 might also be present.", 
    "244": "The complex pathology that leads to heart failure has hampered the search for optimal therapy. Even so, ACE inhibitors have become a cornerstone of treatment. After an acute MI, the goal of ACE inhibition is to limit LV remodeling and progression to ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive failure. In advanced failure, the goal is to reverse peripheral vascular changes and ameliorate symptoms.", 
    "245": "Although left ventricular (LV) dilation has been assumed to be deleterious, the physiologic significance of severe LV dilation in advanced heart failure and its impact on survival have not been defined. LV end-diastolic dimension was measured by M-mode echocardiography in 382 patients with class III or IV heart failure symptoms (mean LV ejection fraction 20 +/- 8%) referred for evaluation for cardiac transplantation. All patients underwent right-sided heart catheterization, and received vasodilator and diuretic therapy adjusted to hemodynamic goals. Although 183 patients with massive LV dilation by LV index > 4 cm/m2 (LV index = LV end-diastolic dimension/estimated body surface area) had a similar severity of hemodynamic impairment to that of 199 patients with only moderate dilation (LV index < or = 4 cm/m2), with baseline mean cardiac index of 2 liters/m/m2 and mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 26 mm Hg in both groups, their actuarial 2-year survival without transplantation was much lower (49 vs 75%; p = 0.004). In the Cox proportional-hazards model, LV index predicted total and sudden death, independent of etiology of heart failure, ejection fraction and other parameters of disease severity. Follow-up echocardiograms (mean 13 +/- 6 months) in 80 heart failure survivors without transplantation showed an increase in mean LV ejection fraction (22 +/- 8% to 26 +/- 13%), but no change in mean LV index in either the massive or moderately dilated groups. Thus, massive LV dilation is an independent contributor to poor outcome in patients with advanced heart failure, and may be stabilized by aggressive vasodilator and diuretic therapy.", 
    "246": "To test the dose responses of piretanide, ramipril, and their combination in patients with essential hypertension, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 480 patients. Twelve separate groups were studied: placebo, piretanide 3 mg, piretanide 6 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, ramipril 5 mg, ramipril 10 mg, and their combinations, as single daily morning doses. Patients were randomized after a 2-week run-in period without drugs; treatment was given for 6 weeks. A dose response compared with placebo was found for both drugs; the combination was more effective than either drug alone. Piretanide 6 mg, combined with ramipril 5 mg, provided optimal blood pressure reduction. Self-reported adverse effects of both drugs and their combinations did not exceed those reported for placebo. A surface analysis suggested that piretanide primarily reduced systolic blood pressure, whereas ramipril was more effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure. The data attest to a combined efficacy of piretanide and ramipril in decreasing arterial blood pressure.", 
    "247": "The authors examined whether changing attitudes and approaches to modifying blood pressure during the 1980s affected the previously described pattern of increasing systolic blood pressure in the elderly which continues through the ninth decade of life. In 1982-1983, a door-to-door census identified 4,497 community-dwelling residents of East Boston, Massachusetts aged 65 and over, of whom 3,657 had baseline blood pressure assessments. Follow-up blood pressure assessments occurred in 1985-1986 and in 1988-1989. Cross-sectionally, the relation of age with systolic blood pressure was quadratic with levels predicted to increase until about age 84 after which they were lower among oldest-old survivors. Longitudinally, mean age-sex-adjusted systolic blood pressure was 3.3 mmHg lower in 1985-1986 compared with 1982-1983 (95 percent confidence interval (CI) 2.4-4.2 mmHg) and 10.6 mmHg lower in 1988-1989 compared with 1982-1983 (95 percent CI 9.5-11.7 mmHg). Utilization of antihypertension medications increased over time and accounted for some, but not all, of the observed decreases in systolic blood pressure. Large shifts occurred in the use of specific antihypertension medications including increases in use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry blockers and decreases in use of thiazide diuretics. Previously described trends for increasing systolic blood pressure in the elderly were reversed during the 1980s when the continued decline in cardiovascular mortality was greatest among the elderly.", 
    "248": "The anti-ischemic properties of the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (ram) were investigated in electrically driven Langendorff hearts from rabbits whose endogenous angiotensin-I content has been previously shown to be very low (constant pressure: 70 cm H2O, Tyrode solution, Ca2+ 1.8 mmol/l). Cumulative concentration-response curves showed that the reduction in global coronary flow (CF) by exogenous angiotensin-I was concentration dependently inhibited by ram (P < 0.05). Myocardial ischemia (MI) was induced by occlusion of a left coronary artery branch and MI was quantified by NADH surface fluorescence photography. MI was significantly enlarged (+23%) (P < 0.05) by exogenous angiotensin-I (6 x 10(-9) mol/l). Addition of ram (10(-8) mol/l) to the perfusion buffer simultaneously with angiotensin-I, completely prevented the reduction of CF by angiotensin-I (P > 0.05) and significantly diminished MI even below control values (-25%) (P < 0.05). In the absence of exogenous angiotensin-I, ram alone (10(-8) mol/l) did not significantly enhance CF (P > 0.05), supporting findings demonstrating a very low endogenous angiotensin-I content in isolated rabbit hearts. However, ram alone (10(-8) mol/l) significantly diminished MI (-24%) (P < 0.05). We conclude that ram does possess direct cardioprotective properties that are independent of the inhibition of angiotensin-II generation but that may be related to potentiation of the effects of bradykinin.", 
    "249": "The metabolism of the thiol-containing drugs penicillamine (beta,beta-dimethylcysteine) and captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) involves the formation of mixed disulfides, including mixed disulfides with serum albumin. The reactions of penicillamine and captopril with serum albumin in aqueous solution and in intact human blood plasma have been studied by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Penicillamine was found to react rapidly at the albumin-cysteine mixed disulfide bond to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide and to react more slowly at other albumin disulfide bonds. The amino acid cysteine was found to react with albumin by the same two pathways. In contrast, captopril rapidly associates with albumin to form noncovalent albumin-captopril complexes. Exchange of captopril between its free and noncovalently bound forms takes place on the NMR time scale. On a longer time scale, captopril reacts with albumin by thiol/disulfide interchange reactions. Noncovalently bound captopril displaced lactate from its albumin binding sites, both in aqueous solution and in human plasma. The results demonstrate that 1H NMR is a useful method for characterizing the state of drug molecules in human plasma and for detecting and monitoring perturbations by drugs of delicately balanced binding equilibria involving endogenous small molecules and macromolecules in plasma.", 
    "250": "This review discusses the mechanisms of action of the organic nitrates, nitrate tolerance, and the effects of nitrates in patients with stable angina pectoris. The nitrates are prodrugs that enter the vascular smooth muscle, where they are denitrated to form the active agent nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylate cyclase, which results in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production and vasodilation as a result of reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. NO is identical to endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which induces vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggregation, reduces endothelium adhesion, and has anticoagulant and fibrinolytic effects. Thus, the nitrates may be more than vasodilators and, in addition to reducing ischemia, may affect the process of atherosclerosis. The vascular effects of nitrates are attenuated during sustained therapy. Although the basis for the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance is not completely understood, sulfhydryl depletion as well as neurohormonal activation and increased plasma volume may be involved. The administration of N-acetylcysteine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or diuretics do not consistently prevent nitrate tolerance. At present, intermittent nitrate therapy is the only way to avoid nitrate tolerance. The intermittent administration of nitrates, however, cannot provide continuous therapeutic benefits, and thus monotherapy with nitrates is not suitable for many patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "251": "The efficacy of nitrates versus that of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure may be evaluated based on 3 treatment aims: hemodynamic improvement, symptom relief, and survival benefit. Nitrates used in conjunction with hydralazine produce a relatively large increase in stroke volume and a prominent reduction of left ventricular filling pressure, whereas ACE inhibitors produce a comparatively modest increase in stroke volume with a prominent reduction in filling pressure. The effect of these drugs on arterial compliance has been evaluated using a modified Windkessel model of the circulation to define their mechanism of action. Nitrates appear to affect the large arteries and arterial bed as well as the venous circulation. Intermediate-term response to therapy is often evaluated by changes in exercise tolerance. A review of multicenter trials reveals that, although both ACE inhibitors and hydralazine/nitrate have favorable hemodynamic actions, the effect of hydralazine/nitrate on exercise capacity appears to be slightly better. ACE inhibitors and nitrates both may reduce dysfunctional myocardial remodeling, as evaluated in a canine model of chronic left ventricular dysfunction. The increase in the ejection fraction by these drugs and the decrease of plasma norepinephrine levels by ACE inhibitors may contribute to improved long-term survival. It appears, therefore, that the long-term benefits of nitrates and ACE inhibitors in heart failure probably relate to their ability both to affect cardiac remodelling and to relax vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "252": "A concise overview of the pharmacologic management of chronic stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction is presented. Nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium antagonists increase exercise tolerance and decrease symptoms in patients with chronic stable angina, and aspirin may prevent myocardial infarction. In unstable angina, aspirin reduces mortality; heparin may prevent myocardial infarction; and nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and heparin may decrease angina. In acute myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta blockers, and intravenous nitrates may decrease mortality, whereas calcium antagonists do not affect mortality. Intravenous magnesium may decrease the incidence of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after the acute phase of myocardial infarction may decrease mortality and prevent reinfarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.",

Pretreatment with captopril (100 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the production of Fos in cells of the SFO and OVLT but did not reduce the concentration of Fos-positive cell nuclei in the PVN and SON. The results suggest that the production of Fos in the SFO and OVLT induced by the haemorrhage is probably due to elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II.",

The fall in blood pressure tended to be greater in the elderly subjects but this is likely to be attributable to their higher initial blood pressures, although it may reflect the small differences in pharmacokinetics. 4. The age related differences in kinetics and dynamics following multiple dosing are quantitatively similar to those obtained with single doses.

    "261": "In the presence of indomethacin (10 microM) and without previous exposure to bradykinin, two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, moexiprilat and ramiprilat (0.1 microM), elicited distinct relaxation responses from preconstricted endothelium-intact but not from denuded bovine coronary artery rings, and enhanced the relaxation response to bradykinin (3 nM). All of these responses were strongly reduced by the selective B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.1 microM). Bradykinin (30 nM), moexiprilat or ramiprilat (0.3 microM) also significantly increased the cyclic GMP content of these coronary segments, an effect which was abolished by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 30 microM) or by removal of the endothelium. L-NNA also strongly reduced the relaxation response to moexiprilat but only partially inhibited that to bradykinin, demonstrating that the ACE inhibitor-induced relaxation was predominantly mediated by endothelial NO release, whereas bradykinin acted in part through another endothelium-dependent mechanism. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitors induce endothelium-dependent relaxation presumably by facilitating the accumulation of endothelium-derived vasoactive kinins in or at the vessel wall. This local mechanism may significantly contribute to the dilator action of these compounds in vivo.",

In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the hemodynamic profile and catecholamine response at rest, during isometric, mental, and orthostatic stresses were compared before and 12 weeks after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or calcium channel blockade. Antihypertensive therapy was titrated either with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril (10 to 40 mg; n = 9) or with the calcium antagonist isradipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 10) until diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg was achieved. Groups were comparable in race, sex, body mass index, pretreatment mean arterial pressure and response to isometric stress (25% increase in mean arterial pressure) before treatment. At rest, total peripheral resistance was reduced to the same extent (18%) in both groups. After fosinopril, the percent increase in stroke volume was higher and heart rate lower than with isradipine. During isometric stress, the percent increase in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output was higher, with isradipine (p < 0.05) reaching pretreatment levels. Plasma catecholamines were also higher with isradipine (p < 0.05), increasing by 100% with plasma norepinephrine compared with 16% before treatment. During orthostatic stress significant reductions in mean arterial pressure and stroke volume were observed after isradipine but not after fosinopril. Neither medication significantly modified the response to mental stress. Our data suggest that despite a comparable reduction in total peripheral resistance at rest, fosinopril preserves a more physiologic hemodynamic response to isometric and orthostatic stress than isradipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "271": "Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was developed approximately 15 years ago as a novel therapeutic approach to hypertension. Although ACE inhibitor therapy was initially reserved for patients with severe hypertension, extensive clinical experience has broadened its use. These agents should now be considered as cornerstone therapy for patients with symptomatic heart failure and are of proved value in preventing the development of this syndrome. This article reviews the key studies that have documented the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in improving clinical outcome for patients with overt congestive heart failure, as well as for those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "272": "The onset of heart failure is associated with complex neurohumoral, cardiac, and vascular changes. These disorders partly explain that, in this situation, regional distribution of blood flows is hardly modified with stability or increase in heart and brain flows and impairement of limb, renal, and splanchnic blood flows. Using the bidimensional Doppler technique to measure brachial blood flow and diameter and standard clearance techniques to determine renal and hepatic blood flows, we studied the effects of perindopril, a long-lasting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on regional hemodynamics. We demonstrated that perindopril produces a very marked increase in forearm and kidney flows but a very minor increase in the hepatosplanchnic territory, resulting in a regional distribution of cardiac output that favors the renal and musculocutaneous territories. This mechanism of action might be an important contribution to clinical improvement observed with perindopril.", 
    "273": "Diaphragmatic function was investigated in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster (CSH) from the dilated Bio 53:58 strain, after long-term therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. Twenty-two 1-month old CSHs were treated during a 5-month period by either oral gavage with perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). Control hamsters from the F1B strain received placebo (n = 7). Mechanical properties were studied in isolated diaphragm strips electrically stimulated in both twitch and tetanic conditions. Compared with F1B control hamsters, peak active tension and positive (+dP/dtmax) and negative (-dP/dtmax) peaks of isometric tension derivative were significantly depressed in placebo treated CSHs. Compared with placebo-treated CSHs, peak active tension was significantly higher in perindopril-treated CSHs in both twitch (25 +/- 4 vs 16 +/- 1 mN/mm2; p < 0.01) and tetanus modes (56 +/- 4 vs 38 +/- 2 mN/mm2; p < 0.01). Moreover, +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax were improved significantly in twitch (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively) and tetanus modes (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). We conclude that, in the CSH, long-term therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril helped to preserve the diaphragmatic function.",

Cardiac output and regional blood flows were measured by microsphere technique; the tone of the venous vessels was determined as mean circulatory filling pressure in conscious, freely moving rats. Perindoprilat evoked a much more prominent increase in kidneys, adrenal glands, intestine, and skin blood flows in embolized rats than in sham-operated rats. The differences between the effects of long-term treatment with perindopril in sham-operated and embolized rats were highly significant. Mean circulatory filling pressure was decreased by short-term and long-term administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It is concluded that venous vessels could be one of the target sites for the effects of perindopril-like drugs.", 
    "275": "The success of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates has led to a reexamination of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in pathophysiology. Ventricular dysfunction leading to congestive cardiac failure is associated with sequential activation of the sympathetic system and increases in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide; however, increases in plasma renin and aldosterone do not occur until very late. The renin-angiotensin system is now regarded as both a circulating and tissue hormonal system. All components of the renin-angiotensin system have been detected in the heart. ACE is localized in discrete areas of the heart, including the cardiac valves, coronary vessels, atria, and myocardium. After experimental myocardial infarction in the rat, although plasma renin and aldosterone levels are not increased, ACE in the myocardium is markedly increased. Treatment with ACE inhibitors suppresses cardiac ACE and is associated with hemodynamic improvement, reversal of the neurohumoral activation, prevention of ventricular dilatation, and remodeling and reduction in mortality rates. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in treating congestive cardiac failure, preventing ventricular remodeling, and regressing left ventricular hypertrophy may involve not only reducing preload and afterload but also suppressing the local cardiac renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "276": "Retrospective analysis of precaptopril and postcaptopril DTPA renograms from 88 hypertensive patients was performed to refine the quantitative criteria used to diagnose renal artery stenosis (RAS). Of the 88 patients, 45 had RAS and 43 had normal renal arteries at angiography. Using time-activity curves from the essential hypertensive group, diagnostic washout criteria for a positive DTPA renogram were developed. These were based on the 20 and 30 min/peak activity ratios in each kidney. When the washout criteria were retrospectively applied to patient data as a whole, sensitivity and specificity for RAS were 67% and 79%, respectively. When previously described uptake criteria, based on the time to peak activity in each kidney and the GFR ratio between the kidneys, were applied to the same data, sensitivity and specificity for RAS were 89% and 84%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the DTPA renogram using the time to peak and GFR ratio was both sensitive and specific for RAS. Measurement of 20 and 30 min/peak renal activity ratios did not improve the accuracy of the test.",

Heart rate did not change on any of the therapies. Enalapril reduced blood pressure mainly through a reduction in total peripheral resistance (delta -3.0 PRU100; CI -5.6, -0.4) while hydrochlorothiazide reduced blood pressure mainly through a reduction in cardiac output (delta -0.8 l/min-1; CI -1.5, -0.07). Minimal vascular resistance (mean of right and left hand) displayed a significant time x treatment interaction indicating a different trend with enalapril than hydrochlorothiazide with a change of -0.12 PRU100 (CI -0.33, 0.05) on enalapril and a change of 0.14 (CI -0.29, 0.56) on hydrochlorothiazide.

We have shown earlier that the thyroid hormone analogue 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) binds to nuclear receptors, alters transcription of T3-responsive genes, and increases +dP/dtmax in hypothyroid rats with substantially less effect on heart rate and metabolism than thyroid hormone, which makes it a selective cardiotonic agent.", 
    "283": "To determine whether DITPA might be useful in treating heart failure, we compared chronic treatment with normal saline, captopril (2 g/L), or the combination of DITPA (375 micrograms/100 g) and captopril (2 g/L) in Sprague-Dawley rats beginning 3 weeks after coronary artery ligation. Both DITPA/captopril and captopril treatment decreased LV end-diastolic pressure compared with controls (21 +/- 2 and 26 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, vs 34 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < .05 for each). The addition of DITPA to captopril produced a 36% increase in resting cardiac index (P < .05) and shifted the cardiac function curve upward and to the left, indicative of enhanced myocardial performance. Also, DITPA/captopril compared with captopril treatment or control produced an increase in the rate of LV relaxation, as manifested by a decrease in tau, the time constant of LV pressure decline (17.5 +/- 1.0 vs 22.2 +/- 1.7 milliseconds, P < .05) and a larger absolute value for -dP/dtmax (-4561 +/- 361 vs -3346 +/- 232 mm Hg/s, P < .05). These changes occurred without changes in heart rate, LV mass, LV systolic pressure, or peripheral resistance relative to captopril treatment (P > .05).",

Use of a cardiotonic analogue of thyroid hormone represents a new approach to improving LV performance and may be a useful adjunct to afterload reduction for the treatment of heart failure.",

The effects of cilazapril were assessed in four experimental groups: normotensive rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats, hypertensive rats with a renal artery stenosis induced by clipping (two-kidney, one-clip rats), and hypertensive rats with uninephrectomy, high salt intake, and administration of deoxycorticosterone (DOCA). In parallel groups of rats, measurement of plasma renin activity was made in order to characterize (at least at the plasma level) the status of the RAS. As expected, renal artery stenosis markedly increased plasma renin activity, and DOCA decreased it to undetectable levels. Cilazapril had a marked preventive effect on neointima formation in normotensive rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats, and two-kidney, one-clip rats but was ineffective in DOCA rats.",

The glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, KW/BW, mean glomerular volume, wide glomerular basement membrane, glomerular mesangial cell proliferation as well as the ratio of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 of kidney tissue in the diabetic rats were significantly increased than those in the non-diabetic rats. These indexes were not significantly different between groups with and without captopril treatment. The results mentioned above illustrated that the obvious renal injury in diabetic rats receiving unilateral nephrectomy could be found as early as in the 3rd month of the experiment. These changes might be related to the metabolic abnormality of glucose and prostaglandins in the kidney and no effect of low dose captopril were noted on the renal injury.",

The effect of lisinopril, a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), injected into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) on water intake was investigated in male Holtzman rats (200-250 g). 2. Injection of lisinopril (2 micrograms/microliters) into the MPOA abolished the water intake induced by subcutaneous (sc) injection of isoprenaline (100%) and water deprivation (90%) and drastically reduced the water intake induced by sc injection of polyethyleneglycol (60%). A small reduction of water intake induced by lisinopril was also observed 90 and 120 min after sc hypertonic saline (N = 10 for each group). 3.

In order to study the effect of such supplements upon patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) we studied a group of 23 patients with the salient characteristics of IDC (18 male, 5 female; mean age 51 +/- 13 years [range: 23-72]; Mg group), who received oral magnesium supplements (15 mmol/day). All patients received oral ACE inhibitors and 22 were receiving digitalis and diuretics. A control group of 27 patients, matched for age, sex, symptoms, and additional treatment (22 male, 5 female; mean age 52 +/- 13 years [range 22-71]) were not given oral magnesium supplements. All these patients also received oral ACE inhibitors, 25 were receiving digitalis, and 23 were receiving diuretics. Mean serum magnesium concentration (total serum Mg) in the Mg group was 0.83 +/- 0.06 mmol/litre [mean +/- SD, range 0.69-0.99], while in the control group it was 0.83 +/- 0.07 mmol/litre [range 0.70-0.96], P = NS. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) improved from 32 +/- 11 per cent [range 13-51] to 42 +/- 14 per cent [range 15-66] in the Mg group and from 30 +/- 13 per cent [range 10-52] to 42 +/- 11 per cent [range: 25-64] in the control group. We found that physiological oral Mg supplements did not influence serum magnesium, LV-EF, or prognosis. Furthermore, we found that 56 per cent of all patients improved when subjected to strict guidance and therapy with ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics.",

In all three classifications there were no statistically significant differences between the incidences in placebo and combined active treatment groups, or between those in the two quinapril groups. No associated serious adverse events were reported. In the low-risk population studied, it would appear that the incidence of first-dose hypotension with quinapril is similar to placebo and is not dose-related.",

Differences in the chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the two converting enzyme inhibitors ruled out class-related effects. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and plasma levels of Ang I and Ang II were the same in vehicle-treated WKY and SHR. In contrast, plasma levels of both Ang(1-7) and vasopressin in SHR were 3.7-fold and 2.6-fold higher, respectively (p < 0.05). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduced the blood pressure of WKY and SHR, and augmented their intake of water and output of urine. These changes were associated with increases in renin activity and plasma levels of Ang I and Ang(1-7). In both WKY and SHR, lisinopril had a greater effect in inhibiting plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ACE, reducing levels of plasma angiotensinogen, and increasing the concentrations of authentic Ang II. The principal finding of this study is that plasma Ang(1-7) is the sole component of the circulating angiotensin system that is elevated in the established phase of genetic hypertension. The finding that chronic inhibition of ACE augments circulating levels of Ang(1-7) evidenced the existence of functional pathways for the alternate processing of Ang I.", 
    "293": "We examined the effects of captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and phosphoramidon (a selective enkephalinase inhibitor) on Tyr-Gly-Gly production during Met-enkephalin hydrolysis in plasma samples taken from individual outbred Swiss-Webster and inbred C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Discriminant analysis procedures identified three distinct plasma profiles of Tyr-Gly-Gly production in all strains of mice: a captopril-sensitive/phosphoramidon-insensitive profile, a captopril-insensitive/phosphoramidon-sensitive profile, and a moderate captopril and phosphoramidon sensitivity profile. The abilities of captopril and phosphoramidon to inhibit Tyr-Gly-Gly production in the same mouse plasma sample were highly inversely correlated (r = -0.938). Plasma of Swiss-Webster mice whose cages and bedding had been changed 24 h prior to sample collection was significantly more likely to exhibit the captopril-sensitive/phosphoramidon-insensitive profile than the plasma of mice whose cages/bedding had not been changed for at least 5 days. The results suggest that environmental novelty may dramatically alter the activity of a plasma dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase system, and thereby regulate behavioral and physiological responses to novel experiences.", 
    "294": "1. Nephrotoxicity was induced in rats by injecting gentamicin intramuscularly (i.m.) at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 days. Treated animals demonstrated a typical pattern of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity characterized histopathologically by necrosis of proximal tubular epithelium, and biochemically by increased serum creatinine and urea concentrations. Reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in renal cortex was significantly decreased by gentamicin. 2. Simultaneous treatment of rats with gentamicin and either captopril or diltiazem significantly potentiated the gentamicin-induced increases in serum creatinine and urea and did not significantly affect the gentamicin-induced decrease in cortical GSH concentration. 3. Concomitant treatment with gentamicin and either Ca2+ or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate decreased serum urea level, did not significantly affect serum creatinine concentration, and significantly increased cortical GSH concentration in comparison to the values of these parameters following gentamicin treatment. 4. Histopathologically, the severity of gentamicin-induced renal damage was exacerbated by captopril, and even more so by diltiazem. Simultaneous treatment with gentamicin and either Ca2+ or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate produced only mild focal atrophy of renal tubular epithelium. Control rats had apparently normal histology. 5. In conclusion, captopril and diltiazem, at the doses used, significantly potentiated gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity to a broadly similar extent. Although Ca2+ and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, at the doses used, reduced significantly the severity of some of the manifestations of nephrotoxicity, they were equally ineffective in completely preventing the development of nephrotoxicity.",

To assess the efficacy and safety of ramipril in a large cross-section of patients, we conducted a multicenter, open-label, prospective study, in which 591 men or women with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 and < or = 114 mmHg) received ramipril on a regimen of 1.25 to 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Forty-one percent of the patients required 2.5 mg and 81% required < or = 5 mg once daily at study completion. Compared with baseline, ramipril reduced mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 19.9/14.7 mmHg (P < 0.001/P < 0.001). Ramipril reduced diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mmHg or by at least 10 mmHg in 84.1% of the patients. Response rates were similar regardless of age, gender, and race. No patient stopped ramipril because of an adverse event or experienced an unexpected adverse event. In our real-world study, low-dose ramipril given once daily controlled blood pressure in most patients and was well tolerated.", 
    "296": "Necrosis of the femoral head and osteopenia were examined histopathologically in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) aged 6 to 36 weeks and compared with that of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Avascular necrosis of the femoral head was frequently observed, mainly in the young SHRSPs and SHRs (about 8 to 15 weeks of age). SHRSPs had the highest incidence of femoral head necrosis among the three strains. This necrotic change in the femoral head was considered to be secondary ischemia induced by angiospasm or arteriosclerosis, similar to the disorders observed in the brain, kidney, and heart in SHRSPs. However, the complication occurred in spite of treatment with antihypertensive agents (ACE inhibitor: enalapril, spirapril) even though other ischemic disorders such as brain hemorrhage and renal infarction were prevented, indicating that the femoral head necrosis in SHRSPs was not due to hypertensive complications induced by angiospasm or arteriosclerosis. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral bone was significantly lower in SHRSPs, and the femoral heads in this strain were the most easily deformed by loads applied during compression tests. Histopathologically, the infarctions were encountered on the lateral side of the epiphysis, but no thrombi were observed. The lateral side of the epiphysis is the anatomic site where the weight load is greatest and the site where the nutritive artery enters. Our results strongly suggest that the coexistence of vulnerable bone matrix and physical weight load to the nutritive artery plays a crucial role in the occurrence of femoral head necrosis in SHRSPs, whether based on generalized or localized osteopenia.",

The total numbers of cells per glomerulus and of mesangial or endothelial cells, as well as nuclear volumes of mesangial cells and the total capillary length per glomerulus, were all significantly higher after subtotal nephrectomy.

Myocardial protein, RNA and myocardial collagen content were reduced proportionately in all treatment groups in SHR, but not in WKY rats. DNA remained unchanged in all groups. Increased right ventricular mass was produced by amlodipine in both SHR and WKY rats (SHR +11.3%; WKY +9.8%), but this was prevented by cotreatment with benazepril. Right ventricular protein and collagen increased significantly with amlodipine in SHR but not WKY rats, and there were no changes in right ventricular RNA and DNA contents in either strain. Amlodipine improved, benazepril impaired and the combination of both agents maintained left ventricular pumping ability when pressure was increased abruptly to pretreatment levels in WKY rats. In contrast, when afterload was increased abruptly in SHR to pretreatment levels, neither amlodipine nor benazepril affected pumping ability, although it was enhanced by the combination.", 
    "304": "These data demonstrate that amlodipine, benazepril and their combination reduced left ventricular mass in SHR. This reversal of LVH was associated with proportional reductions in mycotic protein, RNA and collagen, but not DNA. Therefore, it seems unlikely that LVH reversal with these agents was associated with increased fibrous tissue or impaired left ventricular performance. Finally, addition of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prevents the increase in right ventricular mass produced by the calcium antagonist.", 
    "305": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in pregnancy has been associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of renal dysfunction likely is related to fetal hypotension and prolonged decreased glomerular filtration. Six of 14 previously published cases of neonatal renal failure after maternal ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in death. Eight infants survived after peritoneal dialysis, some with residual renal impairment. Serum lisinopril levels and ACE activity in our patient indicate that during the anuric state the drug has an extremely prolonged half-life, and that it is removed by peritoneal dialysis. In view of this prolonged half-life and the drug's continued suppression of ACE activity and renal function, we recommend institution of early dialysis in infants with renal failure after maternal therapy with lisinopril.",

Although these compensatory responses may provide some short-term restoration of function, their long-term consequences actually may increase morbidity and mortality. Several agents have established roles in the treatment of these patients, whereas others, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have yet to be investigated thoroughly. Results of two trials investigating the role of ACE inhibition after MI seem to provide sufficient data to warrant the use of these drugs in certain patient populations. These results are promising, but further investigation is necessary to answer key questions arising from these trials.", 
    "307": "We report on four patients with hemodynamic brain infarction and pathological circadian blood pressure patterns with nocturnal hypotension which gave rise to a prolonged disturbance of the blood-brain barrier. Besides at least one severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, there was an untreated chronic arterial hypertension and a pathologically reduced vasomotor reactivity after CO2 stimulation in all patients. The 24-h blood pressure monitoring then carried out showed a distinctly pathological circadian profile with hypertensive day values and nocturnal hypotension with minimum values of 95/50 mm Hg. The range of variation between day and night values was significantly raised (systolic: 20% +/- 2.15%; diastolic: 22.9% +/- 2.58%) compared to patients with essential hypertension as well as normotensive subjects (P < 0.01), and was in excess of 40% in the individual case. There was a slow recovery of the blood-brain barrier after drug-induced normalization of the pathological circadian blood pressure profile. We conclude that the registration of circadian blood pressure patterns may be of prognostic and therapeutic relevance. It may also contribute to further clarification of the pathophysiological significance of blood pressure variability for the development of brain infarction.",

Eighty hypertensive subjects with mild cognitive impairment, aged over 70 years were drawn from a community screening programme and randomized to either captopril 12.5 mg twice daily or bendrofluazide 2.5 mg daily in a double-blind trial. Subjects were excluded if they had previously received antihypertensive treatment or had significant cardiac disease. Electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded and scored at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Mean blood pressure fell significantly and equally in both treatment groups. Most ECG variables remained unchanged throughout the trial but a significant reduction in QRS duration from 0.08 to 0.07 seconds was observed with captopril at 12 weeks (p = 0.004) and 24 weeks (p = 0.002). Subjects on captopril also exhibited a significant improvement in overall ECG classification at 12 weeks (p < 0.05), although this was not sustained at 24 weeks (p = 0.076).

Intraperitoneal injection of captopril in doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg decreased the number of coughs dose-dependently. Although the peak effect was similar to that of morphine (0.5 mg/kg), the duration of captopril's effect (10 mg/kg) was longer than that of morphine. Furthermore, while pretreatment with naloxone significantly decreased the duration of the antitussive effect of captopril, it had no significant effect on the early-phase (within 60 min) effect of captopril. These results suggest that the mechanism which underlies the antitussive effect of captopril involves mediation by both nonopioid and opioid systems.", 
    "310": "To elucidate the involvement of angiotensin in puerperal hypertension with and without preeclampsia in the course of prior pregnancy, we measured plasma angiotensin I levels and serum placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP) activities in several puerperal hypertensive patients. Placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP) activities of puerperal hypertensive patients with severe preeclampsia during prior pregnancy were equal to or somewhat lower levels than those in normal puerperal women after a normal pregnancy. However, their angiotensin I levels were higher than those in normal puerperal women after a normal pregnancy. In puerperal hypertensive patients with and without preeclampsia during prior pregnancy, P-LAP activities tended to show much lower levels that those in normal puerperal women, while angiotensin I levels tended to show much higher levels than those in normal puerperal women, respectively. Since serum placental leucine aminopeptidase acts as an angiotensinase via degradation of angiotensin III (A-III), our present data suggest the involvement of angiotensin in puerperal hypertension.", 
    "311": "Clinical research in the therapeutics of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) has evolved from simple case reports and general-response studies in the 1960s to large, randomized, controlled trials conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s. Cumulatively, the investigations show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve clinical status, exercise capacity, and survival; digoxin augments exercise capacity and, probably, clinical status, with unknown effects on survival; the vasodilator combination hydralazine-nitrate improves survival, and perhaps clinical status and exercise capacity; and the new vasodilator flosequinan has a favorable effect on clinical status and exercise capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of mortality at 100 mg/day (this agent has subsequently been withdrawn voluntarily by the manufacturer from clinical use). Advances in study design and methodology, combined with the outcomes of major clinical trials, have resulted in new challenges in the investigation of CHF in humans. To date, only the ACE inhibitors have been shown to affect all of the major CHF therapeutic end points in a positive manner. Is it reasonable to expect similar results from all future drug interventions? If not, which end points should be targeted? Must the survival end point be investigated for all CHF drugs under development? Can studies be performed ethically without background ACE inhibitor therapy? Have the optimum duration and methods for therapeutic trials in humans been determined? Should controlled trials of nonhemodynamic and nonneurohormonal interventions (e.g., anticoagulation, magnesium, exercise regimens) be performed? How can the results of clinical trials best be applied in treating the broad range of patients encountered in practice?(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "312": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) causes disabling symptoms and increases the likelihood of decreased survival. Diuretics, direct vasodilators, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be used to reduce symptoms, prolong life, or both, in these individuals. Diuretics induce sodium and water excretion, leading to decreased cardiac preload and wall tension, and an effective decrease of symptomatic pulmonary and systemic congestion. They have not yet been shown to prolong life in patients with CHF, however. Direct vasodilators, which induce venodilation, arterial dilation, or both (balanced vasodilators), may improve symptoms, and some but not all prolong life. Venodilators, such as nitrates, exert a venous pooling effect, decreasing cardiac preload and symptoms of congestion. Arterial dilators, such as hydralazine, decrease afterload and improve cardiac output. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate provides balanced vasodilation. It also improves survival, but is associated with a relatively high frequency of side effects necessitating discontinuation of one or both agents. The drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure. Flosequinan, a new orally administered, long-acting, balanced arteriovenous dilator, improves exercise tolerance and symptoms. However, preliminary analysis of data from a large, multicenter trial revealed increased mortality and hospitalization for worsening CHF. The drug has recently been withdrawn from the market. The ACE inhibitors can cause hemodynamic and neurohormonal changes that lead to a reduction of preload and afterload, decreasing symptoms of heart failure. They significantly decrease CHF mortality, and might also deter the development of overt heart failure in some asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "313": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) has been shown to lower urinary protein excretion in human renal disease. The mechanism of this antiproteinuric effect is hypothesized to be mediated by changes in renal hemodynamics. However, clinical studies suggest that the effect on renal hemodynamics is fully established immediately after the start of treatment, whereas others show the antiproteinuric effect to reach maximum only after several weeks. To clarify this issue we studied the course of renal hemodynamics, blood pressure and proteinuria during 28 days of ACEi (enalapril 10 mg oid) in nine patients with proteinuria due to non-diabetic renal disease. The effect of ACEi on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics was already maximal within few hours after start of treatment, and remained stable thereafter: MAP was lowered with 8.6 +/- 1.9%, 10.6 +/- 2.1%, 12.8 +/- 2.3% and 12.9 +/- 2.5%, while FF fell 23.0 +/- 2.0%, 17.0 +/- 2.6%, 16.8 +/- 2.8% and 15.9 +/- 4.0% on days 1, 7, 14 and 28 of ACEi, respectively. However, the antiproteinuric effect only gradually reached its maximum on day 28. Urinary protein excretion decreased with 10.9 +/- 6.1%, 32.7 +/- 6.2%, 46.3 +/- 2.5% and 54.0 +/- 2.5% on days 1, 7, 14 and 28 of ACEi, respectively. After drug withdrawal all parameters returned towards baseline.

    "314": "We studied the effects of interruption of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rats that were volume depleted by water deprivation for 48 hours (AWD) with/without furosemide (AWD + F), a condition known to activate RAS. Following baseline micropuncture, AWD rats (N = 6) were treated with a specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AIIRA; 4 mg/kg body wt bolus i.v. and then continuous infusion) and glomerular hemodynamics compared to those obtained during angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (ACEI; 24 mg/kg bolus i.v. and then continuous infusion). Systemic blood pressure decreased equally following AIIRA and ACEI. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) increased from baseline following AIIRA (24 nl/min vs. 30, P < 0.025). While a decrease in efferent arteriolar resistance (RE) reduced glomerular capillary pressure (PGC; 67 mm Hg vs. 60, P < 0.05), this change in RE together with decrease in afferent arteriolar resistance (RA), enhanced glomerular plasma flow rate (QA; 80 nl/min vs. 111). Antagonizing angiotensin II receptor increased QA which, together with the tendency to increase glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, served to improve glomerular filtration. By contrast, although inhibition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme caused greater vasodilatation, no increase in SNGFR occurred. The lack of response in filtration after ACEI was due to a further fall in PGC to 52 mm Hg (P < 0.01 vs. AIIRA), reflecting profound reduction in RE. Since ACEI but not AIIRA potentiates bradykinin activity we examined effects of a specific bradykinin antagonist (Hoe).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "315": "A double-blind, crossover study was carried out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of the long-acting ACE inhibitor trandolapril 1 mg administered once daily and 0.5 mg twice daily in 31 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After randomization, patients entered a single-blind placebo period of 4 weeks. After a double-blind treatment of 4 weeks with either of the dosage regimens, patients were then crossed over to the alternate regimen for the last 4 weeks of the study. Conventional BP and heart rate were measured on each visit and ambulatory BP monitoring was done at baseline and at the end of each treatment phase. Conventional as well as 24-hour and awake ambulatory systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly (P < 0.001) and almost identically decreased by both once- and twice-daily formulations. Moreover, the clinical response rates (reduction in seated diastolic BP > or = 10% or diastolic BP < or = 90 mm Hg) were similar with both treatment regimens (42% vs. 45% with the once- and twice-daily formulations, respectively). However, trandolapril twice daily exerted a significantly (P = 0.03) greater antihypertensive effect on systolic BP during sleep as compared with the once-daily formulation. Due to the fact that the minimal effective dose was used in this trial, further studies with higher doses should demonstrate effective 24-hour control of BP as described with other long-acting ACE inhibitors. In addition, our results suggest that ambulatory BP measurements should be done in dose-response studies.", 
    "316": "Life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the main reason for sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease. In the majority of survivors of cardiac arrest, malignant tachyarrhythmias generate from a structurally fixed arrhythmogenic substrate following myocardial infarction without evidence of acute ischaemia. Thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction improves the electrical stability as elucidated by electrophysiological studies and the signal averaged surface ECG. In post-infarction patients, beta-blockers provide significantly beneficial effects on arrhythmic outcome, particularly in the presence of impaired left ventricular function, whereas calcium antagonists and vasodilators are of no affect or may worsen the prognosis. In survivors of myocardial infarction, the prophylactic use of class I antiarrhythmic agents, which are able to suppress frequent single or complex premature ventricular contractions, cause worsening of the prognosis due to their proarrhythmic properties. However, arrhythmia suppression by antiarrhythmic agents selects patients who are at very low risk for arrhythmic death. Pilot trials using class III antiarrhythmic agents suggest beneficial effect on the reduction of sudden death mortality. As regards secondary prevention of malignant tachyarrhythmias in survivors of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, there is controversy about the importance of Holter monitoring or invasive electrophysiological testing in the evaluation of drug efficacy. In patients with severely impaired left ventricular function, pharmacological treatment is of limited efficacy. Even in cases of significant suppression of spontaneous or inducible tachyarrhythmias documented by Holter recording or programmed ventricular stimulation, the arrhythmic outcome is considerably poorer, but it could be influenced by implantable defibrillators. Amiodarone, as a potential alternative to class I antiarrhythmic agents, particularly in patients refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, shows only limited effects on long-term outcome, which is in part caused by the toxicity of this agent. There is substantial need for new drugs without proarrhythmic properties and particularly for those that correct abnormalities of the automatic nervous system.",

The pattern of arrhythmic complications, especially atrial ectopic beats, ventricular ectopic beats and the brief salvoes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which are characteristic of the condition, suggest that triggered automaticity is a more likely arrhythmia mechanism than reentry. Although treatment with 'conventional' antiarrhythmic agents has an important place, drugs which alter myocardial loading conditions (and thus, thereby, a possible mechanism of triggered automaticity) may be effective. Therapeutic strategies directed against the basic disease processes are in an early stage of clinical development but they hold great promise for the future.",

Free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and Mg2+ ([Mg2+]i) were measured in peripheral lymphocytes from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at the age of 5, 7 and 17 weeks, from various antihypertensive agents-treated SHRSP, and from secondary hypertensive WKY. 2. At the age of 5 weeks, no difference was observed in systolic blood pressure (SBP), or lymphocyte [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i between SHRSP and WKY. At the age of 7 or 17 weeks, SBP and [Ca2+]i of SHRSP were significantly higher than in WKY, and at the age of 17 weeks, [Mg2+]i of SHRSP was significantly lower than in WKY. Further, [Ca2+]i or [Mg2+]i was positively or negatively correlated to SBP, and [Mg2+]i was negatively correlated to [Ca2+]i. 3. SBP of SHRSP fell significantly after antihypertensive treatment with calcium antagonist, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or hydralazine for 40 days. [Ca2+]i was significantly lower in calcium antagonist and hydralazine groups, and tended to be low in ACE inhibitor group. These four groups showed no difference in [Mg2+]i. 4. After 40-day administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), WKY developed severe hypertension, but there were no significant differences in lymphocyte [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i between the L-NNA treated and non-treated groups. 5. These results suggested that increased lymphocyte [Ca2+]i and decreased [Mg2+]i observed in SHRSP are not only secondary to hypertension but possibly related to a basic genetic abnormality of divalent cation handling.", 
    "319": "1. In pithed rats, preganglionic vagal nerve stimulation (at 5 Hz) elicited a bradycardia. This bradycardia was potentiated by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) by about 40%. Subsequent angiotensin II infusion (0.03 micrograms kg-1 min-1) reversed this effect. A similar facilitatory effect was also seen with the angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan (10 mg kg-1, i.v.). These results suggest a tonic inhibitory effect of endogenous angiotensin II on vagal transmission. 2. The effect of captopril in potentiating vagal bradycardia appears to be at the level of vagal neurones, since the bradycardia elicited by the muscarinic agonist, methacholine was unaffected. 3. After the pithed rats were nephrectomized, captopril had no effect on vagally-induced bradycardia, suggesting that the formation of the endogenous angiotensin II responsible for the effect was dependent on renin release from the kidney. 4. When the sympathetic nerves of the pithed rat were electrically stimulated there was a tachycardia, and this was unaffected by captopril. However, when the sympathetic and vagus nerves were activated concurrently, the resulting tachycardia was inhibited by captopril. 5. In pithed guinea-pigs, captopril also potentiated the bradycardia caused by vagal nerve stimulation. This appears to be a tissue-selective effect since the bronchoconstriction due to the vagal stimulation was not affected by captopril. 6. These results suggest that endogenous angiotensin II can have a tonic inhibitory effect on cardiac vagal transmission. Disruption of this mechanism by anti-angiotensin drugs may attenuate the reflex tachycardia associated with the fall in blood pressure in anti-hypertensive therapy.",

This study was designed to investigate the role of bradykinin (BK), as well as the subtype of BK receptors involved, in formalin-induced hindpaw pain in the mouse by use of selective B1 and B2 receptor antagonists. In addition, we have analysed whether or not BK may be involved in formalin-induced hindpaw oedema in the mouse. 2. The pretreatment of animals with captopril (2 and 5 mg kg-1, s.c.) significantly increase the first and the second phases of formalin-induced pain. 3. Co-injection of the selective B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9[Leu8]-BK (0.2-0.4 nmol/paw), together with formalin, caused graded and similar inhibitions of both phases of formalin-induced pain. Similar results were obtained with the B2 antagonists NPC 349 (D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,8-D-Phe7]-BK) and NPC 567 (D-Arg[Hyp3, D-Phe7]-BK) (0.2 and 0.6 nmol/paw). Higher concentrations of these antagonists (1 nmol/paw) failed to antagonize formalin-induced pain. 4. The new potent and selective B2 receptor antagonists, Hoe 140 (D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK), NPC 17731 (D-Arg[Hyp3, trans-4-propoxy-D-proline (transpropyl)7, Oic8]-BK), and NPC 17761 (D-Arg[Hyp3, trans-4-propoxy-D-proline (trans thiophenyl)7, Oic8]-BK) (0.02 to 1.0 nmol/paw), also caused significant inhibitions of both phases of formalin-induced pain. When Hoe 140 was injected subcutaneously 30 min before formalin injection (9.9 and 99 nmol kg-1), it significantly attenuated both phases of formalin-induced pain. The putative non-peptide BK antagonist, MV 8612 (1.6 to 9.6 nmol/paw), but not MV 8608 (5.5 to 33 nmol/paw), caused a graded inhibition of both phases of formalin induced pain, being, however, more active against the first phase.5. The pretreatment of animals with morphine (2.6 to 13 micromol kg-1, s.c.) caused dose-dependent and equipotent inhibitions of both phases of formalin-induced pain. In contrast, in domethacin (2.7 to 27 micromol kg-1) antagonized only the second phase of formalin-induced pain.6. The B2 receptor antagonists, Hoe 140, NPC 17731, NPC 17761, NPC 349 and NPC 567, all caused a significant inhibition of formalin-induced hindpaw oedema. A similar inhibition was also observed within domethacin but not with captopril or morphine.7. Our results provide strong evidence for the important role of endogenous BK, acting through both B1 and B2 receptors, in the genesis of both phases of formalin-induced persistent pain in the mouse. In addition, the current results also demonstrate that the inflammatory oedema associated with the later phase of formalin-induced pain seems to be mediated by endogenous BK, via activation of B2 receptors.", 
    "321": "We examined the mechanisms whereby phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated rabbit peritoneal neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)] altered endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (EC). PMA or PMN alone had no effect on ACE activity. When PMN were coincubated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 4 h in Earle's salt solution, endothelial ACE activity was decreased by 87%. No EC cytotoxicity was observed at this time as determined by 51Cr release from prelabeled EC. Activated PMN-mediated decreased ACE activity was inhibited by catalase (2,000 U/ml) but not by superoxide dismutase (300 U/ml). The decrease in ACE activity was also inhibited by the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea (5 mM) but not mannitol (5 mM), which does not cross cell membranes. Pretreatment of EC with the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate (1-10 mM) for 4 h attenuated the PMN-mediated decrease in ACE activity, as did the thiol reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM), and the myeloperoxidase inhibitor, cyanide (5 mM), but not azide (1-50 mM). Treatment with the proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with human alpha-antitrypsin, or with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine had no effect on PMN-mediated ACE dysfunction. These results suggest that PMN-mediated ACE dysfunction may be due to the production of hydrogen peroxide by PMN and its subsequent conversion into hydroxyl radicals.", 
    "322": "Immunosuppression of recipients of renal transplants with azathioprine has been associated with two major side effects: hepatotoxicity and myelotoxicity, mainly in the form of leukopenia. Reports of isolated anemia in these patients have been rare. We now observed the development of severe anemia in 9 out of 11 renal transplant recipients whose immunosuppressive regimen was converted from cyclosporine plus prednisone to azathioprine plus prednisone. A significant (P = 0.001) drop in hematocrit (from 34 +/- 4% to 27 +/- 3%, mean +/- SD) and hemoglobin (from 11.6 +/- 1.3 g/dl to 9.5 +/- 1.0 g/dl) was found. Since a common variable of all these patients was their use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as antihypertensive medication, we speculated that the combination of azathioprine and ACE blocker might be the reason for the anemia. We then compared 2 groups of 10 patients each who had been on azathioprine as their regular immunosuppressive agent and who did or did not take an ACE inhibitor. Hematocrit and hemoglobin were significantly (P = 0.01) lower in the group of patients taking ACE inhibitors (33 +/- 6% versus 41 +/- 5% and 11.5 +/- 2.0 g/dl versus 14.0 +/- 1.6 g/dl, respectively). Haptoglobin levels were also significantly (P = 0.05) lower in the ACE inhibitor group (116 +/- 65 mg/dl versus 210 +/- 114 mg/dl). Erythropoietin concentration in the serum and the reticulocyte index were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the ACE inhibitor group but the values were probably too low for their degree of anemia. Comparing hematological parameters of the patients in the ACE inhibitor group before and after beginning of the antihypertensive treatment confirmed a significant reduction of hematocrit and hemoglobin following therapy with an ACE inhibitor. Hematocrit fell from 41 +/- 7% to 36 +/- 6% and hemoglobin from 14.0 +/- 2.3 g/dl to 11.3 +/- 1.5 g/dl (P < 0.05 for both). We conclude that the combination of these two drugs should probably be avoided.",

Cases of symptomatic hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have been reported occasionally. The database we analysed consisted of 1,177 patients, mean age approximately 70 yrs, with congestive heart failure NYHA functional class II or III. These patients were treated and observed prospectively according to a uniform protocol, starting therapy with 2.5 mg enalapril and measuring blood pressure at hourly intervals for eight hours thereafter. 94.6% of the patients experienced no symptomatic hypotension, 4.75% moderate symptoms (e.g. dizziness, headache) and 0.59% severe symptoms (e.g. fainting, collapse, renal failure). For the analyses of risk factors a large number of baseline variables were analysed univariately to select those significant for inclusion in a multivariate stepwise logistic regression. Alternatively the CART-(classification and regression tree) technique was used. Both techniques showed diastolic blood pressure < or = 70 mmHg to be the single most significant risk factor. CART-analyses showed also pretreatment with nitrates and systolic blood pressure < or = 120 mmHg to be of prognostic relevance.

    "326": "The effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril, on cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine responses to mental stress were studied. A mental arithmetic test (MAT) was carried out in 9 patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment with alacepril, 25 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and in 9 age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Systolic blood pressure at rest and during MAT and the change in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during MAT were significantly greater in the hypertensive subjects than in the normal subjects. Alacepril significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, both at rest and during MAT, as compared to before treatment in the hypertensive subjects. Furthermore, alacepril significantly attenuated the change in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during MAT (from 127 +/- 76 pg/ml to 66 +/- 42 pg/ml, p < 0.05). These results suggest that alacepril significantly suppresses the augmented cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous responses to mental stress in patients with essential hypertension.",

    "332": "Insulin resistance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. Studies from other countries discovered insulin resistance; in people with essential hypertension in was also associated with obesity, however, insulin resistance was found in lean people too. In obesity, insulin resistance occurs secondarily to many physiopathological states and circulating factors which adversely affects insulin action. The metabolic abnormality in this action was mainly found in relation to abdominal fat; in other cases, insulin resistance was found to be inherited. Hyperinsulinaemia can actually increase blood pressure and is associated with venous and arterial thrombosis and it also rises lipid levels. It is interesting too that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are associated with impaired fibrinolysis through high levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor of endothelial type and in identifying individuals prone to myocardial infarction. Some antihypertensive drugs like beta-blockers, methyl-dopa and diuretics increase insulin resistance, while angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors have not shown any adverse metabolic affects. Alfa-1-blocker were beneficial and alfa-2-agonists were neutral, whereas calcium channel-antagonists are still in controversy. Treatment should be designed to improve the metabolic state; physical exercise, a diet rich in fruit, vegetable and rott vegetables, the reduction of abdominal fat and, finally, the use of antihypertensive drugs which decrease insulin resistance would be expected to reverse hyperinsulinaemia. Biguanides like metformin have also been found to reduce insulin resistance.",

With increased longevity and effective antihypertensive medications, the prevalence of vascular lesions affecting renal viability is increasing, possibly accounting for 15% of end-stage renal disease. Renal vascular lesions alter renin release and multiple associated mechanisms related to adrenergic and vascular regulation. Several new diagnostic modalities, including captopril renography, duplex ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance angiography, are being applied for noninvasive diagnosis. Advances in interventional radiologic procedures, including endovascular stents and surgical revascularization, offer the potential for both improved blood pressure management and salvage of renal function.

Ten patients having a decrease in mean blood pressure (MBP) exceeding 5% at the second hour after a 20 mg furosemide injection were defined as diuretic-responders (DR), while the remainder were defined as diuretic-non-responders (DN). The DR group had a higher baseline MBP (135 +/- 6 [mean +/- SE] vs 121 +/- 4 mmHg, p < 0.05) and serum sodium concentration (145.7 +/- 1.4 vs 143.0 +/- 0.7 mmol/L, p < 0.05) than the DN group. The extent of natriuresis induced by furosemide was not different between the two subgroups. Following 100 mg of captopril administered orally, the DR group had a smaller change in MBP (%) than the DN group (3.08 +/- 5.14 vs -7.78 +/- 3.37, p < 0.05). According to the different BP responses to furosemide and captopril, we conclude that PA patients may be further divided into DR and DN. The DR group had a good response to diuretics whereas the DN group responded better to converting enzyme inhibitors. This classification of PA in terms of blood pressure response to furosemide may have therapeutic implications.", 
    "335": "Idrapril is the prototype of a new class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (plasma ACE activity) were investigated in rats, dogs (after intravenous and oral doses), and human volunteers (after oral doses). Following intravenous administration (1 mg/kg) to rats and dogs, elimination half-lives were 96 and 52 min, systemic clearance 19.6 and 9.5 ml/min kg, and volume of distribution 2.7 and 0.8 liters/kg, respectively. Pharmacokinetics appeared linear in dogs, within the dose range of 0.1-10 mg/kg. After oral administration of similar doses (approximately 2 mg/kg) in the three species studied, peak plasma concentrations were 182, 567, and 726 ng/ml; AUCs 25, 85, and 182 micrograms min/ml; and elimination half-lives 82, 54, and 174 min in rats, dogs, and healthy volunteers, respectively. Absolute oral bioavailability was calculated to be approximately 24% in rats and dogs. Idrapril did not bind to plasma proteins of the species studied. Plasma ACE was fully inhibited following oral administration of approximately 2 mg/kg in rats and humans, but in dogs maximal inhibition did not exceed 85%. Duration of action, measured as time for ACE to recover to 70% of initial activity, was approximately 5, 3, and 22 hr in rats, dogs, and humans, respectively. Idrapril plasma levels appeared correlated in a saturable way with inhibition of plasma ACE in all three species, yielding ex vivo IC50 values of approximately 7 ng/ml for both the rat and humans, and 91 ng/ml for dogs.", 
    "336": "Despite recent evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it is important to note that roughly 40% of patients with New York Heart Association class I-III disease treated with these agents died during 4-year follow-up in the treatment arm of two large trials. Given this high mortality rate, there is an obvious need for therapy beyond digoxin, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors. Digoxin is associated with favorable effects on exercise capacity, ejection fraction, and clinical symptomatology in the majority of patients with CHF. Its effects on mortality are unknown, but are the subject of a continuing trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The beta-agonists are also associated with hemodynamic and clinical improvements in patients with CHF, but probably increase the risk of mortality, especially when taken on a long-term basis. Therefore, their use should be limited to the short-term management of acute exacerbations of CHF. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, particularly milrinone, are associated with increased mortality in patients with CHF, apparently related to their arrhythmogenic effect. Little evidence exists that calcium channel blockers exert beneficial effects in patients with CHF (unlike their role in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); indeed, first-generation calcium channel blockers may be detrimental in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and they should generally be avoided in this setting. Treatment of ischemia in patients with CHF should be initiated with nitrates; low dosages of vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be attempted if nitrates fail.",

    "341": "A number of small, randomised clinical trials and one large trial of intravenous magnesium have been conducted on patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Most of these trials indicate that treatment with magnesium has a beneficial effect on short term mortality, although in most of the small trials the results are inconclusive. A systematic overview of mortality and serious morbidity data from all the available randomised controlled trials of magnesium conducted in a total of nearly 4000 patients with AMI indicates that there were 123 deaths in 1974 patients allocated magnesium, and 193 deaths in 1949 controls (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.76, p < 0.0001). Data on the effects of magnesium on serious ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure are incomplete, and definitions for these serious complications of AMI vary greatly among the trials. Nevertheless, the available data suggest that magnesium also significantly reduces these 2 serious forms of morbidity. These data suggest that magnesium given to patients during AMI can produce significant reductions in mortality and serious morbidity. Although the mechanism of action of magnesium is likely to be independent of other currently used agents, its value when added to thrombolytic therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nitrates is not clear, and is presently being studied in the very large Fourth International Studies of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4) trial.", 
    "342": "In order to examine the role of peptidases in modulating bronchoconstrictor responses to i.v. administered capsaicin, a potent C-fiber stimulant, we measured changes in pulmonary conductance (GL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) in anesthetized mechanically ventilated guinea-pigs. Control guinea-pigs, and guinea-pigs treated with the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors thiorphan (1.7 mg/kg) or SCH32615 (1 mg/kg), the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5.7 mg/kg), or combinations of NEP and ACE inhibitors, were given increasing doses of capsaicin by rapid i.v. injection. The doses of capsaicin required to cause a 50% decrease in GL and Cdyn (ED50GL and ED50Cdyn respectively) were computed for each animal. None of the peptidase inhibitors, when given alone, had any effect on the changes in pulmonary mechanics induced by capsaicin. However, combined administration of thiorphan and captopril, or SCH32615 and captopril, caused a decrease in ED50Cdyn for capsaicin, and prolonged the time during which the peak changes in GL induced by capsaicin persisted. These data support the hypothesis that substances whose degradation is inhibited by combined NEP and ACE inhibitors contribute to the bronchoconstriction induced by iv administered capsaicin. This profile of enzymatic degradation is consistent with the tachykinin, substance P.", 
    "343": "The effects of a single oral dose (20 mg) of lisinopril on systemic, carotid (pulsed Doppler), and cerebral (middle cerebral artery, transcranial Doppler) hemodynamics have been investigated over an 8-h period in eight healthy volunteers in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. In addition, cerebral vasodilatory reserve was measured (acetazolamide test). Lisinopril did not affect systemic hemodynamics but it increased both common carotid artery blood flow (+26.2%, p < 0.01) and diameter (+4.5%, p < 0.05) after 8 h. Lisinopril did not affect middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity but increased cerebral resistance index (+8.1%, p < 0.05) at 4 h and cerebral vasodilatory reserve (+24.8%, p < 0.05). These data suggest that lisinopril produces a paradoxical vasoconstriction of the small cerebral arterioles. This vasoconstriction might be a compensatory mechanism to a dilation of large cerebral arteries, thus resulting in an unchanged cerebral blood flow.", 
    "344": "Ramipril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to II. The literature indicates that diabetes is often associated with mild impairment of learning and memory. The study reports the effects of ramipril on memory retention in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Mice were made diabetic by an injection of streptozocin. After overt signs of diabetes were present, diabetic or vehicle-treated mice were partially trained on a footshock active avoidance task. Immediately after training, ramipril (0.5-1.5 mg/kg s.c.) was administered and retention was tested by continuing training one week later until mice avoided footshock on five out of six trails. The results indicate that ramipril enhanced retention of both diabetic and control mice but it required about 5 times as much ramipril in diabetic as control mice to achieve the same effect on retention. Increased sensitivity to angiotensin II may play a role in cognitive impairment in diabetes.",

The anti-proteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is well established. We studied whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy with perindoprilat in comparison with conventional antihypertensive treatment could influence the development of increased regional albumin clearance as well as albuminuria in experimental diabetes. Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were randomized into a saline group (n = 7), a perindoprilat (1 mg/kg per day) group (n = 8), and a hydralazine (3 mg/kg per day) group (n = 6); six rats served as non-diabetic controls. After 6-8 weeks, blood pressure was equally reduced in the perindoprilat- and hydralazine-treated groups (P < 0.01). Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and albumin excretion were increased in diabetic rats compared to control rats (P < 0.001). Hydralazine did not reduce 24 h protein or albumin excretion, whereas perindoprilat treatment reduced both (P < 0.001) to levels comparable to those of control rats. Regional albumin clearance, assessed in the eye, ileum, lung, skeletal muscle and skin, was clearly elevated in diabetic rats compared to control rats; however, neither drug therapy had an effect on albumin clearance.",

Mean follow-up was 15 +/- 11 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 22 +/- 7%. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 27 +/- 9 mm Hg, and cardiac index was 2.2 +/- 0.6 liter/min/m2. Symptom class was IV in 91% of patients and III in 9%. Etiology was ischemic in 40% of patients and idiopathic in 60%. After intensive medical therapy, heart transplantation was considered indicated in 53% of patients, contraindicated in 20% and not indicated in 27%. Transplantation was performed in 36% of patients during follow-up, and 35% died and 29% were alive without transplantation. A comparison, excluding patients with transplantation, was performed between those who were alive and had survived > or = 6 months after assessment, and those who died. On multivariate analysis, the following 3 parameters were independent predictors of prognosis: intravenous inotropic requirement (p < 0.001), maximal, tolerated captopril dose (p = 0.013) and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.003). When patients with transplantation were considered as deaths, stabilization on medical therapy also reached statistical significance (p = 0.009). Classic prognostic markers including ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, cardiac index, amiodarone therapy and etiology were not associated with prognosis in this homogeneous population of severely ill patients.",

    "355": "In recent years, considerable attention has focused on the possibility that some classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect in retarding the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. Experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that the sustained increase in glomerular capillary pressure evoked in response to loss of renal mass produces a destructive sclerosing reaction. Administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decreases glomerular capillary pressure with a resultant reduction of glomerular sclerosis, suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may protect the injured kidney from hemodynamically mediated glomerular damage. On the basis of these experimental observations, many studies have attempted to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can slow the progression of chronic renal disease in humans. We surveyed the literature critically and concluded that, the data from animals notwithstanding, the majority of studies in humans have been nonrandomized, of too short duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties. Therefore, we cannot yet conclude that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors modify the rate at which renal disease progresses in nondiabetic patients.", 
    "356": "The mechanism-based inactivation of human neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) was studied with N-[(R)-2-benzyl-5-cyano-4-oxopentanoyl]-L-phenylalanine (1) and its peptidic analogue, N(-)[N-(cyanoacetyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-L-phenylalanine (2). While both these active-site-directed molecules inactivate NEP, the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is only inactivated by compound 2 [Ghosh et al. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 4175-4179]. The selectivity in inactivation was addressed further by a comparative study of the interaction of compounds 1 and 2 with five other zinc proteases. The selective inactivation of NEP observed with the ketomethylene compound 1 suggests that the active site of NEP is less discriminating in its requirements for binding such substrate analogues as compared to ACE, a characteristic that may be exploited for designing specific mechanism-based inactivators for NEP. It is proposed that the inactivation is a result of NEP-catalyzed formation of ketenimine intermediates, which are subsequently trapped by an active-site nucleophile.", 
    "357": "The utility of comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), a three-dimensional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (3-D QSAR) paradigm, as a tool to aid in the development of predictive models has been previously addressed (Depriest, S.D. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, in press). Although predictive correlations were obtained for angiotensin-converting and thermolysin inhibitors, certain inadequacies of the CoMFA technique were noted. Primarily, CoMFA steric and electrostatic fields alone do not fully characterize the zinc-ligand interaction. Previously, this was partially rectified by the inclusion of indicator variables into the QSAR table to designate the class of zinc-binding ligand. Recent advances in molecular modeling technology have allowed us to further address this limitation of the preceding study. Using molecular orbital fields derived from semiempirical calculations as additional descriptors in the QSAR table, predictive correlations were produced based on CoMFA and molecular orbital fields alone--indicator variables no longer being necessary. Arbitrary information concerning the alignment of molecules under study within the active-site introduces ambiguities into the CoMFA study. Crystallographic information detailing the binding mode of several thermolysin enzyme inhibitors has previously been used as a guide for the alignment of additional, noncrystallized, inhibitors. However, this process was complicated by the lack of parameters for zinc in the molecular mechanical force field. Therefore, zinc-ligand interactions were ignored during the standard minimization procedure. The use of field-fit minimization using complementary receptor fields as templates is presented as a possible solution to the problem. Predictive correlations were obtained from analyses based on this method of molecular alignment. The availability of crystallographic data for thermolysin enzyme-inhibitor complexes allowed for an alternate definition of the CoMFA region. Herein, promising results from analyses using actual receptor active-site atom probe atoms are presented.",

The patients were followed for at least two years or until they needed dialysis. The therapeutic goal, was a blood pressure of 120 ti 140/80 to 90 mmHg. In the enalapril group, the median decline in GFR was -0.20 (range, +0.18 to -7.11) mL/min/1.73 m2/month, and in the control group, it was -0.31 (+0.01 to -1.97) mL/min/1.73 m2/month (p < 0.05).

    "359": "Chronic peripheral treatments with low doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, enhance daily intakes of dilute ethanol solutions in rats as they do the intakes of water and saline solutions. Placing captopril into the drinking water or infusing it SC increases daily intake of 6% (v/v) ethanol from 30-100% over 4-12 days of treatment. The present study examined the effects of electrolytic lesions either of the subfornical organ (SFO) or of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT), on captopril-enhanced ethanol intake. Captopril was infused in minipumps at 5 mg/day for 14 days. The intake of 6% (v/v) ethanol was abolished by SFO lesions and was temporarily reduced by OVLT lesions. The SFO, in particular, is essential for the expression of enhanced ethanol intake during low-dose peripheral captopril administration. Local angiotensin II synthesis and receptor activation at the SFO appear to be the mechanism of the enhanced ethanol drinking during captopril.", 
    "360": "Nephrosclerosis is the most typical and widespread renal manifestation of hypertension and can be judged as the pathological hallmark of essential hypertension. Nephrosclerosis is an important and frequent cause of progressive renal disease, however, information in the literature on the risk of developing renal failure in the course of essential hypertension is sparse. Traditionally, nephrosclerosis was thought to result from glomerular ischemia. Alternatively, glomerular sclerosis in hypertension may result from glomerular hyperperfusion or hypertension. Studies in experimental models of renal disease have identified a promising intervention with either Ca antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Application of these therapies to patients with nephrosclerosis should await the results of careful clinical trials.",

We enrolled 28 diabetic patients with hypertension and macroproteinuria from the out-patient diabetic-renal clinic. The antihypertensive treatment consisted of lisinopril or nifedipine, and their effect on arterial BP, urinary albumin excretion, glomerular filtration rate, and renal blood flow were measured. BPs at entry were 166/99 (SD 23/9) mmHg for the lisinopril group and 165/99(21/7) mmHg for the nifedipine group. BPs fell to 143/88 (17/13) mmHg for the lisinopril group and 148/85(25/10) mmHg for the nifedipine group at the end of the study.

Intervention treatment with placebo or low dose lisinopril was for 48 weeks. The main outcome changes were in urinary albumin excretion rate, urinary prostaglandin excretion, and glomerular filtration rate. Secondary outcome measures included changes in BP and heart rate. Of the 32 patients entered into the study, 27 completed 48 weeks treatment (12 lisinopril, 15 placebo).

    "363": "In children over 1 year of age, renal disease is the commonest cause of hypertension. Arteriography is considered the reference method to establish the diagnosis of renovascular disease; however, it is an invasive technique with a high radiation burden for children. This was a retrospective study of pre- and post-capto-technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging compared with arteriography in 18 children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Alone, the 99mTc-DMSA scan is a sensitive indicator of renal parenchymal disease, although non-specific in suggesting the pathology. The combination of pre- and post-captopril studies may increase the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of renovascular disease in the presence of hypertension. This work suggests that a screening investigation with a low radiation burden can be carried out at most institutions; if the investigation is positive, there will be a high index of suspicion that renovascular disease is the cause of the hypertension.", 
    "364": "Plasma neurohormones were sequentially analysed in 98 patients with acute myocardial infarction randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo for 4-6 months. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was rapidly suppressed by enalapril, but unaffected by placebo (P = 0.0001). No significant differences were found in the plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, noradrenaline, adrenaline or dopamine between the two treatment groups. Among patients with infarct size above median, plasma angiotensin II increased during head-up tilt at one month in the placebo group, but not in the enalapril group. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) were evaluated by echocardiography in 28 patients (placebo 15, enalapril 13) and changes in left ventricular volumes between baseline and 4-6 months were calculated. Only in the placebo group was a positive correlation found between plasma levels of noradrenaline at day 5-7 and the subsequent increase in LVEDV (r = 0.78, P = 0.005) and LVESV (r = 0.75, P = 0.008). The same trend was found for angiotensin II, adrenaline and dopamine levels at days 5-7 and the subsequent increase in left ventricular volumes. In the placebo group a negative correlation was found between plasma aldosterone at days 5-7 and the subsequent increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.77, P = 0.006) during the study period. Although circulating neurohormones were not significantly influenced by enalapril treatment, it is concluded that enalapril may influence the relationship found between sustained neurohormonal activation and left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "365": "We tested the hypothesis that early plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) values are related to subsequent functional capacity in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Blood for ANF determination was sampled from 90 male patients (age 66.5 +/- 9.5 (mean +/- SD) years) day 3 post MI. Exercise testing on an upright bicycle ergometer to symptomatic end-points was performed 1 and 6 months after MI in 83 and 78 patients, respectively. A weak, but significant inverse relationship between day 3 plasma ANF levels and exercise duration after MI (1 month: r = -0.27, P = 0.012; 6 months: r = -0.36, P = 0.001) was observed. In the subgroup of patients without effort-associated ischaemia, the relationship was closer (1 month; n = 38, r = -0.57, P < 0.001; t months: n = 33, r = -0.65, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, with ANF, patient age and peak creatine kinase MB values as covariates, the relationship remained significant. These findings suggest that in male patients subacute plasma ANF measurements are predictive of exercise capacity following acute MI. The relationship appears to be especially prominent in patients without effort-related ischaemia during exercise.", 
    "366": "Recent investigations using experimental models of diabetes mellitus have emphasized the importance of impaired blood flow for the development of nerve dysfunction. Other observations suggest that this may also be the case for patients. A number of studies have revealed that several types of vasodilators can prevent or successfully treat early conduction abnormalities in diabetic rodents. These include alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, and vasomodulator prostanoids. Other treatments applied to animal models, such as omega-6 essential fatty acids, aldose reductase inhibitors, aminoguanidine which prevents the formation of advanced glycation end-products, and anti-oxidants all appear to have vascular-related effects that lead to improvements in nerve conduction. These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress could be important factors in the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy. Studies have also focused on deficits in axon growth and regeneration, their relation to impaired neuronal synthesis and transport of growth-related chemicals, and neuronotrophic abnormalities. Taken together, the data give rise to the notion that an optimal therapeutic strategy could consist of improving the microenvironment of damaged nerve fibres by manipulating nerve blood flow while concurrently encouraging repair with trophic agents.",

Both drugs improved the post-obstructed kidney (POK) renal hemodynamics, lowered MAP, and normalized eicosanoid excretion by the POK. Cortex and medulla POK:CK ratio of relative density R mRNA was approximately 3.5 for both. Sham, POK, and CK showed renin immunoreactivity and R mRNA exclusively in juxtaglomerular position. In addition, in POK renin was expressed in mesangial cells, along greater lengths of afferent arterioles and in dilated distal tubules and loops of Henle. In situ hybridization revealed that approximately 20% more glomeruli in POK than CK overexpressed R mRNA. Blood vessels of POK consistently showed greater ACE and Ao mRNA expression than CK. Overexpression of the genes coding for members of the RAS is possibly responsible for local Ang II production which, in view of the response to CEI and AT1-R inhibitors, is at least partly responsible for the severe hemodynamic changes in UUO.", 
    "368": "Angiotensin (ANG) II is now recognized as a powerful direct controller of Na+ reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule, a property that predominantly reflects stimulation of the transepithelial NaHCO3 flux. Numerous studies have established that this effect of ANG II represents stimulation of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger, but a single microperfusion study has also suggested direct stimulation of the basolateral Na(+)-HCO3- cotransporter. We have carried out studies in basolateral membrane vesicles from rabbit renal cortex to examine directly whether ANG II exerts an independent effect on the Na(+)-HCO3- cotransporter. Preincubation of vesicles with ANG II (10(-11) to 10(-9) M) for 15 min enhanced the activity of the cotransporter, the greatest effect occurring at 10(-11) M (41 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.005). This stimulation reflected an increase in the maximal enzyme reaction velocity of the cotransporter but no change in the Michaelis constant for Na+. ANG II had no effect on Na(+)-dependent succinate transport. ANG I (10(-9) M) and ANG III (10(-10) M) also stimulated the Na(+)-HCO3- cotransporter, and captopril (10(-4) M) attenuated the ANG I stimulation by 68 +/- 3.5% (P < 0.01) but not that of ANG II and III. Saralasin (10(-11) to 10(-8) M) by itself behaved as an agonist, and its stimulation was additive to that by ANG II. The nonpeptide ANG II receptor antagonist, losartan potassium (10(-6) M), and the disulfide-reducing agent, dithiothreitol (10 mM), each by itself had no effect on the cotransporter but each markedly attenuated the ANG II effect (by 77 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.01 and 74 +/- 1.6%, P < 0.005, respectively) in accord with the view that the basolateral receptor belongs to subtype 1. These results identify physiological concentrations of ANG II as a potent, direct, and specific stimulator of the basolateral Na(+)-HCO3- cotransporter.", 
    "369": "The systemic hemodynamic, renal and hormonal responses to SQ 28,603 (N-[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]-beta-alanine) the selective inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and their combination were determined in conscious dogs after 1 or 3 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing. Coadministration of captopril (100 or 10 mumol/kg i.v.) and SQ 28,603 (10 mumol/kg i.v.) significantly reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and renal vascular resistance and increased cardiac output, stroke volume and renal blood flow in the conscious dogs paced for 1 week. This pattern of hemodynamic improvement was not predicted by the activity of the individual inhibitors. The combination of inhibitors did not significantly increase sodium excretion because of the variability introduced by the depressor activity; however, the pressure-natriuresis curve was steeper and shifted leftward, indicating that sodium excretion was maintained at lower renal perfusion pressures. The increases in urinary and plasma levels of cyclic GMP and atrial natriuretic peptide stimulated by SQ 28,603 were not affected by captopril. The data indicated that the hemodynamic and renal responses produced by SQ 28,603, presumably by elevating atrial natriuretic peptide levels, were enhanced by suppression of angiotensin II or that the combination of inhibitors protected other vasodilator/natriuretic peptides from degradation. Qualitatively similar responses to SQ 28,603, captopril and the combination of inhibitors were obtained in dogs paced for 3 weeks. In summary, the combined angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 inhibitors improved systemic hemodynamics and maintained renal function in conscious dogs with pacing-induced heart failure.", 
    "370": "Bradykinin (BK) affects a variety of smooth muscle types, including uterus. These effects are generally short-lived due to metabolism by a variety of enzymes including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), endopeptidase 24.11 (EP-24.11) and endopeptidase 24.15 (EP-24.15). The uterotonic action of BK and the limitation of that action by peptidases were examined using isolated rat uterus. BK contracted the estrus, diestrus and day 22 pregnant rat uterus. N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (10(-7) M), a specific inhibitor of EP-24.11, and N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (10(-6) M), a specific inhibitor of EP-24.15, enhanced BK-induced contraction in the estrus and pregnant uterus. Enalaprilat (6 x 10(-8) M), an inhibitor of ACE, also enhanced BK-induced contraction. The enzyme inhibitors alone did not contract the uterus. Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism blocked the effects of the inhibitors. ACE is present in the rat uterus, but there are no reports of EP-24.11 or EP-24.15. Here we report that EP-24.11 and EP-24.15 activities are present in the estrus and pregnant rat uterus. Partially purified uterine homogenates metabolized specific model substrates for EP-24.11 and EP-24.15. The enzyme activities were inhibited by N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate and N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, respectively, and increased 5- to 8-fold at term pregnancy as compared to estrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "371": "The cardiovascular effects and pharmacokinetics of once-daily enalapril were studied after single-dose and subchronic treatment in eight patients with hypertension by use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Enalapril, 10 mg, was given at either 7 AM or 7 PM in a randomized crossover design. In addition, inhibition of serum converting enzyme was studied. Subchronic treatment at 7 AM significantly reduced blood pressure during the day but was less effective at night. Subchronic dosing at 7 PM significantly further decreased nighttime blood pressure followed by a slow increase during the day, with no effect on elevated afternoon values. Peak concentrations of enalaprilat were found 3.5 hours (morning) and 5.6 hours (evening) after drug intake (p < 0.05), whereas peak effects occurred 7.4 hours (morning) and 12 hours (evening) after drug administration. In conclusion, 24-hour blood pressure profiles in patients with hypertension were significantly influenced by the time of enalapril dosing. Differences in effect profiles could not be attributed to similar changes in pharmacokinetics or to different time courses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "372": "In subjects with heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exhibit mild systemic antiadrenergic effects, as deduced from treatment-related lowering of systemic venous norepinephrine levels. The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on cardiac adrenergic drive in subjects with heart failure has not previously been investigated.", 
    "373": "In a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of 14 patients, we measured cardiac and systemic adrenergic drive, myocardial and lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors, and hemodynamic changes at baseline and after 12 weeks of therapy. Relative to placebo, lisinopril therapy was associated with only minimal, statistically insignificant changes in hemodynamics, a significant increase in myocardial beta-receptor density, no significant (P < .05) changes in cardiac or systemic adrenergic drive, and no detectable change in lymphocyte beta-receptor density. When subjects were rank ordered into groups with the highest and lowest coronary sinus norepinephrine levels, those with the highest norepinephrine levels exhibited significant decreases in central venous norepinephrine, coronary sinus norepinephrine, and an increase in myocardial beta-receptor density relative to changes in placebo or relative to baseline values. Subjects with lower cardiac adrenergic drive exhibited no significant changes in coronary sinus or systemic norepinephrine levels or in myocardial beta-receptor density.", 
    "374": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril lowered cardiac adrenergic drive and increased beta-receptor density in subjects with increased cardiac adrenergic drive but had no effects on these parameters in subjects with normal cardiac adrenergic drive. These data suggest that cardiac antiadrenergic properties contribute to the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in subjects with heart failure.", 
    "375": "Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic ureteral obstruction. While several cytokines may initiate fibrogenesis, TGF-beta is considered to be a major stimulating factor. It has been reported that TGF-beta 1 regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, that thromboxane (Tx) stimulates ECM protein synthesis, and that angiotensin II (Ang II) increases expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Therefore, we measured TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression by reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction in renal cortex of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) to determine whether Ang II and/or Tx stimulates increases in TGF-beta 1 mRNA. TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels in contralateral kidneys of rats with UUO did not change significantly during 14 days of obstruction, while in the obstructed kidney TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels were increased significantly after three days as compared to the control (unoperated rats) kidneys. The increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression in the obstructed kidney cortex was found in tubular cells rather than glomeruli. OKY-046, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase, did not affect the changes in TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the obstructed kidney. Enalapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, significantly blunted but did not completely abrogate the increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA. These data suggest that in obstruction TGF-beta 1 is increased at the transcriptional level and thus may play a role in initiating fibrogenesis in obstructive nephropathy. The effect of thromboxane on extracellular matrix synthesis does not appear to be mediated by TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "376": "Several causes may affect the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure (CHF). The present study was undertaken to identify what factors might predict benefits in exercise capacity after ACE inhibition in 22 patients with mild to moderate CHF. All patients underwent hemodynamic evaluation before and following an oral dose of quinapril (20 mg). They were then treated daily with 20 mg of quinapril and underwent exercise stress test off-drugs 1 day and 6 months later. Patients were grouped according to their relative changes in vascular resistances after quinapril: Group A (n = 15) showed a greater decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (% delta PVR/% delta SVR > 1). The opposite occurred in Group B (n = 7). Comparison of pretreatment baseline features revealed that the two groups had similar biochemical and hormonal variables, cardiac index, and SVR. Conversely, Group A patients had higher (p < 0.05) pulmonary artery pressure and PVR compared with Group B patients. Following quinapril, Group A patients showed a greater (p < 0.05) increase in cardiac index than Group B patients, despite a similar reduction in SVR. Accordingly, 1-day drug treatment significantly (p < 0.001) increased exercise duration in Group A (+29%), but not in Group B patients (+7%). Benefits in exercise capacity were still significant (p < 0.001) 6 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "377": "Renal sympathetic stimulation of plasma renin activity (PRA) and sodium reabsorption was examined in conscious dogs before and during intrarenal angiotensin II (ANG II)-type 1 receptor blockade with losartan (Dup-753) and converting enzyme inhibition. In uninephrectomized dogs, renal function and PRA responses to 14% blood volume depletion (BVD) were measured. BVD was utilized to activate renal sympathetic outflow in the absence of hypotension. In eight vehicle-treated dogs, 14% BVD increased PRA from 1.38 +/- 0.32 to 2.79 +/- 0.66 ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1 and decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) from 85.1 +/- 11.3 to 45.4 +/- 7.5 mueq/min. During losartan (n = 6) and captopril (n = 5) infusion, plasma renin responses were enhanced in response to 14% BVD (1.93 +/- 0.48 to 5.74 +/- 2.25 and 3.03 +/- 0.73 to 9.19 +/- 1.94 ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1, respectively), whereas antinatriuretic responses were similar to vehicle-infused dogs. Thus, neurogenic antinatriuresis is not mediated by secondary generation of ANG II, since UNaV decreased similarly to control in all conditions of ANG II blockade. Tonic intrarenal and/or circulating ANG II synthesis of dogs on a normal sodium diet inhibit neurogenic stimulation of renin release, since PRA responses were enhanced after blockade of ANG II.", 
    "378": "In this study, the diagnostic value of renal function scintigraphy performed both without and with ACE inhibition has been evaluated using the new radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-MAG3. In cases of decompensated renal artery stenoses, the typical scan finding with this tubular excreted agent was shown to be a distinct parenchymal nuclide retention in combination with a delayed appearance of the radiotracer in the pelvic system. Using this criterion in 43 patients with suspected renovascular hypertension, sensitivity and specificity were 89 and 88%, respectively. Bilateral positive findings were non-specific; excluding them from the study, specificity increased to 100%. In renal insufficiency, captopril scans seem to be of reduced diagnostic value. Summarising our experiences, renal function scintigraphy using 99mTc-MAG3 without and with captopril was proved to be a reliable non-invasive method to detect or exclude haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis.", 
    "379": "Urinary kallikrein excretion (UKE) is decreased in rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), but increases after converting enzyme inhibition (CEI). Although CEI potentiates bradykinin activity, neither the effect of CEI on kallikrein secretion nor the abnormal renal kallikrein metabolism in PHN has been examined previously. To determine the mechanism by which CEI increases UKE, normal rats and PHN received enalapril, 40 mg/kg per d orally for 4 d. UKE was 85% lower in PHN than in normals and increased in both groups after CEI, although UKE in PHN remained significantly less than in normals. Kallikrein mRNA was significantly lower in PHN compared to normals but not in PHN treated with CEI and did not change in normal rats. Renin mRNA was significantly lower in PHN, and was stimulated by CEI only in normals. Renal kallikrein and renin content were not different and were not altered by CEI. Both kallikrein and renin genes appear to be transcriptionally suppressed in rats with PHN and the depressed kallikrein mRNA levels can be reversed by CEI. The modest increase in UKE despite normalization of kallikrein mRNA after CEI suggests that there is also a posttranscriptional defect in synthesis and/or secretion of kallikrein.", 
    "380": "The effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition on atherosclerosis-induced changes in arterial function are unknown, as well as whether they are coupled to improvements of structural alterations in the arterial wall. An atherogenic (A) diet and the ACE inhibitor perindopril (P) were given concomitantly for 4 months to seven adult Pitman-Moore minipigs (7 months of age; A+P animals), which were compared with seven A and seven control (C) animals. Perindopril, at a daily dose of 4 mg PO that is commonly used in the clinical setting, induced a continuous 70% inhibition of serum ACE activity. At the end of the study, the atherosclerosis-induced impairment of arterial flow was investigated via the hemodynamics and vascular rheology of hindlimb arteries in non-barbiturate-anesthetized pigs. Structural alterations were evaluated from the histopathology of lesions in the arterial tree (abdominal aorta, left interventricular coronary artery [LIVCA], and brachiocephalic trunk [BCT]), with particular attention given to the analysis of the structure and composition of aortic elastic fibers. Atherosclerosis impaired the function of both capacitance and resistance arteries. Blood pressure (BP) rose significantly because of increased hindlimb peripheral resistance (HPR) and aortic input impedance (Zc), although blood flow was not affected. Altered aortic stress and elastic responses revealed that the stiffness of the aorta was markedly increased because of increased wall tension and reduced viscoelasticity, the viscous component being blunted in the arterial wall. Perindopril significantly opposed these alterations by reducing BP, HPR, and Zc and by returning parietal stiffness values to C values by increasing aortic compliance. ACE inhibition prevented the alteration of both stress and elastic responses. Major fibroproliferative fatty lesions were observed in the aorta and LIVCA, while moderate fibrosclerotic lesions were found in the BCT. Computerized densitometric analysis of orcein-stained elastin showed that elastic laminae fragmentation was prominent in the abdominal aorta, less in the LIVCA, and moderate in the BCT. Furthermore, the elastin content was reduced in the atherosclerotic aorta, although this loss of elastin was not associated with changes in the biochemical nature of alkali-insoluble elastin. Perindopril significantly prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta, LIVCA, and BCT by decreasing the cross-sectional area of lesions as well as the number of lipid-laden cells in the abdominal aorta and LIVCA. In the abdominal aorta, ACE inhibition significantly prevented the alteration of elastic laminae by specifically preventing elastolytic fragmentation of dense elastic laminae, but it didn ot modify elastin content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, we compared the time course and magnitude of the biochemical effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the plasma renin-angiotensin system, cardiac hypertrophy, renal lesions, and 24-hour blood pressure decrease induced by either intermittent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition administration (benazepril PO, 10 mg/kg once a day, n = 93) or continuous administration (benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg per day via osmotic pumps, n = 92). Control rats (n = 91) received the drug vehicle intermittently or continuously. Mortality was significantly reduced by both intermittent (n = 3/93) and continuous (n = 3/92) inhibition compared with controls (n = 18/91) (P < .001). Changes in the plasma renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure were parallel. A continuous suppression of the activity of the plasma renin-angiotensin system was associated with a 24-hour decrease in blood pressure with continuous inhibition, whereas intermittent inhibition induced a similar fall in blood pressure only for the first hours after gavage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "382": "Endothelium-dependent dilatation of cerebral arterioles is impaired during chronic hypertension. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, on endothelium-dependent dilatation in pial arterioles. Four-month-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) received cilazapril in their drinking water (500 mg/L) for 3 to 6 months. Treatment with cilazapril reduced mean arterial pressure in both WKY rats and SHRSP and had no significant effect on baseline diameter of pial arterioles measured with a cranial window. Responses to bradykinin and A23187, but not to nitroglycerin and adenosine, were impaired in SHRSP. Cilazapril did not affect responses to bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) and A23187 (10(-5) M) in WKY rats but significantly increased cerebral vasodilatation in response to bradykinin (52 +/- 4% vs 27 +/- 5%) and A23187 (19 +/- 3% vs 8 +/- 3%) in SHRSP. Cilazapril also tended to increase dilator responses to nitroglycerin and adenosine in SHRSP. In another group of SHRSP, treatment with cilazapril for 4 days produced a moderate reduction in blood pressure and increased cerebral vasodilatation in response to bradykinin, A23187, and adenosine. Topical application of the active form of cilazapril (cilazaprilat) for 40 minutes also increased cerebral vasodilatation in response to bradykinin, A23187, and nitroglycerin in SHRSP. The data indicate that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enhances cerebral vasodilatation in response to endothelium-dependent agonists in SHRSP and may also increase responses to endothelium-independent agonists.", 
    "383": "Our purpose was to evaluate whether early treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril could permanently alter the course of hypertension. Mating pairs of SHR were treated with captopril, and their pups were maintained on captopril until experimentation. Some captopril-treated rats were taken off treatment at 2 months of age, and then some of these rats were mated at 3 months of age. The mean arterial pressures of conscious captopril-treated rats, the rats removed from therapy, and the offspring of the rats removed from therapy were significantly smaller than control rats at 4 and 9 months of age. Central administration of angiotensin I or II induced significantly smaller increases in blood pressure and drinking in captopril-treated rats and the rats removed from therapy compared with control rats. The increase in blood pressure in response to intravenous injection of angiotensin I or II was similar among all groups, with the exception that captopril-treated rats showed lesser pressor responses to angiotensin I. Early administration of captopril, even after administration was stopped, prevented the subsequent development of hypertension in SHR and altered the course of development of hypertension in their progeny. This effect was associated with decreased central responses to angiotensin I and II. Our data suggest that captopril may permanently alter the development of hypertension in SHR through an alteration in the central renin-angiotensin system.",

Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component. Most clinical assessments tended to improve on active therapy.",

Intracoronary nitroglycerin increased coronary blood flow in a dose-dependent fashion in both the captopril and placebo groups (p < 0.001). However, captopril potentiated the effects of all doses of nitroglycerin and shifted the dose-response relationship to the left (p < 0.001).

    "392": "Diabetic nephropathy occurs in approximately 35% of all diabetic patients, both insulin and non-insulin dependent. It accounts for the largest proportion increase of all diseases as a cause for endstage renal disease in the United States. Certain populations, i.e., Pima Indians and Mexican and black Americans, have a higher propensity for developing diabetic nephropathy. The reasons for this increased incidence, however, are unclear. Pathophysiologically, numerous changes in vascular reactivity and renal physiology occur in early diabetes. These include increased sodium avidity, lower threshold for vasoconstriction secondary to angiotensin II and norepinephrine, a greater than 50% of normal increase in renal vasodilation following a protein meal, and loss of renal autoregulation. These differences are not seen in nondiabetic hypertensive subjects. The therapeutic approach to lower elevated arterial pressure in these patients should take these changes in physiology into account. Specifically, antihypertensive agents are preferred that have natriuretic properties and also blunt the effects of vasoconstrictors on both the vasculature and the cellular level, i.e., inhibit mesangial hypertrophy and matrix expansion, the hallmark of diabetes. Ideal agents, therefore, are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the early stages of the disease, and certain calcium antagonists once renal insufficiency occurs. These choices are largely due to the hemodynamic, natriuretic, and anti-proteinuric effects of these agents. Good blood pressure control is essential for preservation of renal function, regardless of agents used. The ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists of the verapamil and diltiazem groups have demonstrated superior efficacy for preservation of renal function over conventional therapy.",

Ten patients with COPD were administered with captopril (25mg sublingually). Hemodynamics blood gases renin activity inducing angiotensin II and angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) and TXB2/6-ketone-PGF1 alpha were studied through Swan-Ganz catheter before and after administration of the drug. Captopril reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance by 22% and 30% respectively. Levels of ACE angiotension II and TXB2/6-ketone-PGF1 alpha were reduced. There was no significant change in blood gases. Heart rate and systemic arterial pressure did not change significantly. These results suggest that captopril is of value in reducing pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.",

Eight of the 14 patients had received antihypertensive drugs such as calcium channel blockers, diuretics or beta-blockers. Captopril was added to these regimens at 25 mg twice daily in 3 patients, and 37.5 mg in 11 patients. Proteinuria decreased from 2.55 +/- 0.48 g/day to 1.58 +/- 0.35 g/day within three months after the start of administration. In 4 patients (28.6%), the extent of reduction was over 50%, and in 8 patients (57.1%), over 25%. Blood pressure, creatinine clearance and serum creatinine were not changed significantly. There was a positive linear correlation between the extent of reduction of proteinuria and the increase in plasma renin activity (r = 0.93, p < 0.001).

    "399": "During the crossover part of the study there was a significant additional blood pressure-lowering effect (at trough) of the combination compared with either amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Similar results were observed for the blood pressures at peak. The fall in blood pressure with lisinopril was related to baseline plasma renin activity, whereas when amlodipine was given, either alone or in combination, the fall in blood pressure was independent of baseline renin activity. The Blacks (n = 5) appeared not to respond as well to lisinopril as the Caucasians (n = 10). Finally, the blood pressure response to amlodipine tended to be associated with the severity of hypertension.", 
    "400": "The results of the present study indicate that: amlodipine and lisinopril in combination have a marked additional effect on blood pressure compared with either given as a monotherapy; their potentiation of action is long-acting; Black patients tend not to respond to the monotherapy with lisinopril as well as Caucasian patients, although they respond similarly to the combination; the response to amlodipine tends to be greater the higher the initial blood pressure; and, finally, the response to lisinopril is greater the higher the plasma renin activity.",

    "404": "Ambulatory blood pressure was measured directly for 24 h by the Oxford technique on three occasions. Off-treatment and on day 8 of treatment with Ro 42-5892 and with enalapril. Ang II was measured by radioimmunoassay after separation by high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "405": "Plasma renin activity and Ang II were lowered by 83% [95% confidence interval (CI) 61-105] and 68% (95% CI 49-87), respectively, 0.5-1 h after Ro 42-5892, but after only 3 h values had returned to baseline. Unlike this rapid and short-term suppression of Ang II, the maximal antihypertensive response to Ro 42-5892 (fall in blood pressure 12.9/9.0 mmHg) occurred only after 6 h. Blood pressure returned to baseline after 8 h. In response to enalapril, Ang II was maximally suppressed by 63% (95% CI 32-94) after 2 h and by 83% (95% CI 76-90) after 8 h. Despite early maximal Ang II suppression, the maximal antihypertensive response to enalapril occurred only after 12 h (fall in blood pressure 25.3/16.3 mmHg). With this compound a significant antihypertensive effect was still present 24 h after dosing.", 
    "406": "Compared with enalapril at 20 mg once a day, repeated oral administration of a single dose of Ro 42-5892 at 600 mg caused only short-term suppression of Ang II and blood pressure. Suppression of Ang II and reduction in blood pressure were temporally dissociated, both with the ACE inhibitor and the renin inhibitor. This implies that the blood pressure lowering effect of these inhibitors is caused partly by Ang II suppression outside the circulation.", 
    "407": "In order to evaluate changes in left ventricular volumes and regional left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction serial two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during a follow-up of 2 years in 206 consecutive patients treated with streptokinase and adjunctive angioplasty in a randomized group of patients. Unexpected progressive left ventricular enlargement was detected both with and without angioplasty. In anterior wall infarction, end-diastolic volume index increased from 55 +/- 14 to 91 +/- 28 ml/m2 (+65%, P < 0.01) and end-systolic volume index increased from 31 +/- 11 to 55 +/- 23 ml/m2 (+79%, P < 0.01), whereas ejection fraction decreased from 45 +/- 9 to 41 +/- 7% (-9%, P = NS). Averaged regional anterior wall motion improved during the first 4 weeks (11 +/- 10 to 16 +/- 12%), but subsequently deteriorated (16 +/- 12 to 10 +/- 6, P < 0.05). The number of segments with pathological wall motion increased. Similar volumetric and regional wall motion data were demonstrated in inferior wall infarction. We believe this reflects a chronic ventricular remodelling phenomenon. This process takes place predominantly during the first 3 months, but continues over the whole follow-up period. Forty percent of the patients suffered symptoms of heart failure on long-term follow-up. Attenuation of progressive ventricular enlargement remains a therapeutic challenge in the long-term care of these patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are promising agents in this regard.", 
    "408": "The goal of this study was to quantitate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on renal sodium handling after furosemide injection. The study was carried out on low and normal salt intake to assess potential interaction with salt balance. Eighteen healthy normotensive volunteers were examined in a double placebo-controlled parallel group design. Subjects were randomly put on either low-salt (20 mmol/day) or normal-salt (110 mmol/day) diet. In either arm of the diet volunteers were first treated orally with placebo for 1 week and subsequently with 2.5 mg/day of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril for another 1 week. Cumulative 24-h urinary sodium excretion was measured on the 6th day of the respective week after sham injection and on the 7th day after injection of 40 mg furosemide. Compared to pretreatment with placebo, pretreatment with cilazapril resulted in a higher cumulative sodium excretion after furosemide injection (day 7) than after the sham injection (day 6) on both salt intakes. The difference in natriuresis (cilazapril versus placebo) was evident 2 and 3 h after injection of furosemide. Neither the time of onset nor the magnitude of antinatriuresis were affected by cilazapril. Following furosemide angiotensin II increased significantly even after cilazapril pretreatment. Cilazapril tended to reduce urinary furosemide excretion. At any given urinary furosemide concentration, the increment in urinary sodium excretion was significantly greater with cilazapril irrespective of salt intake. The study shows that (a) cilazapril increases furosemide-induced natriuresis irrespective of salt intake, (b) antinatriuresis is not affected by cilazapril, and (c) angiotensin II levels rise after furosemide on cilazapril in therapeutic doses.", 
    "409": "Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms, we evaluated the determinants of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in 30 hypertensives with LV hypertrophy (LV mass > 230 g and normal LV diastolic diameter), before (LV mass 319 +/- 26 g) and after normalization of LV mass (196 +/- 21 g) by antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. As a control group we selected 50 normal subjects. Using multiple regression analysis we studied the relative role of preload (LV end-diastolic diameter), afterload (end-systolic wall stress), inotropic state (systolic pressure/end-systolic LV diameter ratio), and LV mass on LV systolic (peak shortening rate of LV diameter) and diastolic function (peak lengthening rate of LV diameter). The major determinant of systolic function was the end-systolic stress in hypertensives before treatment and the systolic pressure/end-systolic LV diameter ratio in normals and in hypertensives after treatment. The major determinant of diastolic function was LV mass in hypertensives before treatment and end-systolic stress in normals and in hypertensives after normalization of LV mass by treatment. Preload seems not to influence LV function in normals and in hypertensives with normal LV diameter. The inotropic state is the major determinant of systolic function in normals and in hypertensives after treatment, whereas this role is played by afterload in hypertensives before treatment. The diastolic function is primarily influenced by after-load in normals and in hypertensives after regression of myocardial hypertrophy, whereas in hypertensives with myocardial hypertrophy LV mass is the major determinant of diastolic function.",

There is a lack of data on concomitant use of hypocholesterolemic agents and antihypertensive drugs with respect to possible interactions and adverse experiences. We studied 293 patients (below 65 years of age) under treatment with either lisinopril (n = 144) or nifedipine (n = 149) for mild to moderate hypertension for 10 weeks, and with serum cholesterol above 6.5 mmol/L, who were randomized to either lovastatin 20 mg every day or placebo in a double-blind, double-dummy design for 6 weeks. Lovastatin effectively lowered cholesterol by 16% and 15% in the lisinopril and nifedipine group respectively (P < .01 compared to placebo for both groups) without any negative impact on the antihypertensive efficacy of either lisinopril or nifedipine. The drugs in combination were well tolerated and did not affect the well-being of the patients, and did not cause any more adverse effects than the antihypertensive agents alone. Liver enzymes increased slightly during lovastatin therapy, while no case of myopathy was reported. Combined therapy with lovastatin and antihypertensive therapy can be safely undertaken.",

After a 1 month placebo run-in period, 30 patients were treated for 1 year with the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or the calcium antagonist isradipine; dose adjustments and the decision to add hydrochlorothiazide were based on conventional blood pressure measurements in the clinic. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded during 24 h in the run-in period and after 16, 24, and 52 weeks of active therapy. The baseline ambulatory blood pressure below which pressure does, on average, not decrease during active treatment was defined as the pressure at which the regression line between the on-treatment pressure and blood pressure in the run-in period intersects the line of identity. The systolic/diastolic blood pressure limits were similar for the three assessments during active treatment and averaged 128/88 mm Hg for daytime, 106/73 mm Hg for nighttime pressure, and 119/81 mm Hg for the whole 24 h, with upper 95% confidence limits of 137/93, 115/78, and 127/86 mm Hg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "412": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well established antihypertensives. Their effect on kidney function, however, seems to depend on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the clinical symptoms. In one part of the Perindopril and Therapeutic Safety Study (PUTS) the effect of a 6-week treatment with placebo or 4 mg/d of perindopril (Coversum, CAS 82834-16-0) on kidney function and albuminuria was investigated in 56 hypertensives with concomitant nephropathy. The study was performed as multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The results show that perindopril reduced blood pressure effectively. The responder rate determined as a fall in blood pressure at least about 10 mmHg in the perindopril group was 39% vs. 21% in the placebo group. All investigated parameters of kidney function like serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary excretion of albumin and alpha 1-microglobulin remained unchanged during the study. In a subgroup of patients with isolated albuminuria ACE inhibition reduced significantly the urinary albumin excretion (perindopril: -292 +/- 205 mg/g creat. vs. placebo: +61 +/- 48 mg/g creat: p < 0.05). From this study it can be concluded that in hypertension with concomitant nephropathy, except renovascular hypertension and hypertension in renal transplant recipients, ACE inhibition by perindopril will not impair kidney function. In the early phase of nephropathy with isolated albuminuria and normal serum creatinine perindopril improves albuminuria and seems to be even of benefit for the kidney.",

Groups of 51 CMH (about 200 days old) were orally treated with HCTZ (6 mg/kg), captopril (30 mg/kg), a combination of both drugs or vehicle alone (control group), for 217 days. Then survivors were sacrificed and the hearts weighed. The survival of the animals treated with HCTZ alone or in combination with captopril was similar, and was clearly increased when compared to controls (more than 70 days increase in median survival time). A more modest increase in survival occurred in animals treated with captopril alone. The efficacy of the diuretic therapy was consistent with fluid retention being the primary cause of death in CMH and demonstrated the usefulness of the model for the testing of new diuretics. HCTZ or captopril alone had no effect on the heart weight of survivors. However a reduction of cardiac hypertrophy (-18%) was seen when captopril and HCTZ were coadministered. This effect of the ACE inhibitor was considered to result from antagonism of the compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system occurring in response to diuretic therapy.",

Calcium deposit localized by pyroantimonate method was significantly decreased or disappeared on plasmic membrane and was markedly increased in cytoplasma, intramitochondria and I- and A- bands of myofilament in patients with heart failure due to chronic rheumatic heart valvular disease. The degree of intracellular calcium deposit was consistent with the injury of myocardial ultrastructure, suggesting that calcium overload may be one of the major causes of myocardial injury and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers may be useful for protecting myocardium and improving cardiac function.", 
    "415": "Combined recirculation of the rat liver (L) and kidney (IPK) at 10 ml min-1 per organ (LK) was developed to examine the hepatorenal handling of the precursor-metabolite pair: [14C]-enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat. Loading doses followed by constant infusion of [14C]enalapril and preformed [3H]enalaprilat to the reservoirs of the IPK or the LK preparation was used to achieve steady state conditions. In both organs, enalapril was mostly metabolized to its dicarboxylic acid metabolite, enalaprilat, which was excreted unchanged. At steady state, the fractional excretion for [14C]enalapril (FE = 0.45 to 0.48) and preformed [3H]enalaprilat (FE[pmi] = 1.1) were constant and similar for both the IPK and LK. The additivity of clearance was demonstrated in the LK preparation, namely, the total clearance of enalapril was the sum of its hepatic and renal clearances. However, the apparent fractional excretion for formed [14C]enalaprilat, FE(mi) and the apparent urinary clearance were time-dependent and higher than the corresponding values for preformed [3H]enalaprilat in both the IPK and LK. The FE(mi) and urinary clearance values further differed between the IPK and LK. Biliary clearance of formed vs. preformed enalaprilat displayed the same discrepant trends as observed for FE(mi) vs. FE(pmi) for the LK. These observations on the time-dependent and variable excretory clearance (urinary or biliary) of the formed metabolite vs. the constant, and much reduced, excretory clearance of the preformed metabolite are due to dual contributions to formed metabolite excretion: the nascently formed, intracellular metabolite which immediately underwent excretion and the formed metabolite which reentered the circulation, behaved as a preformed species. When data for the IPK and LK preparations were modeled with a physiological model with parameters previously reported for the L and IPK, all data, including metabolite excretory clearances, were well predicted. Model simulations revealed that the apparent FE(mi) differed between the LK and IPK preparations when the liver was present as an additional metabolite formation organ; the apparent excretory (urinary or biliary) clearance of the formed metabolite was further modulated by the volume of distribution of the metabolite, which altered levels of the formed, circulating metabolite.", 
    "416": "Single-pass and recirculating rat liver perfusion studies were conducted with [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat, a precursor-product pair, and the data were modeled according to a physiological model to compare the different biliary clearances for the solely formed metabolite, [14C]enalaprilat, with that of preformed [3H]enalaprilat. With single-pass perfusion, the apparent extraction ratio (or biliary clearance) of formed [14C]enalaprilat was 15-fold the extraction ratio of preformed [3H]enalaprilat, an observation attributed to the presence of a barrier for cellular entry of the metabolite. Upon recirculation of bolus doses of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat, the biliary clearance, estimated conventionally as metabolite excretion rate/midtime metabolite concentration, for formed [14C]enalaprilat was again 10- to 15-fold higher than the biliary clearance for preformed [3H]enalaprilat, but this decayed with perfusion time and gradually approached values for preformed [3H]enalaprilat. The decreasing biliary clearance of formed enalaprilat with recirculation was explained by the dual contribution of the circulating and intrahepatic metabolite (formed from circulating drug) to excretion. Physiological modeling predicted (i) an influx barrier (from blood to cell) at the sinusoidal membrane as the rate-limiting process in the overall removal of enalaprilat, (ii) a 15-fold greater extraction ratio or biliary clearance for formed [14C]enalaprilat over [3H]enalaprilat during single-pass perfusion, and (iii) the time-dependent and declining behaviour of the biliary clearance for formed [14C]enalaprilat during recirculation of the medium. In the absence of a direct knowledge of eliminating organs in vivo, this variable pattern for excretory clearance of the formed metabolite within the organ is indicative of a metabolite formation organ.", 
    "417": "Alatriopril is a dual inhibitor of two cell surface metallopeptidases which play important roles in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and renal function: the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) which catalyses transformation of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and the neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11; atriopeptidase), responsible for the degradation of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of alatrioprilat, the active part of alatriopril, in 6 anesthetized, closed-chest beagle dogs instrumented for the measurement of arterial pressure (aortic catheter), cardiac output (thermodilution), as well as femoral and renal artery flows (Doppler). Animal received alatrioprilat at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg (i.v. bolus). Hemodynamic parameters were measured at baseline, then 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after administration of each dose. In addition, plasma ANF and ACE activity were determined at baseline and 30 min after administration. At the dose of 1 mg/kg, alatrioprilat dit not induce marked hemodynamic effects, except a transient hypotension which appeared within the first 10 min after administration and lasted less than 10 min. Neither plasma ANF nor angiotensin converting enzyme activity were affected by this dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses, identified with the preoperative angiogram, were excluded. Systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular pressures were measured using a femoral catheter and a pulmonary artery catheter respectively. Cardiac output (Q) was determined by thermodilution. [table: see text] Captopril and nifedipine significantly decreased pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and right atrial pressure. No deterioration of renal function was observed. In conclusion, captopril and nifedipine SL are effective and well tolerated for the treatment of high blood pressure after abdominal aortic surgery.",

After a renal angiography, 88 hypertensive patients suspected of renovascular hypertension were classified according to the percentage of stenosis in the main renal artery: class I (< 30% - n = 50), II (30 to < 75% - n = 21), III (75 to < 90% - n = 8) and IV (90 to 100% - n = 11).

Baseline ABP has been analysed both as a continuous variable and as a categorical one (high when > 139/87 mmHg, low otherwise). Pulse pressure was calculated by the difference systolic ABP-diastolic ABP, whereas BP variability was estimated by the standard deviation and the variation coefficient of each recording. The results are given as percentage (mean +/- standard deviation). In the patients with high baseline systolic ABP, ACEI and CA did not significantly differ regarding their effects on pulse pressure (-11.1 +/- 17.2 vs -6.3 +/- 14.0, NS). By contrast, in the other patients, pulse pressure was lowered to a significantly greater degree by ACEI than by CA (-5.5 +/- 18.7 vs +1.8 +/- 18.8, p = 0.04). These differences were not related to baseline diastolic ABP. No difference at all was found with regard to BP variability which was altered by none of the drugs. In conclusion, pulse pressure, a reliable indicator of arterial compliance, seemed to be more decreased by ACEI than by CA, the difference being significant only in patients with apparent hypertension.", 
    "422": "The effects of de-endothelialization and angiotensin II (A II) on smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth are still controversial. Cell culture experiments suggest an hypertrophic effect of AII, whereas in vivo experiments in de-endothelialized arteries using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors suggest a possible role of AII on proliferation and/or migration of SMC. Phenotype of SMC in culture does not necessarily reflect that in the whole organ. Yet, in vivo models are too complex to permit conclusions as to the proper effect of AII or endothelium. Therefore, we examined the effect of de-endothelialization and AII on SMC growth in an organ culture of vessel wall. Rabbit thoracic descending aortas (n = 42) held at their in vivo length, perfused at 40 ml/min and pressurized to 70 mmHg (P70) were maintained in DME medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum for periods of time varying between 0 and 15 days. In another group (n = 26), aortas were relaxed and not pressurized (P0). In each group, some arteries were de-endothelialized; 21 arteries were exposed to AII (10(-6) M) and indomethacin (10(-5) M) during the incubation. SMC proliferation was evaluated by 3H-thymidine uptake by the vessel wall. Statistics were performed using covariance analysis. In P0 group, de-endothelialization or AII had no effect on the vessel wall. In P70 group, de-endothelialization or led to a significant increase in media area which was reported to extracellular matrix synthesis and in 3H-thymidine uptake (p < 0.005) which peaked at 3-5 days and returned to basis levels at 6-8 days. All had no effect on 3H-thymidine uptake (p = 0.516) in P70 group. Our results obtained in rabbit aortic organ culture suggest that de-endothelialization induces SMC growth depending on pressure and/or wall stretching. AII, per se, had no additional effect on SMC growth in this model.",

    "425": "We examined the long-term cost effectiveness of treating hypertensive patients aged 47 to 65 yrs with agents that promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors were compared with standard therapy. To estimate the effect of drug therapy on LVH regression, we pooled data from 25 studies. We estimated the effects of LVH regression on cardiovascular outcomes using Framingham data and the studies of Devereux. The estimated costs of differing treatment strategies included average costs of drug therapy and follow-up care, and direct costs of lost productivity owing to untoward outcomes. Patients were classified by initial left ventricular mass index (LVMI) as low (< 95 g/m2), moderate (95-125 g/m2) and high risk (> 125 g/m2). The data suggested that all three agents reduce LVMI in moderate- and high-risk groups. The respective average reductions in LVMI in high risk and moderate risk were 20% and 12% for ACE inhibitors, 18% and 8% for beta-blockers, and 5% and 6% for calcium channel blockers. We estimated the relative improvement in cardiovascular morbidity/mortality from LVH reversal required for overall cost savings with each drug class compared with a standard regimen. Patients treated with calcium channel blockers needed to realise at least 72% of the expected reduction in cardiovascular outcomes from LVH regression for this strategy to be less costly. For ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, only 32% and 26%, respectively, of the expected reduction in poor outcomes from LVH reversal were required for these agents to be more cost effective. Long-term costs of treatment with ACE inhibitors versus beta-blockers were similar. A 25% higher treatment cost of ACE inhibitors was offset by a greater effectiveness in reversing LVH with attendant lower rates of cardiovascular complications.",

After baseline measurements, the patients were randomized to placebo (n = 16) or enalapril (10 mg BID, n = 26). In the placebo group, the changes in left ventricular function were characterized by increases in end-diastolic (159 +/- 43 to 170 +/- 44 mL/m2) and end-systolic (119 +/- 38 to 128 +/- 49 mL/m2) volumes accompanied by a downward and rightward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation. In contrast, decreases in end-diastolic (166 +/- 43 to 156 +/- 47 mL/m2) and end-systolic (125 +/- 43 to 111 +/- 42 mL/m2) volumes accompanied by a slight upward and leftward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation were noted in the enalapril group. These changes in left ventricular volumes were significantly different between groups (both P < .005) but were not attended by changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, in time constant of isovolumic pressure decrease, or in right ventricular volumes. However, the chamber stiffness constant beta decreased from 0.044 +/- 0.027 to 0.032 +/- 0.019 mL-1/m2 in the placebo group, whereas it increased insignificantly in the enalapril group (0.040 +/- 0.028 to 0.041 +/- 0.028 mL-1/m2). These changes in chamber stiffness constant beta between baseline and follow-up were significantly different between placebo and enalapril groups (P < .05). Another index of chamber compliance, delta V/delta P, also confirmed the presence of opposite changes in left ventricular chamber compliance in the placebo group and in the enalapril group. The mean diastolic wall stress increased with placebo but not with enalapril (+51 versus -13 kdyn/cm2; P < .04) whereas left ventricular mass and the indexes of left ventricular sphericity tended to improve in the enalapril group.

This vector incorporates a six base 3' context sequence, which permits readthrough of the stop codon for the TMV 130K protein gene, inserted between the stop codon for the coat protein (CP) gene and ACEI gene. In contrast to previous TMV RNA vectors, the new vector produced both an intact CP and a fused protein consisting of CP and ACEI (CP-ACEI). As a result, the vector could form virus particles and spread systemically from inoculated to non-inoculated leaves. In tomato plants, production of ACEI in fruit was also achieved.", 
    "439": "Reduction of infarct size by calcium channel blockers, given at reperfusion, has been reported with diltiazem and clentiazem after 6 h of reperfusion following a 90-min coronary occlusion in the dog. The aims of the present study were to establish that the postischemic cardioprotection is not simply a delay in cell death, but a sustained or permanent myocardial salvage. Dogs with a 90-min occlusion of the left descending coronary artery underwent reperfusion for 72 h. Five minutes before reperfusion, they received, at random, i.v. saline (controls) or clentiazem (125 micrograms/kg i.v.), followed by infusion of 1 microgram/kg/min, until sacrifice. Transmural collateral flow measured 15 min after occlusion with radioactive microspheres was not statistically different between groups [(means +/- SE) control: 0.123 +/- 0.040; treated: 0.150 +/- 0.042 ml/min/g]. The area at risk (percentage of left ventricle), delimited by Evans blue perfusion was also similar (control: 39.9 +/- 1.5%; treated: 42.4 +/- 1.6%). Infarct size, estimated as percentage of the area at risk by triphenyltetrazolium chloride and histology, was reduced (p < 0.05) in treated dogs (control, 42.4 +/- 4.7%; treated, 26.5 +/- 5.4%) with collateral flow (> 0.02 ml/min/g), but not in those with virtually no (< 0.02 ml/min/g) collateral flow (control, 62.0 +/- 8.9%; treated, 72.7 +/- 6.8%).

The action potential duration was not altered, but the resting potential was increased by 10.5 mV (SE +/- 4.4). Enalaprilat had no effect on ri probably because the molecule is a diacid and does not cross the cell membrane.

This species was selected because this human renin inhibitor inhibits guinea pig renin. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured by [3H]inulinmethoxy and [14C]aminohippuric acid clearances. Animals were perfused with isotonic saline at 0.2 ml/min. After a stabilization period of 1 h, drugs were given as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus (DuP 753, 1; MK 521, 0.1; Ro 42-5892, 1 mg/kg), followed by continuous infusion (DuP 753, 3; MK 521, 0.3; Ro 42-5892, 3 mg/kg/h).

    "442": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol in decreasing the severity of proteinuria in hypertensive patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied 20 hypertensive patients. All patients had proteinuria (> 3 g/24 h) and were receiving insulin treatment. Proteinuria was measured monthly in the run-in period (3 months) and during the active drug treatment (8 months). Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, and total renal resistance were determined after the run-in and treatment periods. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril 20 mg/day or atenolol 100 mg/day for 8 months. In both groups blood pressure decreased significantly. After 8 months' treatment, severity of proteinuria significantly decreased both in the enalapril-treated group and in the group receiving atenolol. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow significantly increased, while total renal resistance decreased in the patients given enalapril, whereas glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and total renal resistance significantly decreased in the patients given atenolol. The results of this study show that enalapril and atenolol reduce proteinuria in hypertensive diabetic patients by a mechanism related to their antihypertensive effects; furthermore, the beneficial effects of enalapril might be also linked to intrarenal effects.", 
    "443": "Amiodarone is a viable drug for preventing sudden cardiac death, particularly during the first year after MI. If larger trials confirm the aforementioned prospective trials of Ceremuzynski et al, Cairns et al, and the BASIS trial, the efficacy of amiodarone would outweigh the risk of its side effects during the first year after MI. Based on the long-term observation from the BASIS trial, the duration of amiodarone therapy need not be more than 1 year--which, as we have learned, is when these post-MI patients would benefit most from the drug. It is also likely that the effects of amiodarone would complement those of aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The SAVE, CONSENSUS II, and SOLVD trials demonstrated that captopril and enalapril did not reduce the mortality rate during the first year after MI, nor did they reduce the sudden cardiac death rate. Their beneficial effects became evident only during the second year and thereafter. Unlike other antiarrhythmic agents of various classes, amiodarone possesses antiarrhythmic properties but does not exert deleterious effects on ventricular function. More studies are needed to determine if the benefit of amiodarone could be enhanced by combination therapy (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, or beta-blockers). Whether amiodarone will provide the same protection for patients who have poor left ventricular function or congestive heart failure is not known. The European and VA cooperative studies should help answer this question. If it turns out that amiodarone is beneficial, one must then determine whether higher doses of the drug will offer more protection, and, if so, if that greater protection would be offset by increased toxicity. How much amiodarone should be given to offer the most protection with the least risk? Another intriguing research question is this: If we treat patients with amiodarone for more than 1 year, would the drug continue to improve the mortality rate in subsequent years? Other studies are needed in patients at very high risk of sudden cardiac death (ie, those who have a low ejection fraction and high-density VPDs). A study comparing amiodarone and sotalol in high-risk patients for sudden cardiac death is also needed. These clinical studies should be carried out with basic science research investigating the actions of amiodarone at the molecular and cellular level in order to give us a better understanding of how the drug works.",

    "447": "The action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on the consequences of myocardial reoxygenation and oxidative damage was assessed in cultured chick embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes. Lisinopril, 10(-8) M to 10(-6) M, produced a significant (P < 0.05) dose-dependent enhancement of the restoration of contractile frequency occurring during myocardial reoxygenation but did not alter the depression in contractile frequency during hypoxia. Lisinopril significantly (P < 0.05) shifted the dose-response relationship of ammonium persulfate-induced reduction in cardiac contractile frequency. Lisinopril significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the effect of another oxidative agent, tertbutylhydroperoxide which produced a time-dependent reduction in cardiac contractile frequency. Lisinopril did not alter cardiac contractile frequency in the absence of hypoxia or ammonium persulfate or tertbutylhydroperoxide. The viability of cardiomyocytes, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, paralleled the changes in cardiac contractile frequency. Lisinopril significantly (P < 0.05) improved viability of cardiomyocytes exposed to either ammonium persulfate or tertbutylhydroperoxide. Lisinopril did not display any antioxidant properties against the free radical alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl. These data suggest that lisinopril accelerates the recovery of cardiomyocytes during reoxygenation and blunts the effects of oxidative agents through mechanisms involving the endogenous renin angiotensin system and/or a direct cellular action.",

This investigation was undertaken to determine whether intensive antihypertensive therapy with two or more drugs can correct or reduce ischemia in black hypertensive patients. Thallium myocardial stress imaging and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies were performed on 13 black patients with essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease due to hypertensive heart disease (without significant obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease). The studies were made at baseline and after 4 to 48 months of intensive treatment, with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as the main components of the antihypertensive drug regimen. The majority of the patients with abolition or reversal of myocardial ischemia documented by 201Tl-myocardial imaging also had a significant reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM). However, some patients either did not have LV hypertrophy at baseline or had changes in LVM beyond the precision of the echocardiographic M-mode mass calculations. The finding indicated that factors other than reduction of LVM were involved in the reversal of the ischemia. The most likely factor was a change in the regulation of coronary blood flow. Reduction in LVM and reversal of myocardial ischemia determined either by electrocardiography or by thallium myocardial imaging studies may be considered indicators of the effectiveness of treatment.",

Microalbuminuria is an early sign of renal damage found in 20% to 30% of cases of essential hypertension and foretells the development of nephropathy and other complications. Current general guidelines for managing hypertension associated with renal impairment recommend controlling blood pressure, pharmacologically if necessary; adding a diuretic, if initial monotherapy is not effective; and reducing dietary sodium intake. Diuretic drugs remain the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy for patients with renal failure, whereas beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have varying effects and continue to be investigated intensively.

Glomerular injury may be mediated by injury to endothelial cells, which, having lost their thromboresistance, may initiate intravascular coagulation and alter the balance between endothelin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor.

Blood pressure was reduced in a similar manner to that observed with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg intragastrically). SC-51316 had no effect on heart rate. In conscious, sodium-deficient dogs, administration of SC-51316 (30 mg/kg orally) or enalapril (10 mg/kg orally) lowered blood pressure similarly over a 24 h observation period. Thus, SC-51316 antagonizes the activity of AII in vivo and is an orally active, antihypertensive agent.", 
    "474": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure. Despite significant progress in our knowledge of the physiopathology of heart failure, the cause for decompensation in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is still obscure. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat has been found to improve electromechanical coupling of heart cells in animal models. To assess the effects of enalaprilat on ventricular electromechanical coupling in humans, we studied the His bundle electrograms and hemodynamics in 22 hypertensive patients with LVH. Patients received either 2.5 mg enalaprilat or saline placebo intravenously in a double-blind protocol. There were no significant changes in heart rate, and atrioventricular and His-Purkinje conduction times. Ventricular activity duration was reduced from 110 +/- 11 msec to 88 +/- 13 msec after enalaprilat administration (P < .01). Enalaprilat decreased peak-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular pressures, and arterial and pulmonary pressures, as well as pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. End-systolic wall stress decreased 18% (P < .01), ejection fraction increased 11% (P < .01), and end-diastolic pressure-volume ratio decreased 50% (P < .001) after enalaprilat administration. There were no significant changes in these parameters after saline infusion. It is concluded that enalaprilat reduces ventricular activation duration and improves ventricular performance in hypertensive patients with LVH. Data suggest that enalaprilat significantly improves excitation-contraction coupling in these patients.", 
    "475": "This study aimed to assess the left ventricular diastolic function of borderline hypertensive patients (BHT) and to determine the effect of long-term blood pressure control by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on the left ventricular filling profile. Pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were obtained from 18 BHT (14 men, 4 women; mean age: 55 years) and 20 age-sex matched normotensive controls. Studies were done at rest and immediately after exercise on a supine ergometer bicycle. Of the 18 patients, 11 were treated with delapril (30 mg/day) and followed up with longitudinal studies for 24 weeks. At baseline, BHT had a normal left ventricular structure. They showed a decreased peak velocity of early filling (E) (43 +/- 7 v 56 +/- 13 cm/sec, P < .01) and E/A ratio (0.83 +/- 0.2 v 1.08 +/- 0.3, P < .01), whereas peak velocity of late filling (A) and deceleration time (Dec T) were similar in the two groups. Exercise-enhanced filling indices were observed in both groups. Following blood pressure control, no change was observed in the left ventricular morphology. In contrast, progressive improvement of resting and after exercise peak velocity of early filling and E/A ratio were achieved. This indicates that long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition ameliorates cardiac function in borderline hypertension.", 
    "476": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on collateral-dependent blood flow (BF) during exercise. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 320 g) were fed zabicipril, an ACE inhibitor, mixed with powdered food at 0.0, 0.3, and 3.0 mg.kg-1 x day-1 (n = 12/group) for 5-7 days. Under ketamine-acepromazine anesthesia, the carotid and caudal arteries were catheterized for BF determination, and both femoral arteries were ligated to remove the primary route for BF to the distal limb tissue. Later on the same day, collateral-dependent hindlimb BF was determined at two treadmill speeds (15 and 25 m/min at 15% grade) with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled 15-microns microspheres. Zabicipril ingestion induced 50 and 65% inhibition of plasma ACE activity in the low- and high-dose group, respectively (P < 0.001). ACE inhibition did not affect body weight, blood pressure, or heart rate of the rats during exercise. However, BFs to the total hindlimb were 44 and 36% higher (P < 0.001) in zabicipril-treated animals than in the zero-dose controls (approximately 45 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1). Furthermore, BFs to the proximal hindlimb, distal hindlimb, and gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus group were 33-44% greater in drug-treated than in control animals (P < 0.025). Higher speed (25 m/min) failed to further increase muscle BF; therefore peak BFs were likely achieved. These results indicate that collateral-dependent BF was improved by ACE inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "477": "It has been reported that the urinary excretions of chloride (Cl), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg), but not sodium (Na), after furosemide, a loop diuretic, were decreased by pretreatment with lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor in hypertensive subjects. The electrolytes disturbance induced by furosemide might be ameliorated by lisinopril. The present study re-examines this potential drug interaction in healthy subjects. Lisinopril (20 mg) or its matching placebo was given orally using a double-blind, crossover design. Four hours after lisinopril administration, furosemide (20 mg) was injected intravenously and urine was collected during the following intervals: 0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-1.5, 1.5-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-6 hours. Blood samples for plasma furosemide concentration were obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after the agent. There were no significant differences between the two trials in plasma concentrations of furosemide or urinary excretions of the agent. Urine volume and urinary excretions of electrolytes (Na, Cl, K, and Mg) after the furosemide with lisinopril administration were not significantly different from those of placebo at any observation period. These results suggest that the urinary excretions of electrolytes after furosemide administration are not influenced by pretreatment with lisinopril.", 
    "478": "Patients with congestive cardiac failure have elevated sympathetic activity at rest which contributes to the pathophysiology of this syndrome. In addition, the sympathetic response to exercise in these patients is abnormal. Sympathetic activity is accurately reflected by serum noradrenaline levels. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, 16 patients of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, stabilised on optimum doses of diuretics were randomised into two equal groups, to receive either low-dose Lisinopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or matching placebo, over a 12 week period. At the end of the 12 week treatment phase, there was no significant change in noradrenaline levels at rest (p = 0.33) mid exercise (p = 0.17), or peak exercise (p = 0.69), in the lisinopril group. Both lisinopril and placebo groups improved subjectively as assessed by change in NYHA grade, (p < 0.01 for placebo and p < 0.001 for those given lisinopril). Exercise duration improved significantly in the lisinopril group (p = 0.0296), but not in the placebo group after treatment. Low dose lisinopril is of use in congestive cardiac failure even in the absence of measurable changes in sympathetic tone.", 
    "479": "We tested the effect of renal insufficiency, with and without angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, on blood and brain atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in rats. Two ACEs, one which penetrates into the CNS and one which does not, were used to distinguish between peripheral and central ACE effects. Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6-NPX) by ligation of renal arterial branches. After seven days, 28 5/6-NPX rats received lisinopril 20 mg/kg/day and 28 5/6-NPX rats received quinapril 30 mg/kg/day orally for five days, while 28 5/6-NPX control rats and 28 sham rats did not. Body weight, blood pressure, drinking and urine volume were monitored. At sacrifice, urine, plasma, and brain tissue was collected. ANF in 16 brain areas was measured by radioimmunoassay. 5/6-NPX resulted in increased blood pressure, increased urine volume, proteinuria, and increased drinking. Both ACEs lowered blood pressure to sham values and decreased proteinuria. Both ACEs increased plasma renin activity and decreased plasma ANF. However, only lisinopril decreased drinking and urine volume. 5/6-NPX increased ANF values in six brain areas, namely the periventricular preoptic nucleus, the arcuate nucleus, the perifornical nucleus, the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the dorsal raphe nucleus compared to sham rats. These same increases in brain ANF were also observed in 5/6-NPX rats given quinapril, compared to shams. However, lisinopril lowered ANF to sham levels in the periventricular preoptic nucleus, the arcuate nucleus, and the perifornical nucleus. In the three additional brain areas, namely the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the dorsal raphe nucleus, lisinopril did not effect the elevated ANF concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "480": "The free radical scavenging effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor containing sulfhydryl (SH; captopril) were compared with those of ACE inhibitors not containing SH (enalapril, enalaprilat, delapril and its de-esterified products). Electron spin resonance (ESR) using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trap showed that enalapril and delapril (0.6-4.8 mmol/l) inhibited hydroxyl radicals concentration-dependently. Captopril (2.4-10 mmol/l), enalaprilat and the de-esterified product of delapril (1.2-4.8 mmol/l) also inhibited hydroxyl radicals in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of captopril and enalapril (2.4-4.8 mmol/l) on the scavenging of superoxide anion radical were also concentration-dependent. Delapril, its de-esterified product, and enalaprilat weakly inhibited superoxide anion radical. These results indicate that both SH- and non-SH-containing ACE inhibitors scavenge hydroxyl radical more strongly than the superoxide anion radical and that the free radical scavenging action of ACE inhibitors is probably not related only to the presence of the SH radical.", 
    "481": "During administration of loop diuretics the initial volume depletion activates Na-conserving mechanisms, which reduces glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and stimulates renal tubular reabsorption of Na and water. By i.v. infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (100 micrograms bolus; 100 micrograms/h) we examined the role of angiotensin II for the compensatory renal responses occurring during furosemide administration in conscious rats. To evaluate the significance of hydration for the compensatory renal effects of angiotensin II, experiments were performed in groups of rats with or without i.v. replacement of urinary volume losses. Furosemide was administered i.v. (6 mg/kg/h) for 3 1/2 hr. Furosemide infusion produced a short-lasting increase in urine flow rate, Na, Li and K excretion after which the renal excretion rates returned toward pretreatment levels, along with significant reductions in effective renal plasma flow and GFR and increases in effective filtration fraction and effective renal vascular resistance. Sustained increases in urine flow and urinary excretion rates of Na, Li and K were observed in absence of changes in GFR in rats given furosemide with volume replacement. Enalaprilat did not alter the tubular response to furosemide during either euvolemia or volume depletion. However, enalaprilat attenuated the furosemide-induced increases in effective filtration fraction and effective renal vascular resistance. It is concluded that angiotensin II is not essential for the compensatory response of decreased GFR and increased tubular Na reabsorption. However, angiotensin II is an important mediator of renal vasoconstriction during furosemide infusion.", 
    "482": "Angiotensin (Ang) I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of congestive heart failure, and tissue, rather than circulating ACE, may be their major site of action. However, assessments of tissue ACE inhibition in treated patients has not always supported this contention. In these studies, ACE activity was measured in homogenates of sampled tissue by biochemical methods. In the present study, using a model system, we have examined the validity of these tissue-sampling methods. Functional ACE activity was determined by comparing positive inotropic responses to [Pro10]Ang I in either vehicle-pretreated or ACE inhibitor-pretreated papillary muscles. [Pro10]Ang I elicits a response, which is entirely dependent on ACE-mediated conversion to Ang II. The ACE inhibitors studied were captopril, enalaprilat, lisinopril, and quinaprilat. In a parallel study, papillary muscle ACE activity was also measured in homogenates using [125I]MK-351A (a radiolabeled ACE inhibitor) binding. The studies indicate that the tissue-sampling method significantly underestimated functional ACE inhibition in hamster papillary muscles (p < 0.001). Kinetic studies indicated that the half-time for the dissociation of [3H]enalaprilat and [3H]lisinopril from hamster ventricular ACE was 4.5 and 6.2 minutes, respectively. The dissociation of [3H]quinaprilat was biphasic (half-time, 47 and 90 minutes), indicating that the two active sites of somatic ACE differ in their ability to bind to this inhibitor. The rapid rate of ACE inhibitor dissociation suggests that, during the time taken to assay ACE activity biochemically, the enzyme becomes \"disinhibited,\" leading to an underestimation of functional ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitor dissociation rates were partially predictive of the duration of functional ACE inhibition in papillary muscles; other factors that appeared to contribute were \"tissue trapping\" of the inhibitor and de novo synthesis of ACE in papillary muscles. Quantification of tissue ACE inhibition and its relation to drug efficacy must, therefore, involve a careful consideration of these factors to avoid artifacts in clinical decision making and in assessments of pathogenic mechanisms involved in congestive heart failure.", 
    "483": "Ten patients with severe (NYHAIII) heart failure were compared with 10 age-matched healthy subjects in terms of oxygen uptake and minute ventilation at rest and during exercise and calf and forearm blood flow measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and after a standardized exercise test. Patients performed a symptom-limited treadmill exercise test and were then treated with enalapril for 5 weeks; the various measurements were repeated at weekly intervals. Oxygen consumption (VO2) at rest was similar in the patients and controls. During exercise, patients VO2 tended to be lower at each workload, but this was not affected by enalapril treatment. Minute ventilation was higher at rest and at each exercise stage in the patients than in the control subjects, and this was significantly reduced by enalapril treatment. Compared with the controls (2.94 +/- 0.10 and 2.93 +/- 0.20 ml.100 ml-1.min-1) forearm and calf blood flow measured by venous occlusion plethysmography was reduced at rest in the patients (1.34 +/- 0.18 and 1.24 +/- 0.11 ml.100 ml-1.min-1). but was significantly increased by enalapril treatment (1.73 +/- 0.15 and 1.60 +/- 0.16 ml.100 ml-1.min-1). Submaximal leg exercise to a fixed VO2 showed attenuation of the normal vasoconstriction in the forearm and vasodilatation of the calf; enalapril treatment changed these responses significantly towards normal but a marked abnormality of flow pattern persisted.",

    "486": "The diagnostic work-up of renovascular hypertension is still controversial. The efficacy of renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA) before and after captopril (scintigraphic captopril test) was evaluated in a multicentre study. All 380 hypertensive patients in the study underwent renal arteriography; 125 had renal arterial stenosis > or = 70%, and 54 had a technically successful intervention to correct the stenosis. The post-captopril study had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% for predicting blood pressure response to intervention, if renal function was normal and a combination of quantitative parameters was applied (individual kidney uptake index < 40%, time to peak activity < 2 min or > 10 min). In the entire population renal artery stenosis > or = 70% was detected with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 93% if renal function was normal. In patients with abnormal renal function the performance of the test was worse, owing to a lower specificity which could be increased by using only time parameters. The performance of the test was optimal when the post-captopril findings were examined; no improvement was achieved by evaluation of the changes induced by captopril from the baseline. The test can thus be simplified by performing only a post-captopril study for routine use: a negative test would exclude a curable form of renovascular hypertension in > 80% and a positive test would predict it in > 90% of the patients selected for suspicion of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "487": "As a consequence of persistently raised blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) develops as a compensatory mechanism for wall stress induced by the increase in afterload. Recent advances in the fields of molecular biology and genetics are now clarifying the mechanisms involved in the development of LVH. It has been reported that messenger RNA of oncogenes, such as c-fos and c-myc, increases by stretching; these oncogenes contribute to the progression of LVH, the messenger RNA expression of myosin and contractile protein synthesis in the cardiomyocytes. Vasoactive hormones and vascular contracting factors are also reported to have a progressive effect on LVH. In contrast, some antihypertensive agents have been shown to have pharmacological effects on regression of LVH in animals and man. The mechanisms responsible for LVH progression have been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms of LVH regression have not been defined and require elucidation. This paper outlines the basic recognition of the mechanisms of LVH progression and discusses the varied pharmacological actions of calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the regression of LVH in man and rats. Although the role of antihypertensive therapy in regression of LVH remains controversial, the calcium antagonist nicardipine appears to have an important role to play in the treatment of LVH in hypertension and in congestive heart failure.", 
    "488": "The use of calcium antagonists in patients with severe dysfunction is controversial because agents like verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine have been shown to worsen or precipitate congestive heart failure. However, successive improvements in our understanding of the clinical pharmacology of these drugs, of their pharmacokinetics and of their action on several neuro-humoral regulatory mechanisms have led to a continuous improvement of the molecules available. Promising results have been obtained with nisoldipine in patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction (improved exercise tolerance, improved diastolic filling probably related to a relative improvement of chronically ischaemic areas) and other studies are exploring the effects of the combination of nisoldipine with an ACE-inhibitor. Soon, these trials should tell us if there is a real clinical benefit in the use of this agent not only to improve symptoms but also to slow down progression of the ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "489": "Diltiazem is a benzothiazepine derivative calcium antagonist available in several formulations, some of which enable once daily administration. The drug as monotherapy has demonstrated similar efficacy to diuretics in older patients with hypertension. Data comparing diltiazem with beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are more limited, but available studies suggest at least comparable antihypertensive efficacy. Diltiazem as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor-antagonist, isosorbide dinitrate, or another calcium antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with effort angina. The drug has also been used intravenously to terminate supraventricular tachycardias and to control the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation or flutter; it also appears to reduce the rate of early reinfarction in patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. The most common adverse events during diltiazem therapy include headache, flushing, peripheral oedema and hypotension. Atrioventricular block although rare, is the most frequent serious adverse event related to diltiazem therapy and may be exacerbated by coadministration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, especially in the elderly. Thus, diltiazem appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for hypertension and angina in older patients and has shown promise as therapy for supraventricular tachycardias and as prophylaxis against early reinfarction in patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.", 
    "490": "The segment of the population considered to be 'elderly' is consistently growing. At the same time, the number of patients with congestive heart failure continues to grow. Therefore, it is important to consider whether older patients with congestive heart failure have characteristics that identify an aging effect in addition to the obvious abnormalities produced by heart failure. Furthermore, it is important to determine the relevance of these abnormalities to the use of pharmacological therapy. Within a population of 128 consecutive heart failure patients, age-related increases of systemic vascular resistance, changes in baroreceptor responses, and increases of plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) levels were identified. In addition, an age-related reduction of renal function was clearly evident in patients > 65 years of age. These changes affect the use of digoxin, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Most notably, marked reduction of renal function in such patients must be considered in the drug treatment of heart failure.", 
    "491": "Hypertension in animal models and in humans is associated with a decreased vasodilator response to acetylcholine which causes vascular relaxation by release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from the endothelium. Since lowering of blood pressure, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, improved the response to acetylcholine we investigated the effects of brachial artery infusions of ascending dosages of acetylcholine on forearm blood flow before and after 5 months of therapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, in 10 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension. Cilazapril decreased blood pressure from 150.8 +/- 14.4/98.9 +/- 4.3 mmHg during placebo to 138.8 +/- 15.6/88.6 +/- 8.9 mmHg (P < 0.01). Brachial artery acetylcholine infusions increased forearm blood flow from 2.95 +/- 1.5 to a maximum of 22.8 +/- 11.5 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 forearm tissue and decreased forearm vascular resistance from 48.1 +/- 34.1 to 6.9 +/- 6.9 units before cilazapril. This response did not change after cilazapril therapy. Our findings in patients with primary hypertension, therefore, do not support the concept that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition influences endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation to acetylcholine to a significant degree. Whether this lack of effect on endothelial vasodilator function is specific for the vascular bed chosen for study or whether it represents a fundamental difference between animal models and human hypertension remains an important issue to be clarified.",

These changes in size and shape, defined as remodelling, are the sum total of a number of processes that involve the myocyte and the interstitial fibrous structures which provide the matrix in which the myocyte functions. The adapted mechanisms which occur are affected by humoral and cellular phenomena and can be modified by pharmacological agents.

Thirty-five patients were randomized to placebo and 72 to cilazapril at a starting dose of 1 mg daily; titration to cilazapril 2.5 mg at week 4 and 5 mg at week 8 (or matching placebo) was carried out in patients who did not improve clinically. Demographic characteristics, including exercise test duration increased from 402 s (+/- 17 SEM) at baseline to 462 s (+/- 19 SEM) at week 12 for the cilazapril group (+15%) and from 405 s (+/- 23 SEM) at baseline to 408 s (+/- 30 SEM) at week 12 in patients on placebo (+1%) (P < 0.001). In the placebo group, patients able to exercise for more than 6 min at baseline showed an increase in exercise duration at week 12 while those able to exercise for up to 6 min at baseline showed a decrease (P = ns). In contrast, cilazapril-treated patients showed an increase in exercise tolerance regardless of baseline exercise test duration; patients with the most impaired exercise tolerance at baseline showed a greater improvement than patients with mildly impaired baseline exercise tolerance (P < 0.05 vs placebo). NYHA class improved by at least one grade in 51% of the cilazapril group vs 32% in the placebo group (P = ns).

    "494": "Increased insight has been gained into the pathophysiology of heart failure, which is now recognized as a milieu created by specific diseases that cause myocardial dysfunction resulting in haemodynamic abnormalities. Subsequent compensatory circulatory and hormonal changes cause substantive metabolic derangement, and it is the haemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities that produce the congestive and low cardiac output symptoms and physical findings associated with heart failure. One of the earliest abnormalities noted in the failing heart is activation of the renin-angiotensin-neurohormonal axis. This is associated with both dilation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle. This remodelling may be regulated, at least in part, by myocardial tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme systems. Clinical drug trials in patients with heart failure have demonstrated that certain agents reduce mortality and interdict detrimental hormonal activity and remodelling. The Veterans Administration's (VHEFT-I and II) and Scandinavian (CONSENSUS-I) heart failure trials, as well as Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and the post myocardial infarction captopril trial (SAVE--Survival and Ventricular Enlargement) indicate that vasodilators and, in particular, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, decrease heart failure mortality. Furthermore, diminution in morbidity measured as a reduction in hospitalization for congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction was a dramatic beneficial effect noted even in relatively asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Importantly, in the SOLVD and SAVE trials, the diminution in major ischaemic events observed in the treatment groups were noted whether drug was started one week (SAVE) or one year (SOLVD) post infarct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "495": "Intact spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were studied to assess the effect of prolonged antihypertensive treatment on the elastic behaviour of the external carotid artery. Thirty-week-old SHR received the ACE inhibitor captopril, the arteriolar dilator hydralazine or their vehicle for 6 weeks. These rats were compared to normotensive, vehicle treated WKY rats. The internal diameter of the carotid artery was measured continuously in halothane-anaesthetized rats using an echo-tracking device, and intra-arterial pressure was also monitored continuously, on the contralateral side. Captopril- and hydralazine-treated SHR as well as normotensive controls had similar blood pressure values. No significant shift in the distensibility-pressure curves was observed among vehicle-treated SHR and WKY rats or the SHR which had received captopril or hydralazine. Histological examination of the carotid artery fixed ex vivo with paraformaldehyde showed a significant increase in cross-sectional area in vehicle-treated SHR as compared to their normotensive counterparts. These results therefore suggest that the elastic behaviour of elastic arteries is not necessarily altered by the structural changes developing in response to hypertension.", 
    "496": "It has now been demonstrated by several techniques that all components of the renin-angiotensin system reside within the kidney. It is likely that angiotensin II is formed within interstitial renal tissue, as well as intracellularly, and acts locally in an autocrine, paracrine or intracrine manner. It has been difficult to dissect the different renal physiological roles of circulating angiotensin II as opposed to intrarenal generated angiotensin II. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have played an important role in helping distinguish the effects of intrarenal angiotensin. Apart from hemodynamic actions and effects on glomerular filtration rate and renal tubular function, the intrarenal renin angiotensin system probably plays an important role as a regulator of renal sympathetic activity, modifies mesangial cell function, acts as a renal growth promoter, maintains endothelial cell function, and may be an important inflammatory mediator in the kidney. The renoprotective action of ACE inhibitors in reducing proteinuria and in slowing the fall in glomerular filtration rate in experimental and human renal disease may involve any of the above mechanisms. However, a prerequisite for the renoprotective action of ACE inhibitors is reduction of systemic blood pressure.", 
    "497": "Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) are key factors in the esterification of free cholesterol, and the distribution of cholesteryl ester among lipoproteins in plasma. Alterations in these processes may play a role in the lipoprotein abnormalities associated with glomerular proteinuria. The activities of LCAT and CETP were measured using excess exogenous substrate assays in nine patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and in 18 matched controls. The proteinuria-lowering effect of four weeks of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril was also studied. Plasma very low lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (VLDL and LDL) cholesterol, triacylglycerol and apolipoprotein B levels were significantly elevated in the patients compared with controls. High density lipoprotein (HDL) total cholesterol, free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester and the free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester ratio in HDL were lower. Total plasma apolipoprotein A1 was normal. Plasma LCAT and CETP activities were elevated in the patients by 30% (P < 0.01) and by 39% (P < 0.01), respectively, and were both inversely related to serum albumin. VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels were positively related to LCAT and CETP activities, whereas the HDL free cholesterol content was inversely related to LCAT activity. ACE inhibition resulted in a 40% reduction of proteinuria, a partial normalization of LCAT activity, and a decrease in VLDL and LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, elevated activities of LCAT and CETP may provide a mechanism that contributes to the low proportion of cholesterol in HDL relative to that in VLDL and LDL, as well as to the compositional changes of HDL seen in glomerular proteinuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "498": "To determine the renal functional reserve in renal transplant recipients, we measured the glomerular filtration rate by inulin clearance and the renal plasma flow by PAH clearance before and during an amino acid infusion (Totamine, 6 to 8 mg/kg/min for 90 to 120 min) in 18 transplanted patients with stable renal function. To test the role of the renin-angiotensin system on the renal functional reserve, we performed a crossover placebo-controlled randomized trial of acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by injection of perindoprilat (2 mg i.v.), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme before amino acid infusion, each patient being studied twice at seven day intervals. Amino acid infusion induced a time-dependent increase in the glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.04), whether or not the renin-angiotensin system was blocked. Maximal increases were from 49.1 +/- 4.1 to 58.9 +/- 5.4, mean +/- SE (18.5%), in control conditions and from 52.4 +/- 5.6 to 62.1 +/- 5.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 (19.7%) after perindoprilat. The increase in glomerular filtration rate was less pronounced in patients taking cyclosporin A than in patients treated with steroid and azathioprine. Amino acid infusion also induced a significant and time-dependent increase (15.2 to 20.2%) in the renal plasma flow (P < 0.01) whether or not perindoprilat had been given. Furthermore, perindoprilat alone increased renal plasma flow by 13.6%, and this effect seemed additive with that of amino acids. Perindoprilat injection decreased filtration fraction (from 0.20 +/- 0.01 to 0.19 +/- 0.01). This parameter returned to basal values after amino acid infusion (0.20 +/- 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "499": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which have active moieties excreted mainly in urine require adjustment of either the dose or the interval between doses in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction or severe congestive heart failure. Those agents such as temocapril (CS 622) and fosinopril, excreted both in urine and bile, may not require such adjustment. Renal clearance of ACE inhibitors may be reduced and some accumulation may occur in elderly patients with mild renal dysfunction or congestive heart failure. The bioavailability of ACE inhibitors is reduced by concomitant food or antacids which may slow gastric emptying and raise gastric pH. Pharmacokinetic interactions with ACE inhibitors are unlikely in patients receiving thiazide or loop diuretics. When ACE inhibitors are given hyperkalaemia may occur in patients with renal insufficiency, those taking potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics, and in diabetic patients with mild renal impairment. While no pharmacokinetic interaction precludes use of this combination, the pharmacokinetics of some ACE inhibitors are subject to greater variability when patients also receive beta-blockers. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors have additive anti-hypertensive effects and pharmacokinetic interactions between these agents are unlikely. One report exists of a significant effect of coadministered hydralazine on the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of lisinopril. Data on interactions between ACE inhibitors and digitalis are contradictory. There is no evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and digoxin is associated with an increased risk of digitalis toxicity. ACE inhibitors are mainly excreted by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion. Possible interactions between ACE inhibitors and probenecid have been noted, with renal and total body clearance of ACE inhibitors being potentially reduced in the presence of probenecid. Probenecid pretreatment may enhance the pharmacodynamic response of ACE inhibitors. Few but contradictory data exist on the effects of H2-blockers on ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics and little information is available on interactions between ACE inhibitors and hypoglycaemic drugs. Some case reports link ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity. Coadministration of lithium should be undertaken with caution, and frequent monitoring of lithium concentrations is recommended with all ACE inhibitors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may attenuate the haemodynamic actions of ACE inhibitors. NSAIDs reduce renal excretion of ACE inhibitors, with a corresponding increase in circulating drug concentrations. There is little information available on the pharmacokinetic interaction with ACE inhibitors and cyclosporin, but caution should be employed when they are used together.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "500": "A review on the present knowledges of the myocardial structure, with particular emphasis on the collagen network and its degradation/synthesis process was performed. Myocardial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling concepts are analysed, explaining them in the context of ventricular hypertrophy, arterial hypertension, myocardial remodeling in ischemic heart disease and cardiac remodeling in the aged. We also review the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in myocardial fibrosis, as well as the results of preventing action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists in myocardial fibrosis and consequent cardiac remodeling in the animal experimentation. Clinical and therapeutic implications of this knowledge are discussed as well as therapeutic implication in man, in view of recent studies.", 
    "501": "The present experiments describe a marked nycthemeral rhythm in both the appetite for 0.3 M NaCl solution and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis stimulated in Sprague-Dawley rats by chronic administration of enalapril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor. Continuous recording of water, NaCl, and food intakes shows that the sodium appetite is manifest as discrete bouts of salt ingestion in temporal proximity to meals and is partially independent of water bouts. In particular, salt bouts occur without water bouts in the late afternoon of a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and continue periprandially with water bouts during the night. Intake of all three commodities is minimal in the morning. In a second experiment, it was determined that plasma renin activity (PRA) was maximally elevated by chronic enalapril in the daytime and that plasma aldosterone was reduced by enalapril but continued to show nycthemeral rhythm peaking in the afternoon. The concurrent maxima in PRA and aldosterone in the afternoon in enalapril-treated rats thus coincides with NaCl intake in the absence of water intake.", 
    "502": "To investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the cellular function and structure in a variety of organs during the aging process, one hundred CF1 mice were divided into four groups of 25 animals each. Groups A, B, and C received enalapril in drinking water from weaning until the age of 24 mo. Doses administered were (in mg/l): group A, 20; group B, 10; group C, 5. Group D is the control. Animals were killed, and morphometric studies were performed in heart, kidney, liver, and spleen. As a result, there was a decrease of renal and myocardial sclerosis and an increase in the number of mitochondria in heart and liver cells, which is associated with a significant increase in survival of animals receiving ACE inhibitors. These findings lead us to think that natural aging mechanisms have been altered in those animals.", 
    "503": "The antihypertensive activity of quinapril was examined in normotensive and various hypertensive animal models. In 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-RHR), quinapril (0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) had a dose-related and sustained antihypertensive action, which was as potent as that of enalapril and approximately 40 times stronger than that of captopril. Heart rate was not changed by these doses of quinapril. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and 1-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats, quinapril as well as enalapril dose-dependently produced a significant fall in blood pressure. The relative potency and duration of the effect of quinapril was the same as that of enalapril in these models. Quinapril at 30 mg/kg, p.o. lowered blood pressure and increased heart rate in normotensive rats. In contrast, quinapril and enalapril failed to reduce blood pressure in DOCA/salt hypertensive rats. In the repeated dose study, no development of tolerance was observed during the administration period in 2K RHR and SHR. The antihypertensive effects in 2K RHR was greater than those in SHR. Quinapril was more potent and long-lasting than enalapril in 2K RHR and SHR. From these results, quinapril is expected to be useful for the clinical treatment of hypertension.", 
    "504": "Rat beta-cells differ in their individual rates of glucose-induced insulin biosynthesis and release. This functional heterogeneity has been correlated with intercellular differences in metabolic redox responsiveness to glucose. The present study compares glucose metabolism in two beta-cell subpopulations that have been separated on the basis of the presence (high responsive) or absence (low responsive) of a metabolic redox shift at 7.5 mM glucose. Mean rates of glucose utilization and glucose oxidation in high responsive beta-cells were 2- to 4-fold higher than in low responsive beta-cells, whereas their leucine and glutamine oxidation was only 10-50% higher. This heterogeneity in glucose metabolism cannot be attributed to differences in GLUT2 mRNA levels or in glucose transport. In both cell subpopulations, the rates of glucose transport (13-19 pmol/min/10(3) beta-cells) were at least 50-fold higher than corresponding rates of glucose utilization. On the other hand, rates of glucose phosphorylation (0.3-0.7 pmol/min/10(3) beta-cells) ranged within those of total glucose utilization (0.2-0.4 pmol/min/10(3) beta-cells). High responsive beta-cells exhibited a 60% higher glucokinase activity than low responsive beta-cells and their glucokinase mRNA level was 100% higher. Furthermore, glucose phosphorylation via low Km hexokinase was detected only in the high responsive beta-cell subpopulation. Heterogeneity in glucose sensitivity among pancreatic beta-cells can therefore be explained by intercellular differences in glucose phosphorylation rather than in glucose transport.", 
    "505": "In heart failure, cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body for oxygen delivery. Available data suggest that alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism may contribute to defective myocardial performance. Accordingly, thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance might be useful in the treatment of heart failure and has been studied. Experimental and theoretical results of these studies are reviewed and indicate that thyroid hormone increases cardiac output by a combination of effects on the heart and peripheral circulation, specifically by increasing myocardial contractile performance and decreasing venous compliance. In the rat postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses of thyroxine (1.5 micrograms/100 g) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response, including an increase in rate of change of left ventricular pressure and a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These changes could be attributed to conversion to triiodothyronine, the active intracellular form of thyroid hormone. When treatment with thyroxine was continued at the same or higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10 to 12 days, heart rate increased and improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was not sustained. More favorable results were obtained with 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid, a cardiotonic thyroid hormone analogue administered at doses of 375 microgram/100 g, given in combination with captopril. Thus, triiodothyronine or a thyroid hormone analogue may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "506": "The central nervous and systemic kinetics of ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prodrug, and its active metabolite ramiprilat were studied in conscious beagle dogs after sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood during chronic drug administration. The cardiovascular effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been suggested to be mediated partly by central action. Ramiprilat and ramipril were determined in CSF and plasma by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay method. After 10 mg/kg of ramipril, given orally to four dogs once daily for 7 days, significant concentrations of ramiprilat were measured in CSF over the 24-h period after both the 1st and 7th day of treatment. The CSF/plasma (unbound) ratios of ramiprilat on day 7 were (mean +/- S.D.): 0.01 +/- 0.003 (2 h after dose), 0.18 +/- 0.05 (12 h after dose) and 0.32 +/- 0.11 (24 h after dose). Measurable concentrations of ramipril were recorded in plasma after oral dosing (bioavailability approximately 45%), whereas in CSF the prodrug concentration was below the minimal determinable levels in most cases. In a second set of experiments, ramiprilat (3 mg/kg) or ramipril (3 mg/kg) were given i.v. to three dogs once daily for 7 days. Ramipril was rapidly cleared from the plasma, clearance being approximately 140 ml/min/kg and half-life about 0.5 h on day 7. The corresponding values for ramiprilat were 8 ml/min/kg and 0.75 h. The CSF/plasma ratios for ramiprilat were essentially the same after i.v. administration of ramiprilat and ramipril and, furthermore, the ratios did not differ significantly from the ratios observed after oral administration of the prodrug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "507": "The cardinal features of the nephrotic syndrome are albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Traditionally, albuminuria was thought to be responsible primarily for the development of hypoalbuminemia. A decreased plasma-albumin concentration accompanied by a decreased plasma-oncotic pressure was thought responsible for the development of edema and secondary salt retention by the kidney. However, new findings have prompted a reevaluation of these relationships. For example, increased renal catabolism and blunted hepatic synthesis appear to play major roles in the development of hypoalbuminemia. Evidence suggests that primary, rather than secondary, salt retention by the kidney and activation of mechanisms that limit fluid movement across the capillary wall participate in the pathogenesis of the nephrotic syndrome and related edema. The treatment of patients with the nephrotic syndrome should limit proteinuria. This can be accomplished by administering angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lowering the protein content of the diet, and cautiously using non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents.", 
    "508": "Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated to the right hemithorax with a range of total doses delivered in 10 equal daily fractions of 4 MeV X rays. Half of each dose group consumed control feed, and half consumed feed containing the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg/kg/day) continuously after the last irradiation. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the entire thorax was performed at 4 and 8 weeks after the last irradiation, and the findings with CT were correlated with hemodynamic data, heart weight, and pulmonary histopathology. Rats exposed to 20 or 40 Gy in 10 fractions exhibited no acute changes in right lung density. After 60 Gy in 10 fractions, however, right lung density in rats on the control diet increased significantly at 4 weeks, and then returned to normal at 8 weeks. Captopril-treated rats exposed to 60 Gy/10 fractions did not exhibit this transient increase in right lung density. After 80 Gy/10 fractions, right lung density increased to 0.60-0.65 g/cm3 at 4 weeks regardless of diet. At 8 weeks after 80 Gy/10 fractions, right lung density increased further in rats given the control diet, but decreased to near normal levels in captopril-treated animals. The density of the shielded left lung based on the CT was independent of both contralateral radiation dose and diet. Histological examination of the irradiated lungs indicated that these acute changes detected by CT were associated with the exudative and edematous phases of radiation pneumonitis, and that captopril reduced the severity of these changes. Irradiated (40-80 Gy/10 fractions) animals fed the control diet exhibited a significant increase in central venous and pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac right ventricular hypertrophy. Captopril prevented or attenuated these hypertensive reactions. These data demonstrate that high-resolution CT can detect radiation reactions in rat lung within 4 weeks after 60 Gy/10 fractions, and that captopril spares these acute changes detected by CT. The mechanism of captopril action is not clear, but may be due in part to a reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure, resulting in less severe edema in the irradiated lung.",

    "515": "To determine if an abnormality exists in the sympathetic nervous system of patients with accelerated hypertension, we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the tibial nerve by microneurography in eight benign essential hypertensives and seven accelerated essential hypertensives. Basal MSNA, plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly higher in accelerated hypertensives than in benign hypertensives (P < 0.05). To clarify the relationship between the renin-angiotensin axis and sympathetic nervous system in the accelerated hypertensives, we measured the MSNA after 7 d of oral administration of captopril (75 mg/d) for antihypertensive treatment in the benign hypertensives and accelerated hypertensives. After administering captopril, the arterial pressure decreased significantly in the benign hypertensives and accelerated hypertensives with decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels, and the decreases in arterial pressure were greater in the accelerated hypertensive than in the benign hypertensives. After captopril administration, the MSNA decreased significantly in the accelerated hypertensives but did not change in the benign hypertensives. Thus, in accelerated hypertensives, sympathetic tone is elevated, and the elevated sympathetic tone is closely related to the activated renin-angiotensin axis tone.", 
    "516": "The long-term (1.5 years) effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition were evaluated in 22 mostly normotensive patients with nondiabetic renal disease and moderate to severe proteinuria. The nephrotic-range proteinuria of 7.5 g/24 hr fell to 2.9 g/24 hr (-62%) after 2 months' treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and remained relatively stable at this level during continued treatment. The antiproteinuric response varied between study days and between individuals. Of note was the fact that the best antiproteinuric response was observed on those study days when no more than the instituted daily sodium intake (50 to 100 mEq/24 hr) was excreted. The sustained reduction in urinary protein excretion was accompanied by an increase in serum albumin and a slight but significant decrease in serum cholesterol. Those patients with the most pronounced initial antiproteinuric response showed less deterioration of renal function, estimated from the slope of the inverse serum creatinine value in time. These data suggest that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment may be beneficial in normotensive patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria, not only to reduce the symptoms of a nephrotic syndrome, but also to prevent further renal damage.", 
    "517": "In a prospective follow-up of 30 patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein Al and B, and lipoprotein(a) were determined to study their relationship to the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. The patients had proteinuria and advanced nephropathy with a mean +/- SD glomerular filtration rate of 39 mL/min/1.73 m2. The decline in glomerular filtration rate was determined during 2.5 +/- 0.5 years. High serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B were correlated to a more rapid deterioration in kidney function. The rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate was 1.0 +/- 2.5 mL/min/yr in the 10 patients with the lowest cholesterol level, compared with 4.5 +/- 3.2 mL/min/yr in the patients with the highest serum cholesterol (P = 0.015). The combined effect of the measured lipids, blood pressure, type of antihypertensive treatment, protein intake, proteinuria, and hemoglobin A1C on the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate was assessed by multiple regression analysis. The measured factors together had a high explanatory power for the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. In this model, 73% of the variation in decline in glomerular filtration rate was explained by the measured variables (multiple r2 = 0.73). Low cholesterol and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were the strongest predictors of a favorable renal prognosis. This suggests that hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "518": "The principal end point in the evaluation of treatment in incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy is rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Therefore, information on reproducibility of GFR measurements is essential in the planning and evaluation of clinical trials. We studied reproducibility of GFR measurements in insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients using, respectively, a constant-infusion technique with urine collection and labeled iothalamate as a tracer marker and a single-shot procedure using Cr-EDTA, measuring the GFR from the decline in plasma level after bolus injection. The coefficient of variance in the insulin-dependent patients was from 7.5% to 8.8% with repeated measurements. In longitudinal studies with several measurements the mean coefficient of variances varied between 7.4% and 3.4%. In the non-insulin-dependent patients the coefficient of variances between two tests were 7.0% and 5.3% for normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, respectively. In cross-sectional studies as well as in longitudinal studies, it has been consistently shown that GFR is well preserved and at a supranormal level in patients with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria. A decline in GFR appears to start around the transition from microalbuminuria to overt diabetic renal disease, although more detailed studies are needed to support this finding. With regard to intervention trials, several studies document that microalbuminuria can be reduced by effective antihypertensive treatment, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, also in patients with normal or close to normal blood pressure. Preliminary results from long-term studies suggest that reduction in microalbuminuria in these patients is associated with preservation of GFR and, thus, apparently renoprotection. In patients with overt renal disease, it has been consistently shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces albuminuria as well as the rate of decline in GFR. This is also observed with combined treatment regimens, for instance beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors combined with diuretics, or the three types of drugs in combination.", 
    "519": "Dietary protein provokes renal growth and synthesis of renin. Because angiotensin II (AII) has growth-promoting properties, we tested the possibility that protein-induced renal growth depends on angiotensin II. Normal adult male rats placed on a high-protein diet (50%) developed significant renal and glomerular growth over 6 days compared with rats on a low-protein diet (6%). However, neither angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril nor angiotensin receptor antagonism with losartan influenced the degree of whole-kidney, cortical tubular, or glomerular growth. Thus, angiotensin II is not a necessary factor in dietary protein-induced renal growth in normal adult rats.", 
    "520": "Both protein restriction and administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to slow the progression of chronic renal failure. Protein intake conditions the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and the renal production and excretion in the urine of eicosanoids. Both dietary protein restriction and ACE inhibitors decrease proteinuria. The effects of ACE inhibitors on the progression of renal disease may be due to hemodynamic effects (lowering of systemic or intraglomerular pressures) or to decreased activity of growth factors as a result of blockade or angiotensin II production.", 
    "521": "The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of three potent reference renin inhibitors (remikiren, CGP 38560A, and enalkiren) in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys. In additional experiments, remikiren was given on top of either CGP 38560A or enalkiren in the same animals. Finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive angiotensin II concentrations) were also measured. Our results show that remikiren was as effective as cilazapril and markedly more effective than CGP 38560A or enalkiren in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive angiotensin II to similarly low levels. One possible explanation is that, in our model, remikiren in contrast to CGP 38560A and enalkiren is able to inhibit renin in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.",

    "523": "During myocardial ischaemia, either in chronic coronary insufficiency or the acute phase of myocardial infarction, the renin-angiotensin system is activated which, by its deleterious cardiac effects, aggravates the ischaemia. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, by their indirect effects (improved conditions of left ventricular load, negative inotropism, attenuation of catecholaminergic stimulation), reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, and by their direct coronary vasodilator effect reduce myocardial ischaemia. In addition, by attenuating the formation of oxygen-free radicals, by participating in the inactivation of some of them and protecting the lysosomal membranes, they combat reperfusion injury. In the animal model of acute myocardial infarction, they reduce myocardial infarct size and the prevalence of reperfusion arrhythmias. In the clinical situation, their effects on the ischemic response to effort in anginal patients remain controversial, appear to be more marked in abnormalities of the coronary micro-circulation especially in syndrome X and in hypertensive heart disease. In ischemic heart disease, long-term treatment may be beneficial by their trophic coronary and myocardial effects and two large scale trials report a decrease in the recurrence of myocardial infarction with ACE inhibitors. In the acute phase of myocardial infarction if their possible actions on reducing the infarct size and reperfusion arrhythmias require further confirmation, they do limit expansion of the infarct and decrease early left ventricular dilatation. However, the appreciation of tolerance is variable and the timing of their introduction remains controversial.", 
    "524": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors induce hypertrophy of renal juxtaglomerular cells in laboratory animals, and, in some studies, also produced renal tubular lesions. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril on renal function in normotensive rats. Male rats were dosed orally with quinapril at 0 (vehicle control) or 400 mg/kg for 1, 3, 8, 17 or 29 days. This dose of quinapril is more than 1000-fold greater than the effective antihypertensive dose in rats. Parameters of renal function were measured approximately 24 hours after dosing in order to minimize interference from acute pharmacologically mediated effects. Mean arterial blood pressure was only mildly affected at this time: 126.7 +/- 6.0 and 100.0 +/- 8.7 mm/Hg (mean +/- S.E.; day 29) for the control and quinapril-treated animals, respectively. Microscopic analysis of kidney tissue showed pronounced juxtaglomerular cell hypertrophy and hypergranularity in the quinapril-treated animals. These changes were first observed on day 7 and reached a maximum response by day 14. There were no morphologic changes in renal tubules. Quinapril had no significant effect on serum biochemistry parameters (electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine). Urine output in quinapril-treated animals was increased 65% to 197% over controls during the course of the study and correlated with increased water consumption (r = 0.96). Urine osmolality was reduced 31% to 55% on days 8, 17 and 29. However, except for minimal reductions (< 15%) on day 8, there were no significant effects of quinapril on total (24 hour) urinary excretion of electrolytes or creatinine. There were also minimal effects of quinapril on direct measurements of renal function in anesthetized animals. Mean values (+/- S.E.) for control and quinapril-treated animals on day 29 were, respectively: glomerular filtration rate: 2.93 +/- 0.37 and 2.70 +/- 0.53 ml/min; effective renal plasma flow: 11.14 +/- 2.06 and 11.22 +/- 2.35 ml/min; effective renal tubular secretion: 267 +/- 63 and 261 +/- 106 micrograms/min; filtration fraction: 27.1 +/- 2.5 and 24.0 +/- 0.4%; and fractional sodium excretion: 0.25 +/- 0.04 and 0.34 +/- 0.04%. There were also no significant differences between control and quinapril-treated animals when the above parameters were measured following plasma volume expansion on day 29. The results show that quinapril had no adverse effects on renal function in rats when administered at a suprapharmacological dose for up to 4 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "525": "The administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor transitorily reduces the GFR in a kidney with renal artery stenosis, effect that can be ascertained with scintigraphic studies using ACE inhibitors. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of captopril renography (CR) in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH) in 51 hypertensive patients in which this diagnosis was suspected. All subjects underwent angiography and RVH was diagnosed when renal artery stenosis exceeded 60%, there was lateralization of renal vein renin or there was a concordant clinical outcome. Renography was performed 15 minutes after Lasix administration, using Tc-99m DTPA, before and 60 minutes after the oral administration of 50 mg of captopril. The scintigraphic criteria for a positive test were a decreased split renal function, a delayed peak uptake, a decreased excretion of DTPA and a prolonged transit time. In three of 28 patients in whom angiography discarded RVH, CR was positive. In the 23 patients with confirmed RVH, CR was positive in 10 of 12 with unilateral stenosis, in 3 of 8 with bilateral stenosis and 1 of 3 with stenosis in a transplanted kidney. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test for RVH was 60.9% and 89.2% respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or adverse effects after captopril administration. We conclude that CR in RVH is useful to select patients for further studies (angiography) and to perform a functional interpretation of angiographic alterations.",

The effect of fructose 1-6 diphosphate (FDP) and captopril (Cap) on cultured endothelial cells was also investigated. The findings indicated that the two drugs might protect cultured endothelial cells from anoxia-reperfusion injury.

The series comprised 14 patients with an average age of 70 +/- 9 years without diuretic therapy presenting with pure calcific aortic stenosis without other valvular or coronary disease. All were in sinus rhythm; 5 were taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Plasma concentrations of endothelin 1, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), arginine vasopressin (AVP), catecholamines, plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured in resting, fasting patients, by blood samplings from a peripheral vein immediately before cardiac catheterisation. The results were compared with the severity of the aortic stenosis (aortic valve area greater or less than 0.7 cm2), the ratio of left ventricular work/myocardial mass (greater or less than 0.6) and treatment (with or without ACE inhibitors). Catecholamine levels were much higher in severe aortic stenosis (noradrenaline: 579 +/- 66 pg/ml when valve surface area > 0.7 cm2 versus 900 +/- 92 pg/ml when valve surface area < 0.7 cm2; p < 0.01). Endothelin -1 and AVP concentrations were normal. Whereas PRA was normal, aldosterone levels were increased in patients without treatment by ACE inhibitors. This treatment did not, however, normalise the noradrenaline levels. The increase in ANF concentration was large when left ventricular work decreased with respect to myocardial mass (190.8 +/- 42.3 pg/ml if W/M was decreased versus 82.7 +/- 15.4 pg/ml when W/M was normal): this could be related to the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Hypercholesterolemia was defined as LDL-cholesterol plasma levels above 160mg/dl in female patients and above 130mg/dl in male patients or in women presenting any other risk factor for cardiovascular disease. From the 20 patients included, 18 had also high levels of arterial blood pressure. They were evaluated for admission in the study after they have substituted the antihypertensive medication for at least 6 weeks, from beta-blockers or diuretics to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. Lovastatin was administered in a initial daily dose of 20mg to all patients for 6 weeks. After this period this dose was increased to 40mg in 11 patients with LDL-cholesterol levels above 130mg/dl. All patients were treated for a total period of 24 weeks.", 
    "530": "Lovastatin therapy for 24 weeks reduced LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol plasma levels in 30% and 21%, respectively, while no changes in HDL-cholesterol or triglycerides plasma levels were observed. The medication was well tolerated and no changes in bilirrubins or transaminases plasma levels were detected. In 9 patients the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase showed an elevation and the mean level of all group increased from 109 +/- 59 to 188 +/- 60m mu/ml (p < 0.05). This was an isolated abnormality without any other clinical manifestation.", 
    "531": "Lovastatin in NIDDM showed to be an efficient agent to reduce high levels of LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol. However, the importance of the abnormality observed in serum alkaline phosphatase levels deserves further investigation. In this condition we recommend discontinuation of lovastatin therapy.", 
    "532": "To assess the effects of enalapril on bronchial responsiveness, we studied ten stable asthmatics and five healthy normal volunteers. Spirometry and methacholine bronchoprovocation dose (PC20) were measured before and after oral administration of 20 mg enalapril. Significant hypotensive effect was observed in all. More than two fold (2.73) increase in bronchial responsiveness was observed in the asthmatics (P < 0.01) without significant change in the expiratory flows. PC20 after enalapril fell by 56.8 +/- 23.0% of baseline value (P < 0.001). No significant change was observed in spirometric parameters and bronchial responsiveness in normal subjects. We conclude that enalapril significantly enhances BR and cannot be used safely in treatment of hypertension in asthmatics.", 
    "533": "An anaphylactoid reaction was observed in a patient treated with low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis using a dextran sulfate cellulose (DSC) column and administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The authors have investigated to determine the causes and countermeasures. When using heparin as the anticoagulant, large increases in bradykinin levels in plasma were observed after its passage through the column during the procedure. Increase in bradykinin levels in blood were observed, to a lesser but still significant degree, after terminating the procedure. When withholding the ACE inhibitor for a few days before LDL-apheresis, the increase in bradykinin levels was much weakened and the anaphylactoid reactions became mild. Such anaphylactoid reactions were not observed when the ACE inhibitor was withheld for a few weeks, or when using Futhan instead of heparin as the anticoagulant. Although the critical level of bradykinin needed to cause the anaphylactoid reaction and the other possible causal factors remained unclear, the bradykinin levels are thought to be related to the reactions.", 
    "534": "Abnormal proliferation of VSMC is a feature of atheromatous plaques and is responsible for obstructive neointimal lesions at the sites of mechanical or immunological intimal damage. We have discussed approaches to the development of specific inhibitors of VSMC proliferation based firstly on studies of the mechanism of action of known inhibitors and secondly on the identification of genes which are unique to and necessary for VSMC proliferation. The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, heparin and hexamethylene bisacetamide on VSMC proliferation have been discussed. Each of these types of agent has been shown to inhibit VSMC proliferation in vitro and/or in vivo. Examination of the mechanisms by which these agents inhibit VSMC proliferation reveals that transforming growth factor beta is an important mediator of their action and that the processes of de-differentiation and proliferation are independently regulated. Studies aimed at identifying genes involved in VSMC proliferation are at an early stage but have already provided strong evidence to support the hypothesis that VSMC in the vessel wall are heterogeneous and contain a subpopulation of cells with an enhanced proliferative capacity. Identification of the genes expressed by these cells may allow specific inhibitors of VSMC proliferation to be developed and may shed light on the pathogenesis of neointimal lesions.",

    "536": "We previously demonstrated the dependency of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by the inhibitor enalaprilat in vitro on the concentration of substrate and enzyme present in the assay, according to a competitive tight-binding mechanism. In the present study, the relevance of these findings for ex vivo measurements after administration of enalapril has been confirmed in serum samples of four patients which were assayed twice using different substrate concentrations in vitro. The measured extent of ACE inhibition in the samples was markedly different depending on the substrate concentration added in vitro (in relation to its Km value: S/Km, respectively), suggesting lower inhibition over time when higher S/Km was used. When the dilution factor and the added S/Km were taken into account the measured values could successfully be predicted from the respective serum enalaprilat concentrations by means of the concentration-effect model previously evaluated for the in vitro relationship (Emax tight model). Considering conditions which probably better reflect the situation in vivo (no dilution, physiological substrate concentrations far below Km) we simulated a time course of in vivo serum ACE activity in these patients which suggests almost complete inhibition of serum ACE over time in contrast to the in vitro measurement. Thus, we conclude that the usual ex vivo measurements of ACE activity lead to an underestimation of the extent of inhibition because of sample dilution and high exogenous substrate in vitro, and therefore must fail to reflect enzyme inhibition in vivo.",

For the patients treated with calcium antagonists, conversely, 59% of NK patients were responders in comparison with 82% of the LK subgroup, a significant difference between drug groups. After 3 and 6 months of treatment blood pressure was significantly lower in NK patients treated with ACE inhibitors and in LK patients treated with calcium antagonists.

Chronic effects on blood pressure of SQ29,852 administered daily for 21 consecutive days were compared to those of captopril and enalapril in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and two-kidney-one-clip renal hypertensive (CLIP) rats. 2. SQ29,852 showed significant chronic anti-hypertensive effects at 30 mg/kg in SHR and at 10 mg/kg in CLIP rats. Chronic anti-hypertensive effects of SQ29,852 were in-between those of enalapril and captopril. 3.

A 24-hour electrocardiogram was recorded before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment with enalapril. No significant difference was observed in the mean R-R interval on 24-hour electrocardiography between the pretreatment and the posttreatment periods (824 +/- 84 msec vs 834 +/- 83 msec). The SDANN increased significantly (P < 0.01) between the pretreatment period (62.8 +/- 13.7 msec) and the posttreatment period (87.1 +/- 31.2 msec), as did the standard deviation of the R-R interval during the two monitoring periods (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the mean value of the standard deviations of the R-R interval for 5 minutes; the proportion of adjacent R-Rs with a difference of more than 50 msec; or the root-mean square of the difference in successive R-Rs in the pretreatment period as compared with the posttreatment period. Causal blood pressure at rest decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after treatment with enalapril (124 +/- 17/66 +/- 7 mmHg) as compared with the pretreatment period (140 +/- 24/75 +/- 13 mmHg).

This article discusses the current status of antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients and focuses on the use of calcium channel blockers that safely reduce blood pressure while having a neutral or beneficial effect on the diabetic state and related medical complications. While both calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are suitable agents for the primary treatment of diabetic hypertension, the beneficial effects of calcium channel blockers on glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and renal function support their routine use as alternatives to ACE inhibitors. Among the three classes of calcium channel blockers, second-generation dihydropyridines offer advantages over older calcium channel blockers because the second-generation drugs provide greater vascular selectivity and less direct myocardial depression.",

Our study was aimed at checking the effects of captopril before thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and included 204 patients, hospitalized within 4 hours from the onset of symptoms. Patients were randomly subdivided into 2 groups: the first group (105 patients, Group A: pretreatment) received 6.25 mg captopril orally about 15 min before iv administration of urokinase (2 million), the second group (99 patients, Group B: late-treatment) received captopril about 3 days after thrombolytic treatment. Captopril doses were later increased in both groups according to blood pressure. All patients were subdivided according to the localization of infarction. One hundred and thirty-seven patients showed anterior AMI (70 from Group A and 67 from Group B); 67 patients showed inferior AMI (35 from Group A and 32 from Group B). Ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmias (VHA) due to reperfusion were evaluated during the first 2 hours. Ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmias occurred in 11.4% of patients with anterior AMI in Group A versus 38.8% in Group B (p < 0.001). CK peak normalization time in the group with anterior AMI was achieved after 58 +/- 2 hours in Group A versus 72 +/- 2 hours in Group B (p < 0.01).

Antihypertensive drugs were withdrawn one week before the CT or, if this was considered unsafe, patients were treated with nifedipine or diltiazem (53 subjects; 56.4%). We used renal angiography and the Muller criteria to interpret the CT. Our results were as follows: sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 96%; positive predictive value, 88%; and negative predictive value, 97%. In our study a simplified criterion for positive CT-postcaptopril plasma renin activity > 10 ng/mL/h-provided a similar diagnostic value. We conclude that the captopril test is a useful screening test for the detection of renal artery stenosis in selected hypertensive patients and that it can also be reliably performed in patients who are taking calcium antagonists.", 
    "548": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to cause angioedema. The purpose of this study was to establish what proportion of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with angioedema were concomitantly taking any of the ACE inhibitors and to show how this group differed in presentation and response to treatment from the larger population of patients with non-ACE inhibitor-related angioedema. An 8-year retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of angioedema observed from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 1991 was undertaken in the ED of an urban teaching hospital. Forty-nine patients ranging from 12 to 88 years of age with symptoms and physical examination that was consistent with the diagnosis of angioedema were entered onto the study. Twelve cases of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema were identified, all occurring in the last 4 years of the review, and when compared with the non-ACE inhibitor-related group were older (mean age, 63.3 vs 43.0 years), had less of an allergic history (0% vs 49%; P = .013), but demonstrated the same severity of symptoms and response to medical therapy. No case required an artificial or surgical airway. ACE inhibitor related angioedema is becoming a common type of angioedema observed in this ED. These patients are older and free of other allergic disease and respond well to traditional therapy.", 
    "549": "Congestive heart failure is one of the most important causes of peripheral edema seen in clinical practice. Edema in congestive heart failure is the result of the activation of a series of humoral and neurohumoral mechanisms that promote sodium and water reabsorption by the kidneys and expansion of the extracellular fluid. These mechanisms, in concert with abnormal Starling forces such as increased venous capillary pressure and decreased plasma oncotic pressure, promote fluid extravasation and edema formation. The management of edema in congestive heart failure is designed to improve cardiac function and to inhibit the hormonal and neurohumoral pathways that promote edema. The combination of diuretics and vasodilators or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and, in some cases, cardiac inotropic agents is highly effective in achieving these goals and providing significant symptomatic improvement in patients with edema secondary to congestive heart failure.", 
    "550": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are of value in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.

    "551": "Somatostatin (SRIH) has recently been shown to be effective in reversing many of the early changes of diabetic nephropathy. It is unknown whether SRIH exerts its protective effects via its ability to suppress growth hormone (GH) or via other direct renal effects. Since changes in glomerular prostaglandin (PG) E2 production are thought to be an important part of the underlying pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy, we sought to determine if SRIH altered glomerular PG E2 production in the rat. Whole glomeruli isolated from streptozotocin-diabetic rats and from controls were incubated with either saline, captopril, or varying concentrations of SRIH, and PG E2 production was determined by direct radioimmunoassay of media. Incubation with captopril (10(-4) M) resulted in equivalent increases in PG E2 production in glomeruli from both control and diabetic rats (140.8 +/- 12.8% and 150.2 +/- 18.9% respectively). Incubation with high concentrations of SRIH (10(-6) M) also resulted in significant increases in glomerular PG E2 production in both diabetic and control rats. However, at low SRIH concentrations (10(-10) M), glomerular PG E2 production was increased only in the diabetic rats (167.0 +/- 11.4% vs 95.3 +/- 9.2% in normals). We conclude that SRIH increases glomerular PG E2 production, and that glomeruli from diabetic rats appear to be more sensitive to lower concentrations of SRIH when compared to normal rats. It is possible that this effect on PG E2 production may underlie the favorable effects of SRIH on the glomerulus in diabetes.", 
    "552": "Individuals with hypertension and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have a 10-fold greater risk of developing cardiac failure than hypertensives without ECG evidence of LVH. LVH in hypertension is characterized by myocardial fibrosis and structural changes to the small intramural arteries. Hypertensives with or without LVH have reduced coronary vasodilator reserve due to hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries. Prognosis of arterial hypertension is largely determined by cardiac complications. The aim of treatment of hypertensive heart disease is to reverse myocardial hypertrophy in order to prevent progression to hypertensive heart failure, as well as reversal of the hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries in order to improve coronary reserve. On the development of hypertensive heart failure, administration of digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be initiated. Although regression of LVH can be induced by dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and sympatholytic substances, clinical evidence of the reversal of hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries has still to be established.", 
    "553": "To evaluate the renal protection of enalapril a study was made in 37 patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension. Sixteen patients had diabetic nephropathy with the serum creatinine ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/dl. Twenty-one patients had non-diabetic chronic renal failure with serum creatinine from 2.2 to 6.3 mg/dl. Of 16 patients with diabetic nephropathy, 6 served as control and 10 received enalapril. Nine patients in the non-diabetic chronic renal failure group served as controls, while 12 were given enalapril. The control patients received alpha methyldopa (500 mg/day) for blood pressure control. In the studied patients enalapril was given at the dose of 5-10 mg/day. Over a period of 2 yrs, enalapril attenuated progression of renal failure in patients with diabetic nephropathy at the serum creatinine level from 2 to 2.9 mg/dl (creatinine clearance 21.5-38.4 ml/min) when compared with control patients. At the serum creatinine of 3 to 4 mg/dl progression of renal failure did not differ from control patients. In non-diabetic renal failure progression of renal failure was delayed in patients with serum creatinine level ranging from 2.2 to 5 mg/dl (creatinine clearance 18-42 ml/min); patients with serum creatinine level ranging from 5.5 to 6.3 mg/dl had deterioration of renal function as control patients. Proteinuria was decreased in all patients on enalapril. Thus, for preventing progression of renal failure, enalapril should be given in chronic renal failure with milder degree of renal function impairment; in diabetic nephropathy it should be started earlier at the lower serum creatinine level than in non-diabetic chronic renal failure, yet with comparable creatinine clearance.",

The ACE inhibitor in the Hw fraction was further purified by Dowex 50W ion-exchange chromatography and four subsequent steps of HPLC.

    "564": "As a symptom of an underlying condition, cough is one of the most common reasons patients see physicians. To the majority, a cough means that 'something is wrong' and it causes exhaustion and/or self-consciousness. Patients find these reasons as well as effects on lifestyle, fear of cancer and/or AIDS or tuberculosis to be the most troublesome concerns for which they seek medical attention. The treatment of cough can be divided into two main categories: (a) therapy that controls, prevents or eliminates cough (i.e. antitussive); and (b) therapy that makes cough more effective (i.e. protussive). Antitussive therapy can be either specific or nonspecific. Definitive or specific antitussive therapy depends on determining the aetiology or operant pathophysiological mechanism, and then initiating specific treatment. Since the cause of chronic cough can almost always be determined, it is possible to prescribe specific therapy that can be almost uniformly successful. Non-specific antitussive therapy is directed at the symptom; it is indicated when definitive therapy cannot be given. Practically speaking, the efficacy of nonspecific therapy must be evaluated in double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised studies of pathological cough in humans. Such studies have demonstrated the efficacy of dextromethorphan, codeine and ipratropium bromide aerosol in patients with chronic bronchitis. While the preferred treatment for patients with cough due to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy is withdrawal of the offending drugs, it may be possible to ameliorate the cough by adding nifedipine, sulindac or indomethacin to the treatment regimen. The efficacy of protussive therapy has not been well documented. Although hypertonic saline aerosol and erdosteine in patients with bronchitis, and amiloride aerosol in patients with cystic fibrosis have been shown to improve mucus clearance, their clinical utility has not been adequately studied.", 
    "565": "The management of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) presupposes that the patient is identified by echocardiography and is carefully evaluated for risk stratification, taking into consideration possible associated complications. The role of non-pharmacological treatment is limited, except in obese patients. Drug treatment, especially using calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, has proved to be effective in reducing LVH. These drugs are also effective in controlling, if not reversing, the associated pathophysiological changes and complications, such as impaired systolic and diastolic function, and ventricular arrhythmias. There is, however, no evidence of any beneficial effect on myocardial ischaemia. The desirable goal is LVH regression, but it may not be achievable in over 50% of patients, and it is not possible to identify patients in whom regression is likely. Regression, or control of each sequelae, could prevent sudden death, the evolution of hypertensive heart disease leading to heart failure and, probably, myocardial infarction. Patients must be followed carefully during and, particularly, at the beginning of the antihypertensive therapy which has to be gradually introduced. At best, blood pressure must be reduced while avoiding hypotension. The strategy of antihypertensive treatment has to be reconsidered on the basis of the presence of LVH and could lead to decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients with LVH.", 
    "566": "The effects of EXP3174 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), the active metabolite of the angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist losartan, on systemic and coronary hemodynamics as well as on regional myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres) were evaluated in anesthetized, open-chest dogs with or without preactivated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (furosemide treatment). These effects were compared with those of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat (0.1-1 mg/kg). In dogs without preactivated RAS, EXP3174 or enalaprilat did not exert marked hemodynamic effects other did not exert marked hemodynamic effects other than a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at the highest doses. In dogs with preactivated RAS, EXP3174 induced a marked, dose-dependent decrease in MAP (maximum decrease -23 +/- 7%), associated with a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR), whereas cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), and left ventricular dP/dt remained unchanged. At the coronary level, EXP3174 induced a decrease in mean coronary resistance that paralleled that of AP. Similar systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects were obtained with enalaprilat administered at doses three times higher. However, regional myocardial tissue perfusion, assessed by the microspheres technique (whether subendocardial, subepicardial, or transmural) or its transmural distribution (endo/epi ratios) was not affected by EXP3174 or enalaprilat. Thus, these results indicate that blockade of the AT1 receptor of AII by EXP3174 induces hemodynamic modifications similar to those evoked by the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. The lack of effect of EXP3174 or enalaprilat on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) suggests, however, that the RAS does not play a role in regulation of myocardial tissue perfusion.", 
    "567": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a modest natriuretic effect, but the responsible changes in tubular sodium (Na) handling are not fully known. We therefore studied the effect of a single dose of 20 mg enalapril on Na excretion in 8 healthy subjects, using lithium clearance and maximal water diuresis to analyze tubular Na handling. Because the natriuretic effect may depend on the volume state, the same subjects were studied during low (20 mmol Na/day), medium (200 mmol Na/day), and high (400 mmol Na/day) salt intake. Enalapril caused natriuresis during the 20-mmol Na diet (from 51 +/- 9 to 81 +/- 14 mumol/min, p < 0.05) and the 200-mmol Na diet (from 190 +/- 24 to 230 +/- 31 mumol/min, p < 0.05), but not during the 400-mmol Na diet. The increase in Na excretion was not accompanied by consistent changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), free water clearance data, maximal urine flow, uric acid clearance, or lithium clearance. Instead, the increase in Na excretion was positively related to the increase in Na concentration in the maximally diluted urine (r = 0.75, p < 0.01). Regardless of diet, enalapril reduced the filtration fraction, but a significant increase in effective renal plasma flow was noted only during the 20-mmol Na diet. The data suggest that a decrease in Na reabsorption in the diluting segment, perhaps related to renal vasodilatation, participates in the natriuretic effect of ACE inhibition in humans.",

Captopril pretreatment [50 mg every 8 h for 3 days plus 0.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) at induction of anesthesia] attenuated development of acute heart failure associated with RRVP, maintaining normal cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP). Total vascular capacitance after a volume load plus RRVP was higher in captopril-pretreated animals (129.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 100.4 +/- 4.8 ml/kg) owing to an increase in unstressed volume (118.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 88.4 +/- 5.6 ml/kg).

In isolated right atria, lisinopril (0.001-10 microM) decreased the amplitude and rate of the spontaneous contractions. In electrically driven left atria this negative inotropic effect was accompanied by a shortening of the time to peak tension and time for total contraction. 3. Lisinopril did not modify the electrophysiological characteristics of the ventricular action potentials recorded in papillary muscles perfused with normal Tyrode solution or elicited by isoprenaline in papillary muscles perfused with 27 mM K Tyrode solution. 4. In single ventricular cells, lisinopril (10 microM) had no effect on the inward L-type Ca2+ (ICa,L), the inward rectifier (IK1) or the delayed rectifier K+ currents (IK). However, it abolished the stimulation-dependent facilitation of the L-type Ca2+ current. 6. These results indicate that the negative inotropic effect of lisinopril cannot be explained by a decrease in Ca2+ entry through L-type channels and suggest that lisinopril may possibly act at an intracellular site to reduce contractile force.", 
    "570": "The term microalbuminuria means a slightly elevated urinary albumin level. It indicates an abnormal passage of plasma albumin into urine through the glomerular filter. Its prognostic significance was first established in diabetics: in insulin-dependent diabetics microalbuminuria predicts a renal disease, while in non-insulin-dependent diabetics it predicts an excessive cardiovascular mortality. Recently, microalbuminuria has been shown to predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population, especially in elderly subjects. Pathogenetic mechanisms common to both atherosclerosis and renal failure may account for the predictive value of microalbuminuria in the above-mentioned conditions.",

    "572": "An open parallel randomized study was performed in which the effects of doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocker and enalapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme were compared in 70 patients with essential high blood pressure and plasma cholesterol levels greater than 240 mg/dl. Following 2-4 weeks of placebo administration the patients were randomly treated with one of the two drugs. When required doses were increased and hydrochlorothiazide added until blood pressure lower than 160/95 mmHg was achieved. After this period the patients were observed for a minimum of 8 weeks. The mean length of the study was of 22 weeks.", 
    "573": "Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure without modifying cardiac frequency. Doxazosin tended to favorably modify the lipid profile of the plasma while enalapril significantly reduced the levels of cholesterol, lipids and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Upon termination of the study the total HDL/cholesterol index increased 8.6% in those treated with doxazosin and decreased 5.5% in those receiving enalapril (p < 0.05).",

    "575": "To elucidate the mechanism of anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal action of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, a randomized double-blind study was undertaken in 30 consecutive patients (27 men, 3 women; mean age 58 [28-70] years) with stable angina and at least 50%, angiographically well demonstrated, stenosis of one of the main coronary artery branches. They received an intracoronary infusion of either 0.5 mg captopril (n = 16) or of a placebo (n = 14) to see whether in this form of application the drug could cause an acute dilatation of a coronary stenosis. The diameter before captopril administration was 1.40 +/- 0.63 mm, while 1, 5 and 10 min after infusion it was 1.49 +/- 0.58 mm, 1.30 +/- 0.54 mm and 1.41 +/- 0.59 mm (not significant). There was also no significant difference between captopril and the placebo. The absence of effect with captopril may be due to insufficient liberation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in an arteriosclerotic coronary segment.", 
    "576": "Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) activates transcription of cAMP response element (CRE)-containing promoters following an elevation of intracellular cAMP. Here we show that CREB and the highly related protein ATF-1 are also potent transcription inhibitors. Strikingly, CREB inhibits transcription of multiple activators, whose DNA-binding domains and activation regions are unrelated to one another. Inhibition requires that the CREB dimerization and DNA-binding domains are intact. However, inhibition is not dependent upon the presence of a CRE in the promoter, and does not involve heterodimer formation between CREB and the activator. The ability of an activator protein to inhibit transcription in such a promiscuous fashion has not been previously reported.", 
    "577": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in heart failure and delay progression to clinical heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Increasing numbers of older patients are being considered for such treatment. However, there are reports of excessive and prolonged decreases in blood pressure (BP) after the first dose of some ACE inhibitors. We have studied the hemodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and neurohumoral responses to the first dose of oral captopril 6.25 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, perindopril 2.0 mg, intravenous enalaprilat 1.5 mg, and perindoprilat 1.0 mg, compared with oral or intravenous placebo in 6 parallel groups of 12 elderly patients each with moderate-to-severe (New York Heart Association classes II-IV) heart failure. Oral dosing with active drugs led to different temporal responses. After captopril, there was an early short-lived decrease in BP. Enalapril led to a later long-lasting decrease, but perindopril was not different from placebo. Intravenous enalaprilat and intravenous perindoprilat each lowered BP to a similar extent. The doses of drugs used appeared to be comparable because plasma ACE inhibition was similar following perindopril or enalapril and also comparing perindoprilat and enalaprilat. These studies indicate that oral ACE inhibitors have different profiles of acute BP changes after the first dose. The explanation is not clear, but could include physicochemical differences in the interaction between prodrug ester and diacid metabolites leading to differences in tissue distribution and local enzyme inhibition.", 
    "578": "It is now well accepted that treatment of hypertension must extend beyond the mere control of blood pressure. Among the objectives \"beyond blood pressure control\" is the remodeling of resistance and compliance vessels that have usually undergone a process of hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia. Salutary vascular remodeling by antihypertensive treatment not only implies structural changes of the vascular wall, but also functional improvements, including diminished contractile responses to endogenous vasoconstrictors and enhanced relaxation to endogenous vasodilators. We have treated spontaneously hypertensive rats with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors zabicipril, perindopril, and ramipril at antihypertensive and sub-antihypertensive doses and have analyzed vascular morphology and function. Chronic oral treatment was begun before hypertension developed (prevention study). Remodeling of mesenteric vessels with, inter alia, a reduction of the media:lumen ratio was achieved by antihypertensive doses of the drugs. Further, vascular function was improved not only after high-dose, but also after low-dose ACE inhibitor treatment, as tested in the aortic vessels: an inhibition of vascular ACE was associated with attenuated vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine and enhanced dilator responses to acetylcholine. In addition, low and high doses significantly increased aortic cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content, suggesting an improved vasodilator capacity. Our data demonstrate that improvements of vascular function can be achieved by ACE inhibitors, independently of structural changes and of the antihypertensive action exerted by these drugs.", 
    "579": "The effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment with perindopril 2 mg/kg/day, by gavage, for 3 months on the mechanical function and structure of large arteries were studied in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension. Hemodynamic parameters, including instantaneous aortic blood flow and pressure, were recorded under anesthesia at the end of the treatment period. Systemic arterial compliance was calculated from aortic pressure and flow recordings; passive mechanical properties of the in situ localized carotid artery were measured. Histologic and morphologic parameters of the aortic media, including cross-sectional area and thickness, size, and density of smooth muscle nuclei and of elastin and collagen fibers, were measured using an automated image analysis system. ACE inhibitor treatment significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (-27%, p < 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (-30%, p < 0.05) while cardiac output was increased (29%, p < 0.05). Systemic arterial compliance and carotid compliance were both increased by treatment (63%, p < 0.05, and 83%, p < 0.05, respectively). Morphometric assessment of vascular structure showed that ACE inhibitor treatment significantly decreased medial cross-sectional area (-36%, p < 0.001) and thickness (-16%, p < 0.001) by affecting smooth muscle cell hypertrophy (nucleus size decreased by 26%, p < 0.05) without changes in smooth cell number. Collagen density was decreased by treatment (-42%, p < 0.05), whereas elastin density was not affected by treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A total of 320 patients with a mean age of 62 +/- 1 years and CHF of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I (2 patients), II (204 patients), or III (114 patients) were included after a 2-week run-in period during which time vasodilators were stopped and diuretic and/or digoxin therapy stabilized. Perindopril treatment was started at 2 mg, increasing to 4 mg once daily after 2 weeks if supine systolic blood pressure remained > 100 mm Hg. After this dose titration period, follow-up visits were scheduled at monthly intervals for the first 3 months, then at 3-month intervals with a maximum period of follow-up being 30 months. At the time of analysis, mean duration of treatment was 276 days and 208 patients were treated > or = 6 months. Of the 320 patients, 10 (3.1%) died, 9 (2.8%) were withdrawn for worsening heart failure, and 38 (11.9%) for nonfatal adverse events, including cough (2.8%), dizziness or orthostatic discomfort (1.9%), angina pectoris (1.6%), and cutaneous signs (1.3%). Exercise test duration increased from 516 +/- 14 to 659 +/- 19 sec after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.01). At 6 months, 55.6% of patients improved by at least 1 NYHA class. Supine systolic blood pressure decreased slightly from 137 +/- 2 to 132 +/- 1 mm Hg (p < 0.01) and plasma creatinine levels remained stable from 100 +/- 2 to 102 +/- 2 mumol/liter after 6 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III and IV. Underlying cardiopathy was ischemic (6 patients), hypertensive (5 patients), valvular (2 patients), and dilated cardiomyopathy (2 patients). Hemodynamics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and perindoprilat (the active metabolite of perindopril) blood titration were measured at 2 periods. Acute assessment was performed over 2 titration days on oral perindopril 2 mg (day 1) and 4 mg (day 2); measurements were performed at rest and at 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours. Chronic assessment was performed after 3 months of treatment with oral perindopril, 4 mg daily. During the study, 1 patient withdrew due to low systolic blood pressure (< 100 mm Hg) and 3 severely impaired patients died due to a worsening of heart failure during the study. Among the 11 remaining patients, 6 were symptomatically improved. On 4 mg perindopril administration, hemodynamic improvement was similar for peak values at both day 2 and at 3 months. At day 2, compared with baseline, cardiac index increased by 21% (p < 0.05) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 54% and by 21%, respectively (p < 0.01).

    "582": "The effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on intrinsic myocardial contractility of the failing myocardium have been poorly documented. In the present study, inotropy, lusitropy, and economy of force generation were studied in vitro in papillary muscles from cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster (CSH) under early perindopril therapy, i.e., therapy begun at a stage when experimental heart failure was not yet observed. One-month-old CSH from the dilated strain Bio 53.58 were randomly treated over a 5-month period with either the ACE inhibitor perindopril 1 mg/kg/day (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11), and 7 age-matched controls were given placebo. Compared with control, placebo had a lower maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) (p < 0.01) and normalized total force (p < 0.05), and a lower curvature of the force-velocity relationship (p < 0.01). It has been shown that the higher the value of the curvature, the better the myothermal economy of force generation. Compared with placebo, perindopril had a 68% inhibition of plasma ACE activity and a greater Vmax (p < 0.05), whereas total force/mm2 was similar. This resulted in a lesser decrease of the curvature compared to control (p < 0.05). Placebo had a decreased peak lengthening velocity and rate of force decline.

    "583": "In 1987 the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) was published, which was a milestone for the treatment of patients with heart failure. The study showed a highly significant reduction in mortality in patients with severe heart failure treated with enalapril in comparison to placebo in combination with conventional treatment for heart failure, including the use of other vasodilators. The improvement in survival was exclusively due to a reduction of progression of pump failure. The incidence of sudden cardiac death was not affected. In 1991 2 studies were published in which patients with mild and moderate heart failure were included. The Second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) compared the efficacy of enalapril with the effects of a vasodilator therapy consisting of the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. The study showed a highly significant reduction in mortality in the group of patients on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In contrast to CONSENSUS, the benefit on survival was due to a reduction of sudden cardiac death. The second study was the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) treatment arm trial, which compared enalapril and placebo in combination with standard therapy in symptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. The SOLVD treatment trial showed a highly significant improvement in survival on enalapril in comparison with placebo. ACE inhibition resulted in a borderline significant reduction of fatal myocardial infarctions, suggesting an impact of ACE inhibition on the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. The data available show a clear indication for the treatment of symptomatic patients with mild and moderate-to-severe heart failure with ACE inhibitors as a first-line therapy.",

Patients were ambulatory and selected if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was between 94 and 115 mm Hg and no serious illness or ACE inhibitor intolerance was known. Perindopril was started at 2 or 4 mg once daily and, if supine DBP remained > 90 mm Hg, the daily dose could be doubled after 1 or 3 months (or a diuretic added if perindopril titration reached 8 mg). At entry, the 2,927 patients (65% females) were on average 74 years old, body weight was 68.2 kg, duration of hypertension was 9.4 years, and prior antihypertensive treatment was present in 78%. Percentage of normal DBP (< or = 90 mm Hg) was 69% at 1 month, 86% at 3 months (in patients on perindopril alone), and 94% at 6 months. At 6 months the reduction of systolic blood pressure and DBP was 28 and 16.6 mm Hg, respectively. Of the 2,927 patients at entry, 8.6% dropped out during the trial, including 6.1% due to side effects. Cough was the most common symptom (8.9%) leading to withdrawal in 3.4% of cases. In one patient, serum creatinine increased (3-fold at 1 month), but overall no significant variation of renal function occurred, as shown by stable plasma creatinine and potassium levels."
