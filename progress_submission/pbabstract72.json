    "1": "The ability of sinorphan (100 mg twice a day) to lower blood pressure was compared with that of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (25 mg twice a day) using a randomized-sequence, double-blind crossover design in 16 patients with essential hypertension. Each treatment was administered for 4 weeks and treatments were separated by a 3-week placebo period. At the end of the last phase of treatment sinorphan was combined with captopril for a further 4-week period. The changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were monitored using repeated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.", 
    "2": "When given as monotherapy for 4 weeks, neither sinorphan nor captopril significantly reduced the 24-h or the 14-h daytime mean SBP or DBP. However, a significant decrease in DBP was observed during the first 6 h after the morning administration of captopril. With sinorphan only a significant decrease in night-time SBP was found. With the combined therapy of sinorphan and captopril, significant decreases both in SBP and in DBP were observed, which were sustained over 24 h. After 4 weeks of sinorphan alone or in combination with captopril, no change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level was found. However, urinary cyclic GMP excretion increased transiently after administration of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor.", 
    "3": "Neutral endopeptidase inhibition with sinorphan has a limited effect on blood pressure in hypertensive patients when given alone. However, simultaneous neutral endopeptidase and ACE inhibition induces a synergistic effect, and might therefore represent an interesting new therapeutic approach to the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "4": "To investigate whether the angiotensin II (Ang II) subtype 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist CV-11974 had a similar effect to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on cerebral blood flow autoregulation in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "5": "Sixteen WKY rats and 16 SHR were given CV-11974 0.1 mg/kg intravenously and compared with two control groups (n = 16). Their cerebral blood flow was measured with the intracarotid xenon-133 injection method and blood pressure was raised by noradrenaline infusion and lowered by controlled haemorrhage in separate groups of rats. The limits of autoregulation were determined by computed least-sum-of-squares analysis.", 
    "6": "The dose of CV-11974 given lowered blood pressure but did not influence baseline cerebral blood flow. In WKY rats the lower limit of autoregulation in control rats was 60 +/- 3 mmHg, whereas after CV-11974 administration it was 48 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.01). In SHR the corresponding values were 85 +/- 2 and 78 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05). In WKY rats the upper limit of autoregulation in control rats was 144 +/- 5 mmHg, whereas after CV-11974 administration it was 126 +/- 7 mmHg (P < 0.05). In SHR the corresponding figures were 174 +/- 8 and 144 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.01).", 
    "7": "Thus, the AT1 receptor antagonist, although it did not influence baseline cerebral blood flow, shifted the autoregulation curve towards lower blood pressure. This effect is similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and might be due to release of Ang II-dependent tone in the larger cerebral resistance vessels.", 
    "8": "To evaluate the respective roles of elevated blood pressure and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of structural changes in the aortae of rats with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "9": "Renovascular hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one clip) were randomly allocated to three different groups and were treated with equihypotensive doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 3 mg/kg per day) or of a new long-acting calcium antagonist (mibefradil, 30 mg/kg per day). A renovascular hypertensive group was left untreated. A sham-operated group of rats was used as a normotensive control group. At the end of the 5-week treatment period the rats were killed and their aortae were removed. Medial hypertrophy, elastin and collagen content and density of nuclei were evaluated using quantitative morphometry. The aortic cyclic GMP (cGMP) content was quantified by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "10": "Hypertension was associated with medial hypertrophy, a decreased elastin: collagen ratio, hypertrophy of the smooth muscle cells and increased cGMP content of the aorta. Mibefradil and enalapril equally prevented the morphological consequences of hypertension (i.e. medial hypertrophy and the decreased elastin:collagen ratio). The aortic cGMP content was increased by enalapril but not by mibefradil.", 
    "11": "The present results show that, even in a high-renin model (two-kidney, one clip), it is possible to prevent or suppress the vascular consequences of hypertension without interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. This suggests that the changes observed in the aorta are directly related to blood pressure or to other mechanisms independent of the renin-angiotensin system, which could be blocked by a calcium antagonist such as mibefradil.", 
    "12": "The efficacy and safety of sustained-release diltiazem, 200-300 mg once daily was compared with that of captopril, 12.5-25 mg twice-daily, in 100 elderly patients (65-85 years old) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mmHg). All patients received placebo for 2 weeks, followed by an 8-week double-blind period, and were randomized to either diltiazem (n = 50) or captopril (n = 50). Their blood pressure was measured at trough level at week 4 immediately before dosing, i.e. 24 h post diltiazem dose or 12 h post captopril dose. Also at week 4, in non-responders, diltiazem was increased from 200 to 300 mg once daily and captopril from 12.5 to 25 mg twice daily to achieve a target supine diastolic blood pressure reduction of at least 10 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. Supine diastolic blood pressure, at week 8, was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced from 102 +/- 1 to 90 +/- 1 mmHg with diltiazem and from 103 +/- 1 to 89 +/- 1 mmHg with captopril, bringing this parameter within normal limits for both groups. Supine systolic blood pressure was also significantly (P < 0.001) reduced. Target blood pressure was achieved in 68% of patients taking diltiazem and in 70% taking captopril. Distribution of adverse events was comparable in both groups; no significant changes in laboratory or electrocardiographic parameters occurred. Two serious events were reported with captopril: one sudden death and one cerebrovascular stroke. Sustained-release diltiazem once a day is a convenient, well tolerated, first line treatment for hypertension in the elderly, for whom the possibility of using two dose levels allows a close regimen adjustment, 200 mg being recommended as a starting dose.", 
    "13": "The successful introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension or heart failure has increased interest in the (patho)physiological role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE is not only involved in the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, but also inactivates vasoactive substances such as bradykinin and substance P. Accumulation of these substances during treatment with ACE inhibitors may contribute to both their therapeutic action and certain adverse effects associated with their use, such as cough and angioneurotic oedema. Renin inhibitors offer an alternative approach to inhibit the RAS. The major advantage of these, still experimental, drugs is their high specificity for the RAS since angiotensinogen is the only known substrate of renin. The currently available renin inhibitors are pseudopeptides that are rapidly taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile. Consequently, these drugs are subjected to a considerable first pass effect which limits their oral bioavailability. Additionally, plasma elimination half-life times are short and the duration of action is limited. Despite these shortcomings, single oral or intravenous administration results in a 80 to 90% inhibition of plasma renin activity and a slight reduction in blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The extent of blood pressure reduction is dependent on the patient's salt balance. After 1 week of oral treatment with the renin inhibitor remikiren, the antihypertensive effect was reduced in salt-repleted hypertensive patients. Subsequent intravenous administration of the drug did not further affect blood pressure, indicating that it was not the first pass effect that was limiting the efficacy of remikiren.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "1. We have examined several phosphorus-containing peptides as potential mixed inhibitors of two neurotensin-degrading zinc metallopeptidases, endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 and endopeptidase 3.4.24.16. 2. Among a series of 13 phosphonamide peptides, N-(2-(2-naphtyl)ethylphosphonyl-glycyl-prolyl-norleucine (phosphodiepryl 08) was found to inhibit potently the hydrolysis of neurotensin by purified endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 and 3.4.24.16 with an identical Ki value of 0.4 nM. 3. Phosphodiepryl 08 displayed a strong selectivity towards the two peptidases since it failed to inhibit several other zinc-containing peptidases such as endopeptidase 3.4.24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase M, leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidases A and B. 4. The protective effect of phosphodiepryl 08 on neurotensin degradation was examined in vitro and in vivo in central and peripheral bioassays. 5. Phosphodiepryl 08 virtually abolished neurotensin degradation by 4-day-old plated pure cultured neurones from mouse embryos and greatly potentiated neurotensin-induced antinociception in the mouse hot plate test. 6. In the periphery, phosphodiepryl 08 inhibited neurotensin degradation by membranes prepared from isolated longitudinal smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum and greatly potentiated the neurotensin-induced contraction of the same longitudinal smooth muscle preparation. 7. Our study indicates that phosphodiepryl 08 behaves as a potent and selective mixed inhibitor of endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 and 3.4.24.16 and can be used as a powerful agent to prevent neurotensin degradation, in vitro and in vivo, in central and peripheral assays.", 
    "15": "Increasing animal evidence support an important facilitatory interaction between angiotensin II and norepinephrine within the kidney. This angiotensin II/norepinephrine interaction was investigated in man by examining the effect of enalapril pretreatment (5 mg for 5 days) on the renal response to a low non-pressor dose of intravenous tyramine 4 micrograms/kg/min for 120 min in 8 healthy subjects undergoing water diuresis. Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic agent which causes neuronal release of norepinephrine. Enalapril and tyramine, alone and in combination, had no effect on glomerular filtration, effective renal plasma flow or sodium excretion. Tyramine caused a significant increase in urinary flow rate (p < 0.05) but this was not influenced by enalapril pretreatment. The lack of effect of enalapril on the renal response to tyramine contrasts with a previous study which examined the effect of enalapril on the renal response to circulating norepinephrine. This may suggest that enalapril affect renal function only when there is renal vasoconstriction (as with norepinephrine) and not when renal blood flow is unchanged (as with tyramine).", 
    "16": "In experimental studies using cilazapril, the strongest inhibition of neointima formation was obtained when treatment was initiated 6 days before injury. The MERCATOR trial showed no reduction in restenosis with cilazapril given after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The purpose of this study is to determine whether previous administration of cilazapril could prevent restenosis.", 
    "17": "A total of 167 patients were randomly and prospectively assigned to the cilazapril group or the control group. In the cilazapril group, 78 patients received a 2 mg dose of cilazparil daily, starting 7 days before PTCA and continuing for 6 months. Only 128 patients (cilazapril 56, control 72) completed the study because 39 dropped out. Coronary angiograms were evaluated by the quantitative coronary angiogram (QCA) system.", 
    "18": "There were no differences between the two groups of patients with regard to baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics. QCA analysis (cilazapril 66 lesions, control 101 lesions): the loss at follow-up in minimal lumen diameter was 0.36 +/- 0.57 mm in the cilazapril group and 0.57 +/- 0.75 mm in the control group (P < 0.05). Restenosis rate: in the cilazapril group, 16 of 56 patients (28.6%) had restenosis in contrast to 36 of 72 patients (50.0%) in the control group (P < 0.02). When vessel restenosis was evaluated, 16 of 63 vessels (25.4%) demonstrated restenosis in the cilazapril group, in contrast to 41 of 82 vessels (50.0%) in the control group (P < 0.01).", 
    "19": "Treatment using cilazapril 7 days before PTCA significantly reduced the rate of restenosis. These data suggest that previous administration of cilazapril might be important for preventing restenosis.", 
    "20": "The alpha-agonist drug phenylephrine has been generally considered to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure for the reason that increased afterload produced by the vasoconstriction should decrease ventricular function; the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs generally have been considered to be contraindicated in heart failure because of the dependence of the failing heart on beta-sympathetic agonism; the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been indicted recently as causing undesirable cardiovascular depression in patients for coronary artery bypass surgery. Yet recently, phenylephrine has been shown to have positive cardiac inotropic effects in a variety of experimental preparations including intact humans; the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to be therapeutically effective in treating patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF); and the \"gold standard\" for treating chronic CHF at present are the ACEI. Consequently, the clinician caring for patients with cardiac disease needs to reevaluate the use of classic drugs whose original pharmacological properties may either have changed because of advances in technology or may be producing effects that were unanticipated previously.", 
    "21": "In this review, we evaluate the efficacy of ACE-inhibitors for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our information is based on published material and personal experience derived from extensive revision of the SMILE study. All trials with a randomized experimental design, irrespective of their primary research objective, have been included. Results are presented in terms of either hemodynamic or clinical benefit. The available evidence indicates that the mortality rate of AMI patients who undergo short- and long-term treatment with ACE-inhibitors is significantly reduced. This reduction is more evident in high risk patients, such as subjects with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure on admission, anterior location of the infarction. ACE-inhibitors also limit the development and progression of congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction, the onset of clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease (reinfarction, need for revascularization) and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, probably by means of mechanisms involving a specific effect of these compounds. In conclusion, the available data indicate that administration of ACE-inhibitors to patients with AMI is associated with significant clinical benefit.", 
    "22": "Noninvasive cost-effective screening of hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension is a desirable approach to a rare disorder. Currently many patients are screened with angiography, which is both invasive and expensive.", 
    "23": "A MEDLINE search from 1985 through July 1994 using the key words \"renovascular hypertension,\" \"noninvasive,\" \"screening\" generated 16 references. We reviewed these references, as well as several additional references, in an effort to find a reliable noninvasive screening test for renovascular hypertension.", 
    "24": "To date, the most reliable noninvasive screening test for renovascular hypertension is captopril renography. Results of captopril renography allow the physician to diagnose renovascular hypertension with an accuracy of greater than 90 percent. Cost-effectiveness requires appropriate selection of high-risk hypertensive patients for subsequent investigation with captopril renography. Hypertensive patients who have fibromuscular dysplasia, which is most commonly found in young white women, have the best treatment outcomes.", 
    "25": "This one-year open study conducted in two centres investigated the 24-hour effectiveness of the ACE inhibitor perindopril in the treatment of 31 patients with mild or moderate hypertension. The investigation evaluated the so-called \"through\" effect, i.e. the effect of the drug at the end of the 24-hour dosage period. Monotherapy with perindopril (4 mg or 8 mg administered once a day) led to normalization of the diastolic pressure to values lower than 90 mmHg in 48% of the patients, and a combination of perindopril with hydrochlorothiazide produced this effect in another 38% of patients. Treatment thus was able to normalize the diastolic blood pressure in 86% of patients. The mean decline of systolic pressure in a recumbent position was 17.6 mmHg and 13 mmHg for diastolic pressure assessed in a recumbent position 24 hours after ingestion of the drug. The reduction of blood pressure achieved after three months treatment persisted for the whole year. In 93% of the patients the diastolic pressure was at the end of one year lower than 95 mmHg. The drug was very well tolerated and in none of the patients the treatment had to be discontinued because of undesirable side-effects. Perindopril is a significant contribution to the spectrum of drugs used in the treatment of hypertension because of its 24-hour effectiveness and very good tolerance.", 
    "26": "Moexipril is a new nonpeptide angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an intermediate duration of action. The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of moexipril as add-on therapy to nifedipine retard (20 mg b.i.d) was compared to placebo during 8 weeks in a double-blind trial with a parallel group design. A total of 203 patients with essential hypertension and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg on nifedipine alone were randomly assigned to placebo or moexipril 3.75 mg o.d., 7.5 mg o.d., or 15 mg o.d.. At endpoint, the adjusted mean reductions in DBP from baseline were 6 mm Hg, 9 mm Hg (p < 0.01), and 9 mm Hg (p < 0.05) in the moexipril 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg groups, respectively, compared to 5 mm Hg in the placebo group. All dosages of moexipril were well tolerated, and the overall percentages of patients who reported adverse experiences were smaller than in the placebo group. We concluded that moexipril as add-on therapy to nifedipine is well tolerated and gives additional antihypertensive effects.", 
    "27": "We wished to determine whether chronic treatment of rats with cyclosporin A (CSA), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonists modulates the angiotensin receptor density. In rats treated chronically with CSA, the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II (AII) is increased and this increase is modulated by ACEI and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Rats were treated for 6 weeks orally with CSA (15 mg/kg/day), the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day), the angiotensin receptor antagonists DUP 753 (10 mg/kg/day), and D 8731 (10 mg/kg/day) and the combinations CSA + lisinopril, CSA + DUP 753, and CSA + D 8731. Olive oil was used as a control. The number of total AII receptors (Bmax) was determined by Scatchard analysis of [125I]Sar1 Ile8 AII binding in kidney, liver, adrenal cortex, and adrenal medulla. The receptor subtypes were analyzed with the specific antagonists DUP 753 (subtype 1) and PD 123319 (subtype 2). CSA upregulated angiotensin receptors in all organs studied. Lisinopril alone downregulated angiotensin receptors and abolished the effect of CSA in liver and adrenal cortex and medulla, but not in the kidney, where it had no effect. DUP 753 alone downregulated the angiotensin receptor subtype 1 in kidney, liver and adrenal cortex; its effect on the adrenal medulla in which 89% of angiotensin receptors are subtype 2, did not quite reach significance. The combination of DUP 753 and cyclosporin CSA abolished the CSA-induced increase in angiotensin receptor density in all four organs. The angiotensin receptor antagonists D 8731 downregulated the angiotensin receptors (subtype 1) in liver and kidney and upregulated angiotensin receptors (subtype 2) in the adrenal medulla.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Losartan, a recently developed nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, was orally administered for 14 days to mice with viral myocarditis, beginning 7 days after encephalomyocarditis virus inoculation. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) captopril and enalapril were also administered in the same manner to compare the therapeutic effects of these three drugs on the degree of myocarditis, acute heart failure, and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Heart weight and the heart weight/body weight ratio were reduced by losartan (60 mg/kg/day) and captopril (7.5 mg/kg/day), but not by enalapril (1 mg/kg/day). LV wall thickness and cavity dimension were decreased in the losartan and captopril groups. Captopril reduced both myocardial necrosis and inflammation, whereas enalapril reduced myocardial necrosis but not inflammation. However, none of the studied losartan doses (1.2, 12, 60 mg/kg/day) influenced myocardial necrosis and inflammation resulting from viral infection. Thus, specific blockade of AII is beneficial in congestive heart failure (CHF) and LV hypertrophy but is not effective in viral-evoked inflammation and injury.", 
    "29": "In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of 5 mg ramipril and 6 mg piretanide and the respective component monotherapies in hypertensive patients [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100-114 mm Hg]. After a single-blind run-in period on placebo, 611 patients were randomized to ramipril (n = 209), piretanide (n = 201), or the combination therapy (n = 201). At randomization, the three groups had the same characteristics (51% men, age 55 +/- 10 years, BP 165 +/- 18/104 +/- 6 mm Hg). At 4 weeks, BP decreased more with combined therapy than with monotherapy. As compared with piretanide monotherapy, the gain in the antihypertensive effect in the supine position averaged 2.1 mm Hg [90% confidence interval (CI) -0.8-5.0 mm Hg; p = 0.07] systolic BP (SBP) and 1.9 mm Hg (CI 0.3-3.5 mm Hg, p = 0.02) DBP and, as compared with ramipril monotherapy, these differences were 4.2 mm Hg (CI 1.3-7.0 mm Hg, p = 0.008) and 2.0 mm Hg (CI 0.5-3.6 mm Hg, p = 0.009). The incidence of adverse events (AE) and the changes in biochemical measurements were similar in the three treatment groups with the exception of spontaneously reported polyuria and serum uric acid concentration. Polyuria was reported more frequently (p < 0.001) with piretanide therapy (n = 23) and combined therapy (n = 19) than with ramipril therapy (n = 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was measured in rats after single intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) doses of idrapril calcium, and the correlation between peak inhibition and tissue concentration of the drug was investigated. Five minutes after idrapril calcium (3 mg/kg i.v. as free acid), ACE in the examined tissues (serum, lungs, kidneys, heart, aorta, adrenals, testes, and brain) showed > 50% inhibition, always associated with measurable amounts of idrapril. After 90 min, ACE activity was still inhibited only in serum, lungs, kidneys, and aorta, recovering to basal values by 8 h in all samples but serum. Oral idrapril calcium (30 mg/kg) produced > 50% peak ACE inhibition in serum, lungs, and kidneys, in which measurable levels of the drug were detected, and in the aorta, where idrapril was not detected. Other tissues showed neither marked inhibition nor measurable drug levels. Kinetics of ACE inhibition in affected tissue mirrored those observed after intravenous administration. Idrapril, despite its hydrophilic nature, is able to reach extravascular tissues and to inhibit local ACE. However, in no tissue did the effect on ACE last longer than in serum and the hypothesis of a peculiar role of tissue RAS in determining the hypotensive activity of idrapril calcium is not supported in rats.", 
    "31": "The effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on pressor responses to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline (10 ng/kg-3.0 mg/kg) in the pithed rat were compared. In addition, the effects of losartan and captopril on pressor responses to cirazoline were compared in the presence of the selective irreversible alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist SZL-49 (1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-bicyclo[2,2,2]octa-2,5- dienyl-carbonyl)-piperzine) and/or the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine. Losartan (5.0 mg/kg) and captopril (3.0 mg/kg), as compared to saline, significantly lowered the blood pressure of intact, anaesthetized and pithed rats. Continuous infusion with vasopressin was used to restore the blood pressure of pithed rats pretreated with losartan or captopril to a level comparable to animals that had received saline. Losartan, captopril, nifedipine (1.0 mg/kg), and SZL-49 (10.0 mg/kg) antagonized the pressor actions of cirazoline, which displaced the dose-diastolic blood pressure response curve for the agonist to the right. Moreover, pressor responses to cirazoline were significantly reduced in rats that had received losartan and nifedipine in comparison to nifedipine alone. In contrast, in rats treated with nifedipine, further administration of captopril did not significantly reduce pressor responses to cirazoline as compared to nifedipine alone. Cirazoline-mediated pressor responses at all doses were significantly attenuated in rats treated with SZL-49 and either losartan or nifedipine combined as compared to SZL-49 alone. In contrast, only cirazoline-mediated pressor responses at lower doses were significantly reduced by pretreatment with a combination of SZL-49 and captopril as compared to SZL-49 alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "A double blind randomised comparison of two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was made in a study in which ambulatory blood pressure was monitored over a steady-state dosage interval and the subsequent 24-h period, the latter being designed to mimic a missed dose of drug. The blood pressure responses on active therapy were compared to an identical recording made at the end of a 3-week placebo run in period. Eighty-eight essential hypertensives were treated with a morning dose of either trandolapril 2 mg or enalapril 20 mg. Mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were calculated on each of the following periods: daytime (8:31 a.m.-10:30 p.m.), nighttime (10:31 p.m.-6:30 a.m.), and early morning (6:31 a.m.-8:30 a.m.). Trough/peak was calculated for each group both on active treatment and after a missed dose. Twelve patients were excluded from analysis before opening the randomisation code because of inadequate ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) recordings. Demographic data, placebo-period office blood pressure, and ABPM recordings were not significantly different between the two groups. Both trandolapril and enalapril effectively reduced blood pressure over the 24-h period. Twenty four-hour ambulatory SBP and DBP decreased from 148 +/- 14/92 +/- 10 mm Hg to 135 +/- 14/83 +/- 10 mm Hg in the trandolapril group (p < 0.001).

Hypertensive out-patients with supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 105 and < or = 120 mm Hg at the end of a 2- to 4-week placebo-baseline period were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups. Of the 323 patients who were randomized to double-blind medication, 297 completed the study, but 6 patients were excluded for violations of protocol; therefore, statistical analysis was performed in 291 patients. Only 7 patients withdrew owing to lack of efficacy (2 receiving combination therapy). In all three treatment groups, clinically significant reductions in DBP were achieved. Combination therapy was statistically more effective than each component in both evaluable data and intent-to-treat analyses. The incidence of adverse events (AE) was 24% in the quinapril monotherapy group, 14% in the combination therapy group, and 11% in the HCTZ monotherapy group. Orthostatic hypotension with related symptoms was observed in 4 patients (2 receiving quinapril monotherapy, 1 receiving HCTZ monotherapy, and 1 receiving combination therapy). Once-daily quinapril plus HCTZ provided increased reduction of DBP as compared with the monotherapies and was well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "34": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), are two mechanistically similar enzymes involved in the metabolism of several vasoactive peptides. Selective inhibitors of ACE are effective antihypertensive agents in high-renin, renovascular rats and normal-renin, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but are not effective in the low-renin, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. In contrast, NEP inhibitors are only effective in the low-renin model of hypertension. Treatment with a combination of selective inhibitors or with a dual inhibitor of both enzymes produces an antihypertensive response regardless of basal plasma renin activity. In this study, we compared the activities of MDL 100,173, a novel subnanomolar inhibitor of both ACE and NEP, with those of equimolar doses of captopril, a selective ACE inhibitor, following intravenous administration in these three rat models of hypertension. Treatment with MDL 100,173 significantly lowered blood pressure compared to vehicle treatment in all three models, whereas captopril treatment lowered blood pressure in the renovascular and SHR models only. Administration of MDL 100,173 also significantly elevated diuresis and natriuresis compared to either vehicle or captopril treatment in the SHR and DOCA-salt rats. Urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was increased by MDL 100,173 treatment in all three models of hypertension.

In each patient a euglycaemic glucose clamp with simultaneous indirect calorimetry allowed us to determine whole body glucose disposal and substrate oxidation. Changes in morning SBP and DBP were also determined. Lisinopril vs. placebo significantly improved whole body glucose disposal (40.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 30.3 +/- 0.4 mumol/kg LBM x min; P < 0.01), non-oxidative glucose metabolism (18.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.9 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg LBM x min; P < 0.01) and fasting plasma potassium levels (4.8 +/- 3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; P < 0.05). SBP (175 +/- 3.3 vs. 160 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and DBP (106 +/- 2.3 vs. 95 +/- 2.0 mm Hg; P < 0.001) were significantly reduced by lisinopril administration. After ACE inhibition, fasting plasma potassium levels correlated with the decline in mean arterial BP (r = -0.71; P < 0.006). In conclusion, lisinopril administration reduces arterial BP and improves insulin sensitivity in elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "36": "The nasal secretions are the first barrier that nasally administered drugs encounter. Therefore, the characterization of peptide metabolism in the nasal secretions is essential to predict nasal peptide bioavailability. Metabolism of bradykinin was measured in rat and sheep nasal secretions to estimate the extent of degradation of nasally administered peptide compounds. A single-pass, in situ nasal perfusion technique was employed to collect secretions for the investigation of peptide metabolism in rat nasal secretions. The protein content, mucin concentration, and degree of bradykinin metabolism in perfusate aliquots collected over a 2-h period showed that the early perfusate fractions contained most of the active secretory materials. Evidence of continuous mucus secretion and plasma extravasation was found in the nasal perfusate throughout the entire collection period. Sheep nasal secretions were collected with a cotton pledget inserted into the nasal cavity. Bradykinin and its fragments were degraded by carboxypeptidases and endopeptidases present in both rat and sheep nasal secretions. Hydrolysis of Phe5-Ser6 was the major metabolism pathway of bradykinin in the rat nasal perfusate, whereas in sheep nasal secretions, hydrolysis of the Pro7-Phe8 and Phe8-Arg9 bonds also occurred. Evidence of angiotensin converting enzyme, carboxypeptide N, and aminopeptidase activity was identified in the rat nasal perfusate with specific substrates and inhibitors. The activity of these and other enzymes in the nasal secretions may significantly limit the bioavailability of nasally administered peptide drugs prior to their exposure to the nasal mucosal tissues.",

All patients were New York Heart Association Functional Class II, III, or IV and had remained symptomatic despite optimal dosing with digoxin and diuretics. After 12 weeks of therapy, the improvement in treadmill exercise duration was greater in the lisinopril group (113 seconds) compared with the placebo group (86 seconds). This improvement in exercise duration was particularly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35% (lisinopril = 130 seconds; placebo = 94 seconds). In patients receiving lisinopril, the increase in exercise duration was accompanied by an improvement in quality of life as measured by the Yale Scale Dyspnea/Fatigue Index and in signs and symptoms of heart failure. In addition, the lisinopril group had a larger mean increase (3.7%) in left ventricular ejection fraction when compared with the placebo group (1.3%). Thus, lisinopril, administered once daily for 12 weeks, was well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of heart failure when used concomitantly with diuretics and digoxin.", 
    "38": "The efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril were evaluated in a 12-week open, multicenter post-marketing surveillance study. 233 patients, 45 years and over with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-105 mm Hg were followed after a washout period of 7 days. 22 withdrew due either to adverse reactions, mainly cough (4.3%) and dizziness (3%), or noncompliance. DBP of 90 mm Hg or less was achieved in 50.7% with once-a-day 10 mg lisinopril, in 26.1% with 20 mg and in 16.1% with 20 mg plus addition of hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg; in only 7.1% was BP not controlled. Adverse reactions other than cough or dizziness were experienced by fewer than 1%. Dartmouth COOP Functional Health Assessment Charts/WONCA were used to evaluate quality of life and were found useful in the study. Compared to baseline assessments, all functional status indicators (physical fitness, feelings, daily activities, social activities, change in health and overall health) scored significantly better in all treated patients after 12 weeks. Thus, in more than 90% of patients lisinopril was well-tolerated, highly effective in lowering blood pressure and possibly (no control group) improved the quality of life of all patients.",

The daily dosage of enalapril was increased, if required, from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. Blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at weeks -6, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12. At week 0, venous blood was also sampled for baseline plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin concentrations.",

In the nifedipine group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg, and 4 (8%) were receiving the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. Despite a dose-dependent fall in the serum ACE activity in the enalapril group, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by only 8 mmHg throughout the 12-week titration period compared to a decline of 15, 18, and 19 mmHg at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively, in the nifedipine group (P = 0.01 between groups). In the enalapril group, changes in MAP between weeks 0 and 12 correlated significantly with baseline plasma glucose (r = 0.45, P = 0.001) and aldosterone concentrations (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and UAE (r = 0.3, P = 0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation between the changes in MAP and baseline plasma renin concentration.

    "43": "To study the effects of nitinol alloy stent in the treatment of atherosclerotic arterial stenosis, eight miniature pigs were subject to abdominal aortic balloon denudation and high-fatty food. Then 8 nitinol alloy stents were implanted into each abdominal aortas of pigs. The pigs were equally divided into two groups. One group was given captopril (3 mg/kg/d). All animals were sacrified for pathological examination 6 to 10 months after stent implantation. The degree of arterial intima proliferation in the areas of stent implantation not significantly different from that of areas of balloon denudation alone; the atherosclerotic lesions were found at the arterial surface of stent implantation sites. The intima layer was rich in smooth muscle cells, with atherosclerotic plaque formed around the stent wire. On the other hand, significant decrease in arterial intima proliferation was found in group II with no atherosclerotic plaque. The arterial stenosis resulting from atherosclerotic lesion could not be prevented by implantation of intravascular stent, and on the contrary, the mechanical stress of stent wire might worsen the atherosclerosis. Captopril might impede the development of atherosclerotic stenosis after stent implantation.", 
    "44": "Coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies are the commonest causes of CHF in elderly patients. Almost half of elderly patients with CHF have normal LV ejection fraction. LV ejection fraction must be measured before knowing how to treat CHF. Underlying causes of CHF should be treated when possible. Precipitating causes of CHF should be treated. Diuretics are the first-line drug in the treatment of CHF. ACE inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with CHF and should be administered with diuretics to patients with CHF and abnormal or normal LV ejection fraction. Oral isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine improves survival in patients with CHF, and should be administered to patients with CHF and abnormal or normal LV ejection fraction who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor therapy or in whom CHF persists despite therapy with diuretics plus ACE inhibitors. Digoxin should be administered to patients with a rapid ventricular rate associated with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Digoxin should be administered to patients with CHF in sinus rhythm and abnormal LV ejection fraction that does not respond to diuretics plus ACE inhibitors or in patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors or other vasodilator therapy. Digoxin should not be given to patients with CHF in sinus rhythm with normal LV ejection fraction. Calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in patients with CHF and abnormal LV ejection fraction but may be used to treat CHF with normal LV ejection fraction. The use of beta blockers in the treatment of CHF with abnormal LV ejection fraction is experimental. However, beta blockers might improve clinical symptoms in patients with CHF and normal LV ejection fraction by slowing heart rate, thereby increasing LV diastolic filling time and increasing LV end-diastolic volume. Maintenance of sinus rhythm will also increase LV diastolic filling time in patients with CHF and normal LV ejection fraction.",

Diabetic rats had increased plasma cholesterol, tryiglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than in normal rats. Compared to other antihypertensives, nicardipine seems to have a less beneficial effect on lipids and lipoproteins. However, it is only the good glycemic control that normalized these plasma lipids and lipoproteins in diabetic rats. This suggests that good glycemic control prevents dyslipidemia in diabetic rats.

    "55": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetic patients. Animal studies have shown that, besides diminishing the glomerular capillary pressure, ACE inhibitors might reduce albuminuria by influencing glomerular charge selectivity through glomerular preservation of heparan sulphate proteoglycan. In humans, an indirect measurement of glomerular charge selectivity can be obtained by calculating the glomerular charge selectivity index (SI), a clearance ratio of IgG/IgG4, two identically sized but differently charged molecules. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of ACE inhibition on charge selectivity by comparing SI in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with microalbuminuria after 6 years of treatment either with or without captopril. Thirty-five of 45 patients participating in a prospective randomized study evaluating the effect of captopril in preventing the development of diabetic nephropathy were included in the present study, 17 being treated with captopril, 18 left as untreated controls. The selectivity index was calculated after measuring s-IgG, u-IgG, s-IgG4, and u-IgG4. The results demonstrated a higher selectivity index in the captopril-treated group [1.21 (0.51-1.94) median (range)] compared to the control group [0.94 (0.31-1.87)], however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.16).

Diagnosis of heart failure in the older patient may be difficult because of atypical symptoms or the acceptance of symptoms as manifestations of old age. Heart failure is not a diagnosis but a syndrome. Echocardiograms should be obtained in most elderly patients to aid diagnosis and assessment. Loop diuretics, taking into account the altered homoeostasis of old age and presence of co-morbidity, are the mainstay of symptomatic treatment. ACE inhibitors are likely to benefit survival, although formal trials have failed to include many older patients. Digoxin and direct vasodilators are less well tolerated in elderly patients.", 
    "57": "Acute myocardial infarction continues to be the number 1 killer in industrialised countries. While the more widespread use of thrombolytic therapy has made a dramatic impact on patient survival, changes in long-term prognosis after discharge from hospital have not improved radically and 5-year mortality remains at over 30%. The single most important determinant of survival in the long term is left ventricular function. The process of ventricular dilatation and remodelling begins early after infarction. While such changes may initially go unrecognised clinically, without intervention progressive functional impairment will ensue and the majority of patients will develop signs and symptoms of heart failure, which carries a worse prognosis than many forms of cancer. ACE inhibitors act on both the haemodynamic and neurohormonal mechanisms in heart failure. Several large-scale clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that early use of these agents in stable patients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock can reduce significantly the development of heart failure and death. A strategy for the early initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy is proposed to improve survival in AMI patients.",

Ten each of the hypertensive patients were treated with captopril, atenolol, or verapamil. Physical examination and biochemical analyses (serum Mg and Zn) were done in all participants at baseline, and in patients after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The results were compared according to a nested design with Neumann-Keuls test. We found no significant differences between controls and patients in serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Zn at the start of the study, although there was a significant decrease in serum Zn in patients after 3 (P < .01) and 6 months (P < .001) of treatment, regardless of the drug used. This decrease was thought to be attributable to the zincuric effect of captopril or to dietary measures, or both. Intraerythrocyte Zn was not significantly affected by antihypertensive treatment. Serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Mg were significantly lower (P < .001) in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, and serum Mg in patients treated with verapamil was significantly lower (P < .05) than after treatment with captopril or atenolol. Serum Mg concentration was related directly with serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.4043, P < .05). We conclude that supplementation with Mg may benefit patients with hypertension.",

To elucidate the mechanism of hypertension-induced nephrosclerosis, we examined gene expression and localization of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and cellular phenotype in the kidney of 25-week-old SHRSP with moderate renal damage. Renal mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis. The localization of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and cellular phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the kidney of 25-week-old SHRSP, renal transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA was elevated compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), whereas renal collagen mRNAs of SHRSP were not increased. Immunoreactive transforming growth factor-beta 1 in SHRSP was mainly localized in glomerular cells. Furthermore, alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin were significantly expressed in SHRSP glomerular cells, in contrast to negligible expression of these proteins in WKY. alpha-Smooth muscle actin staining was also observed in interstitial cells, and vimentin, another phenotypic marker, was expressed in atrophic tubular cells of SHRSP, despite no staining of these proteins in WKY. Furthermore, all these phenotypic changes in SHRSP were associated with increased cell proliferation, as shown by the increased number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells. Treatment of SHRSP with cilazapril and nifedipine (from the age of 13 to 25 weeks) prevented the increase in transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression and the cellular phenotypic modulation and was accompanied by a reduction of urinary albumin excretion and inhibition of cell proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To determine the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on BRS after AMI we studied 27 patients with a first Q wave AMI, no signs of heart failure and no history of arterial hypertension or diabetes mellitus. An additional group of 10 patients with the same clinical characteristics served as controls. On the 5th day after the onset of AMI, three consecutive boluses of phenylephrine were given intravenously and baseline BRS was taken as the mean slope of the linear regression lines of RR intervals over systolic blood pressure. QT interval was also measured and corrected according to Bazett's formula (QTc). Consequently, a single oral dose of captopril 50 mg or placebo was given to treatment or control group patients, respectively; BRS and QTc were reassessed 1 h later.

The aim of this study was to establish the effect of perindopril based antihypertensive therapy on media thickness to lumen diameter (media:lumen) ratio of peripheral resistance vessels and left ventricular mass in essential hypertension. Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed or poorly regulated essential hypertension were treated with perindopril. Insufficient treatment response (DBP > 90 mmHg) led to addition of isradipine, and hydralazine was used as a tertiary drug if necessary. Gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were taken surgically at baseline and after 9 months of successful treatment. Two small resistance arteries were isolated and mounted in a small vessel myograph, and media:lumen ratio (%) was measured under standardized conditions. Left ventricular mass was determined by echocardiography. Mean (SD) media:lumen ratio decreased from 9.8 (2.6) % to 7.8 (1.9) % (p < 0.05), while left ventricular mass decreased from 299 (75) g to 199 (53) g (p < 0.001). Correlation was found between changes in left ventricular mass index and media:lumen ratio (r = 0.62, p < 0.01). It is concluded that a perindopril based regimen efficiently normalizes resistance artery structure and left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension within one year of treatment. The impact of these findings on the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in arterial hypertension remains to be investigated.", 
    "63": "Treatment of hypertension with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) may be associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration especially in patients with renal insufficiency. This open study in 19 patients with a variety of renal diseases with complicating hypertension investigated the effects of the ACEI, enalapril, on haemoglobin and plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 2, 60 and 120 days after starting treatment with enalapril. By day 60 there was a significant decrease in mean haemoglobin concentration (mean decrease 7.4 g/l) that was sustained until day 120. Apart from a small, but significant, reduction by day 2, mean plasma EPO concentration remained constant throughout the study. The magnitude of the decrease in haemoglobin concentration was, however, significantly correlated with the baseline plasma creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance. These results suggested that the degree of renal insufficiency was important in determining the haematological response to ACE inhibition. While the mechanism of these changes remains unclear, our findings suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, rather than decreasing EPO production, may reduce the erythropoietic activity of the hormone.",

    "66": "Many diabetic patients will develop a nephropathy that will eventually result in end-stage renal failure. The early stage (\"incipient\") of diabetic nephropathy generally appears after 5 to 20 years of diabetes and is characterized by microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/day), which is only detectable by sensitive radio-immuno-enzymatic methods. When a frank proteinuria develops (> 500 mg/day), the glomerular filtration rate inexorably declines, resulting in terminal renal failure after several years. The onset of microalbuminuria or the elevation of blood pressure (above 120-140/80 mmHg) are predictive of a poor evolution and require appropriate preventive therapeutic interventions. These include an optimal control of hyperglycaemia, dietary proteins and salt restriction, and prescription of anti-hypertensive drugs, with a particular benefit ascribed to angio-tension converting enzyme inhibitors (and maybe to certain calcium channel blockers). These interventions have been proven efficient to prevent or slow down the evolution of diabetic nephropathy.",

The present study was designed to assess how glomerular expression of mRNA for these isoforms is regulated and whether their expression is affected by enalapril treatment in diabetic rats. Animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) untreated diabetic rats; (2) enalapril-treated diabetic rats; (3) untreated control rats, and (4) enalapril-treated control rats. Enalapril treatment was continued for 24 weeks. The glomerular mRNA levels for SM1 and SM2 showed little change in all groups throughout the experimental period. In contrast, SMemb mRNA in group 1 increased significantly with age compared to levels found in untreated controls (4.6-fold higher at 4 weeks, p < 0.01; 6.8-fold higher at 12 weeks, p < 0.01, and 10.6-fold higher at 24 weeks, p < 0.001). Enalapril reduced both creatinine clearance (p < 0.01) and urinary protein excretion (p < 0.01) in diabetic rats. Moreover, enalapril significantly attenuated the increase in the glomerular SMemb mRNA level in diabetic rats (the difference between treated and untreated rats was significant at p < 0.01 from week 4 to 24). However, enalapril had no effect on SMemb mRNA levels in controls. These data suggest that SMemb is a molecular marker for phenotypic alteration and that the beneficial effect of enalapril on proteinuria and renal function may be, at least in part, associated with reducing SMemb mRNA expression in diabetic glomeruli.", 
    "68": "The effects of long-term treatment with a novel angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, on ACE activity and cardiac function in rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) were examined and compared with those of captopril and enalapril. Left coronary artery ligation of rats resulted in decreases in mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, dP/dt, cardiac output and stroke volume indices, and increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance 12 weeks after the operation. A significant increase in ACE activity of the myocardium, but not that of serum or other tissues, was detected in the CHF rat 12 weeks after the operation. Oral treatment with ACE inhibitors (10 mg/kg/day captopril, 10 mg/kg/day enalapril or 3 mg/kg/day trandolapril) from the 2nd to 12th week, attenuated the changes in cardiac output and stroke volume indices, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance of the CHF rat. Treatment also attenuated the increase in the cardiac. ACE activity of CHF rats. A close relationship between the decrease in cardiac output index and the increase in cardiac ACE activity was detected. The results suggest that trandolapril, like other ACE inhibitors, exerts a beneficial effect on cardiac function in the CHF rat and that one of the mechanisms for this effect is attenuation of elevated cardiac ACE activity.", 
    "69": "The thiol drug captopril has been reported to possess reducing and transition metal-binding properties, which could result in specific changes in iron and copper prooxidant capacity. Thus, the effects of captopril on iron- and copper-induced oxidative injury were evaluated using deoxyribose as the oxidizable substrate in the presence of physiological phosphate concentrations but in the absence of the non-physiological chelator EDTA. In an iron(III)/H2O2/ascorbate oxidant system, captopril enhanced deoxyribose oxidation only when it was pre-mixed with iron, whereas it did not influence sugar degradation when not pre-mixed with the metal or when ascorbate was omitted. The physiological thiol GSH acted in a similar manner, whereas the SH-lacking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat did not influence iron-induced deoxyribose oxidation, indicating that the thiol group is crucial in favouring enhanced iron reactivity due to 'malignant' chelation. Further specific experiments designed to evaluate possible thiol-dependent iron(III) reduction failed to demonstrate ferric to ferrous reduction by either captopril or reduced glutathione (GSH). When iron(III) was replaced by copper(II) to induce deoxyribose oxidation, captopril was prooxidant both in the presence and absence of ascorbate, and when pre-mixed or not with copper. On the other hand, GSH was prooxidant up to 2:1 molar ratio with respect to copper but markedly inhibited copper-dependent sugar oxidation beginning at molar ratio of 4:1. Ramiprilat did not significantly influence copper-induced deoxyribose oxidation. Moreover, unlike the experiments performed with iron, captopril, as well as GSH, readily reduced copper(II) to copper(I). Hence, captopril can act as prooxidant in the presence of iron or copper. In the former case, only 'malignant' iron chelation by the drug is involved in oxidant injury, whereas in the latter both copper chelation and reduction are operative, although specific chelating mechanisms are crucial in enhancing copper-induced oxidant injury. Captopril, therefore, cannot be considered simply as an 'antioxidant drug', and its catalytic transition metal-related prooxidant capacity should be taken into account in experimental and clinical investigations.", 
    "70": "The growing list of vasoactive substances known to be involved in blood pressure control provides new targets for antihypertensive drugs. Currently under development are alternative strategies for blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., renin inhibition and angiotensin II receptor antagonism) that may have fewer side effects than angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition, and antagonists to other vasocontrictor peptides, such as endothelin and vasopressin. Novel strategies to enhance the effects of endogenous vasodilators, such as natriuretic peptides and nitric oxide, are also being explored.", 
    "71": "Delapril is a carboxy-alkyl-dipeptide mainly converted in animals and humans to an active diacid derivative (M-I), which in turn is converted to an active 5-hydroxy-indane diacid (M-III). In humans these metabolites are excreted in the urine. The presence of the indanyl-glycine moiety gives delapril a high lipophilicity, greater than several other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril and enalapril. Due to its greater lipophilicity, delapril has been shown to exert a more effective inhibition of vascular ACE than captopril and enalapril, both in vitro and in vivo. The activity of delapril on tissue ACE also lasts longer than on the circulating enzyme. At doses ranging from 1-10 mg/kg orally, delapril exerts a marked and long-lasting antihypertensive action in various experimental models of hypertension. The blood pressure reduction has been shown to be accompanied by suppression of angiotensin II release from the vascular wall. In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and in SHR with chronic renal failure, besides reducing hypertension, delapril significantly improves survival rate and prevents the development of stroke, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal sclerosis. The ability of delapril to reduce hypertrophy in vascular and cardiac tissue has been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.", 
    "72": "The addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to digitalis and diuretics in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) prolongs survival and improves the clinical condition of patients. These actions depend on the inhibition of ACE and are, therefore, common to all ACE inhibitors. Thus, the inclusion of an ACE inhibitor in the therapeutic regimen of chronic CHF is mandatory, whenever feasible. The use of ACE inhibitors in chronic CHF should avoid symptomatic hypotension and inordinate decreases in renal function. To this end, ACE inhibitor therapy should progress by gradually increasing doses, and sodium intake and dosages of diuretics and ACE inhibitors should be adjusted in the light of changing circumstances. ACE inhibitors with short elimination half-lives should be preferred in chronic CHF, since they allow quicker dose adjustment than their longer-acting congeners, and given that compliance with once and twice daily dosing would be similar.",

The initial dose of delapril (7.5 mg twice daily) and enalapril (2.5 mg twice daily) could be doubled on a 2-weekly basis (from the beginning of the study) to a maximum of 30 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. The evaluation of the efficacy was based on the changes of NYHA class, results of exercise testing involving bicycle ergometry (duration of exercise, workload, work performed, double product) performed before and after 3 months' treatment, echocardiography (left ventricular end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and left ventricular wall stress) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment and changes in cardiothoracic ratio, electrocardiography, and NYHA class, and patient's opinion of efficacy. Safety was evaluated by monitoring the adverse reactions, laboratory tests, and blood pressure. At 3 months, both treatments had produced a significant improvement compared with baseline in the duration of exercise, workload, and work performed in the bicycle ergometry test as well as in the ejection fraction and in left ventricular wall stress after 6 months of treatment. In addition, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, delapril produced a significant decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume.

At the end of an 8-week treatment period, clinical symptoms of heart failure were significantly relieved by both drugs, with a consistent and statistically significant improvement in patients' quality of life evaluated using a symptoms/activity scale (p < 0.001). None of the patients was judged NYHA class III at the end of the trial and 40% were assigned to class I (p < 0.01). There was a relevant, but not statistically significant, increase in exercise duration in both treatment groups (10% captopril group, 14% delapril group), but the number of patients discontinuing the exercise test for dyspnea was 50% less in the delapril group. Neither drug had evident effects on echocardiographic left ventricular parameters. Two patients treated with captopril and 3 with delapril complained of mild-to-moderate adverse reactions. The safety of both drugs was confirmed by laboratory tests.", 
    "75": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition therapy has now become firmly ensconced in the modern therapeutic approach to all stages of congestive heart failure (CHF), including the early presymptomatic phase. Although its benefit is abundantly proven as add-on therapy in established CHF, after digitalis and diuretics, smaller and shorter studies have shown that, as second-line therapy and combined with diuretics, it may be preferable to digoxin with an undoubted benefit in postinfarction failure. As first-line therapy in early presymptomatic CHF, the evidence is also good, based on the prevention arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), albeit in predominantly postinfarction patients, and on the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study on postinfarction patients. ACE inhibitors given prophylactically or therapeutically helped to prevent clinical heart failure in the SOLVD and SAVE studies. These data suggest a role for ACE inhibitors as effective first-line monotherapy in early heart failure, acting on left ventricular function to avoid or lessen unfavorable remodeling. There are some contraindications or cautions for the use of ACE inhibitors in CHF, such as preexisting hypotension, high-renin states such as bilateral renal artery stenosis with hypertensive heart failure, aortic stenosis combined with CHF, overdiuresis with excess sodium depletion, and significant preexisting renal failure. ACE inhibition therapy may have deleterious effects on renal function in heart failure, for example, by decreasing the glomerular filtration rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Safety was monitored by a variety of laboratory tests, including renal and hepatic function, urinalysis, routine hematology testing, and the reporting of adverse events. Analysis of the data obtained revealed that delapril and captopril exhibit equal efficacy over the dosage ranges studied. There was a greater improvement of NYHA classification in terms of CHF signs and symptoms and ergometric workload in the delapril group; however, this did not reach statistical significance. The safety of the 2 drugs was also comparable, with no significant differences in any of the parameters measured at the start and end of the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the reporting of adverse events between the 2 drugs, although the sample size studied was small.

The dose was then doubled for the remaining 6 weeks. In this phase, 1 patient in each group experienced orthostatic hypotension; the dose was then reduced to the initial dose for study completion. A total of 195 patients received active treatment (96 delapril, 99 enalapril). After 8 weeks' treatment, bicycle ergometry demonstrated a significant increase in exercise duration (p < 0.01) and workload (p < 0.01). Echo Doppler investigations showed a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in left ventricular end-systolic volume associated with a significant increase (p < 0.01) in ejection fraction and cardiac output. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, or biochemical and hematologic tests were found. There were no significant differences between treatment groups.

    "79": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has 2 different active sites: a C-site (in the carboxy terminal region) and an N-site (in the amino terminal part). Some ACE inhibitors have a relatively greater affinity for the C-sites, whereas others bind to the 2 sites with equal affinity. The different ontogenesis of lung and heart endothelial cells can be related to binding differences to the C- and N-sites. We labeled Ro31-8472, a clizapril derivative, which has the same affinity for the 2 ACE sites. Binding of 125I-Ro31-8472 to human left ventricle and lung plasma membranes was saturable, inhibited by ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid and displayed affinities of 360 +/- 41 pM in heart and 320 +/- 51 pM in lung. For captopril the Hill slope was 0.57 +/- 0.03 for heart and 0.48 +/- 0.05 for lung; for delaprilat, a nonsulfhydryl analogue of captopril, the slope was 0.43 +/- 0.05 for heart and 0.55 +/- 0.05 for lung.

    "80": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the metabolism of two major vasoactive peptides, converting angiotensin (Ang) I into Ang II and inactivating bradykinin. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is present in the 16th intron of the ACE gene and is strongly associated with plasma and cellular ACE levels. Contrasting with the lack of relation between ACE gene polymorphism and blood pressure level, a large case-control study has shown that the deletion marker allele of the ACE gene was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. The pathophysiological link between ACE gene polymorphism and cardiovascular events remains hypothetical. One hypothesis is that this polymorphism influences Ang II and bradykinin concentrations in the peripheral and/or local circulations through its effects on ACE levels in plasma and endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism on blood pressure, plasma active renin, and aldosterone regulation in normal subjects.",

Forty minutes after initiating the remikiren infusion, an exogenous Ang I infusion was begun and increased gradually every 15 minutes from 1 to 10 ng.kg-1.min-1. Median (range) plasma ACE levels (mU/mL) were 39 (32 to 57) and 24 (12 to 30) in the DD and II groups, respectively.

After 2 months, mean hematocrit (Ht) had dropped from 0.57 (range 0.52-0.62) to 0.45 (0.34-0.49). Ena was stopped and, after a period of 3.8 +/- 0.3 months, Ht had risen again to baseline values (0.56, range 0.52-0.61) in 8 of them. These 8 patients were then given 5 mg/day Ena. Ht decreased more slowly, and after 3 months reached a mean of 0.49 (0.44-0.54). Group 2 (9 patients) received 600 mg/day Theo in 2 doses. After 2 months, Ht had decreased from 0.56 (0.52-0.61) to 0.52 (0.46-0.63), but in 5 patients, Ht remained above 0.51. After 1 month discontinuation of treatment, PTE persisted in 7 patients.

We have identified an apparent single-domain (67 kDa) insect angiotensin converting enzyme (AnCE) in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Km, 365 microM), removes Phe-Arg from the C terminus of bradykinin (Km, 22 microM), and is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, captopril (IC50 = 1.1 x 10(-9) M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 1.6 x 10(-8) M).

Northern analysis identified a single 2.1-kilobase mRNA in Drosophila embryos, and Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA indicates that the insect gene is not duplicated. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the AnCE protein is a secreted enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and is inhibited by captopril (IC50 = 5.6 x 10(-9) M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 2 x 10(-8) M).

Since ACE is identical to kininase II, which inactivates the nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) and related kinins, potentiation of kinins might be responsible for these additional effects of ACE inhibitors. a) In rats made hypertensive by aortic banding, the effect of ramipril in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was investigated. Ramipril in the antihypertensive dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks prevented the increase in blood pressure and the development of LVH. The low dose of ramipril (10 micrograms/kg/day for 6 weeks) had no effect on the increase in blood pressure or on plasma ACE activity but also prevented LVH after aortic banding. The antihypertrophic effect of the higher and lower doses of ramipril, as well as the antihypertensive action of the higher dose of ramipril, was abolished by coadministration of the kinin receptor antagonist icatibant. In the regression study the antihypertrophic actions of ramipril were not blocked by the kinin receptor antagonist. Chronic administration of BK had similar beneficial effects in a prevention study which were abolished by icatibant and NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). In a one year study the high and low dose of ramipril prevented LVH and fibrosis.

    "90": "Structural remodeling of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium develops in a time-dependent fashion following acute myocardial infarction and may be an integral component in the transition toward overt heart failure. Globally, the remodeling process is characterized by progressive LV enlargement and increased chamber sphericity. At the cellular level, the remodeling process is associated with myocyte slippage, hypertrophy, and accumulation of collagen in the interstitial compartment. In the present study, we examined the effects of early, long-term monotherapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on the progression of LV remodeling in dogs with LV dysfunction (ejection fractions 30-40%) produced by multiple sequential intracoronary microembolizations. Dogs were randomized to 3 months oral therapy with enalapril (n = 7) or to no treatment (n = 7). In untreated dogs, LV end-systolic volume index (ESVI), end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) and chamber sphericity increased significantly during the 3 months follow-up period. In contrast, in dogs treated with enalapril ESVI, EDVI and chamber sphericity remained essentially unchanged. Treatment with enalapril attenuated myocyte hypertrophy and the accumulation of interstitial collagen in comparison to untreated dogs. These data indicate that early treatment with ACE inhibitors can prevent the progression of LV remodeling in dogs with LV dysfunction. Afterload reduction, inhibition of direct action of angiotensin-II and possibly the decrease in bradykinin degradation elicited by ACE inhibition may act in concert in preventing the progression LV chamber remodeling.",

Physiologic parameters were within the normal range of values for this technique and were stable for the duration of each experiment. Quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations were determined in perfusate, urine, and perfusate ultrafiltrate using a specific and sensitive reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry. Perfusate protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration method at 37 degrees C. The total renal clearance of quinapril (CLr) was calculated as Dose/AUC(0-infinity), and is represented by the sum of its urinary and metabolic clearances. The urinary clearances (CLe) of quinapril and quinaprilat were calculated as urinary excretion rate divided by midpoint perfusate concentration for each respective species. Of the total renal clearance for quinapril (CLr = 4.49 ml/min), less than 0.1% was cleared as unchanged drug (CLe = 0.004 ml/min); over 99% of the drug was cleared as quinaprilat formed in the kidney. The clearance ratio of quinapril [CR = CLr/(fu.GFR)] was 41.0, a value representing extensive tubular secretion into the renal cells. Following quinaprilat administration, the clearance ratio of metabolite [CR = CLe/(fu.GFR)] was 3.85, indicating a net secretion process for renal elimination.", 
    "94": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of two ACE-inhibitors with different chemical formulae, cilazapril (CLZ) and captopril (CPT), on left ventricular myocardiocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), characterized by ultrastructural alterations associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, and from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, considered as controls. After CLZ-treatment, not remarkable changes are observed in WKY myocardiocytes, whereas SHR ones show a considerable reduction in their original alterations in ultrastructure. After CPT-treatment, both SHR and WKY myocardiocytes are altered in ultrastructure. The morphometric investigation confirms that CPT and CLZ produce different effects. Even if the drugs induce a similar decrease in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, CLZ unlike CPT seems to improve the ultrastructural abnormalities associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. These changes could be related to the different chemical structure of CLZ and CPT, or to a different affinity of the two drugs for the local renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "95": "During the last few years, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases has been increasing. Captopril is the earliest oral ACE inhibitor and was marketed in 1977. The adverse effect most undesirable with vasodilators, particularly in patients with heart disease, is a reflex tachycardia. The absence of tachycardia with the possibility of binding free radicals is the comparative advantage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Because of their positive hemodynamic effect, ACE inhibitors should be used as a supplement in the treatment of patients who need aortocoronary bypass. Their use does not exclude the intravenous administration of vasodilators, and only decreases the required therapeutic concentration of these drugs.",

The aim of the present study was to quantify renin mRNA in the hypothalamus in response to a low NaCl diet and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, both of which are well-known stimuli of renin mRNA in kidney. 2. Groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were given either a normal diet, low NaCl chow (0.04% NaCl), enalapril (0.25 mg/mL in drinking water), or low NaCl + enalapril, for 7 days. Renin mRNA in the hypothalamus was quantified by a competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. 3. Renin mRNA concentration in the hypothalamus of rats receiving a normal diet was 52 +/- 3 S.E. fg/microgram total RNA. Low NaCl had no effect (57 +/- 7), whereas values were significantly lower in rats treated with enalapril, either given alone (38 +/- 2; P = 0.002) or combined with a low NaCl diet (33 +/- 4; P = 0.003). 4. In conclusion, we have quantified renin mRNA in the rat hypothalamus and shown that it can be suppressed significantly by enalapril. This response is opposite to that seen in the kidney after enalapril.",

In the present study we have examined the effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibition on bradykinin (BK) depressor responses in pregnancy in both Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Ramipril (10 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced mean blood pressure (MBP) in all animals. Further administration of L-nitro-arginine (L-NOARG, 20 mg/kg, i.v.) increased MBP to a less extent in pregnant WKY and to a similar level in pregnant SHR compared with their non-pregnant controls (controls), respectively. 3. Systemic depressor responses to BK were increased in pregnant WKY and were unchanged in pregnant SHR as compared with their controls. Ramipril (10 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated BK responses in all groups, and abolished the differences between pregnant and non-pregnant WKY. Further administration of L-NOARG (20 mg/kg, i.v.) did not further influence BK responses in all groups. 4. The results suggest that systemic depressor responses to BK are enhanced in pregnant WKY and unchanged in pregnant SHR. Decreased ACE activity may contribute to enhanced systemic depressor responses to BK in pregnant WKY.",

The aim of this experiment was to examine the effects of ACE inhibition and bradykinin on renal morphology and blood pressure in SHR. 3. Between 6 and 10 weeks of age male SHR received one of four treatments: water (n = 26), ramipril (1 mg/kg per day; n = 24), ramipril (1 mg/kg per day) plus Hoe 140 (0.5 mg/kg per day; n = 25) or Hoe 140 (0.5 mg/kg per day; n = 25). 4. Renal medullary and cortical volumes were determined stereologically at 10 and 20 weeks of age. 5. After 4 weeks of treatment, ramipril reduced the size of the renal medulla while Hoe 140 increased medullary volumes compared to control. Ten weeks after treatment was stopped the renal medulla of the ramipril group had returned to normal, however, there was a persistent increase in medullary volume of both Hoe 140 treated groups. 6. Our results imply that bradykinin may influence the size of the renal medulla which may have important effects on the development of hypertension in SHR.",

We have conducted a survey of 75 rural and 75 urban randomly selected general practioners (GPs) in Western Australia to ascertain how closely current practice mirrors published Australian guidelines for the management of hypertension. 2. Fifty-one rural and 49 urban GPs completed the 19 item questionnaire. The two groups were well matched in terms of age and years in general practice. An assessment of the criteria utilized to diagnose hypertension revealed a tendency for much greater scatter in the cut points used to define systolic compared to diastolic hypertension, but no systematic difference between urban and rural GPs. 3. After an initial finding of mild hypertension the follow-up time to the next check-up was significantly longer for rural patients compared to urban patients (72 +/- 13 and 36 +/- 5 days respectively, P < 0.01). Urban GPs reviewed established hypertensive patients more commonly at 1-3 monthly intervals (89%) while rural GPs reviewed more commonly at 3-6 monthly intervals (86%). 4.

The percentage of patients (65%) who achieved supine DBP of < or = 90 mmHg in the perindopril group was not significantly different from the enalapril group (73%). Monotherapy resulted in control of supine DBP in 56% of the perindopril group and 58% of the enalapril group; the addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in control of supine DBP in 6% and 15% respectively. The number of withdrawals for adverse events was statistically significant between groups (0 in the perindopril group and 7 in the enalapril group, p = 0.01). During active treatment the most frequently reported complaints were headaches and cough; there was not statistically difference between groups. Changes in laboratory parameters were minor and not significantly different between the two groups except for serum glucose, potassium, and triglyceride levels.

    "107": "Recent studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) reduces blood pressure into adulthood. This study explored changes in vascular reactivity in adult normotensive (WKY) rats and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) receiving the following treatments at 6-10 weeks of age: (a) ACE inhibitor (ramipril); (b) hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide (hydral/HCTZ); or (c) no treatment. The hypothesis tested was that vascular changes and blood pressure would be reduced in adult SHRSP treated with ramipril during development. At 17 weeks of age, rats were anesthetized and vascular tissue was excised. Isolated experiments in the aorta included characterization of initial phasic and tonic contractions to 0.1 microM angiotensin II (AII). A phenylephrine (PE) concentration-response curve was performed on carotid arteries, and threshold values were determined. All WKY groups showed lower systolic blood pressure (131 +/- 4 mmHg) and reduced phasic AII induced contraction (7.4 +/- 4.7%) compared with SHRSP (217 +/- 4 mmHg; 37.2 +/- 4%). Antihypertensive treatment reduced blood pressure (ramipril: 168 +/- 2; hydral/HCTZ: 198 +/- 6 mmHg) but not phasic AII responses in adult SHRSP; adult WKY rats were unaffected by treatment. Threshold values for PE in carotid arteries were lower in SHRSP than in WKY, indicating increased sensitivity. However, SHRSP treated with ramipril did not demonstrate increased sensitivity to PE. These data support the hypothesis that blood pressure and sensitivity to PE but not contractile responsiveness to AII in adult SHRSP are determined by an AII-sensitive mechanism during development.", 
    "108": "We report the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors indomethacin and meclofenamate, of the ACE-inhibitor captopril and of the muscarinic receptor antagonist methyl-scopolamine on the renal action of cicletanine (20-30 mg/kg i.v.) in anesthetized rats. Methylscopolamine, at doses ranging from 60 to 600 micrograms/kg i.v., did not at all affect cicletanine's action on the kidney's excretory function. Captopril (20 mg/kg i.v.) induced by its own a small rise of urine flow, and of urinary sodium and chloride excretion. The drug enhanced the effect of cicletanine on urine flow and sodium excretion by an additive effect. In the presence of captopril, and also of indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) and meclofenamate (5 mg/kg i.v.), but not with control conditions, cicletanine significantly enhanced glomerular filtration rate and p-animohippurate clearance. Despite the fact that renal hemodynamics improved, the prostaglandin inhibitors nearly completely abolished cicletanine's effect on urinary fluid and electrolyte excretion. The results suggest that muscarinic receptors are not involved in the diuretic response to cicletanine. Cicletanine's diuretic and saluretic action may be related to a stimulation of renal prostaglandin synthesis. An enhanced prostaglandin production, and an activated reninangiotensin system, may also mask a direct vasodilating effect of cicletanine on the renal vasculature in the rat.",

During the acute phase of a myocardial infarction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition appears to be well tolerated, to prevent the development of heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and to improve the hemodynamic and clinical variables of heart failure when present. Accordingly, early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is clearly indicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction associated with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or clinical evidence of heart failure.

In contrast, in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study, patients were selected with a reduced radionuclide ejection fraction and without overt ongoing ischemia.

An increase has been reported of renal ET-1 production associated with progression of renal disease in rats with reduced renal mass. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the evolution over time of the urinary ET-1 excretion in an experimental model of renal mass reduction not caused by renal infarction. Rats were subjected to 2/3 nephrectomy (right nephrectomy and resection of the lower left renal pole) and thereafter randomly assigned to a no-treatment control group or to treatment with recombinant erythropoietin, recombinant erythropoietin plus verapamil, or recombinant erythropoietin plus enalapril. The urinary ET-1 excretion was decreased by week 16 after nephrectomy as compared with healthy animals and with the levels 6 weeks after nephrectomy. The temporal evolution of urinary ET-1 excretion in the various groups of rats showed a trend toward decrease in all groups except the one receiving enalapril. The urinary ET-1 excretion correlated directly with creatinine clearance and inversely with tubulointerstitial damage. We observed an inverse correlation between urinary ET-1 excretion and arterial blood pressure 16 weeks after nephrectomy. These results indicate that renal ET-1 production decreases with the progression of renal disease and in relation with the severity of tubulointerstitial damage. The decrease in renal ET-1 production might contribute to the development and perpetuation of renal disease-associated arterial hypertension; this situation may be favorably modified by the use of enalapril.",

Eight healthy subjects aged 22 to 34 years were studied in a single-blind, randomized, prospective crossover study. Autonomic activity was determined by computer analysis of RR interval variability in the time and frequency domains.

    "129": "The aim of this study was to compare the long-term effects of treatment with enalapril or placebo on plasma neurohormones in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Elevated neurohormonal levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Multiple studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease mortality and morbidity in these patients. In Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction (treatment trial). In contrast, in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction (prevention trial), there was no significant reduction in mortality with enalapril therapy. The effect of enalapril was examined in 333 prevention trial and 129 treatment trial patients. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and plasma renin activity were measured in these patients at baseline, and at 4 and 12 months of follow-up. In a subset of these patients, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin were also measured. Analysis of covariance models were used to determine the effect of enalapril on each neurohormone. Participants in the treatment trial had significantly higher neurohormonal levels when compared with those in the prevention trial or normal control subjects. In the treatment trial, patients taking enalapril had a greater decrease in plasma NE levels than patients taking placebo (p < 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "130": "Several pharmacologic forms of adjunctive therapy, designed to enhance the efficacy of thrombolysis following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), are being explored. However, few studies have assessed the use of standard secondary prevention therapies (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, magnesium, calcium antagonists, etc.) for antecedent thrombolysis. Although calcium antagonists have not been shown to alter post-AMI mortality, diltiazem has been shown to reduce recurrent nonfatal infarction and myocardial ischemia following non-Q-wave AMI. Because both non-Q-wave AMI and AMI treated with thrombolytic therapy result in early reperfusion and clinical manifestations of \"incomplete infarction\" (i.e., aborted transmural infarction), we hypothesize that prophylactic administration of diltiazem to AMI patients who receive thrombolysis before other therapies might decrease ischemic complications. We have initiated a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of long-acting diltiazem 300 mg/day and aspirin 160 mg/day versus aspirin 160 mg/day alone in up to 920 patients with an uncomplicated first AMI (no heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction) within 36 to 96 hours of receiving thrombolysis. Active enrollment is under way at 46 centers in the United Kingdom, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Denmark. This trial (known as the Incomplete INfarction Trial of European Research Collaborators Evaluating Prognosis Post-Thrombolysis [diltiazem], or INTERCEPT) represents the first long-term, large-scale, prospective study of a calcium antagonist administered post-thrombolysis as adjunctive therapy to AMI patients in which the primary trial objective is to assess the effect of blinded therapy on the 6-month cumulative occurrence of a combined clinical end point (cardiac death, recurrent nonfatal AMI, and medically refractory ischemia).",

In anterior AMIs, the non-infarct-zone index deteriorated in the placebo group but remained unchanged in the enalapril-treated group (0.18 vs 0.02; p < or = 0.05), an effect related to attenuated LV volume expansion. No treatment effects were observed in nonanterior AMIs or in the entire unselected population. Thus in an unselected population with AMI, early enalapril treatment had no effect on LV function; yet in patients with anterior infarcts, LV function was maintained through preservation of function in the noninfarcted myocardium.",

Renal blood flow (electromagnetic flow-meter) and glomerular filtration rate (polyfructosan clearance) were assessed on the left denervated kidney together with renin secretion and urinary electrolyte excretion. (-)-Ozolinone (15.5 mg/kg i.v.) behaves as a stereoselective loop diuretic equipotent to 20 mg/kg of furosemide and 45 mg/kg of (+/-)-ozolinone; (+)-ozolinone induced only minor salidiuretic effects. Both ozolinone enantiomers markedly increased the renal blood flow and decreased the filtration fraction, suggesting that the vosodilating effect predominates on the efferent glomerular arterioles. (-)-Ozolinone also induced an acute rise in renin secretion. The inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin or meclofenamate) prevented renin hypersecretion in response to (-)-ozolinone and modified its salidiuretic effects but had no effect on the vascular response. The inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system by aprotinin had no effect on the overall renal response to (-)-ozolinone. The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril decreased blood pressure, prolonged the (-)-ozolinone-induced decrease in renal vascular resistance and increased renin secretion. Our results demonstrate that the loop diuretic, ozolinone, induces stereoselective and prostaglandin-dependent renin secretion, which is involved in the regulation of intra-renal hemodynamics.",

There are multiple components of the extracellular matrix, and the exact composition in various renal diseases is not known. Thus, we examined some of the major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in murine and human glomerular diseases. We studied matrix synthesis and degradation at the level of gene expression and ECM composition in the intact glomerulus. To determine whether the composition of sclerosis was similar among diseases, we examined a normal mouse strain and compared it with strains which spontaneously developed glomerulosclerosis. The baseline levels of matrix components varied between different mouse strains, and this level correlated with their propensity to develop glomerulosclerosis. In addition, when glomerulosclerosis was induced, the baseline ECM mRNA level predicted the subsequent outcome. We studied mice transgenic for bovine growth hormone, since they develop progressive glomerulosclerosis. Treatment with heparin substantially decreased the lesions without changes in type IV collagen mRNAs. However, there was an up-regulation of both the mRNA and enzyme activity for the 92 kD matrix metalloproteinase. In contrast, when these mice were treated with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists, the glomerulosclerosis was accentuated histologically and the ECM synthetic and degradative mRNAs were elevated. These data suggest that the mRNA levels reflect response to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Inflammatory responses were measured in two perpendicular directions serially, and the areas of rash were used as an index of inflammatory reaction induced by lisinopril. Inflammatory responses were dose-dependently enhanced by treatment with lisinopril.

    "147": "Erythrocytosis is not rare in renal transplant recipients, and phlebotomy is still the main treatment. Recently, the occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor induced anemia in patients on chronic hemodialysis and in renal transplant recipients has been reported. We herein report 5 transplant recipients whose hematocrit levels decreased while taking ACE inhibitors, including 2 patients treated with ACE inhibitors for erythrocytosis. The individual mean hematocrit values ranged from 35.0% to 54.7% before treatment and from 27.6% to 42.0% after treatment. The hematocrit level in the 2 patients with erythrocytosis decreased from 54.7% to 39.8% and 47.5% to 27.6%, respectively. Anemia improved after discontinuation or dosage reduction of the drugs. The patients were given the same immunosuppressive drugs, and had good renal function. ACE inhibitor-induced conspicuous anemia was not observed in the transplant recipient who received a kidney from a twin sibling and had not been taking any immunosuppressive drugs, nor in the 8 other patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic glomerulonephritis who served as controls. We conclude that ACE inhibitor-induced anemia may frequently arise in an immunosuppressed state. Based on these events, the ACE inhibitor can be used as a potent drug for erythrocytosis in post-transplant recipients.", 
    "148": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) leads to left ventricular dysfunction, the extent of which predicts mortality. We studied the effect of very early enalapril treatment in patients with left ventricular failure (Killip classification II-III) resulting from AMI. In a double-blind randomized trial, patients on conventional treatment were started on placebo (PL, n = 15) or 2.5 mg enalapril (EN, n = 15) twice daily as early as 24 to 30 h after AMI and were followed up over a period of 21 days. One patient died in each treatment group. There were three dropouts in the placebo group (progressive heart failure requiring antiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition) and one dropout in the enalapril group (malignant ventricular arrhythmias). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and norepinephrine decreased similarly in both groups from elevated baseline concentrations. The patients with the highest baseline ANP levels died in both groups: EN: 579 fmol/ml (mean 65.3 +/- 34.4 fmol/ml), PL: 403 fmol/ml (mean 63.5 +/- 37.6 fmol/ml). Killip classification improved in 9 of 13 patients on enalapril but only in 5 of 11 patients on placebo. On echocardiography an increase in fractional shortening (FS) (3.2 +/- 7.5%, p < 0.05) was found with enalapril only. Patients on placebo required more diuretics, and plasma aldosterone increased threefold. Thus, very early enalapril treatment may help prevent left ventricular failure after AMI. Extremely high initial plasma ANP concentrations may predict an unfavorable outcome.",

Many antipsychotics may block the antihypertensive efficacy of guanethidine and related drugs. The interaction between clonidine and antipsychotics is defined less clearly. Limited data suggest possible additive hypotensive effects when chlorpromazine and methyldopa are given in combination. Increased plasma concentrations of thioridazine with a resultant increase in adverse effects have been reported when propranolol or pindolol are added to the regimen. A similar increase in chlorpromazine concentrations has been reported when propranolol was added. Although there are no reports documenting an interaction between a calcium-channel antagonist and an antipsychotic, the possible inhibition of oxidative metabolism of antipsychotics, additive calcium-blocking activity, and additive pharmacodynamic effects are theorized.

In the former group, sodium transport measurements were performed at the baseline placebo period and after 6 months of active treatment. The maximal rate of Na+/Li+ countertransport decreased significantly after 6 months of treatment, without differences between both groups of treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors did not significantly modify other sodium transport parameters.

    "164": "Thiol compounds have been reported to abolish hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase induced luminol chemiluminescence and this effect has been attributed to scavenging of superoxide (O2-)/(H2O2) produced from hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. Yet other workers have reported that thiol compounds have shown little, if any, reactivity towards O2-/H2O2. The aim of this study was to examine the discrepancy between these two sets of findings further. Captopril (a thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) and MPG (a simple thiol) were observed to abolish hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase induced chemiluminescence. The reactivity of captopril and MPG towards O2-/H2O2 was then determined by measurement of thiol oxidation in captopril and MPG after their incubation with hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. Incubation (at 10 min, 37 degrees C) with 4 mM hypoxanthine/0.03 u ml-1 xanthine oxidase resulted in 7% and 20% thiol oxidation in captopril and MPG (at 1 mM) respectively. Captopril and MPG, therefore, appeared to be ineffective scavengers of oxidants produced by hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. Captopril and MPG also did not affect urate production or oxygen consumption by xanthine oxidase which indicated that captopril and MPG quench luminol chemiluminescence by a mechanism that excludes the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase induced luminol chemiluminescence may, therefore, be an unsuitable method for measuring free radical scavenging activity by drugs.", 
    "165": "Diuretics are commonly used to treat a variety of conditions, including progressive nephropathies, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases. Such treatment stimulates the production of angiotensin II, an important mediator of renal growth which may accelerate progressive glomerulosclerosis. To further study the effects of diuretic treatment on normal renal growth and development, weanling male Munich-Wistar rats received no drug, enalapril, furosemide, or both drugs for 6 wk; morphometric studies were then performed using standard light and electron microscopic techniques. Plasma renin activity was elevated by furosemide treatment. Cortical tubular growth was stimulated in rats receiving furosemide or both drugs; enalapril did not affect cortical tubular growth when compared with untreated animals. Glomerular volume was increased in furosemide-treated animals, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of mesangial cells, whereas enalapril decreased glomerular volume. Furosemide also increased the filtration surface area per glomerulus whereas enalapril decreased it. Concurrent enalapril treatment blocked the furosemide-induced changes in filtration surface area as well as attenuating overall glomerular and mesangial growth. Glomerular changes correlated with plasma renin activity. Furosemide stimulated glomerular growth, especially of mesangial cells, probably via stimulation of AngII production. Given the relationship of mesangial cell growth and progressive renal disease, diuretic therapy could thus accelerate glomerulosclerosis. Cortical tubular growth also increased with furosemide; however, enalapril had no effect, so factors besides angiotensin II appeared to modulate tubulointerstitial growth in these animals.", 
    "166": "Initiation of antihypertensive treatment (AHT) in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) induces a faster initial (0 to 6 months) and a slower subsequent (6 months to end of observation) decline in GFR [delta GFR (ml/min/month) approximately 1.5 vs. 0.35]. Whether this initial phenomenon is reversible (hemodynamic) or irreversible (structural damage) after prolonged AHT is not known. To elucidate these mechanisms we investigated 42 hypertensive IDDM patients (16F/26M, age 40 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD) with DN receiving AHT (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, N = 30) for 6 (2 to 15) years [median (range)]. GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), arterial blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) and albuminuria (mg/24 hr) were measured the last day on AHT and one month after withdrawal of AHT. The measured variables were all significantly elevated after withdrawal of AHT: GFR [mean(SEM)] from 76(4) to 81(4) (P < 0.0001), BP [mean(SEM)] from 140/82 (2/1) to 151/89 (2/1) (P < 0.0005) and albuminuria [geometric mean (antilog SEM)] from 704 (1.2) to 1122 (1.2) (P < 0.0001). A correlation between relative rise in systolic blood pressure (delta Sys%) and relative change in GFR (delta GFR%) was found (r = 0.44, P < 0.005). Our results render some support of the hypothesis that the faster initial decline in GFR is due to a functional (hemodynamic) effect of AHT, which does not attenuate over time, while the subsequent slower decline reflects the beneficial effect on progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "167": "The effect of oral supplementation of L-arginine, the substrate of nitric oxide, (1.25 g/liter water) and captopril (15 mg/liter water) was studied in 5/6 nephrectomized rats for a period of three months. N-omega-nitro L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, was given orally (70 mg/liter water) with or without L-arginine or captopril. The urinary excretion of nitrite (NO2) + nitrate (NO3), the known metabolites of nitric oxide, was taken as an index of nitric oxide production. Chronic renal failure rats were characterized by a low creatinine clearance, high FENa%, proteinuria, hypertension and a low urinary excretion of NO2 + NO3; 0.152 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.001) nmol/micrograms creatinine compared with 0.481 +/- 0.004 (P < 0.001) in normal rats and 0.479 +/- 0.11 (P < 0.001) in untreated sham-operated rats. Both L-arginine and captopril were effective in the normalization of all these parameters. The combination of L-arginine and captopril had no additive effects. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor significantly diminished the captopril beneficial effect. It is concluded that chronic renal failure in rats is a low nitric oxide production state. The supplementation of L-arginine is shown to overcome this condition. It is suggested that the beneficial effect of captopril on chronic renal failure is through a specific L-arginine--nitric oxide synthase--nitric oxide pathway.", 
    "168": "The renin-angiotensin system is critical for regulating extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. Angiotensin II, the active peptide hormone produced by the renin enzymatic cascade, sustains vascular volume and blood pressure by constricting vessels, stimulating adrenal aldosterone secretion, increasing renal tubular sodium absorption, activating the sympathetic nervous system, and increasing cardiac contractility. These actions are a disability in the pathophysiologic states of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF), however, since reactive increases in renal renin and angiotensin II stimulate sympathetic activity and renal sodium retention, leading consequently to circulatory volume over-load. The actions of angiotensin II are mediated by its interactions with specific cell-surface angiotensin II receptors, namely, AT1 and AT2; most cardiovascular actions of angiotensin II come from its interaction with the AT1 receptor. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor blockers antagonize the actions of the renin-angiotensin axis, neutralizing its effects on hypertension and heart failure. Losartan is the first oral, nonpeptide, selective AT1-receptor blocker to be approved. Clinical trials show it to be effective and well tolerated as therapy for hypertension and CHF. Data obtained thus far suggest ACE inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers have similar efficacy for treating these conditions, but the receptor blockers appear to produce fewer adverse effects. Whether the sustained increase in angiotensin II concentrations after AT1-receptor antagonism produces deleterious effects is not known. The concern is that these high levels may stimulate unblocked AT2 receptor; the effect of that stimulation may not be important, however.", 
    "169": "Antihypertensive drug therapy can lower blood pressure and prolong life, but many hypertensive patients continue to develop further risk factors and to die prematurely of heart disease. Antihypertensive drugs can also interfere with the patient's quality of life, and many are not compatible with the concomitant medical conditions of the patient and the medications taken to treat them. For these reasons, the antihypertensive therapy selected should meet the specific and complete needs of each patient, not just treat the high blood pressure. An analysis of the drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system suggests that several of these drugs have a more favorable therapeutic profile than other classes of hypotensive agents. The newly developed receptor-site-specific blockers are expected to be tolerated better by hypertensive patients and, consequently, to enhance their quality of life. The first of the new class of nonpeptide blockers of the AT1 receptor, losartan--which has no partial agonist activity--is likely to have the advantages of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors without their adverse effects, notably cough. In selected patients, the AT1-receptor blockers could become the drugs of first choice for the management of hypertension.",

We recommend that ACE inhibitors not be used in pregnancy. However, if a child is born with ACE inhibitor fetopathy, aggressive therapy with dialysis to remove the inhibitor may mitigate the profound hypotensive effects. Therapy will depend on the specific ACE inhibitor, and care recommendations cannot be generalized for the entire class of drugs as their protein binding and volume of distribution differ substantially.",

ACEI, but not DHL, led to a significant fall (P < 0.01) in blood pressure, 57 +/- 11 versus 89 +/- 25 in the DHL group and 103 +/- 24 mmHg in controls, and to a dramatic increase in plasma creatinine. PRA and PRS were undetectable in ACEI-treated rats; in contrast, PRC and renal staining with anti-renin antibody were significantly increased in ACEI rats. On day 28, the blood pressure was normal in all groups and plasma creatinine returned to the normal range in ACEI rats. PRA, PRS and PRC were not significantly different in the ACEI group and controls. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major postnatal role in the neonatal rat. Inhibition of the RAS during the first 2 weeks of life leads to high mortality, severe hypotension, reversible renal failure and a defect in circulating angiotensinogen.", 
    "172": "Dorsal aortic blood pressure (PSYS, systolic; PDIAS, diastolic; and PDA, mean) and heart rate (HR) were measured in resting freshwater bowfins (n = 6), Amia calva L., before and after i.v. injections of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng.kg-1 of synthetic [Asn1, Val5]-angiotensin II (ANG II). Baseline PSYS, PDIAS, and PDA were 27.7 +/- 2.8, 22.4 +/- 1.8, and 24.5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Bowfins were only moderately responsive to ANG II in a stepwise manner and the increase in blood pressure became significant only at the two highest doses; lower doses tended only to increase arterial pressure. Pressor responses due to 200 and 500 ng.kg-1 decayed over a greater time period compared with other doses. alpha-Adrenergic blockade abolished 70% of the ANG II-mediated pressor responses. Eel, salmon, and goosefish angiotensin I (ANG I; 500 ng.kg-1) elicited similar vasopressor responses (magnitude and time course) which were eliminated by prior angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril; 2-10 mg.kg-1). Bullfrog ANG I evoked a pressor effect, only at a higher dose (5000 ng.kg-1). Consecutive norepinephrine (NE) injections (100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng.kg-1) increased PSYS, PDIAS, and PDA in a dose-dependent manner which was dependent on alpha-adrenoceptors since phentolamine (1-3 mg.kg-1) abolished 80% of the pressor action of NE. PSYS was elevated by 100 ng.kg-1 of NE but PDIAS and PDA were significantly increased only at 200 ng.kg-1 ANG II and NE had no measurable chronotropic effect and resting HR (27.2 +/- 0.8 beats.min-1) was unchanged. Captopril and phentolamine treatments produced rapid hypotension and bradycardia (25-30%) which lasted from 15 to 30 and 20 to 40 min, respectively. The rising and decreasing phases of the NE-mediated pressor responses had shorter durations than ANG II effects. Tachyphylaxis occurred with the high doses of ANG II and NE. The data show that in the ancient bowfin, which evidently lacks renal juxtaglomerular cells, the cardiovascular system can be regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and NE.",

Two hundred seventy-three patients with diabetes and an identical number of age-, gender- and race-matched controls were examined for clinical evidence of oral lichen planus. Patient medication histories were also obtained from each group. Eleven diabetic patients (4%) and eight control patients (3%) had clinical evidence of oral lichen planus. Ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with the presence of oral lichen planus lesions in six patients. There was no apparent association of diabetes and oral lichen planus in this population, and the ingestion of medications known to cause lichenoid mucosal reactions had no influence per se on the presence of oral lichen planus lesions (p > 0.05). However, the type of medication ingested by those patients who had oral lichen planus lesions was either nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which was a significant association (p < 0.00).",

Arterial segments were perfused at a constant flow rate (perfusion pressure taken as an index of arterial tone) and loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of fluorescent dye fura 2 (fura 2-AM). Increases in [Ca2+]i were measured simultaneously with vasoconstriction after stimulation with a depolarizing hyperkalemic solution or the agonists norepinephrine or serotonin. Age had no effect on increases in [Ca2+]i vasoconstrictor responses, or electromechanical coupling efficiency (hyperkalemic solution). Increases in [Ca2+]i after agonists were similar in all groups, but vasoconstrictor responses and pharmacomechanical coupling efficiency decreased with age. ACEI had no effect on vasoconstriction or [Ca2+]i signals. In conclusion, coupling efficiency after agonist stimulation decreased with age; ACEI had no effect on coupling efficiency.", 
    "182": "Responses to angiotensin I, II, III, and IV, des-Asp1-angiotensin I, and (p-amino-Phe6)-angiotensin II were compared in the hindquarters vascular bed of the cat. The peptides produced dose-related increases in perfusion pressure, and dose-response curves to all six peptides were parallel. Des-Asp1-angiotensin I, angiotensin I, II, and III produced similar increases in perfusion pressure and were approximately 300-fold more potent than (p-amino-Phe6)-angiotensin II, 100-fold more potent than angiotensin IV, 30-fold more potent than norepinephrine, and 10-fold more potent than U-46619. The time courses of the response to des-Asp1-angiotensin I, angiotensin I, II, and III were similar, and responses were not altered by a time-delay coil. DuP-532, an AT1 receptor antagonist, reduced responses to the six angiotensin peptides. PD-123,319 did not alter responses to the angiotensin peptides. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reduced responses to angiotensin I and des-Asp1-angiotensin I. These results show that des-Asp1-angiotensin I as well as angiotensin I, II, III, and IV have similar efficacy and that responses to the peptides and (p-amino-Phe6)-angiotensin II are mediated by AT1 receptors. These results suggest that AT2 receptors have little role in modulating responses and that angiotensin IV has a lower affinity for the AT1 receptor than does angiotensin II or III. The results also indicate that complete rapid local conversion of the substrates into active peptides occurs near the site of action within the hindquarters vascular bed.",

We recorded mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and hindlimb conductance. The response to hemorrhage was unchanged with hormonal blockade alone. Blockade of the autonomic nervous system caused a faster rate of blood pressure decline, but the rate of decrease in hindlimb conductance was maintained at control levels. Blocking the autonomic nervous system and the hormones resulted in rapid blood pressure decline and an increase in hindlimb conductance. Although the three types of efferent blockade had a similar pattern of effects in normotensive and hypertensive rabbits, hypertensive rabbits exhibited less cardiovascular support during hemorrhage than normotensive rabbits. During hemorrhage, hypertensive rabbits had an attenuation of hindlimb vasoconstriction, a reduction in the heart rate-mean arterial pressure relationship, and reduced ability to maintain blood pressure compared with normotensive rabbits.",

Ang II infusion induced cardiac hypertrophy and medial hypertrophy both in the aorta and in first-order mesenteric arterioles, accompanied by induction of smooth muscle polyploidy. The growth response to Ang II differed in the large and small vessels, with a marked induction of smooth muscle hyperplasia in the mesenteric arterioles but no change in cell number in the aorta. Infusion of noradrenaline did not induce cardiac or vascular hypertrophy, levels being similar to those in the rats treated with perindopril only.",

A total of 20 adult female New Zealand white rabbits were studied. All rabbits received 75 IU of human menopausal gonadotrophin s.c. each day for 7 days. On day 8, all rabbits received 2500 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Ten rabbits were randomly chosen to receive enalapril orally. Five received 1 mg/kg of enalapril and five received 2 mg/kg of enalapril twice daily. The remainder received placebo orally twice daily. On day 10, all rabbits underwent surgical exploration. Total body weight was found to increase significantly in the placebo group (by 293 g, P < 0.001) but not in either group receiving enalapril. Haematocrit also increased significantly in the placebo group (by 3%, P < 0.013) but not in the enalapril groups. Ovarian weights were highest for the 2 mg/kg enalapril group (5.80 +/- 0.52 g), followed by the 1 mg/kg enalapril group (3.64 +/- 0.45), and least for the placebo group (2.69 +/- 0.17). All 10 placebo rabbits met criteria for severe OHSS whereas only six in the enalapril groups did. We concluded that angiotensin II may play a significant role in the development of weight gain, third space fluid accumulation and intravascular fluid depletion in OHSS. ACE inhibition resulted in a 40% decrease in the incidence of OHSS in the rabbit model.", 
    "195": "Large-scale drug trials have focused primarily on mortality and morbidity and less on the functional state of the myocardium. A model was developed to assess myocardial contractile state in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and to address the questions of differences in function between patients with and without overt heart failure, effects of enalapril, and best predictors of functional outcome. Pressure-angiographic data were obtained from 16 patients with overt heart failure and 47 without heart failure. Repeat studies were conducted in 41 patients following 1 year's treatment with enalapril or placebo. Left ventricular silhouettes were divided into 18 segments to estimate regional ejection fraction, wall stress and myocardial damage (% myocardial damage). Contractile state was assessed and ranked by ejection rate-preload-afterload relationships and by a score method based on 10 myocardial and ventricular function parameters. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) were significantly greater (P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) lower (P < 0.009), % myocardial damage greater (P < 0.008) and contractile state more depressed in patients with overt heart failure. Changes in EDV and ESV (delta placebo vs delta enalapril) were significant (delta EDV, P < 0.003; delta ESV, P < 0.014). Directional shifts in the diastolic pressure-volume relationships with enalapril or placebo depended primarily on the basal contractile state and diastolic volume range. The best single predictors of post-treatment EF were the score index (a surrogate parameter for the contractile state) and ESV. Added benefits of enalapril include the prevention of further dilatation in patients with less depressed contractile state and delay in the onset of heart failure. Asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction should also be considered for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.", 
    "196": "To determine the neurohormonal response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition after acute myocardial infarction, 36 patients presenting within 6 h of the onset of chest pain were studied in a single regional cardiology service. In this double-blind study, 13 patients were randomized to receive captopril, 12 patients received enalapril, and 11 patients received placebo, for 12 months. In patients receiving placebo, acute myocardial infarction was associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, and stimulation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels. ACE inhibition did not significantly alter circulating levels of norepinephrine, brain natriuretic peptide or atrial natriuretic peptide. Compared with placebo, enalapril induced a steep decline in plasma ACE activity, and plasma angiotensin II levels were reduced by both ACE inhibitors. Using grouped data, circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide at the zero sampling time were significantly higher than atrial natriuretic peptide values. Brain natriuretic peptide levels at 72 h were significantly correlated with the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction measured 5 days and 3 months after infarction. Similar associations were observed for atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine. We confirm activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems after acute myocardial infarction. The atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide and sympathetic nervous system responses to acute myocardial infarction were not significantly modified by ACE inhibition. Brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels were significantly correlated with the left ventricular ejection fraction measured 5 days and again 3 months after myocardial infarction, and may prove a useful prognostic index.",

No difference in BK release was found between control hearts and hearts pretreated with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE or kininase II) inhibitor, enalaprilat (50 ng ml-1). 3. No significant change in des-Arg9-BK-like immunoreactivity during reperfusion was observed in control hearts. In contrast, des-Arg9-BK-like immunoreactivity rose from 44 +/- 15 to 177 +/- 61 fmol min-1 g-1 (P < 0.05, n = 7) 30 s after reperfusion in enalaprilat-treated hearts. 4. In conclusion, BK is released upon reperfusion of the globally ischaemic rat heart.

This fact excludes the majority of such patients from consideration for BMT at many centers. We sought to determine if prophylactic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevents this deterioration in pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction. We treated six consecutive patients with initial left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) by radionuclide gated blood pool imaging (RGBP) of < 50% (42 +/- 7%) with enalapril 5 mg orally twice per day started 48 h prior to induction therapy and continued throughout the follow-up period. Serial RGBP imaging demonstrated an increase in LVEF in all patients to 54 +/- 6% (P < 0.005). No patient experienced clinical deterioration during a follow-up period of 18 +/- 11 months. We conclude that prophylactic treatment with enalapril may prevent deterioration in pre-existing mild left ventricular dysfunction during BMT.", 
    "199": "In the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, a follow-up (mean, 2.2 yr) of 200 study participants with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) was conducted to determine the effect of lowering protein intake and blood pressure on the rate of decline in GFR. The rate of decline was faster in participants with ADPKD than in persons with other diagnoses, reflecting, in part, faster disease progression in the ADPKD group. Baseline characteristics that predicted a faster rate of decline in GFR in persons with ADPKD were greater serum creatinine (independent of GFR), greater urinary protein excretion, higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), and younger age. In patients with initial GFR values between 25 and 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2, neither assignment to a low-protein diet group nor assignment to a low blood pressure group significantly reduced the rate of decline of GFR in ADPKD participants. Similarly, the decline in GFR was not related to achieved protein intake or MAP. In participants with GFR values between 13 and 24 mL/min per 1.73 m2, assignment to the low MAP group led to a somewhat more rapid decline in GFR. However, the more rapid decline in GFR did not appear to be due to a detrimental effect of low blood pressure or the antihypertensive agents used to reach the low blood pressure goal. Lower protein intake, but not prescription of the keto acid-amino acid supplement, was marginally associated with a slower progression of renal disease.", 
    "200": "This study was undertaken to assess whether the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, and the long-acting nitrate, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, affect left ventricle dysfunction and anatomical remodelling in rats with myocardial infarction. Lisinopril, isosorbide-5-mononitrate or vehicle were given to rats (n = 10-14 per group) immediately after coronary artery occlusion (by an intravenous bolus) and then for nine weeks (in drinking water). At the end of the study, left ventricular pressures were measured, the heart arrested in diastole, and infarct size, left ventricular chamber volume and wall thicknesses measured. Lisinopril significantly lowered systemic blood pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure in rats with small (< 15% scarred tissue of the left ventricle) and large (> 15%) infarcts; the weight of the left ventricle (including the septum) was reduced by 24% and 28% in animals with small and large infarcts, respectively. Lisinopril lowered left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (by 33% and 39%) and chamber volume (by 4% and 34%) in rats with small and large infarcts, respectively, compared with controls (NS). The combined anatomical and hemodynamic changes led to a reduction of the circumferential wall stress by 20% and 44% in lisinopril-treated rats with small and large infarcts, respectively (NS). No significant changes were seen in the nitrate-treated hearts compared with controls. Lisinopril, given early after myocardial infarction and continued for nine weeks, significantly affected cardiac hemodynamics and ventricular weights in rats with infarcts of different sizes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "201": "The present investigation evaluated the effects of aprotinin, an inhibitor of kallikrein, on blood pressure responses, heart rate, and duration of hypotension induced by acute administration of captopril and enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Captopril (20 mg/kg) and enalapril (20 mg/kg) administered intravenously caused a significant (p < 0.001) fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the absence of aprotinin. In contrast, captopril (20 mg/kg) and enalapril (20 mg/kg) failed (p > 0.05) to cause a fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the presence of aprotinin (2 mg/kg). Captopril and enalapril were able to significantly reduce the heart rate (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001) in the presence as well as in the absence of aprotinin. The duration of hypotension produced by captopril and enalapril was abolished significantly (p < 0.001) in the presence of aprotinin. These findings may suggest that captopril and enalapril caused hypotension via the kallikrein pathway, since the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin can antagonize the hypotensive responses of these agents. Thus, kallikrein may be an independent mediator in the regulation of blood pressure.", 
    "202": "We compared the response of the oral angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist (ARA) UP 269-6 with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril 20 mg or placebo, during salt depletion in normal men. We also evaluated safety and tolerability. Sixteen healthy, normotensive male volunteers followed a standardised salt-depletion regimen for 3 days before each study day. Seven different doses of UP 269-6 (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 180 mg) were administered double blind in a four-panel dose escalation, with enalapril and placebo randomised within each panel. Supine and erect blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR); serum and urinary electrolytes; plasma active renin (PAR), aldosterone, and Ang II were measured at intervals. Urinary electrolytes and aldosterone were measured for the 24 h before dosing and for 24 h after dosing. Dizziness and light-headedness on standing were reported after UP 269-6 at higher doses. Enalapril caused one episode of symptomatic postural hypotension. No other drug-related adverse events (AE) were noted. There was a dose-related decrease in supine and erect systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) with UP 269-6 at > or = 40 mg, with no change in HR. Based on the maximal decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), UP 269-6 at 180 mg had an effect largely comparable to that of enalapril 20 mg. There was a dose-related increase in PAR with UP 269-6. Although this was greater with UP 269-6 180 mg than with enalapril, serum and 24-h urinary aldosterone suppression was greater with enalapril than with any dose of UP 269-6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "203": "We assessed the inhibitory effect of UP269-6, a new orally active angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous ANG I in healthy male volunteers maintained on an unrestricted sodium intake and compared it with that of enalapril. Seven different single doses of UP269-6 ranging from 5 to 180 mg, 20 mg enalapril, or placebo were administered to 16 subjects in a double-blind fashion. The order of placebo and enalapril was randomized, and UP269-6 was given in an ascending dose order. The peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to a test dose of ANG I was determined serially before and after oral drug administration by monitoring finger BP by a photoplethysmographic method. No drug-related side effect was observed. There was a dose-dependent inhibition of the SBP response to the ANG I challenge. Doses as low as 40 to 80 mg had blocking effects quite similar to that of enalapril 20 mg. Ten hours after the 20- and 40-mg doses of UP269-6, the SBP response was still attenuated when drug levels no longer were measurable in plasma. UP269-6 also produced a dose-related increase in active renin and ANG II levels at 24 h after drug intake. In these volunteers on unrestricted salt intake, no statistically significant effect on 24-h urinary aldosterone excretion was observed. Based on these preliminary data, the pharmacokinetic drug half-life (t 1/2) was estimated at 4.7 h and the EC50 was estimated at 41 ng/ml. UP269-6 appears to be a well-tolerated, potent, orally active, antagonist of ANG II receptors in men. Doses of 40-80 mg might block the ANG I pressor response as does enalapril 20 mg.", 
    "204": "To compare the effects of an angiotensin II (Ang II)-receptor antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on myocardial, vascular structure and reactivity, SHR (5-week-old) were treated with losartan of captoril for 16 weeks. Losartan (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and captopril (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.) significantly prevented the development of hypertension with aging, and the effects by these drugs were almost similar. Losartan and captopril significantly reduced the ventricular weight and the thickening of the coronary artery. Maximal coronary flow (MCF) induced by adenosine in the isolated heart was significantly higher in both the losartan and captopril groups. However, MCF in the captopril group was significantly lower than that in the losartan group. The pressor response to exogenous norepinephrine in the mesenteric arterial bed was significantly lower in the losartan group, whereas that in the captopril group was not. These findings suggest that the local Ang II produced by enzymes other than ACE also may play a role in vascular hypertrophy and hyperresponsiveness in SHR.",

However, an association between self-reported depressive symptoms and corticosteroid exposure was identified. The association was strongest in subjects reporting a past history of depression or a family history of depression. The strength of the corticosteroid-depressive symptom association was comparable with that of associations observed for age, poverty and psychosocial stress.",

    "209": "SHRs were given captopril 20 mg/kg/day (group A, n = 13) and 100 mg/kg/day (group B, n = 17) from intrauterus period to 16 weeks of age, then the treatment was removed. Experiments were carried out at 40 weeks. SBP, left ventricular mass/body weight ratio, wall/lumen ratio of branch III mesenteric and renal artery were determined. The perfusion pressure response to alpha 1 adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine) of resistance blood vessels in a hindquarter model in the presence of Nw-nitro-1-arginine-methyl ester (LNAME) or L-arginine were examined. Untreated SHR (n = 16) and untreated WKY (n = 17) served as controls. Both doses of captopril treatment completely prevented hypertrophy of vascular vessels to some extent comparable to that of the untreated WKY. But their SBP was still significantly higher than that of the untreated WKY. The curves of perfusion pressure responding to incremental doses of phenylephrine shifted rightward in the captopril treatment groups in a dose dependent manner. The curves of high dose group were almost identical to those of WKY, markedly different from that of the untreated SHR. Captopril decreased the over enhanced vasoconstrictor effect of LNAME in SHR. The attenuated vasoconstrictor effect by L-arginine was greatly augmented by captopril, suggesting that captopril improves the function of resistance of vessels by mediating endothelial cells. Captopril-induced alteration in vascular structure and function may be separated from its hypotensive effect. Clinically, continuing administration of captopril may be beneficial to the improvement of the vascular system in those blood pressure unresponsive patients.",

The mechanisms involved in NO-induced vasodilatation and cytotoxicity are briefly reviewed in the context of inflammatory reactions and cardiovascular function. Although NO can hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle, activation of the endothelium can induce hyperpolarization and vasodilatation by other means. Endogenous inhibitors of NO generated by leucocytes may compromise blood flow distribution after ischaemia and reperfusion injury. Chronic heart failure is associated simultaneously with impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and with excess production of NO via the inducible NO synthase (iNOS), although it is unclear whether the latter ameliorates or exacerbates ventricular dysfunction. Excess NO production is also one of the earliest signs of transplant rejection, and suppression of iNOS expression by immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporin A might be one means by which these drugs protect allografts. Disturbances in the activity of NOS isoforms in the artery wall also accompany the development of atherosclerosis, providing conditions propitious for vasospasm and thrombosis. Reversing the NO defects with therapeutic agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, offers promise in protecting against some manifestations of vascular disease.",

Beta blockers should be used to treat complex VA in older persons with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease if there are no contraindications to beta blocker therapy. The use of amiodarone in treating complex VA should be reserved for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in older persons who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta blockers. VA associated with congestive heart failure should be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. If older patients have life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs, invasive intervention should be performed. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended in older patients who have medically refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "217": "The aim of the investigation was to assess and compare the effects of a calcium channel antagonist, (i.e. amlodipine) and an ACE-inhibitor (i.e. lisinopril) in reducing chronic left ventricular hypertrophy in 15-week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Changes in cardiac hypertrophy were assessed after 8 weeks by measuring the fractional rates of protein synthesis using a 'flooding dose' of [3H]-phenylalanine for 10 min. Blood pressure was monitored throughout the treatment period in both SHR and Wistar-Kyoto control rats (WKY). The results showed a decrease in blood pressure by amlodipine after 1 week of treatment which was further reduced at 4 to 8 weeks. Lisinopril caused immediate and sustained reductions in blood pressure (190 mmHg to 130 mmHg, P < 0.001). After 8 weeks of treatment in SHR rats, amlodipine had no significant effect on left ventricular weight (P > 0.05), whereas lisinopril caused a marked reduction. The protein content and RNA were also not changed by amlodipine. In contrast, lisinopril significantly lowered the tissue protein, RNA and DNA content (P < 0.001). The changes in the left ventricles of lisinopril-treated SHR rats were accompanied by an increase in the fractional synthesis rate of left ventricular myofibrillar proteins (+12 per cent, P < 0.025). The synthesis rate per unit RNA was also increased in right ventricular tissue of lisinopril-treated SHR rats. However, amlodipine had no effect on the fractional synthesis rates of any of the left-ventricular fractions of SHR rats (P > 0.05). The cellular efficiency in the right ventricle was also increased in amlodipine-treated SHR rats, indicating a moderate effect on protein metabolism. In conclusion, amlodipine had minimal effects in the reduction of established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), despite reducing the blood pressure, whereas lisinopril caused regression of LVH. These events were associated with small changes in protein synthesis rates, with the contractile protein showing an increase.", 
    "218": "Flow cytometry DNA analysis has been used to measure the percentage of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells in G2 + M phase of the cell cycle in mature stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The effects of three different pharmacological interventions on the cell cycle parameters have also been studied. Vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from SHRSP have significantly elevated G2 + M phase of the cell cycle compared with cells from the normotensive reference strain, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY). This observation reflects an increased tetraploid and octaploid cell populations in vivo. Treatment with a combination of hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on the percentage of cells in G2 + M phase of the cell cycle. Treatments with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril or AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, resulted in an equivalent blood pressure-lowering effect to that obtained with hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide. In contrast to hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide, these two treatments resulted in a highly significant regression of vascular smooth muscle polyploidy in the SHRSP. We hypothesise that angiotensin II plays an important role in cell cycle regulation in that, alone or in conjunction with one of the inhibitory proteins, it is able to stop the cell cycle progression after endoduplication but before the cytoplasmic division. Pharmacological interventions which remove an excess of angiotensin II may allow the cells to re-enter the cell cycle thus resulting in the regression of vascular smooth muscle polyploidy and improved arterial compliance.", 
    "219": "Inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) results in suppression of the formation of angiotensin II and delay of the degradation of bradykinin. Hence, the pharmacological effects of ACE inhibitors are attributable to both of these mechanisms. This is a brief review of the haemodynamic, neurohumoral and metabolic alterations following ACE inhibition, with an attempt to separate those attributable to the angiotensin-mediated actions and those attributable to bradykinin-mediated actions as they relate to prevention or attenuation of cardiac damage in hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and congestive heart failure.", 
    "220": "The effects of ACE inhibitors on plasma aldosterone in chronic heart failure are poor, variable and unsustained. This is important to recognise because aldosterone has many harmful properties of its own. Aldosterone causes magnesium loss, potentiates catecholamines, induces ventricular arrhythmias, alters baroreflex function and stimulates myocardial fibrosis. Strategies to reduce these effects of aldosterone are being explored.", 
    "221": "Currently there is concern that ACE inhibitors are not being utilised to their maximum potential for the prevention or treatment of heart failure. Underutilisation of ACE inhibitors has been attributed to a lack of appropriate medical education of physicians. However, an alternative explanation is that the trials have failed to answer important questions about how ACE inhibitors should be used in heart failure and that physician prescribing is appropriate to the current state of knowledge. The lack of evidence of benefit in patients with heart failure over the age of 75 years and of any substantial controlled trial in patients with apparent heart failure and well-preserved left ventricular systolic function, a common finding in elderly patients, may be common reasons why ACE inhibitors appear to be prescribed infrequently for heart failure.", 
    "222": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibition treatment on the renal acidification function was studied in 5 mild hypertensive subjects. Before and after one week treatment with daily 75 mg of captopril bicarbonate loading was carried out by peroral administration of 68 mmol NaHCO3. The difference between the partial carbon dioxide tension (pCO2) of the urine and blood [(U-B) pCO2], as well as the pH and bicarbonate values were determined at every hour in the course of 3 hours. In the same persons phosphate loadings were also carried out. Although decrease H+ excretion may follow the suppression of aldosterone, which could be expected in response to the short-term captopril treatment, no such change in distal tubular function could be demonstrated by the sensitive methods administered in this study. It seems to be highly probable, that captopril does not limit the urinary acidifying function in patients with healthy kidneys.", 
    "223": "In the present pilot study an attempt was made to evaluate the usefulness of results obtained about the treatment of patients suffering from high blood pressure for a pharmacoepidemiological study of the therapeutic value of antihypertensive agents. Data from 90 hypertensive patients were used in the present retrospective-prospective study. These patients all attended an out-patient clinic located in one of the East-Bohemian districts that are participating in the MONICA programme. Instead of the analysis of the population data, regular blood pressure measurements, plasma glucose levels, and total cholesterol concentrations were measured and analysed. The consumption of various antihypertensive drugs in this study was similar to that found in larger studies performed in other health districts of the Czech Republic. Diuretics were the drugs most frequently prescribed for hypertensive patients. General practitioners rarely prescribed calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 1990 and 1991. The metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs, mostly diuretics, were not significantly evident. The most frequent occurrence of non-compensated blood pressure was recorded for the treatments with Trimecryton and methyldopa. However, the validity of these findings should be tested in a larger group of hypertensic patients.", 
    "224": "The affinity of three substrates for the intestinal peptide carrier is explained based on their three-dimensional (3D) structural data. The kinetic transport parameters of three ACE-inhibitors, enalapril, enalaprilat, and lisinopril, have been determined in an in vivo system using rat intestine. The observed kinetic transport parameters (+/- asymptotic standard error) of enalapril are: 0.81 (+/- 0.23) mM, 0.58 (+/- 0.37) mumol/h per cm2, and 0.56 (+/- 0.04) cm/h for the half-maximal transport concentration (KT), the maximal transport flux (Jmax) and the passive permeability constant (Pm). Enalaprilat was transported by passive diffusional with a Pm of 0.51 (+/- 0.04) cm/h. For lisinopril the kinetic transport parameters were 0.38 (+/- 0.19) mM, 0.12 (+/- 0.07) mumol/h per cm2, and 0.18 (+/- 0.02) cm/h for KT, Jmax, and Pm, respectively. The affinity of the ACE-inhibitors for the intestinal peptide carrier has been evaluated based on their ability to inhibit the transport rate of cephalexin. The inhibition constants (Ki) of enalapril, enalaprilat and lisinopril were 0.15, 0.28 and 0.39 mM, respectively. 3D structural analysis of lisinopril using molecular modelling techniques reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bond formation is responsible for decreased carrier affinity.", 
    "225": "Although many studies have examined the effects of antihypertensive agents on proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate in patients with kidney disease, many questions remain unresolved. These questions include whether the effects of agents differ, whether their effects are similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with renal disease, and whether the effects of any agents are independent of blood pressure reductions.", 
    "226": "We conducted a meta-analysis of studies obtained with MEDLINE and bibliographies from comprehensive reviews but included only investigations with follow-up times of at least 6 months. We combined data (1) in an analysis of randomized controlled trials, (2) in a separate univariate analysis of controlled and uncontrolled trials, and (3) using weighted multiple linear regression.", 
    "227": "In 14 randomized controlled trials, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors caused a greater decrease in proteinuria (pooled mean [95% confidence intervals], -0.51[-0.68 to -0.35], ln [treatment/control]), improvement in glomerular filtration rate (0.13 mL/min per month [0.10 to 0.16 mL/min per month]), and decline in mean arterial pressure (-4.0 mm Hg [-4.9 to -3.0 mm Hg]) compared with controls. In a multivariate analysis of controlled and uncontrolled trials, each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure decreased proteinuria (regression coefficient [95% confidence interval] -0.14 [-0.22 to -0.06] ln [after/before]), but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (-0.45 [-0.58 to -0.32]) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (-0.38 [-0.70 to -0.06]) were associated with additional declines in proteinuria that were independent of blood pressure changes and diabetes. Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure caused a relative improvement in glomerular filtration rate (0.18 mL/min per month [0.04 to 0.31 mL/min per month]), but among diabetic patients there was a tendency for dihydropyridine calcium antagonists to cause a relative reduction in glomerular filtration rate (-0.68 mL/min per month [-1.31 to -0.04 mL/min per month]).", 
    "228": "Long-term beneficial effects of antihypertensive agents on proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate are proportional to blood pressure reductions and are similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with renal disease. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and possibly nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, have additional beneficial effects on proteinuria that are independent of blood pressure reductions.", 
    "229": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate the antihypertensive effects of diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, central alpha-agonists, and other vasodilators.

    "230": "A three-phase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study included 162 patients aged 18 to 75 years with essential hypertension. After diastolic blood pressure was controlled to 90 mm Hg or less with once-daily verapamil hydrochloride, patients received ibuprofen, naproxen, or placebo matching capsules for 3 weeks, and blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse effects were evaluated. A general linear model with 95% confidence intervals was used to compare each nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment group with the placebo group.", 
    "231": "No significant differences in sitting, standing, or supine blood pressure were noted with naproxen or ibuprofen compared with placebo. The percentages of patients in each treatment group with increases of 10 mm Hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. Statistically significant increases in weight were seen with both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapies. Changes in pulse rate were not significant. The incidence of adverse effects was similar across all three treatment groups.", 
    "232": "The addition of naproxen or ibuprofen to the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure is controlled by once-daily verapamil does not cause an increase in blood pressure. Verapamil may therefore offer considerable advantages in maintaining control of blood pressure in patients who regularly receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy.",

Since his hypertension had nevertheless increased, and he developed dizziness and headaches, a combination of ACE-inhibitor and calcium antagonist was now tried, followed--when this treatment proved unsuccessful--by the fixed-combination preparation containing enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide. This at last led to a reduction in his blood pressure to approaching normal values, and his subjective symptoms cleared up.", 
    "234": "The high rates of drug-induced acute renal failure, worsening chronic renal dysfunction and systemic toxicity of renally excreted drugs in the elderly can be minimised by carefully assessing renal function, avoiding potentially nephrotoxic drugs as much as possible and closely monitoring drug concentrations and renal function when they must be used. The co-existence of impaired renal function, degenerative vascular disease or cardiac failure in the elderly substantially increases the risk of renal toxicity. When in doubt about potential nephrotoxicity or an increased risk of systemic toxicity from renally excreted drugs in the elderly, the practitioner should consult the numerous published guidelines.", 
    "235": "The outlook used to be grim: Dipstick-positive proteinuria usually meant that renal failure was inevitable. But now the diagnosis can be made early with the triad of increased kidney size, elevated GFR, and microalbuminuria.

    "236": "Although chronic pressure overload may progress to left ventricular (LV) failure, the pathophysiology of this transition is not well understood. In addition, the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on this transition are largely undefined.", 
    "237": "To examine changes in LV structure and function during the transition to heart failure, rats with LV hypertrophy due to banding of the ascending aorta (LVH, n = 22) and age-matched sham-operated rats (n = 6) were studied 6, 12, and 18 weeks after aortic banding. Two-dimensionally guided transthoracic M-mode echocardiograms and transmitral Doppler spectra were recorded for assessment of LV geometry and systolic and diastolic functions. LVH rats were randomized to no treatment (n = 10) or treatment with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril (50 mg/kg per day, n = 12) after the baseline echocardiogram. Six weeks after banding, LVH rats had increased LV wall thickness with normal cavity dimensions and supranormal endocardial systolic shortening. However, midwall shortening was mildly depressed, and a restrictive diastolic filling pattern was present. After 18 weeks of untreated pressure overload, LV wall thickness was unchanged, but cavity dilation, a fall in endocardial shortening, and further deterioration of diastolic filling were evident. In contrast to untreated LVH rats, the fosinopril-treated rats showed no change in LV diastolic cavity dimension, and systolic and diastolic functions did not deteriorate or improved. Closed chest LV systolic pressures at 18 weeks were not different in LVH or LVH-fosinopril rats (197 versus 198 mm Hg), although end-diastolic pressure was higher in the untreated rats (18 versus 11 mm Hg). Calculated LV systolic wall stress was lower in fosinopril-treated than untreated LVH rats. The severity of LV diastolic filling abnormalities correlated strongly with operating LV chamber stiffness (r = .88, P < .0001).", 
    "238": "This model of pressure overload is characterized initially by concentric LV hypertrophy with compensated LV chamber performance; however, markedly abnormal diastolic filling is present. The transition from compensated hypertrophy to early failure is heralded by LV dilation, impairment of systolic function, and progression of the abnormalities in LV filling. Chronic ACE inhibition in rats with supravalvular aortic banding (1) does not change in vivo LV systolic pressure but prevents increased LV cavity size and increased LV wall stress and (2) attenuates impairment of (or improves) both systolic and diastolic functions. The effects of fosinopril could be explained in part by inhibition of an intracardiac renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "239": "Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) demonstrated that enalapril therapy significantly improved the clinical course of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The goals of this substudy were to evaluate changes in LV structure and function in SOLVD patients and to test the hypothesis that enalapril inhibits remodeling in patients with LV dysfunction.", 
    "240": "Patients entering both the prevention and treatment arms of SOLVD from 5 of the 23 clinical centers were recruited for this substudy. The 301 patients who participated underwent Doppler-echocardiographic evaluation according to standard protocol before randomization to either enalapril or placebo and again after 4 and 12 months of therapy. Recorded data were analyzed in a blinded fashion at a central core laboratory. Analysis of baseline clinical characteristics showed that patients enrolled in the substudy were generally representative of the SOLVD population, although prevention arm patients were slightly overrepresented in the substudy group (69.8% compared with 61.9% of remaining SOLVD patients). The enalapril group demonstrated significant reductions in the mitral annular E-wave-to-A-wave velocity ratio (due predominantly to a reduction in E-wave velocity), and this response was different from that seen in the placebo group (P = .030). Changes in the E-to-A ratio in the enalapril group correlated significantly with changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (r = .56; P < or = .01). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased in placebo but not enalapril-treated patients, and the differences in response between the treatment groups were significant (P = .025 and .019, respectively). LV mass tended to increase in placebo patients and to be reduced in enalapril-treated patients, and the difference in response between the groups was highly significant (P < or = .001).", 
    "241": "These data demonstrate that enalapril attenuates progressive increases in LV dilatation and hypertrophy in patients with LV dysfunction. The results support the possibility that the favorable effects of enalapril reported in the SOLVD trials were related to inhibition of LV remodeling.", 
    "242": "Nanomolar concentrations of des-Asp-angiotensin I potentiated the contractile action of angiotensin II on the rabbit aortic ring but attenuated the contractile action of angiotensin III in the same tissue. Indomethacin had no effect on the potentiation of angiotensin II but inhibited the attenuation of angiotensin III. The action of angiotensin II, angiotensin III and des-Asp-angiotensin I was not inhibited by (S)-1-}[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl}-5-(diphenylacetyl )-4,5,6, 7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo-[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid, ditrifluoroacetate, dihydrate (PD123319), an angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist. The data show that angiotensin II and angiotensin III act on different subclasses of angiotensin receptors and that their actions are differentially modulated by des-Asp-angiotensin I. The data also indicate the possibility that des-Asp-angiotensin I is a functional peptide that modulates the contractile action of the two angiotensins at sub-nanomolar concentrations.", 
    "243": "The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. Although such an effect could be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension or congestive heart failure in diabetic patients, it might also precipitate severe hypoglycaemia. To test this hypothesis we carried out a nested case-control study, using data in the Dutch PHARMO system (1986-92), among diabetic patients treated with insulin or with oral antidiabetic drugs, who were admitted to hospital with hypoglycaemia. We identified 94 patients who had been admitted with hypoglycaemia and selected 654 controls from the same cohort. With adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, hypoglycaemia was significantly associated with current use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio 2.8 [95% CI 1.4-5.7]). Both among users of insulin and among users of oral antidiabetic drugs, use of ACE inhibitors was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for hypoglycaemia (2.8 [1.2-6.4] and 4.1 [1.4-12.2], respectively). Although ACE inhibitors have several advantages over other antihypertensive drugs in diabetes, the risk of hypoglycaemia should be taken into account. Further investigation of the mechanism is needed since as many as 13.8% of all hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia might be attributable to use of ACE inhibitors.",

    "246": "Among starters, the proportion initiating therapy on diuretics increased from 35.9% in period 2 to 47.5% in period 3, significantly so among women (P = .04). The proportions initiating other drugs displayed no significant trends. Among continuous users, the use of diuretics, beta-blockers, and vasodilators generally decreased over the 3-year period, while the use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased significantly in each of the three periods (P < .05). The decline of 2.7% in the prevalence of diuretic use in period 1 abated during period 2 (1.8% decline), and it slowed significantly (P = .03) to almost a complete halt during period 3 (0.2% decline).

Overall, there was a statistically significant reduction in total mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.88; P < .001) and in the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74; P < .001). Similar benefits were observed with several different ACE inhibitors, although the data were largely based on enalapril maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride, and lisinopril. Reductions for total mortality and the combined endpoint were similar for various subgroups examined (age, sex, etiology, and New York Heart Association class). However, patients with the lowest ejection fraction appeared to have the greatest benefit. The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months, but additional benefit was observed during further treatment. The reduction in mortality was primarily due to fewer deaths from progressive heart failure (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83); point estimates for effects on sudden or presumed arrhythmic deaths (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.12) and fatal myocardial infarction (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.11) were less than 1 but were not significant.",

Under these conditions, increasing concentrations of the drug were seen not to scavenge O.-2 directly. However, a combination of captopril and iron could bring about the breakdown of the superoxide anion; a result that may help to understand the free radical-scavenging properties of captopril.", 
    "254": "The effects of medium-term antihypertensive treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramipril were studied on 10 hypertensive single-kidney patients in a double-blind study versus placebo. Patients with renovascular hypertension were excluded. Compared to placebo, ramipril induces a significant reduction of arterial blood pressure (p < 0.02 for systolic, p < 0.01 for diastolic, and p < 0.05 for mean blood pressure), renal vascular resistance (p < 0.005), and microalbuminuria (p < 0.005), but a significant rise of effective renal plasma flow (p < 0.01) and no significant variation of the glomerular filtration rate. The reduction of microalbuminuria was not related to arterial blood pressure variation. Our study shows that ramipril, in appropriately selected-kidney patients, is effective and safe in reducing arterial blood pressure, bringing about an improvement of renal function and reducing microalbuminuria, which is frequently observed in this condition.", 
    "255": "It has been reported that beta-blockade has beneficial effects on the cardiac function and prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure. However, the mechanism for these effects remained unclear. This study compared the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 2.5 to 5.0 mg/day, or delapril, 15 to 30 mg/day) alone with the effects of beta-blockade therapy (metoprolol, 40 to 60 mg/day) coupled with an ACE inhibitor on global and regional left ventricular (LV) function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the global LV ejection fraction (EF), regional EF (rEF), and regional ejection time (rET) were determined by sector analysis of the radionuclide ventriculogram before and after therapy (duration 14 +/- 9 months). The coefficients of variation of rEF and rET were calculated as indexes of the heterogeneity of regional LV systolic wall motion. EF increased significantly from 20% +/- 8% to 30% +/- 8% (p < 0.05) in patients who received beta-blockade and an ACE inhibitor (n = 5). Furthermore, the coefficients of variation of rET decreased from 27% +/- 13% to 16% +/- 7% (p < 0.05). In contrast, patients treated with an ACE inhibitor only (n = 7) showed no significant improvements in any of these parameters. These results suggest that, compared with an ACE inhibitor alone, beta-blockade improves global and regional LV function in dilated cardiomyopathy by synchronizing myocardial contraction.", 
    "256": "Experimental findings are presented of an in vivo comparison between a Sentron catheter and another tip transducer manometer: a Millar microtip catheter. Both catheters have been used simultaneously in the left ventricle of dogs. Pressure variations were elicited by drug infusion. Pressure values and derivatives obtained from both systems were compared. A cross correlation between episodes of the two pressures was computed. Results from this study showed good correlation between left ventricular systolic pressure measured with both manometers (R = 0.992, p < 0.0001), end-diastolic pressure (R = 0.809, p < 0.0001) and between first derivatives: positive derivative (R = 0.993, p < 0.0001) and negative (R = 0.634, p < 0.0001). The mean cross correlation between both pressure signals was 0.61 +/- 0.04. In the frequency domain no statistical difference was found between the location of the maxima of the peaks. It is concluded that a Sentron manometer can be a valid alternative, at a reasonable price, to a cheaper, though less accurate fluid filled catheter and a more expensive 'golden standard' microtip catheter.",

Cellular and plasma determinants of blood viscosity and renal function were measured in 19 patients at baseline and 2, 60 and 120 days after treatment with enalapril (mean dose 5.4; range 2.5-20 mg/day). Within 2 days of starting enalapril there was a significant decrease in apparent blood viscosity measured at high shear rate (-0.15 mPa.s; p < 0.05) which fell further by day 60. The decrease in blood viscosity was primarily the result of hemodilution, as evidenced by a concurrent fall in plasma albumin concentration and plasma viscosity. A small, but significant decrease, in hemoglobin concentration (-7.4g/l; p = 0.03), and a trend of improved red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) rheological properties may have also contributed to the decrease in blood viscosity. We conclude that enalapril had a beneficial effect on hemorheology in patients with renal disease. The mechanism of the rheological changes appeared to be multifactorial and would be expected to decrease vascular resistance to blood flow.",

Several diagnostic modalities including thallium imaging, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and positron emission tomography have gained considerable acceptance as useful tools in detecting myocardial viability. The management of heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function includes the use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates. In patients with heart failure and impaired left ventricular systolic function, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have become an integral part of the medical management. In patients whose angina is unresponsive to the addition of nitrates, a trial of bet blockers should be attempted and first generation calcium blockers should be avoided. Revascularization should always be sought, particularly when myocardial viability has been established.", 
    "292": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and vascular mass are both increased in the mesenteric arteries of diabetic rats. As vascular hypertrophy may result from smooth muscle growth following increased formation of angiotensin II, we have examined the histological nature of the increase in mesenteric arterial mass and the role of elevated ACE activity in diabetic vascular hypertrophy by administration of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril). Cross-sectional area of the media was measured in perfusion-fixed mesenteric vessels of diabetic rats 3 weeks after streptozotocin injection. The media was significantly larger (63%) in mesenteric vessels of diabetic rats compared to age-matched control animals. Medial hypertrophy in these vessels was not associated with increased blood pressure or plasma renin activity but there was evidence for increased hemodynamic load due to hyperphagia and intestinal enlargement. Increased mesenteric ACE activity was involved in this process as there was significant inhibition of medial hypertrophy by perindopril. Other markers of cardiovascular hypertrophy such as left ventricular weight and aortic medial area were less affected, but increased in the diabetic group when corrected for significant body weight effects, consistent with a systemic influence of diabetes on cardiovascular mass. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of vascular complications of diabetes and may have implications for the use of ACE inhibitors in preventing or arresting diabetes-associated vascular pathology.", 
    "293": "Nitric oxide derived from the vascular endothelium and other cells of the cardiovascular system has important roles in physiological regulation of blood flow and may have pathophysiological functions in cardiovascular disease. Nitric oxide can be synthesised from L-arginine by any of three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and its interaction with prostacyclin, its proposed mechanisms of action and cytotoxicity are briefly reviewed in the context of cardiovascular function. Although nitric oxide can hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle, activation of the endothelium can induce hyperpolarization and vasodilatation by other means. Nitric oxide has important roles in the physiological regulation of local blood flow and blood pressure, especially during exercise and in response to shear stresses and other local factors in arterioles. Nitric oxide is also involved in neurogenic control of the microcirculation through autonomic efferent nerves and it contributes to vasodilatation and inflammation associated with activation of sensory nerves. In pathological circumstances, excess nitric oxide produced by inducible NOS compromises circulatory function in septic shock, during transplant rejection, and during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury. Immunosuppressant drugs like cyclosporin A inhibit the expression of NOS through complex intracellular intermediates. Disturbances in the activity of constitutive and inducible NOS in the artery wall accompany the development of atherosclerosis, vasospasm and thrombosis, and may contribute to some forms of hypertension and diabetic vascular disease. Reversing the nitric oxide defect with therapeutic agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offers promise in protecting against some manifestations of vascular disease.", 
    "294": "The polymyopathy of the Syrian hamster is associated with alterations of cellular calcium regulation and contractile performance of cardiac and skeletal muscles and, in particular, the diaphragm. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to preserve contractile performance. Therefore we analyzed the expression of the genes coding for the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (SERCA) in heart and diaphragm of the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster (CSH) from the dilated strain Bio 53-58, and we tested the influence of ACE inhibition on accumulation of the different SERCA mRNAs. In the diaphragm of healthy hamsters, two SERCA mRNA isoforms were present: SERCA 1 and SERCA 2. At 6 mo of age, the myopathic process resulted in decreased levels of SERCA 1, whereas the level of SERCA 2 was unchanged. The ACE inhibitor perindopril (1 mg.kg-1.day-1), administered by force feeding from 1 to 6 mo of age, had no effect on the SERCA 1 mRNA level. In heart, the myopathy was associated with a depressed level of SERCA 2 mRNA in 9- but not in 6-mo-old animals. Perindopril treatment from 6 to 9 mo reversed cardiac hypertrophy and the relative decrease in SERCA 2 mRNA level. Preventive treatment with perindopril from 1 to 9 mo tended to prevent (not significantly) the development of cardiac hypertrophy and reduction in SERCA gene expression. In conclusion, the myopathic process affects SERCA gene expression in the diaphragm and subsequently in the heart. Perindopril treatment can prevent SERCA mRNA loss in heart but not in diaphragm.", 
    "295": "Mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), whole body vascular compliance (C), and unstressed blood volume (USV) are important indexes of cardiovascular function in mammals, but they have not been measured in fish. In the present experiments, dorsal aortic (PDA) and sinus venosus (PSV) pressures were measured in unanesthetized trout before and during electrical cardiac fibrillation, while blood volume (BV) was manipulated between 50 and 150% of normal. Measurements were repeated after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with lisinopril. Cardiac fibrillation (zero-flow condition) rapidly (approximately 5 s) dropped PDA and increased PSV (equals MCFP). MCFP in normovolemic trout (4.8 +/- 0.3 mmHg) varied directly with BV. C determined from in vivo capacitance curves was similar to that obtained gravimetrically, in vitro (3.4 and 3.5 ml.mmHg-1.kg body wt-1, respectively). USV was 13.3 ml/kg body wt (approximately 45% of BV). ACE inhibition reduced PDA in unfibrillated trout at all BV and reduced PDA in fibrillated fish at BV > or = 80%. ACE inhibition did not affect PSV, MCFP, C, or USV. The systemic arteriovenous pressure gradient at zero flow (delta PF0) was greatest at 100% BV (8.2 +/- 0.5 mmHg) and was reduced by ACE inhibition at 80-120% BV. These results show that key indexes of venous function are readily measured in fish and that the trout venous system is not an effector of angiotensin-mediated regulation of arterial blood pressure. Thus angiotensin acts solely on arterial resistance vessels. Furthermore, the drop in delta PF0 during ACE inhibition is due to a decrease in arteriolar resistance.", 
    "296": "Previous studies have indicated that the pressure diuresis and natriuresis (PDN) response is greatly impaired in thyroxine-treated hypertensive rats. In the present study, we have examined the role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) as a mediator of these alterations by characterizing the relationships between renal perfusion pressure and urine flow and sodium excretion in hyperthyroid rats acutely treated with a converting-enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 2 mg/kg) or an AT1 angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan, 10 mg/kg). In the control animals, captopril did not change mean arterial pressure (MAP) or renal blood flow (RBF) but significantly decreased MAP and increased RBF and glomerular filtration rate in the hyperthyroid rats. Captopril did not change the PDN response of the control animals but improved significantly that of the hyperthyroid rats, although it was not completely normalized. Losartan also significantly improved renal hemodynamics and excretion in hyperthyroid rats. These results indicate that an increased intrarenal activity of the RAS is partly responsible for the blunted renal PDN mechanism of the hyperthyroid rats.", 
    "297": "Substantial advances in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic heart disease, especially myocardial infarction, have reduced mortality rates during the past several years. This progress is tempered, however, by the continuing large overall incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiac death in persons in their prime years. Preventive measures are important and are usually best applied by primary care physicians. The acute crisis of coronary artery thrombosis demands accurate diagnosis and timely thrombolytic therapy, which has halved the mortality rate of myocardial infarction. Several effective thrombolytic agents are available; on the basis of several large international trials of these drugs, it appears that the benefits of early and appropriate use of any one of these agents outweigh any individual advantages. In addition to thrombolytics, aspirin and heparin are necessary adjunctive drugs for acute myocardial infarction. Nitroglycerin is helpful, but its essential role seems less evident. Earlier use of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been proved effective in reducing mortality. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is definitely as effective as thrombolytic therapy, but immediate application is logistically challenging in most US hospitals.", 
    "298": "The long-term effects of losartan, an angiotensin II subtype-I receptor antagonist, were compared with those of captopril in a murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by encephalomyocarditis virus. Four weeks after viral inoculation, 42 DBA/2 mice were given oral losartan 1.2 mg/kg/day (n = 8), 12 mg/kg/day (n = 8) or 60 mg/kg/day (n = 8) or captopril 7.5 mg/kg/day (n = 8) in drinking water or distilled water (n = 10). Mice were killed at the end of the 12-wk treatment period. Heart weight, left ventricular thickness, left ventricular cavity dimension and myocardial fiber diameter were significantly lower in mice given losartan 60 mg/kg as compared with the infected untreated group. Captopril had a similar effect on all parameters. The pathologic score of cardiac fibrosis was significantly lower in the mice treated with captopril but was not reduced in the mice treated with losartan. Moreover, as compared with the age- and sex-matched normal mice, cardiac mass and myocardial fiber diameter were significantly lower in normal mice treated with losartan 60 mg/kg. This study suggests that long-term treatment with losartan may prevent thickening of left ventricular wall and cavity dimension in dilated cardiomyopathy caused by encephalomyocarditis virus. The potency, and perhaps the efficacy, of losartan appear to be less than those of captopril.", 
    "299": "One step in de novo pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis was predicted to be an oxidation catalyzed by an unidentified D-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (E4PDH). To help identify this E4PDH, we purified the Escherichia coli K-12 gapA- and gapB-encoded dehydrogenases to homogeneity and tested whether either uses D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) as a substrate. gapA (gap1) encodes the major D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA3PDH). The function of gapB (gap2) is unknown, although it was suggested that gapB encodes a second form of GA3PDH or is a cryptic gene. We found that the gapB-encoded enzyme is indeed an E4PDH and not a second GA3PDH, whereas gapA-encoded GA3PDH used E4P poorly, if at all, as a substrate under the in vitro reaction conditions used in this study. The amino terminus of purified E4PDH matched the sequence predicted from the gapB DNA sequence. Purified E4PDH was a heat-stable tetramer with a native molecular mass of 132 kDa. E4PDH had an apparent Km value for E4P [Kmapp(E4P)] of 0.96 mM, an apparent kcat catalytic constant for E4P [kcatapp(E4P)] of 200 s-1, Kmapp(NAD+) of 0.074 mM, and kcatapp(NAD+) of 169 s-1 in steady-state reactions in which NADH formation was determined. From specific activities in crude extracts, we estimated that there are at least 940 E4PDH tetramer molecules per bacterium growing in minimal salts medium plus glucose at 37 degrees C. Thin-layer chromatography confirmed that the product of the E4PDH reaction was likely the aldonic acid 4-phosphoerythronate. To establish a possible role of E4PDH in pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis, we showed that 4-phosphoerythronate is a likely substrate for the 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase encoded by the pdxB gene. Implications of these findings in the evolution of GA3PDHs are also discussed. On the basis of these results, we propose renaming gapB as epd (for D-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase).", 
    "300": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an important regulator of proximal tubule salt and water reabsorption. Recent studies indicate that rabbit proximal tubule angiotensin II receptors are the type-1 (AT1R) subtype. We studied the effect of Ang II on proximal tubule receptor expression. Rabbits were treated with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or a low salt diet to modulate endogenous Ang II levels. In captopril-treated rabbits, liver and glomerular AT1R mRNA levels increased 242 +/- 125 and 141 +/- 60%, respectively (n = 6-7; P < 0.05), as determined by quantitative PCR. In contrast, proximal tubule AT1R mRNA levels decreased 40 +/- 11% (n = 6; P < 0.05). Binding of 125I Ang II to renal cortical basolateral membranes of captopril-treated rabbits decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.55 to 1.4 +/- 0.17 fmol/mg protein (n = 6; P < 0.025). In rabbits fed a sodium chloride-deficient diet for 4 wk, AT1R mRNA levels decreased 52 +/- 11% in liver and 43 +/- 7% in glomeruli (n = 4-5; P < 0.05), whereas they increased 141 +/- 85% (n = 5; P < 0.05) in proximal tubule. In basolateral membranes from rabbits on the sodium chloride-deficient diet, specific binding of 125I Ang II increased from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 4.3 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg protein (n = 7; P < 0.05). To determine whether Ang II directly regulates expression of proximal tubule AT1 receptors, further studies were performed in cultured proximal tubule cells grown from microdissected S1 segments of rabbit proximal tubules and immortalized by transfection with a replication-defective SV40 vector. Incubation of these cells with Ang II (10(-11) to 10(-7) M) led to concentration-dependent increases in both AT1R mRNA levels and specific 125I Ang II binding. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited Ang II stimulation of AT1R mRNA. AT1R mRNA expression was decreased by either forskolin or a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogue (dibutryl cAMP). Simultaneous Ang II administration overcame the inhibitory effect of forskolin but not dibutryl cAMP. These results indicate that proximal tubule AT1R expression is regulated by ambient Ang II levels, and Ang II increases AT1R mRNA at least in part by decreasing proximal tubule cAMP generation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. Upregulation of proximal tubule AT1R by Ang II may be important in mediating enhanced proximal tubule sodium reabsorption in states of elevated systemic or intrarenal Ang II.", 
    "301": "We investigated the effect of pharmacological treatment with captopril, nitrendipine, and captopril plus nitrendipine on myocardial heterologous adenylyl cyclase desensitization and the underlying postreceptor defects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In myocardial membranes from SHR, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with guanylylimido-diphosphate (P < .001) and forskolin (P < .05) was significantly reduced, whereas no difference with forskolin was obtained in the presence of manganese chloride. Reconstitution of Gs alpha into Gs alpha-deficient S49 cyc- mouse lymphoma cells revealed no difference between SHR and control rats. In contrast, pertussis toxin labeling of Gi alpha was significantly increased in SHR. The reduction of adenylyl cyclase in SHR was abolished after pertussis toxin treatment of membranes. Treatment with captopril, nitrendipine, or both reduced Gi alpha and increased guanylylimidodiphosphate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in SHR. In summary, heterologous adenylyl cyclase desensitization due to an increase of Gi alpha but in the presence of an unchanged activity of Gs alpha or the catalyst occurs in SHR. This alteration, which could contribute to the progression of contractile dysfunction by producing adrenergic subsensitivity, is sensitive to pharmacological treatment most likely because of a reduction of sympathetic activity.", 
    "302": "In the present study, we investigated serum and myocardial neuropeptide Y concentrations as measures of sympathetic activity as well as myocardial beta-adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR and control rats at 10 weeks of age were kept on oral treatment with captopril, nitrendipine, or both for 20 weeks. Treatment only slightly reduced but did not normalize blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in SHR. The elevated serum concentration of neuropeptide Y, the reduced number of beta-adrenoceptors, and the depressed beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity were partly normalized compared with the values observed in control rats. We conclude that antihypertensive treatment, at doses that failed to normalize systolic pressure and to reverse cardiac hypertrophy completely, is able to reduce sympathetic activity in SHR, thereby resensitizing the depressed beta-adrenoceptor-adenylyl cyclase system.", 
    "303": "We studied the evolution in choice of antihypertensive therapy in the elderly over a seven-year period and defined factors associated with such prescribing. To accomplish this, we performed a retrospective analysis of 8428 enrollees older than 65 years of age in the New Jersey Medicaid and Medicare programs newly begun on antihypertensive therapy between 1982 and 1988. Diuretics were the most common agents prescribed (51%), followed by calcium channel blockers (14%), beta-blockers (13%), central adrenergic antagonists (11%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5%). However, the use of diuretics declined sharply during the latter part of the time interval studied. Using logistic regression modeling, we determined that the odds of a subject being started on a diuretic compared with any other antihypertensive drug decreased from 1.0 during the referent years 1982 to 1984 to 0.75 in 1985 to 1986 and to 0.41 in 1987 to 1988, after controlling for demographics, comorbidity, and hospital and physician visits (P < .001). The relative odds of diuretic use were significantly increased (P < .05) for the oldest subjects (odds ratio, 1.28 for age 85 and older versus ages 65 to 74 odds), women (odds ratio, 1.15), and blacks (odds ratio, 1.14). Despite the growing evidence during the study interval of the efficacy of diuretics in treating hypertension in the elderly, diuretic use diminished throughout this period in relation to other antihypertensive drugs. Subject characteristics (oldest subjects, women, and blacks) were important determinants of physicians' choice of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "304": "A moderate reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure in individuals with hypertension and improves blood pressure control in those taking a converting enzyme inhibitor. However, it is unclear how effective reduction of salt intake is compared with addition of other drugs, in particular, thiazide diuretics. We directly compared the separate effects on blood pressure of reducing sodium intake or adding a thiazide diuretic in the pressure of a converting enzyme inhibitor in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. We studied 11 subjects with essential hypertension who had been taking 25 mg captopril twice daily for at least 1 month. In the double-blind study, after 1 month of captopril alone, supine blood pressure was 151 +/- 5/95 +/- 4 (SEM) mm Hg. With the addition of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily for 1 month, blood pressure fell to 137 +/- 5/87 +/- 3 mm Hg. When a moderate reduction in salt intake (from 206 +/- 26 to 109 +/- 20 mmol urinary sodium/24 h) was added to captopril for 1 month, blood pressure was reduced by a similar amount (to 137 +/- 4/90 +/- 3 mm Hg). Plasma potassium fell during the diuretic treatment (3.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/L, P < .05) but increased nonsignificantly during salt reduction (3.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). These results clearly demonstrate that moderate salt reduction, which can be easily achieved, is as effective as a thiazide diuretic in lowering blood pressure in the presence of a converting enzyme inhibitor and has the particular advantage that plasma potassium does not decrease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The extent of wave reflection was estimated by the augmentation index defined as the ratio of the amplitude of pressure wave above its systolic shoulder to the pulse pressure. The augmentation index, left ventricular mass index by two-dimensional echocardiography, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures were determined before and after 8 weeks of daily treatment with fosinopril (10 to 20 mg) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg) with or without diuretics and compared with those values in 79 normotensive control subjects. After 8 weeks of treatment, both drugs lowered 24-hour ambulatory peripheral systolic and diastolic pressures into the normal range to a similar extent (fosinopril, -18/-13 mm Hg; atenolol, -23/-17 mm Hg, both P = NS). On the other hand, whereas the elevated augmentation index in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects (16 +/- 11% versus 10 +/- 8%) was completely normalized by fosinopril (-9.3 +/- 9.8%, P < or = .002), it was lowered by atenolol (-4.8 +/- 8.9%, P < .002) but to a significantly smaller extent (fosinopril versus atenolol effect, P = .04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Despite this evidence that the hypertension is Ang II dependent, TGR(mRen-2)27 rats have suppressed renal renin and renin mRNA content, and there is controversy concerning the plasma levels of renin and Ang II in these rats. We investigated the effect of the transgene on circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin and bradykinin peptides in 6-week-old male homozygous TGR(mRen-2)27 rats. Systolic blood pressure of TGR(mRen-2)27 rats was 212 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM, n = 25) compared with 108 +/- 2 mm Hg (n = 29) for age- and sex-matched Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared with control rats, TGR(mRen-2)27 rats had increased plasma levels of active renin (4.5-fold), prorenin (300-fold), and Ang II (fourfold) as well as tissue levels of Ang II (twofold to fourfold in kidney, adrenal, heart, aorta, brown adipose tissue, and lung and 18-fold in brain). Plasma angiotensinogen levels were reduced to 73% of control, and plasma aldosterone levels were increased fourfold. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme was reduced to 64% of control.

The Registry comprised a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure, including some with predominantly diastolic dysfunction. Drug use was determined in a population cross-sectional manner at the time of identification (74% hospitalized). The median number of drugs per patient was four, with diuretics taken by 62%, digitalis by 45%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) by 32%, calcium channel blockers by 36%, antiarrhythmics by 22%, and beta-blockers by 18%.

    "320": "Adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction should include aspirin, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and, in most patients, consideration of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, especially if left ventricular function is reduced. Heparin has an important adjunctive role in enhancing early vessel patency in patients who receive tissue-type plasminogen activator and in decreasing the frequency of reocclusion of an infarct-related artery during any thrombolytic therapy. Heparin must also be administered to all patients who undergo primary angioplasty. Intravenously administered nitroglycerin and orally administered nitrates are probably most effective in patients with symptomatic ischemia. Calcium channel blockers and prophylactic antiarrhythmic agents are not indicated for most patients with acute myocardial infarction. Currently, insufficient evidence is available to recommend the widespread use of intravenously administered magnesium sulfate in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. In patients with ischemic pain, judicious intravenous administration of morphine can provide relief. Use of warfarin sodium should be reserved for patients at risk for left ventricular mural thrombus.

Further evaluation of the effect of TCV-116 revealed that SHR treated with a low dose of TCV-116 (1 mg/kg per day) showed a decrease in left ventricular mass with only a little decrease in blood pressure and that the incidence of VT/Vf was reduced in association with the degree of regression of LVH. Electrophysiological study using microelectrode techniques revealed that in the LVH groups (SHR-N and SHR-H), the action potential duration (APD) of the left ventricular papillary muscle was more prolonged than in WKY rats, whereas APD shortened to a greater extent during superfusion with a hypoxia/no-glucose solution.

    "328": "1. The ability of bradykinin and its analogues to depolarize rat and mouse superior cervical ganglia was studied by use of in vitro grease-gap recording techniques, and the ability of antagonists selective for bradykinin receptor subtypes to block their effects was examined. 2. Bradykinin (3 microM) depolarized ganglia from both species, although the magnitude of the maximal response was less in mouse (15 +/- 5%, n = 7) than rat tissue (33 +/- 6%, n = 7), relative to muscarine (1 microM). 3. Interleukin 1 beta (30 u ml-1 for 18 h at 37 degrees C) increased the depolarization caused by bradykinin (3 microM) in mouse ganglia from 15% to 54% (P < 0.001, n = 12). Responses to the B1 receptor agonist, [des-Arg10]-kallidin (3 microM) were similarly potentiated but this was only detected after inhibition of peptidase activity with 10 microM captopril (4% to 35%, n = 5). 4. In ganglia from both species the rank order of agonist potency was bradykinin = [Lys0]-bradykinin > [des-Arg10]-kallidin. However, like responses to [des-Arg10]-kallidin in mouse tissue, both the potency of bradykinin and the maximal depolarization achieved (EC50 = 912 nM; 80%, n = 11) was enhanced following inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with 10 microM captopril (EC50 = 50 nM; 135%, n = 4). 5. Responses to bradykinin were selectively antagonized by the B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 but not by the B1 antagonist, [Leu8]-bradykinin1-8. From Schild analysis the pA2 value for Hoe 140 in mouse tissue was 9.65, although the slope of the regression line was significantly greater than unity, indicating non-competitive kinetics (slope = 1.88 +/- 0.18, n = 9). The depolarization caused by [Lys0]-bradykinin was also antagonized by Hoe 140 (3 nM).6. Thus the predominant bradykinin receptor in mouse superior cervical ganglia is compatible with a B2 subtype. Furthermore the depolarizations caused by B1 and B2 agonists in this tissue can be increased following exposure to interleukin l beta, and by blocking peptide degradation with captopril.", 
    "329": "The tissue renin angiotensin system may play a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology. Angiotensin converting enzyme in tissues is now a target for pharmacological inhibition. It is therefore important to determine whether ACE is evenly distributed throughout the vascular tree and whether the enzyme has the same characteristics in different vascular beds. We have thus measured angiotensin converting enzyme density in three functionally different vascular beds with three different methods: the enzyme kinetic assay, a radioligand binding assay and in vitro autoradiography. All three methods demonstrated a significantly higher binding density and activity of ACE in resistance arteries from the mesenteric vascular bed of rats than in microvessels from the brain, or in a conduit artery, the aorta. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the enzyme-radioligand complex was the same in the three functionally different vessel types. Radioligand displacement studies for ACE from plasma and the mesenteric vessels in vitro utilizing a panel of different ACE inhibitors have shown a similar rank order of inhibitory potency suggesting that catalytic sites of ACE were the same in plasma and the mesenteric microvessels. In vivo, the enzyme inhibition in plasma, mesenteric and brain vessels measured by enzyme kinetic and radioligand binding assay were well correlated. There was a similar degree of inhibition between different vessels and tissues (mesenteric vessels, aorta, kidney, left ventricle and coronaries) measured by in vitro autoradiography.",

In 266 mild essential hypertensive outpatients (age: 18-78 years) CBP (trough measurements) and ABP (Spacelabs 90202 or 90207) were measured after 3 to 4 weeks of wash-out and after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with an ACE-inhibitor (n = 135) or a calcium-antagonist (n = 131). ABP recordings were analyzed to obtain average 24 h, day-time (6 a.m. to midnight) and night-time (midnight to 6 a.m.) systolic and diastolic BP values and standard deviations (BP variabilities). Treatment reduced both CBP and ABP. Treatment-induced changes in CBP showed a poor correlation with those in 24h, day- and night-time BP (r never > 0.23) and the correlation was poor also when trough ABP (mean of last 2 h) was considered. Twenty-four hour, day- and night-time BP were similarly reduced by treatment with a direct relationship between the initial BP values and the subsequent BP falls. BP standard deviations were also reduced by treatment in relation to the pretreatment values but the overall reduction was small, limited to the day-time and proportional or less than proportional to the reduction in mean values, with no changes or an increase in variation coefficients. The effects of ACE-inhibitor and calcium-antagonist treatments were superimposable. Our results from a large data base show that antihypertensive treatment effectively reduces all ABP components. The reduction cannot be predicted by the concomitant fall in CBP but it relates to the initial ABP values. Treatment has a limited effect on BP variability, this being the case both for ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists.", 
    "331": "The prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) is poor. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the most promising of current options, with benefits not only in terms of haemodynamic and clinical improvement but also in mortality. Data are reviewed comparing the once-daily ACE inhibitor lisinopril with captopril or enalapril in patients already receiving digoxin and/or diuretics for heart failure. Data are also reviewed which compare lisinopril with digoxin in patients already receiving diuretics alone for heart failure. Lisinopril is more effective than placebo and at least as effective as captopril or enalapril in these comparative studies on the basis of haemodynamics, exercise test results and clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. Lisinopril may also be a suitable alternative, as well as being an adjunct, to digoxin in patients already receiving diuretics alone. Lisinopril is usually well tolerated in patients with heart failure. The mechanism of benefit of ACE inhibitors in heart failure is not clear, but apart from blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may also involve modulation of sympathetic stimulation, cardioreparation and regulation of potassium balance. The new ATLAS study (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril And Survival) is being conducted to address the question of whether ACE inhibitors in general practice should be given at the current low doses, or at the higher doses used in large survival studies.", 
    "332": "1. The mechanism underlying the foetal toxicity induced by captopril is not well understood. Since bradykinin and angiotensin II appear to be important in the regulation of the placental circulation, experiments were performed to assess the effects of captopril on the vascular actions of these peptides on the human foetal placental circulation. 2. Full-term human placentas, obtained from normal pregnancy, were perfused with a modified Tyrode solution bubbled with O2 using a pulsatile pump. The placental perfusion pressure was measured with a Statham pressure transducer and recorded continuously on a Hewlett-Packard polygraph. 3. Bradykinin (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 nmol) injected into the placental arterial circulation produced an increase in placental perfusion pressure in all experiments. This effect of bradykinin was significantly inhibited by indomethacin (3 x 10(-7) M). 4. Captopril (10(-7) M) significantly potentiated the pressor effect of bradykinin on the human placental circulation (n = 6). This effect of captopril was reversed by indomethacin (3 x 10(-7) M). 5. Angiotensin I (n = 6) and angiotensin II (n = 6), injected into the placental arterial circulation, both produced dose-dependent increases in placental perfusion pressure. The dose-response curves to angiotensin I (n = 6) were significantly displaced to the right by captopril in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. We suggest that the toxic effects of captopril on the foetus, rather than reflecting an inhibition of angiotensin II formation, may instead be related to a potentiation of the vasoconstrictor effect of bradykinin on the foetal placental circulation, thereby reducing blood flow and causing foetal damage. The reasons for this are discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In order to evaluate whether treatment with different antihypertensive drugs would affect plasma fibrinogen levels, 118 mild to moderate essential hypertensive subjects, all males, aged 18 to 65 years, were randomly treated with amlodipine 10 mg, atenolol 100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or lisinopril 20 mg, all given once daily for 8 weeks. 2. Before and after 8 weeks' treatment, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fibrinogen, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, plasma uric acid, serum creatinine and serum potassium were evaluated. 3. All four medications significantly reduced BP values, although the BP lowering effect of lisinopril, amlodipine and atenolol was significantly greater compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Plasma fibrinogen levels were unaffected by atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, whereas they were significantly decreased by lisinopril (-11.2%, P = 0.002). This fibrinogen lowering effect was more evident in smokers (-17.7%) than in non smokers (-7.4%). 5. Atenolol and amlodipine did not significantly affect plasma lipids, hydrochlorothiazide increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C; lisinopril increased HDL-C and decreased TC and LDL-C. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma glucose and uric acid concentrations, which were unaffected by the other drugs. The diuretic also reduced serum potassium. 7. The results of this study indicate that lisinopril reduces levels of plasma fibrinogen and confirm that different antihypertensive drugs may elicit different metabolic effects, which may variously influence the overall risk profile of the hypertensive patients.",

    "335": "The distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme was examined in the rabbit brain by in vitro autoradiography with the specific radiolabelled inhibitor 125I-351A. In the rabbit, the highest concentrations of radioligand binding were found in the choroid plexus, blood vessels, subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, area postrema and inferior olive. High levels of binding were found throughout the basal ganglia, consistent with the results in all other species studied. In the midbrain the central gray and the superior colliculus displayed high levels of binding. In the medulla oblongata high levels of binding were associated with the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, consistent with the pattern in other species. There was moderate labelling throughout both the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, which contrasts to the rat but is consistent with the situation in primates. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is more widely distributed in rabbit brain that in rat, human and Macaca fascicularis, and the results suggest ACE has a very general role in the metabolism of neuropeptides. Inhibitors of converting enzyme are very widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart disease, and the rabbit should provide a useful model for examining the effects of these drugs in the brain.", 
    "336": "ACE inhibitors are used widely in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, but there is only limited information on adverse interactions between ACE inhibitors and other cardiovascular or noncardiovascular drugs. The present article provides an overview of this issue, with emphasis on those interactions having the greatest clinical implications. In patients who have been sodium and/or volume depleted by thiazide or loop diuretics, the additional use of ACE inhibitors can lead to an excessive reduction in blood pressure and symptomatic hypotension. An increase in serum potassium levels may occur after coadministration of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors, resulting in hyperkalaemia especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The incidence of acute renal failure may be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy when these drugs are combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and given to patients whose renal function becomes increasingly dependent on angiotensin II and prostaglandins. There is some evidence, albeit scant, linking ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity in patients maintained on lithium, and with the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients undergoing haemodialysis, venom immunisation or concomitant allopurinol therapy.", 
    "337": "Morphology studies imply a possible contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to neurotransmission in the mammalian retina. To investigate further the functional role of the RAS in the visual system of humans, we tested the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Captopril (Capt; 25 mg) on electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, the cone flicker threshold (CFT), the FM-28-HUE test, and the psychophysical rod threshold in healthy volunteers. The parameters of renin, angiotensin, and blood pressure were controlled. We obtained the following results. First, Capt induced a significant decrease in amplitudes of the scotopic b-wave, oscillatory potentials, and the a-wave. The latency of responses to 30-Hz flicker was increased. Second, the CFT was reduced to a lower intensity, whereas the final rod threshold remained unchanged. These results are in accordance with previous immunocytochemical and electrophysiological data. They cannot be explained exclusively by the observed changes in systemic blood pressure. We conclude that the RAS may possibly be involved in retinal neurotransmission in humans in addition to its vascular effects.",

The study consisted of a 3 x 2 factorial design wherein 186 men and women with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 4 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with both 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril reduced systolic and diastolic BP to a similar extent and significantly more than placebo. The 240 mg verapamil + 10 mg enalapril combination was additive for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; 120 mg verapamil + 10 mg enalapril was additive for systolic BP only. The total number of adverse events reported was similar for all six treatment groups. QOL scores were unchanged from baseline and not different between treatment groups. The combination of 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril was significantly more effective at reducing BP than either drug alone; this additivity of effect was not linked to a higher rate of adverse experiences or to a deterioration in QOL. Thus, combination therapy at lower doses may offer an alternative treatment option to higher dose monotherapy.",

There were 14 patients in each group, and they were similar (mean +/- SE) in age (54 +/- 3 v 50 +/- 4 years), gender (nine men/five women), and body mass index (33.4 +/- 0.8 v 33.9 +/- 0.9 kg/m2). Patients treated with lisinopril had a somewhat greater fall in both systolic (18 +/- 3 v 10 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic (12 +/- 2 v 8 +/- 1 mm Hg) blood pressure, but only the change in systolic pressure was statistically significant (P < .05). Plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8 AM to 4 PM (breakfast at 8 AM and lunch at 12 PM), and there was a modest increase in all three variables following hydrochlorothiazide treatment (P < .05 to P < .09). However, daylong plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentration did not change with lisinopril treatment. Finally, neither the ability of insulin to mediate glucose disposal nor fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, changed with either treatment.

    "340": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril would alter cell Na+ transport kinetics, metabolic parameters associated with insulin resistance, or both in young adults with mild hypertension. Sixteen young adults (mean age 29 +/- 4 years) were treated with placebo for 8 weeks, then with lisinopril for 12 weeks. Metabolic risk factors examined included plasma lipid levels, plasma insulin concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity determined by an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure. Red blood cells were assayed for Na+/H+ exchange, Na+/Li+ exchange, Na(+)-K+ pump activity, and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport before and during treatment. Blood pressure decreased from 142 +/- 4/98 +/- 2 mm Hg before treatment to 131 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg during lisinopril treatment (P < .001). During lisinopril treatment, there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol (from 177 +/- 8 to 161 +/- 8 mg/dL, P < .008), in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (from 107 +/- 7 to 91 +/- 7 mg/dL, P < .002), and in insulin at 60 min into the oral glucose tolerance test (from 132 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 15 microU/mL, P < .05). There was a marginally significant increase in insulin sensitivity during lisinopril treatment (P < .08).

    "345": "Fosinopril sodium is an effective new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is very useful for the clinical treatment of hypertension. After oral administration, fosinopril sodium is only partially absorbed (about one third of the drug). We studied the solution behavior of fosinopril sodium in aqueous media by a combination of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and laser light scattering (LLS). LLS characterizes the self-association properties of fosinopril sodium in solution, and NMR chemical shifts provide information on molecular conformation and interactions. The results revealed that fosinopril sodium has a micelle-like self-association behavior with a critical micelle concentration (cmc) approximately 1.5 mg/mL. Hydrophobic interactions could induce formation of micellar aggregates, which had a narrow hydrodynamic size distribution, with an average diameter of approximately 150 nm at concentrations above the cmc. The surface activity and self-association of fosinopril sodium may be responsible for its early observed concentration-dependent stability in aqueous solution, unexpected decrease in solubility in the presence of metal ions, as well as the limited absorption in clinical studies.",

The dosage was increased if the average sitting diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mm Hg. Significantly greater mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were seen after 2, 6, and 8 weeks of isradipine. However, by the end of the trial, 83% of patients receiving isradipine and 78% receiving enalapril showed a decrease of at least 5 mm Hg in sitting diastolic blood pressure to a level below 96 mm Hg. Possible or probable drug-related adverse effects were reported in 36% of patients showing a good antihypertensive response to isradipine, and in 30% of those who responded to enalapril. There was a trend for a lower frequency of adverse effects in isradipine non-responders (25%) and a higher frequency in enalapril non-responders (43%). Pruritus, dizziness, edema, and fatigue were reported more often with isradipine, and cough and changed bowel habits were more common with enalapril. The relationship between the pattern of adverse effects and the extent of blood pressure reduction may be dependent on the mechanism of action of a drug. In responders, isradipine and enalapril showed differing patterns, but a similar overall incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "347": "Captopril was the first oral inhibitor of the angiotension converting enzyme (ACE). Its introduction into clinical practice in 1981 was a great advance in the treatment of essential hypertension. In subsequent years a number of other ACE inhibitors was developed. They are nowadays, due to their favourable effects and good tolerance, basic antihypertensive drugs. They are indicated either as monotherapy or part of combined treatment, in particular in moderate to severe hypertension or when other antihypertensive drugs are ineffective, poorly tolerated or contraindicated. They are suitable also for hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac failure, in diabetics and in dyslipoproteinaemia. Recent reports indicate that ACE inhibitors preserve the quality of life of hypertonic patients better than other hypotensive drugs. It seems that some can it, even improve.", 
    "348": "Diabetes mellitus is the leading underlying cause of end-stage renal disease in the USA. To develop preventive strategies aimed at combatting diabetic end-stage renal disease, three steps are required: first, the delineation of the natural history of diabetic nephropathy; second, the identification of modifiable risk factors for the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy; and third, the demonstration that manipulation of these factors does indeed reduce risk. A review of the literature regarding the epidemiology and prevention of diabetic renal disease in humans published during the past year revealed a wealth of data which may guide preventive efforts. Prospective cohort studies confirmed that microalbuminuria is a strong predictor of nephropathy and that blood pressure is an important modifiable risk factor for the progression of diabetic renal disease. In addition, observational studies identified several novel factors which might also increase risk. Randomized controlled trials provided convincing evidence that strict glycemic control reduces the risk of progression to diabetic nephropathy by 50%. Data from trials also demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors slow the progression of renal disease beyond their effect on blood pressure alone. Future research should further evaluate novel modifiable risk factors, define optimal treatment strategies for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antihypertensive agents, and develop methods to translate these findings into practice for the general population.", 
    "349": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of large conductance arteries. We investigated whether a similar reduction also occurs in small arteries, and whether such a reduction can be prevented by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (P) in a rat model of CHF (left coronary artery ligation). After 1 month treatment with placebo or P (2 mg/kg/day), rats were anesthetized and arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and central venous pressure were measured with a micromanometer. Segments of aorta and mesenteric artery (mean diameter, 281 +/- 8 microns) were then isolated, cannulated, and perfused at constant pressure using an arteriograph. Responses to increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (Ach), nitroprusside, and to 10(-4) mol/L NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were studied after preconstriction by phenylephrine. Heart failure resulted in a decrease in systolic and diastolic pressures, an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic and central venous pressures, and a significant depression of Ach-induced dilatation of the mesenteric artery (maximal dilatation, from 90 +/- 4% to 63 +/- 4%, P < .05) but not of the aorta (from 56 +/- 8% to 45 +/- 5%, NS) without any modification in the endothelium-independent vasodilatation induced by nitroprusside. In the group treated by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, systolic and diastolic pressures were slightly decreased, whereas left ventricular end diastolic, central venous pressures, and the endothelium-dependent vasodilating response to Ach were normalized. Responses to L-NAME were not affected by CHF or perindopril. Perindopril also decreased hypertrophy, as evidenced by a significantly lower heart weight in treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "350": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) enhance the endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin and cause the accumulation of kinins in the vascular wall. Bradykinin elicits the production of vasodilator prostanoids and nitric oxide by endothelial cells. However, there is an additional component to the dilator actions of bradykinin, which is mediated by a diffusible endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). The knowledge gathered on the nature of EDHF and its mechanism of action are reviewed briefly. EDHF causes hyperpolarization and relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by activating K(+)-channel, the nature of which varies between species. During the inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase, concentration-response relationships of the hyperpolarization and relaxation elicited by bradykinin overlap in canine coronary arteries. Both effects are enhanced equally by the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat. They are inhibited by membrane depolarization that is obtained by raising the extracellular concentrations of potassium ions. Likewise, in the human coronary artery, the hyperpolarization elicited by bradykinin, which is also mediated by EDHF, is augmented in the presence of perindoprilat and prevented by potassium-induced depolarization. In this blood vessel, contrary to the canine coronary artery, the EDHF-mediated responses occur at concentrations comparable to those initiating the nitric oxide-dependent component. Therefore, the increased production of EDHF, which is induced by kinins, may contribute to the cardiovascular effects of perindoprilat, together with an enhanced production of nitric oxide and vasodilator prostanoids.",

Monoclonal antibodies specific for trout leucocytes failed to identify any microglial-like cells in sections of the brain, although microvessels containing immuno-positive reaction products were observed. A number of distinct lipoxygenase products were found in supernatants of ionophore-challenged gill, including 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, 12-HETE, and 12-HEPE, and a large number of dihydroxy fatty acid derivatives with conjugated triene chromophores.

    "356": "Many studies have consistently documented that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in progressive renal disease, but very few data are available on whether they also prevent renal failure and death. The mechanisms of the beneficial effect of ACE inhibition are only partially understood. Recent data suggest that angiotensin II modulates renal synthesis of endothelin-1, a vasoactive peptide implicated in the process of renal injury. Here we investigated in a long-term study whether ACE inhibition ameliorated renal function in uninephrectomized (UNx) male MWF/Ztm rats. Three groups of rats at nine weeks of age underwent UNx or sham-operation. Nephrectomized animals were left untreated or treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in drinking water. In untreated UNx animals systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, urinary protein and renal synthesis of endothelin-1, evaluated by its urinary excretion, were significantly increased, as compared with control animals with two kidneys. End-stage renal failure developed in all untreated UNx rats that died within 9 to 14 months from UNx. ACE inhibitor significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, completely prevented proteinuria and renal function deterioration, and reduced endothelin-1 excretion. All UNx rats treated with lisinopril were alive 14 months after UNx. These results show that ACE inhibition prevents end-stage renal failure induced by UNx in male MWF/Ztm, and that the beneficial effects of angiotensin II inhibition in this model are related to modulation of renal synthesis of endothelin-1.", 
    "357": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) results in tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the obstructed kidney (OBK). In this study we report that a specific angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists, SC-51316, ameliorates the expansion of the renal cortical interstitium in the OBK of the rat at five days of UUO. This is similar to the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. SC-51316 (20 mg/liter in the drinking water) or enalapril (200 mg/liter in the drinking water) was administered beginning 24 hours before UUO and continued through five days after UUO. The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium (Vv) was measured by a point-counting method, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and collagen type IV (collagen IV) protein deposition were examined histologically using specific antibodies. We also examined the mRNA levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and collagen IV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In untreated rats with UUO, Vv was remarkably expanded; collagen IV and alpha SMA protein deposition in the interstitium and PCNA labeling of nuclei were increased. These changes were significantly ameliorated by administration of an ACE inhibitor or an Ang II receptor antagonist. A monocyte/macrophage infiltration was evident in the OBK of untreated or Ang II receptor antagonist treated rats but was greatly reduced in the OBK of rats given enalapril. Increased expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA and collagen IV mRNA was blunted (40 to 75%) by the administration of Ang II receptor antagonist or enalapril. The Ang II receptor antagonist or the ACE inhibitor did not affect the contralateral kidney of rats with UUO or the control kidney of normal rats. This study indicates that the renin-angiotensin system has a major role in the pathogenesis of the tubulointerstitial fibrosis of obstructive nephropathy. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis of obstructive nephropathy is most likely mediated by an increased level of Ang II in renal tissue.", 
    "358": "The co-administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihypertensive agents often, but not always, results in blunting of the effect of antihypertensive therapy. Although NSAIDs have no detectable pressor effects in normal subjects or untreated hypertensive people, they seem to antagonize the action of the majority of antihypertensive agents, making it necessary to increase their dosage, and often preventing proper control of blood pressure, particularly in black and elderly patients. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not completely understood, but may involve inhibition of vascular and renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, with resulting vasoconstriction and impaired renal excretion of Na+ and water. Also, suppression of a possible intermediary action of PG in the antihypertensive action of agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been proposed. Certain antihypertensive drugs, such as Ca(2+)-channel blockers, centrally acting alpha agonists, and diuretics seem less sensitive to antagonism by NSAIDs. Aspirin and sulindac seem to be devoid of pressor effects, and thus provide a safe alternative in patients at risk for this interaction. These compounds may, in selected circumstances, even potentiate the effects of antihypertensive medications. Studies are underway to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of more selective blockers of arachidonate metabolism, such as thromboxane synthase inhibitors and selective inhibitors of PGH synthase-2.",

The effects of NSAIDs on glomerular microcirculation will also be analyzed in comparison with another class of drugs used to lower proteinuria in nephrotic patients, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Finally, we will analyze the relationship between urinary prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 and discuss the effects of modulating these hormones on glomerular functions.", 
    "360": "The coronary effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Because these drugs may interfere with hormone systems other than the reninangiotensin system (RAS), we studied modulation of the coronary effects of neurotensin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) by pretreatment with captopril in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was cannulated and perfused at a pressure equal to mean aortic blood pressure. Coronary blood flow (CBF) was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter, subendocardial segment length by ultrasonic crystals. ACE inhibition (captopril 0.25 mg/kg), as an intracoronary (i.c.) injection, followed by an intracoronary infusion (0.25 mg/kg/h) did not affect the relative vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 (10(-4)-10(-1) micrograms/kg i.c.) or neuropeptide Y (10(-3)-1 microgram/kg i.c.). However preinjection flow of a second dose-response curve of ET-1 was significantly higher in captopril-treated as compared with control animals. The increase in CBF induced by neurotensin (10(-3)-1 microgram/kg i.c.) was potentiated by captopril (40 +/- 14% after vs. 20 +/- 9% before captopril, p < 0.01, at the highest dose used). Changes in hemodynamics or in regional myocardial function could not explain altered effects of neurotensin. We therefore conclude that ACE inhibition does not interfere with the acute vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 or NPY in this canine model but may reverse the long-term tonic coronary constrictor effect of ET-1. Potentiation of the neurotensin effect on CBF might be due to prevention of hydrolysis of neurotensin or to a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism.", 
    "361": "The evidence is becoming stronger (but not conclusive) that restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery at a later date than is generally accepted might decrease mortality. The CORAMI report suggests a good outcome with rescue angioplasty, but, unfortunately, there was no control group. Since urgent rescue PTCA opened the infarct-related artery in the 29% of patients who remained occluded after thrombolysis, those cardiologists advocating emergency PTCA in all infarcting patients argue that 100% of occluded vessels can be opened with PTCA. I don't argue that fact but would point out that 71% of these same patients would have had unnecessary angioplasty since the occluded artery would have opened with thrombolytic therapy. The randomized trial performed by Ellis and colleagues was a difficult one because of physician bias. It took three years to complete at 20 sites, and in the presence of an occluded anterior descending coronary artery some investigators were reluctant to randomize all of their patients to conservative therapy. Obviously, a large trial would be appropriate to confirm Ellis and colleagues' observations but I doubt this will ever be done. Based on what is now known, I think it is worthwhile to consider rescue angioplasty in patients with a known occluded infarct-related artery. Unfortunately, that means performing coronary angiography almost immediately in all patients with infarcting myocardium in order to identify those with persistant occlusion.", 
    "362": "The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify the agreement between simultaneous and ipsilateral non-invasive finger artery blood pressure (Finapres) and intra-arterial radial blood pressure among 13 volunteer hypertensive patients, aged 36-71 years and taking cardiovascular medication, during steady-state fluctuation of arterial blood pressure and during an increase in blood pressure induced by static exercise. Eight patients were being treated with beta-blocking agents, eight with calcium antagonists, four with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, four with diuretics and one with prazosin in combination therapy. Their auscultatory brachial artery blood pressures ranged in systole from 142 to 206 mmHg and in diastole from 88 to 120 mmHg during the treatment. The mean systolic finger artery blood pressure deviated by -14 +/- 5 mmHg (P = 0.02, mean value +/- SEM) and the diastolic finger artery blood pressure deviated by 0.6 +/- 3 mmHg (P = 0.70) from the corresponding radial artery pressure. The maximal beat-to-beat difference between systolic and diastolic finger and radial artery pressure, respectively, showed that a range of less than 10 mmHg in the steady state after individual adjustment for bias. In general, neither systolic nor diastolic differences between the methods exceeded the limits of +/- 10 mmHg, and the bias did not significantly increase (P > or = 0.12) during a 10-mmHg increase in arterial blood pressure caused by static exercise. Among three subjects, an increase in bias and poorer agreement was associated with atrial fibrillation and steplike changes in the Finapres output after autocalibration. The results support usage of the Finapres technique to measure beat-to-beat changes of peripheral arterial blood pressure in hypertensive patients taking cardiovascular medication, with a feasible agreement with beat-to-beat radial artery blood pressure.", 
    "363": "The pharmacokinetics of furosemide (frusemide) in patients with oedema have been relatively well studied, but in many studies it is unclear whether the disease or the oedema per se has the major effect. The rate of absorption of oral furosemide in patients with oedema was decreased, but total bioavailability was almost unchanged. The peak serum concentration (Cmax) and time taken to achieve Cmax were either decreased or unchanged. Binding of furosemide to plasma proteins is lower in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), decompensated liver cirrhosis (DLC) and nephrotic syndrome, probably as a result of hypoalbuminaemia. The elimination half-life (t1/2) can be unchanged (CHF, DLC) or prolonged (chronic renal failure: CRF). Plasma and renal clearance are reduced in patients with CRF and nephrotic syndrome, but are almost unchanged in CHF and DLC. Disease-induced disorders are mainly responsible for the alterations of furosemide pharmacokinetics in oedematous conditions, while the influence of oedema per se is probably not clinically relevant. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin have been studied in a small number of studies only. In patients with CHF, considerable interindividual differences have been found. Because digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window, this drug should be administered cautiously to oedematous patients. Theophylline has higher bioavailability in patients with oedema, with a significantly higher Cmax in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and CHF than in healthy volunteers (29 and 22%, respectively). Furthermore, clearance decreases and t1/2 increases in these patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often administered as prodrugs, and their pharmacokinetic profile could be influenced by the diseases that accompany oedematous states. However, the effect of oedema is difficult to discriminate from that of the disease. Individual ACE inhibitors are affected differently, but importantly the dosage of perindopril should be reduced in patients with CHF, while for most other ACE inhibitors the changes in pharmacokinetic parameters are clinically irrelevant. In conclusion, studies on pharmacokinetic changes in oedema are limited. Besides affecting absorption (after oral administration) and conversion of the prodrug to the active form, probably as a result of the associated disease, oedema has not been proven to cause any clinically relevant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters for individual drugs. However, further studies of this aspect of pharmacokinetics are needed.", 
    "364": "The appreciation that congestive heart failure is not merely a disorder of myocardium has led to a substantial alteration in the treatment of this disease. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is increasing as their well-demonstrated mortality and symptomatic benefits become better publicized and known. Although diuretics and digoxin continue to remain standard additions to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for the therapy of congestive heart failure, investigations of these and other agents continue. For example, acceptance of beta-blockade as a potentially beneficial therapeutic intervention increased in the past year with the publication of the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS), the largest controlled trial to date. Similarly, survival studies of vasodilators and positive inotropic agents such as vesnarinone are ongoing. Even the effects of exercise in severely ill patients (who were previously advised to be sedentary) are being studied. With the understanding that heart failure is a systemic disease and that controlled trials are needed because many of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we can expect continued improvement in the management of heart failure.", 
    "365": "There have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, and this has led to improvements in its treatment. Nonetheless, the prevalence of congestive heart failure and the associated mortality and morbidity continue to increase. Hence, there remains a need for additional therapeutic approaches that will complement current management with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, other vasodilators, and digoxin. This article reviews a number of potential avenues that are currently being evaluated or remain targets for future investigation. Given our current understanding of the mechanisms of progression of left ventricular dysfunction, therapies that limit neurohormonal activation or interfere with its consequences and those that improve the balance between myocardial energy requirements and supply appear to be the most promising. Agents that improve hemodynamics without altering the underlying pathophysiology may produce short-term symptomatic improvement but have limited potential to alter the natural history of congestive heart failure. Positive inotropic therapies probably fall into this category, but most of these also appear to accelerate progression and increase mortality. In the long-term, specific interventions that reverse changes at the cellular and molecular level offer the greatest promise.", 
    "366": "Thrombolysis and other new therapies have proved beneficial in elderly patients with myocardial infarction, but are underused in this age group. Because elderly patients are at greater cardiac risk than younger patients, they have more to gain from treatment. However, these treatments may pose more risk for elderly patients. Physicians must constantly assess the elderly patient's risk status and make treatment decisions based on risk-benefit analysis.", 
    "367": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve left ventricular dysfunction and survival in patients with chronic myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to examine the ACE activity in infarcted tissues in such patients in comparison with non-diseased tissues from control subjects obtained at necropsy.", 
    "368": "ACE activity was measured in the left ventricles and right atrial auricles of patients (n = 9) with chronic myocardial infarction obtained at left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and in the hearts of control subjects at necropsy (n = 10).", 
    "369": "In non-diseased hearts, the ACE activity was highest in right atria and auricles [2.4(SEM 0.2), 2.2(0.3) nmol.mg-1 protein.min-1, NS, respectively], followed by left atria [1.7(0.2)], left auricles [1.5(0.1)], right ventricles [1.0(0.2)], and left ventricles [0.5(0.1)]. The ACE activity was significantly increased in aneurysmal tissues of patients with chronic myocardial infarction relative to left ventricles of control subjects [4.2(0.4) v 0.5(0.1) nmol.mg-1 protein.min-1, P < 0.01]. There was, however, no difference in the ACE activity of right atrial auricles between patients with chronic myocardial infarction and control subjects [2.8(0.5) v 2.2(0.3), NS]. In patients with chronic myocardial infarction, the ACE activity was higher in left ventricles than in right auricles (P < 0.01). The ACE activities in the infarcted and control ventricles were negatively correlated with the membrane protein content (r = -0.77, P < 0.01).", 
    "370": "In non-diseased human hearts, the ACE activity is higher in atria than in ventricles and higher in the right than in the left ventricle. Furthermore, the ACE activity in aneurysmal left ventricular tissue after myocardial infarction is higher than in non-diseased left ventricular myocardium. These results suggest that the local ACE in the human heart may play an important role in the pathophysiological state after myocardial infarction.", 
    "371": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) converts the largely inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the active octapeptide angiotensin II. ACE is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system that has long been suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The ACE gene spans 21 kilobases and consists of 26 exons, and two different mRNAs and endothelial and testicular ACE are transcribed from the ACE gene. Circulating ACE probably originates from proteolytic cleavage of the hydrophobic anchor and passive leakage of the membrane-bound enzyme. Normal serum ACE by spectrophotometric assay is very low (8.3-21.4 microliters/ml). The abnormally elevated ACE levels is indeed a diagnostic aid in sarcoidosis. The ACE gene has 287 base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 16. The ACE deletion polymorphism appears to be associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction in the Caucasian and Japanese population. Recently in multicenter clinical trials (SAVE), administration of inhibitors of ACE were shown to decrease cardiac events after myocardial infarction.", 
    "372": "Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.",

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured radioisotopically by 99mTcDTPA or 51CrEDTA clearance after three and six months of each treatment. Subgroups were assessed for effective renal plasma flow (33 patients), exercise tolerance (25 patients) and by a symptom-oriented questionnaire (45 patients).",

There was no significant difference between the two treatments in the mean baseline GFR or in changes from baseline at three and six months (captopril mean baseline GFR 49.6 ml min-1 1.76 m-2, enalapril 54.7 ml min-1 1.76 m-2; mean change (95% confidence interval) at three months captopril 12 ml min-1 (+3.0, +21.0), enalapril -2 ml min-1 (-13.0; +9.0); mean change at six months, captopril 3.7 ml min-1 (-6.7; +14.2), enalapril -6.0 ml min-1 (-21.0; +9.4). Significantly more patients given captopril had an improvement in GFR during the study period (26/31 compared with 20/31 enalapril-treated patients at three months, p = 0.0096, and 23/30 compared with 15/27 at six months, p = 0.021). There were no significant changes in effective renal plasma flow. Three patients treated with enalapril developed symptomatic hypotension within three days of starting treatment.

Data from three clinical trials conducted in Mexico and including a total of 426 patients were examined using a retrospective approach and statistical methods. The meta-analysis proved that quinapril induces positive diastolic and systolic responses at all the doses studied, particularly at the 10-mg dose. At this dose, 94.1% of patients reduced their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 10 mm Hg or attained a DBP of < or = 90 mm Hg. Overall, quinapril reduced DBP by between 14.8 and 24.8 mm Hg proportionally to the baseline DBP. Systolic blood pressure decreased 16 to 35.7 mm Hg from baseline levels. We conclude that the meta-analysis allowed a clearer and more dependable handling of the results regarding effectiveness and optimum dose of quinapril.", 
    "380": "Two titrimetric methods are proposed for the determination of captopril in pure form or in tablets. In the first method iodide selective electrode is used for indirect titrimetric assay of captopril. This compound forms silver salt in presence of excess silver ions, the excess silver ions are determined potentiometrically with standardized iodide solution and an iodide selective electrode. The second method involves the titrimetric determination of captopril using a new oxidimetric titrant 2.3-dichloro-5.6-dicyano-1.4-benzoquinone (DDQ) in anhydrous acetic acid. The equivalent point is detected potentiometrically using calomel and platinum electrodes. The two methods allow semimicro-determination of captopril, the results by the proposed procedures are in good agreement with those obtained by the official method.", 
    "381": "To examine the role of stress on renal sodium excretion, we studied 27 normotensive and 21 hypertensive subjects. All subjects were placed on a standardized sodium diet. After water loading (2290 ml in 3 1/2 hr) they completed a 30 min baseline and a 30 min stress period (competitive videogame). Sixty-nine percent of the subjects increased (\"excreters\") and 31% decreased (\"retainers\") their sodium excretion under stress. In addition to increased potassium excretion (p < 0.006), excreters also manifested less of a stress associated increase in systolic (p = 0.055) and diastolic (p = 0.040) blood pressure and showed greater expression of anger (p < 0.02) than retainers. The same subjects were also studied to determin the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril 25 mg b.i.d.) on sodium excretion. On captopril, excreters now showed a retention of sodium (p < 0.001) and potassium (p < 0.01) under stress and no longer differed significantly in blood pressure reactivity. The results suggest that there are two different stress-related patterns of renal sodium excretion, that these patterns are related to blood pressure responses to stress, and may be related to anger expression. In addition, sodium excretion patterns under stress may be altered with certain type of antihypertensive medications.", 
    "382": "The present study examines the release of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from human spermatozoa during capacitation conditions and in correlation to acrosome reaction and cell death. The ACE content of spermatozoa was measured by treating the cells with different detergents. Glass wool-filtered and washed human spermatozoa were incubated for 3 hours at 37 degrees C. Percentages of acrosome-reacted and dead spermatozoa did not change significantly, but the ACE release increased from 0 to 2.93 +/- 0.44 mU/100 x 10(6) spermatozoa after 180 minutes (P < 0.001). In order to study the influence of acrosome reaction on ACE release, the acrosome reaction of noncapacitated spermatozoa was induced by 10 microM calcium ionophore A23187. The percentages of acrosome reaction and viability in noncapacitated spermatozoa as well as the ACE release were compared to corresponding data from experiments using capacitated spermatozoa (3 hours, 37 degrees C) from the same donors. Although the number of living acrosome-reacted spermatozoa after ionophore treatment (30.5 +/- 4.0%) was significantly higher than after capacitation (13.3 +/- 2.8%, P < 0.001), ACE release from ionophore-treated, noncapacitated spermatozoa was lower (P < 0.05). The data indicate that ACE release from human spermatozoa during capacitation is independent of acrosome reaction. Measurement of ACE release may be a clinically useful assay for human sperm capacitation.", 
    "383": "ACE inhibitors are superior to other vasodilators in the treatment of congestive heart failure and may be advantageous in patients with myocardial infarction and hypertension. The mechanisms mediating these beneficial effects are not clear. The present article discusses the mechanisms leading to augmented release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide during ACE inhibition. Acute potentiation of bradykinin (Bk)-induced vasodilation was studied in rings of bovine and human coronary arteries mounted in organ chambers for recording of isometric force. The ACE inhibitors captopril, enalaprilat, fosinoprilat, lisinopril, or ramiprilat alone did not affect vascular tone in isolated coronary tone in isolated coronary artery preparations with intact endothelium. However, in the presence of exogenous Bk, kallidin, or one of the slowly degradable Bk2-receptor agonists D-Arg(Hyp3)-Bk or [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-Bk they elicited potent concentration-dependent relaxations. Relaxations in response to lisinopril were not observed in the presence of other vasodilators. They were prevented by mechanical removal of the endothelium, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase or Bk2-receptor blockade. The data indicate that ACE inhibitors potentiate the effects of Bk on endothelial cells by a local mechanism, probably independent of the degradation of bradykinin. The chronic effects of ACE inhibitors on endothelial function were compared with those of selective angiotensin(AT)1-receptor blockade in cyclosporin A (CsA) treated rats. Chronic AT blockade alone does not affect endothelium-dependent relaxation and increases contractions to ATII in the rot aorta. Combination of CsA with either an ACE-Inhibitor or an AT2 receptor antagonist prevented the endothelial dysfunction in the rat arta observed after CsA alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "384": "Hypertension induced in rats by suprarenal banding has a blood pressure elevating effect that is accompanied by the occurrence of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. This phenomenon is already present at 2 weeks after banding and persists up to 1.5 years. The increase in cardiac weight is mostly due to the development of fibrosis, since myocytes are only slightly increased in size. The fibrotic tissue consists mainly of fibronectin and collagen and contains numerous cellular elements. The occurrence of fibrosis can be completely inhibited by the administration of the specific ACE inhibiting drug, ramipril, which indicated that angiotensin II may directly stimulate fibroblasts to produce fibronectin and collagen. The antifibrotic effect of ramipril was also present in a low dosage that did not lower blood pressure, confirming the hypothesis that angiotensin II has a direct effect on connective tissue cells and their ability to produce extracellular matrix proteins. The direct effect of the renin-angiotensin system on the activity of interstitial cells was further proven by molecular biology techniques showing an upregulation of transcription for collagen I and III which is prevented by ACE inhibition.", 
    "385": "This study investigated the role of the endothelium and angiotensin II (Ang II) in regulating medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. [3H]-thymidine incorporation into medial SMC of rat arteries was examined in vivo, using ballooned rat carotid arteries, as well as in vitro, using cultures of aortic tissue rings (organoids). In vivo, maximal medial [3H]-thymidine incorporation occurred within 3 days post-ballooning. In endothelium-denuded organoids, maximum medial DNA synthesis was achieved after 7 days of culture. [3H]-thymidine-labelling of SMC in intact organoids (with endothelium) increased minimally during culture, indicating that the endothelium provided protection with respect to medial proliferation under basal conditions (culture in the presence of 1% plasma-derived serum). Inclusion of 10(-7) M Ang II significantly elevated medial [3H]-thymidine incorporation above that in control cultures. The stimulatory effect of Ang II was much more pronounced in intact organoids that in endothelium-denuded organoids, indicating synergistic growth regulation by Ang II and endothelium-derived factors. When organoids were cultured in the combined presence of Ang II and the ACE inhibitor cilazaprilat, labelling indices of intact organoids were also significantly increased above control, but to a lower level than those obtained in the presence of Ang II alone. However, for endothelium-denuded organoids, medial [3H]-thymidine incorporation in the combined presence of Ang II and cilazaprilat was not significantly different from that in untreated controls. Thus, cilazaprilat exerts both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent negative regulatory effects on medial SMC proliferation.", 
    "386": "It has been suggested that enalaprilat inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in plasma and tissue; it may therefore reduce portal vascular pressure owing to secondary hyperaldosteronism in patients with liver cirrhosis. In order to evaluate this concept, 20 patients with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension received an intravenous infusion of 2.5 mg of enalaprilat. Wedged hepatic venous pressure, free hepatic venous pressure and cardiac index were measured before, immediately after, and then 15 min, 30 min and 1 h after intravenous enalaprilat infusion. The mean pressure gradient between wedged hepatic venous pressure and free hepatic venous pressure was significantly decreased, by 13% immediately after, 18% at 15 min, 23% at 30 min and 13% at 1 h after infusion of enalaprilat. Thirteen patients experienced a decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) greater than 5 mmHg, another three 3-5 mmHg and the remaining four patients exhibited no significant change in HVPG. Systemic haemodynamic indices, including pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure, decreased significantly at 15 and 30 min after enalaprilat infusion (P < 0.01). Liver function, renal function and blood routine before and after enalaprilat infusion showed no significant change. There were no adverse effects during or after enalaprilat infusion. We conclude that enalaprilat infusion can quickly and safely reduce the hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with HBsAg-positive cirrhosis.", 
    "387": "Experiments were designed to investigate the mechanism underlying the endothelium-dependent relaxations to perindoprilat, a converting enzyme inhibitor, in canine coronary arteries previously exposed to bradykinin. Rings suspended in organ chambers were exposed to bradykinin for 3 min and washed extensively for 150 min. In rings previously exposed to the peptide, bradykinin induced relaxations which were augmented in the presence of perindoprilat; this response was not affected by indomethacin, but nitro-L-arginine induced a rightward shift of the relaxation to the peptide without affecting its maximal effect. In canine coronary arteries previously exposed to the peptide, perindoprilat caused endothelium-dependent relaxations (IC50 = 7.83), which had been observed previously at concentrations where the converting enzyme inhibitor did not augment the response to bradykinin. Carboxypeptidase B, but not aprotinin, impaired the relaxation to perindoprilat, suggesting a contribution of bradykinin. The relaxation to perindoprilat was not affected by the B1 antagonist Leu8-des-Arg9-bradykinin. However, the bradykinin B2 antagonist HOE-140 displayed a noncompetitive antagonism against the response to perindoprilat. The response to the converting enzyme inhibitor was not affected by indomethacin but was impaired significantly by nitro-L-arginine. The present findings suggest that in canine coronary arteries previously exposed to bradykinin, the relaxation to perindoprilat is mediated mainly by endothelium-derived nitric oxide. In addition, the response to perindoprilat may be due to factors other than just protection of bound bradykinin from degradation.", 
    "388": "Substance P (SP) evokes fluid secretion and plasma extravasation when applied to the nasal mucosa of rats. SP and another tachykinin, neurokinin A (NKA), are degraded in vitro by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE). In this study, NKA or SP were applied locally to the nasal mucosa of rats. Subsequent fluid secretion was measured by a filter paper technique. Plasma exudation was derived as the recovery of intravenous (i.v.) administered 125I-albumin from the fluid-containing filter papers. In order to inhibit enzymatic degradation of the tachykinins by NEP and ACE, the rats were treated with i.v. administered phosphoramidon or captopril respectively or their combination. SP evoked fluid secretion that was augmented by phosphoramidon and further enhanced by adding captopril. NKA evoked nasal fluid secretion less effectively than SP and the effect was unaffected by peptidase inhibition. SP, but not NKA, evoked increased plasma exudation but only after pre-treatment with phosphoramidon.", 
    "389": "To investigate the contribution of a cardiac renin-angiotensin system to cardiac hypertrophy due to volume overload, the effects of losartan, a non-peptide angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was studied. LVH was produced in male Wistar rats by volume overload secondary to aortic insufficiency (AI). Losartan (10 mg/kg/d) was orally administered for 2 weeks after surgery to both AI and sham-operated (control) rats. Two weeks after surgery, aortic pulse pressure and left ventricular (LV) weight were markedly increased in the AI rats as compared with the control group, whereas cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity remained unchanged. The effects of the chronic administration of losartan an AT1 receptors were verified by the blockade of Ang II pressor response. Losartan treatment produced a significant reduction in LVH in AI rats without affecting the systolic blood pressure. In separate groups of rats, to elucidate the mechanisms of the attenuation of LVH by treatment with losartan, we determined plasma and LV immunoreactive Ang II content and plasma renin activity (PRA). LV Ang II content increased in AI rats, while plasma Ang II content, PRA and II concentration were increased by the treatment. There was a significant positive correlation between LV weight and LV Ang II content. These results suggest that cardiac Ang II, rather than circulating Ang II, plays an important role in the LVH due to volume overload via the AT1 receptor.", 
    "390": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of inhibition on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) of myocardial function and perfusion of the rat impaired by diabetes. Spontaneously diabetic rats were treated with the ACE-inhibitor captopril for 4 months. Cardiac performance was analysed in the isolated heart perfused at constant volume. Epicardial perfusion was determined by measuring changes in epicardial fluorescence after injection of a bolus of fluoresceinisothiocyanate-dextrane (3 kDa) as described previously. As compared to untreated diabetic controls, captopril prevented the increase of end diastolic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure and vascular resistance. The intravascular volume was enlarged and the epicardial perfusion rate increased in hearts of diabetic rats treated with captopril as compared to diabetic controls. Treatment of diabetic rats with the ACE-inhibitor captopril (1) increases the number of perfused capillaries, and (2) can partly prevent the development of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. Together with morphological data demonstrating an inhibition of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in hearts of diabetic rats treated with captopril, our data suggest that ACE-inhibition is cardioprotective in diabetes. These observations are also compatible with the assumption that an accelerated generation of angiotensin II may be involved in the pathophysiological chain of events leading to diabetic cardiopathy.", 
    "391": "This article examines trials of the use of two types of drugs in the treatment of myocardial infarction: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists. ACE inhibitors are an established treatment for hypertension and heart failure and have been shown to reduce mortality from heart failure and after myocardial infarction. Six large studies have been carried out. In 1 in which an ACE inhibitor was given 3-16 days after infarction in patients with an ejection fraction < 40%, mortality was reduced by 17%. In a second study of patients who had evidence of heart failure and were followed up for 15 months, treatment with ACE inhibitors was given 3-10 days after myocardial infarction and mortality was reduced by 27%. Two other studies of 11,000 and 50,000 unselected patients with myocardial infarction showed only marginal clinical benefit. Calcium antagonists were introduced to treat hypertension and angina pectoris. In trials with patients with heart failure, the results have not been encouraging, and in some patients these agents seem to be harmful. Recently, long-acting calcium antagonists have become available, and these may avoid the deleterious effects of short-acting drugs. Since calcium antagonists act on smooth muscle, they may increase myocardial blood flow to improve function after \"stunning\" or \"hibernation.\" This idea was investigated with a long-acting dihydroyridine calcium, antagonist in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Doppler Flow, Echocardiography, and Functional Improvement Assessment of Nisoldipine Therapy-I--DEFIANT I), and a further study is being carried out. At present the widespread use of calcium antagonists after infarction is not recommended.", 
    "392": "In patients with myocardial ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction (LV) may arise from irreversible damage (cell death), myocardial stunning (postischemic dysfunction), or myocardial hibernation (persistent myocardial dysfunction at rest due to underperfusion). Chronic LV dysfunction usually refers to hibernating myocardium. However, stunning might also become chronic, producing persistent myocardial dysfunction. Clinical studies have demonstrated that many patients with coronary artery disease have subsequent recurring ischemic (symptomatic or silent) episodes at short intervals in the same area and that each episode may be followed by myocardial stunning. In these patients the myocardium may not recover fully between episodes and function may remain reversibly depressed for long periods or may even be clinically depressed. The recognition of both stunning and hibernation is very important clinically and therapeutically, since chronic LV dysfunction may have a negative effect on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, both clinical states are potentially correctable. Pharmacologic intervention with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium antagonists might improve or protect hibernating myocardium. The acute hemodynamic effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nisoldipine have been investigated in patients with chronic LV dysfunction probably arising from hibernating myocardium. Nisoldipine was found to improve both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function without activating the adrenergic system. The improvement in systolic function may be due to a redistribution of coronary blood flow and to a slight reduction in afterload induced by nisoldipine. On the other hand, nisoldipine may improve diastolic function in these patients by an intrinsic mechanism, Reducing intracellular calcium overload or balancing intracellular calcium homeostasis in the ischemic areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Proportionate use of calcium antagonists showed the greatest gains, increasing from 0.3% to 27%, while the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased from 0.8% to 24%.

These adverse experiences were also frequently reported in patients receiving placebo: 17.2%, 5.6%, 2.4%, 3.9%, and 2.6%, respectively. Dry cough as an adverse event was reported in 8.8% of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and in 3.1% and 2.6% of patients treated with losartan or placebo, respectively. Only dizziness was considered \"drug-related\" more often in losartan-treated (2.4%) than placebo-treated (1.3%) patients. In controlled clinical trials, losartan was better tolerated than other antihypertensive agents as determined by the incidence of patients reporting any drug-related adverse experiences. Rates of discontinuation due to clinical adverse experiences in patients who received losartan monotherapy or losartan+hydrochlorothiazide were 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with placebo (3.7%). No laboratory adverse experiences were unexpected or of clinical importance. First-dose hypotension rarely occurred with losartan or with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, and withdrawal effects such as rebound hypertension were not observed in clinical trials. There were no clinically important differences in the clinical or laboratory safety profiles in the demographic subgroups for age, gender, or race.

Ambulatory DBP during the day was lowered significantly from 98 +/- 11 mmHg to 87 +/- 10 mmHg (LIS) and to 88 +/- 9 mmHg (NIT) and during the night from 95 +/- 9 mmHg to 86 +/- 8 mmHg (LIS) and to 79 +/- 7 mmHg (NIT). Cumulative sodium excretion 6 hr after an acute sodium load increased to 52 +/- 39 mmol (placebo), 96 +/- 44 mmol (LIS, P < 0.05 vs. placebo), and 71 +/- 34 mmol (NIT). Glomerular filtration rate, cumulative dopamine excretion, ANP, and endothelin excretion did not differ between either treatment group. We conclude, that: (1) both drugs were similar in lowering office BP and during the day, but NIT tended to be more effective during the night; and (2) cumulative sodium excretion during LIS was significantly increased compared with placebo. There was a similar trend during NIT also. Therefore, it is possible that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and possibly calcium antagonists might improve the sodium-retaining state in CAH independent of differences in blood pressure, ANP, dopamine, or renal function.", 
    "400": "The second part of this review summarizes the role of other classes of pharmacological therapy in treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI). The goals of pharmacological therapy are to alleviate symptoms, to stabilize hemodynamic status, and to prevent arrhythmias. These agents have been utilized primarily because of their ability to limit infarct size. Other beneficial properties may include their effects on neurohormonal activation, hemodynamics, and arrhythmias. In an individual patient, age, associated medical conditions, and hemodynamic status are important considerations in choosing a specific class of drug therapy. The beta-adrenergic blocking agents have modest effects on mortality, and they are useful when used alone and in combination with thrombolytic agents. Calcium antagonists have a limited role in acute MI. Diltiazem reduces the incidence of reinfarction in patients with non-Q MI. Oral nitrate therapy has not been shown to reduce mortality. Data from recent trials suggest that prophylactic administration of antiarrhthymic therapy is also not useful in acute MI. The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors when administered in the acute phase of MI needs to be evaluated further. These agents are safe and well tolerated, and they offer greatest benefit when given in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.",

The first method is based on the reaction of captopril with the luminol-hydrogen peroxide-copper(II) system, the copper(II) ion acting as a key species in the light-emitting process. The catalytic activity of copper(II) decreases due to complex formation with the sulphhydrylic captopril analyte. Application of this indirect method allows captopril determinations in the 8.0-1.0 microM range as starting concentrations. Similarly, captopril was capable of generating chemiluminescence from acid cerium(IV) solutions, a reaction that could be analytically exploited by the inclusion of the rhodamine B fluorophore yielding a sensitized-type of chemiluminescence emission that allowed quantitation of captopril concentrations in the 0.1-6.0 microM range with a detection limit of 0.037 microM (original concentration).

    "427": "To find out if there are one or more criteria to guide selection among the ACE inhibitors for the treatment of arterial hypertension, we have reviewed the principal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of the more frequently used agents of this class of antihypertensive drugs. Among the pharmacokinetic aspects that we have considered, terminal half-life, as related to the duration of the antihypertensive effect, and the route of elimination may have an impact in the clinical selection among the various ACE inhibitors. On the other hand, all the other characteristics have no pragmatic clinical relevance or may be corrected by dosage adjustment. Among the pharmacodynamic aspects, the antihypertensive efficacy of the different ACE inhibitors seems to be very similar, and some of the differences found in different studies are probably due to the population investigated and to the protocol of the study (time of blood pressure measurements, diet, drug dosage etc.). However, some differences can be found among the various ACE inhibitors when the antihypertensive efficacy is evaluated also as trough to peak ratio of blood pressure reduction. Indeed, in respect of the administration schedule of each ACE inhibitor not all the agents of this class have a trough to peak ratio above 50 to 60%, as suggested by the Food and Drug Administration of the US. According to this criterion, especially when blood pressure is measured with 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, some drugs such as lisinopril, enalapril and trandolapril should be preferred for their higher trough to peak ratios. Left ventricular hypertrophy is significantly reduced by antihypertensive agents, the ACE inhibitors being the most effective. Indeed, the reduction of left ventricle mass for each 1 mm Hg reduction in mean blood pressure is greater for ACE inhibitors than for other classes of antihypertensive agents. However, this effect seems more class related than characteristic of one or more among the various ACE inhibitors. Insulin resistance is elevated in hypertensive patients and it has been thought responsible for or associated with other metabolic abnormalities. ACE inhibitors seem to correct the insulin resistance of hypertensive patients, but this effect also appears to be class related more than limited to one ACE inhibitor or another. Our knowledge of this field is still limited and more studies are necessary, especially to understand the prognostic impact of insulin resistance and/or insulin resistance improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

They underwent M-mode and Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography at the beginning and after six weeks of enalapril treatment. In this study all patients treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril responded with a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in left ventricle and mass index were shown after six weeks of treatment with enalapril (p < 0.01). Total peripheral resistance and end-systolic stress decreased in the same time course (p < 0.001). Ejection fraction increased in both examinations after six weeks of therapy with enalapril, but this increase was not statistically significant. In radionuclide examinations, time to peak filling rate decreased significantly after six weeks of enalapril therapy (p < 0.02). Despite these improvements in cardiac systolic and diastolic parameters, cardiac output and stroke volume decreased slightly after enalapril treatment. We concluded that enalapril improves diastolic and systolic parameters in LV function but causes slight decreases in cardiac output and stroke volume in addition to lowering blood pressure.",

    "432": "The cardiac interstitium is composed of nonmyocyte cells and a structural protein network which plays a dominant role in governing the structure, architecture, and mechanical behavior of the myocardium. The heterogeneity in myocardial structure, created by the altered behavior of nonmyocyte cells, particularly cardiac fibroblasts which are responsible for myocardial collagen metabolism and fibrous tissue accumulation, may largely explain the appearance of diastolic and/or systolic myocardial failure. Regulatory mechanisms that are related to the fibrous tissue response in various cardiovascular diseases, e.g., hypertensive heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy or post myocardial infarction, are of primary clinical interest. A better understanding of the hitherto neglected role of cardiac fibroblasts in mediating an adverse structural remodeling of the myocardium will lead to specific pharmacologic agents that interfere with the fibrous tissue response. Several lines of evidence based on in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (RAAS) are involved in the structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment, including the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or aldosterone receptor antagonism that was found to prevent myocardial fibrosis in the rat with renovascular or genetic hypertension. In cultured adult cardiac fibroblasts, an angiotensin (Ang)II- or aldosterone-mediated dose-dependent increase in collagen synthesis could be completely abolished by the use of AngII type 1 or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, respectively. Likewise, the AngII-mediated decrease in the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 1, the key enzyme for interstitial collagen degradation, could be antagonized by AngII receptor blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "434": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now widely used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. They are of particular value in treating hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and in diabetics where they have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Differences in the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics between the various ACE inhibitors generally do not translate into significant clinical differences in the majority of patients. However, fosinopril may be the preferred ACE inhibitor in patients with significant renal dysfunction because of a reduced requirement for dosage reduction. The duration of action of ACE inhibitors is determined by two properties, the plasma half-life and the affinity of binding to tissue ACE. All of the ACE inhibitors (with the possible exception of captopril) can provide satisfactory 24-hour blood pressure control in the majority of patients with mild to moderate hypertension when given once daily. Lisinopril provides consistently better 24-hour control of blood pressure than either captopril or enalapril. Evidence for superior 24-hour blood pressure control over enalapril has not been as well established for the other ACE inhibitors. Captopril may be preferred for initiating therapy in patients with severe heart failure who are at risk of first dose hypertension because of its rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of action. There is evidence, however, that perindopril may have a low risk of first dose hypertension in heart failure because of its gradual onset of action. Long-acting ACE inhibitors may be preferable for chronic therapy of heart failure. All of the ACE inhibitors have a low incidence of adverse effects in both young and elderly patients, and there is no convincing evidence of differences in tolerability between the drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Half of the animals of each group drunk plain water while the other half was provided water enriched with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (ENA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. In rats receiving standard diet, ENA had a significant inhibitory effect on the consequences of ablation: the rats had normal blood pressure, low proteinuria, and high endogenous creatinine clearance compared to water-drinking controls. The high-salt diet significantly enhanced the sequelae of ablation: a high blood pressure and proteinuria, low clearance, which ENA was unable to prevent in these animals. No plausible explanation for the absence of ENA's beneficial effect is available: one can speculate that, under conditions of high-salt intake, the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed leaving no place for ENA to exert its effect. We also believe that the highly adverse effect of a high-salt diet in chronic renal failure is due to growth factors other than angiotensin II.",

Enalapril pretreatment alone, compared with placebo, produced slight nonsignificant increments in absolute and fractional sodium excretions and a marked increase in effective renal plasma flow but no change in glomerular filtration rate. Candoxatrilat alone produced marked augmentation of both absolute and fractional sodium excretions. The candoxatrilat-mediated increment in absolute sodium excretion was significantly correlated with increases in urinary cGMP and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in response to this drug, but neither effective renal plasma flow nor glomerular filtration rate was altered compared with placebo. Combining enalapril pretreatment with candoxatrilat significantly attenuated the increments in absolute and fractional sodium excretions in response to the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor. Blood pressure was reduced by enalapril alone compared with placebo, whereas candoxatrilat treatment alone led to a marginal but significant enhancement of blood pressure. The combination of enalapril and candoxatrilat abolished any significant blood pressure change compared with placebo. Thus, candoxatrilat-mediated natriuresis occurs via a renal tubular rather than glomerular mechanism and is blunted by enalapril. This attenuation by enalapril may occur by interference with angiotensin II-dependent effects on the renal tubule or on systemic blood pressure.",

We studied whether oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD) could attenuate these effects of endothelin-1 (2.5 ng/kg per minute for 90 minutes) in six healthy volunteers. Endothelin infusion alone increased plasma endothelin from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 8.8 +/- 1.0 pmol/L (P < .05). Blood pressure rose by approximately 6 mm Hg (P < .05). Renal function changes were relatively large: Renal blood flow decreased from 941 +/- 76 to 729 +/- 118 mL/min (P < .05) and glomerular filtration rate from 105 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 10 mL/min (P < .05); renal vascular resistance increased from 101 +/- 7 to 152 +/- 20 mm Hg.min/L (P < .05); and sodium excretion decreased from 158 +/- 54 to 86 +/- 27 mumol/min (P < .05). Enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure from 94 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < .05) and prevented the hypertensive response to endothelin. By contrast, despite renal predilatation, endothelin reduced renal blood flow strongly (from 1063 +/- 127 to 763 +/- 100 mL/min, P < .05), although maximal renal vascular resistance was numerically lower (124 +/- 11 mm Hg.min/L) than during endothelin alone (P < .05). Glomerular filtration rate fell from 118 +/- 11 to 108 +/- 11 mL/min (P < .05). Enalapril did not alter the antinatriuretic effect of endothelin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Observations in control rats were from 4 to 35 weeks of age, whereas treated rats received enalapril from 4 to 20 weeks and were studied for a further 15 weeks. We measured blood pressure and the ratio of left ventricle weight to body weight and derived methoxamine log dose-perfusion pressure curves in the isolated hindquarter bed. From the changes in resistance properties we also estimated the changes in structure using a model developed previously. During therapy, blood pressure was depressed to a common value in both strains. After drug withdrawal, by age 35 weeks, previously treated SHR developed only mild hypertension, whereas blood pressure of WKY had recovered to the corresponding control level. At 21 weeks, soon after enalapril was stopped, left ventricular development was depressed in both strains; the depression was slightly greater in SHR, but that of vascular resistance was proportionately similar in each strain. Late cardiovascular development between 21 and 35 weeks was attenuated in the previously treated groups. For the left ventricle, it was similar in each strain, but for the vasculature, late development was relatively smaller in SHR than WKY. In the former, the pattern of development between 21 and 35 weeks was the same as in untreated controls and appeared to be mediated in response to the rise in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "443": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) potentiates sympathetic neurotransmission by presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release. We investigated whether endogenous Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity in sodium-depleted essential hypertensive patients. We evaluated the effect of intrabrachial infusion of saralasin, an Ang II antagonist (5 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute), and benazeprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (2 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute), on forearm vasoconstriction (measured by strain-gauge venous plethysmography) induced by the application of lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg for 5 minutes). Both saralasin and benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group) blunted the vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure, suggesting that circulating Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity. In addition, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation can activate the production of vascular Ang II, the effect of saralasin and benazeprilat on lower body negative pressure application was evaluated in the presence of isoproterenol (0.09 microgram/100 mL forearm tissue per minute) and propranolol (10 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute). In two other groups of hypertensive patients, isoproterenol infusion increased the release of Ang II in the forearm vasculature (arteriovenous values measured by radioimmunoassay). Furthermore, isoproterenol potentiated lower body negative pressure-induced vasoconstriction. This facilitating effect was abolished by either saralasin or benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group). In contrast, in two further groups of patients (n = 6 for each group), in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol saralasin and benazeprilat did not alter the vasoconstrictor action of the endogenous sympathetic stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "444": "Transgenic rats carrying the murine Ren-2 gene represent a monogenetic model of hypertension characterized by low plasma renin and high extrarenal expression of the transgene. The hypothesis has been raised that stimulated local reninangiotensin systems may be responsible for the development of hypertension in this model. This study analyzes the effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, which specifically interferes with the renin-angiotensin system, and the direct vasodilator dihydralazine on the renal and extrarenal expression of renin and angiotensinogen. A comparison of gene expression between heterozygous and homozygous transgenic and normal Sprague-Dawley rats was also performed. We demonstrate high sensitivity of blood pressure toward converting enzyme inhibition in transgenic TGR(mREN-2)27 rats. In the kidney, expression of the transgene and the endogenous renin gene increased, suggesting that both are modulated by lisinopril in a similar manner. On the other hand, blood pressure reduction by dihydralazine did not abolish renal renin suppression in transgenic rats, indicating that mechanisms different from direct effects of blood pressure account for renin suppression. Homozygosity for the transgene led to increased Ren-2 expression and higher blood pressure and had opposite effects on angiotensinogen expression compared with heterozygous rats. Cardiac hypertrophy was reduced by lisinopril but not dihydralazine and was positively correlated with cardiac angiotensinogen expression. Increased angiotensin II in the adrenal gland of TGR(mREN-2)27 rats, which overexpresses the transgene, provides evidence that this leads to enhanced generation of tissue angiotensin II. We conclude that expression of the mouse transgene, the endogenous rat renin gene, and the angiotensinogen gene is subject to differential tissue-specific regulation. Reversal of cardiovascular damage with the converting enzyme inhibitor but not dihydralazine suggests that angiotensin II generated locally may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and structural changes in TGR(mREN-2)27 rats.", 
    "445": "In a double-blind randomized trial, the effects of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril) and a beta-blocker (atenolol) on small artery structure were compared in previously untreated essential hypertensive patients. Subjects (diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 and < or = 120 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 months with either perindopril (n = 13, 4 to 8 mg/d) or atenolol (n = 12, 50 to 100 mg/d); the dosage was adjusted upward and in some cases combined (n = 5, perindopril; n = 2, atenolol) with thiazide diuretic to achieve target blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg). Before and at the end of treatment, gluteal biopsies were taken under local anesthetic; from these biopsies, two small arteries were dissected and mounted on a myograph for morphometry. The reduction in blood pressure with atenolol (drop in mean blood pressure 28.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) was greater than with perindopril (20.6 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, P < .05). Perindopril treatment caused an increase in small artery diameter (231 +/- 14 to 274 +/- 13 microns, P < .05) and a reduction in the ratio of media thickness to lumen diameter (7.94 +/- 0.65% to 5.96 +/- 0.42%, P < .05), whereas atenolol had no effect (246 +/- 14 to 231 +/- 13 microns and 7.14 +/- 0.47% to 6.79 +/- 0.45%, respectively). The change in small artery morphology caused by perindopril was not accompanied by any change in media cross-sectional area, suggesting that the change was due to \"remodeling.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Inspired by the diversity of short-term functional responses to vasoactive agents, hypotheses are presented with respect to the heterogeneity of structural alterations.

These hypotheses may help explain the origin of both intervascular and intravascular heterogeneity of vascular structural responses.",

Tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by northern blot analysis, with a specific complementary DNA probe. In the heart, left ventricular mRNA levels for fibronectin; types I, III and IV collagen; and laminin were significantly higher in SHRSP than control Wistar-Kyoto rats. In the mesenteric artery and aorta of SHRSP, TGF-beta 1 mRNA and the mentioned extracellular matrix protein mRNAs were increased compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, the expression of various genes was up-regulated in cardiovascular tissues of SHRSP. Treatment of SHRSP with TCV-116 suppressed the gene expression of the mentioned extracellular matrix proteins and TGF-beta 1 in both heart and blood vessels in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, TCV-116 regressed cardiac hypertrophy and lessened the medial hypertrophy of the aorta in SHRSP. These results show that angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist in vivo can inhibit the gene expression of TGF-beta 1 and extracellular matrix proteins in hypertensive cardiovascular tissues. These effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of AT1 receptor antagonist on hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy and vascular thickening.", 
    "448": "Human chymase is a serine proteinase that converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II independent of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro. The effects of chymase on systemic hemodynamics and left ventricular function in vivo were studied in nine conscious baboons instrumented with a LV micromanometer and LV minor axis and wall thickness sonomicrometer crystal pairs. Measurements were made at baseline and after [Pro11DAla12] Ang I, a specific substrate for human chymase, was given in consecutive fashion as a 0.1 mg bolus, an hour-long intravenous infusion of 5 mg, a 3 mg bolus, and after 5 mg of an Ang II receptor antagonist. [Pro11DAla12]Ang I significantly increased LV systolic and diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic and end systolic dimensions and the time constant of LV relaxation and significantly decreased LV fractional shortening and wall thickening. Administration of a specific Ang II receptor antagonist reversed all the hemodynamic changes. In separate studies, similar results were obtained in six of the baboons with ACE blockade (20 mg, intravenous captopril). Post-mortem studies indicated that chymase-like activity was widely distributed in multiple tissues. Thus, in primates, Ang I is converted into Ang II by an enzyme with chymase-like activity. This study provides the first in vivo evidence of an ACE-independent pathway for Ang II production.", 
    "449": "The mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering action of chronic administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is still controversial. We investigated the effects of the ACE inhibitors, captopril and perindopril, on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in plasma and tissues (adrenal gland and kidney) in the rat. Captopril or perindopril was infused intraperitoneally into rats via a mini-osmotic pump for 6 days at a rate of 0.5 or 0.25 mg/kg/hr, respectively. Perindopril markedly increased plasma renin concentration (PRC) from 12.7 +/- 1.1 to 867 +/- 59 ng Ang I/ml/hr and significantly inhibited plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) from 17.5 +/- 3.5 to 7.8 +/- 0.6 pg/ml and plasma ACE activity from 31.6 +/- 1.7 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 U/liter. Captopril also increased PRC from 12.1 +/- 2.1 to 147 +/- 17 ng Ang I/ml/hr. However, it did not inhibit plasma Ang II (20.6 +/- 1.9 vs 22.0 +/- 2.1 pg/ml, N.S.) and increased plasma ACE activity from 35.9 +/- 1.8 to 65.0 +/- 4.8 U/liter. Perindopril increased kidney renin from 625.3 +/- 84.6 to 2152.3 +/- 233.4 micrograms/g/hr, while captopril produced a modest but insignificant rise in kidney renin (708.0 +/- 107.1 vs 1083.3 +/- 155.5 micrograms Ang I/g/hr, N.S.). On the other hand, both captopril and perindopril decreased adrenal Ang II significantly (from 21.1 +/- 2.7 to 9.2 +/- 0.5 pg/capsule and from 15.5 +/- 2.9 to 2.0 +/- 0.6 pg/capsule, respectively). Adrenal renin was not altered by either treatment. In spite of no inhibition of plasma Ang II, the pressor response to intravenous Ang I was still suppressed after captopril treatment. Both captopril and perindopril lowered the blood pressure of the rats significantly. Our results support the hypothesis that inhibition of tissue RAS is important for the hypotensive action of ACE inhibition.", 
    "450": "The relevance of the tissue prorenin-renin-angiotensin system (PRAS) to male reproduction has been suggested by several investigators in the past. Although the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme in semen has been demonstrated, unequivocal evidence for the presence of prorenin and renin in the semen is not yet available. We have used a specific immunoradiometric assay based on an antibody directed against the pro-segment of the prorenin molecule to demonstrate that significant quantities of prorenin are present in human semen samples. Although semen is a rich source of proteases and protease inhibitors, the assay used by us, unlike the usual enzymatic renin assay, is not affected by such proteases, and their inhibitors. Furthermore, Western blotting data clearly demonstrated that prorenin is present in semen as a 48 kDa protein. In a majority of semen samples, the prorenin content was found to be several fold greater than that measured in EDTA-plasma samples. Interestingly, the level of prorenin was found to be directly proportional to the sperm density in semen samples. Our results suggest that seminal prorenin is produced locally within the male reproductive system, although its exact origin is yet to be defined, that a complete prorenin-renin-angiotensin system exists in human semen and that this system may be relevant to sperm function.", 
    "451": "The study was undertaken to evaluate the development and association of parameters related to the metabolic syndrome during celiprolol treatment. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and independent oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed on 25 nondiabetic patients with controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. The tests were carried out during the patients' previous antihypertensive monotherapy (beta- or Ca-blocker, or an ACE inhibitor), and after 6 and 12 months of celiprolol treatment. About one third of patients were randomized to a control group in which treatment was kept unchanged. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI), measured by the euglycemic clamp test, increased 35% in the celiprolol group at 6 months and remained at that level at 12 months, independent of the previous treatment (p = 0.03, compared to the change in the control group). During a 2 hour OGTT, incremental glucose area under the curve (AUC) decreased from 4.5 to 1.9 hr x mmol/l during 6 months of celiprolol treatment, and decreased further to 1.5 hr x mmol/l at 12 months (p < 0.001). Insulin AUC decreased from 113 to 72 hr x mU/l, and decreased further to 68 hr x mU/l (p < 0.01). All insulin parameters in OGTT were highly significant (p < 0.0001) and inversely associated with ISI. Insulin AUC had the best linear correlation with ISI (r = -0.682, p < 0.0001). Glucose parameters in OGTT correlated only weakly and inversely with insulin sensitivity. From the fasting serum lipids, triglycerides showed an inverse (p < 0.001) and HDL a weak (p < 0.05) positive association with ISI. Four out of 20 metabolic, clinical, and demographic parameters proved to be independently significant predictors for ISI in multiple regression analysis. These were insulin AUC, fasting insulin levels, triglyceride values, and age. The coefficient of determination in this four-parameter linear model was 69%. In this preliminary, observer-masked trial with a limited control group, celiprolol improved the impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance of dyslipidemic hypertensive patients. A fairly predictive model can be formulated to evaluate the peripheral insulin sensitivity of hypertensive patients with suspected metabolic syndrome using OGTT with serum insulin determinations.", 
    "452": "To examine the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and aldosterone antagonist on myocardial collagen in the cardiomyopathic hamster, the collagen concentration was measured by determining the hydroxyproline concentration, and the ratio of type I to type III collagen (type I/III ratio) was measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five-week-old Bio14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters were treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril (20 mg/kg per day) or the aldosterone antagonist K-canrenoate (20 mg/kg per day) in drinking water for 20 weeks, and the collagen concentration and type I/III ratio at 25 weeks were compared with those in 25-week-old untreated Bio14.6 and normal F1b hamsters. The collagen concentration markedly increased and the type I/III ratio significantly decreased (ie, type III collagen dominant) in untreated Bio14.6 compared with F1b at 25 weeks. Captopril and K-canrenoate treatment significantly reduced the collagen concentration and reversed the changes in the type I/III ratio in cardiomyopathic hamster. These results suggest that ACE inhibitor and aldosterone antagonist improve myocardial collagen in the cardiomyopathic hamster, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, and that the mechanism of this improvement may be related to the cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "453": "These economic analyses differ widely in their methods and results because not only do they make different assumptions, they also consider different costs and apply different sensitivity analyses (to factors including costs). All of the economic analyses considered hospitalization costs and drug costs, not surprisingly, because these are the two main variables in the equation. Only the Dutch and UK studies, however, gave consideration to general practice costs, only the Dutch study included nursing home and district nursing costs, and only the UK study included initiation costs, monitoring costs and out-patient costs. Only the Dutch study attempted to make some allowance for indirect costs, although it was somewhat dismissive of their effects. The SOLVD study was the only one to attempt to estimate the direct costs of deaths and none of the studies made any attempt to estimate the indirect costs. With respect to sensitivity analysis, only the Dutch, UK, and USA studies examined the effect of varying the proposed efficacy of treatment, and all found the economic analysis to be sensitive to this variable; indeed, the Dutch study found it to be highly sensitive. The UK, USA, as well as SOLVD studies, examined the sensitivity of the analysis to varying hospital costs and all found it to be sensitive. The UK and USA studies found their analyses to be relatively insensitive to the effects of a discount rate. The USA study found greater sensitivity to varying mortality than the Dutch study. Other factors considered included initiation and follow-up strategies in the UK study and dose regime in the SOLVD study.", 
    "454": "The physiologic effects of ACE inhibitors often result in symptomatic relief in patients with heart failure and prevention of episodes of decompensated heart failure and ischemic events in some patients. It is important to determine if these effects, in conjunction with all other aspects of ACE inhibitor treatment, favorably alter quality of life as judged by the patients. Questionnaires that allow patients to rate the effects of heart failure and treatments on their lives have been used in some controlled clinical trials. The available data suggest that symptomatic patients have a limited quality of life than can be improved by ACE inhibitors. In addition, it seems reasonable to assume that avoidance of episodes of decompensated heart failure and ischemic events would have some yet-to-be-defined effect on maintenance of patients' quality of life. However, the proportion of patients who experience these preventive effects during a few years of follow-up may be too small to document an effect on quality of life in the overall population with mild heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The high mortality rate associated with heart failure makes it difficult to study quality of life over prolonged periods of time. One investigation [18] has suggested that quality of life progressively deteriorates in survivors over 2 to 4 years despite administration of ACE inhibitors. This finding is consistent with the natural history of heart failure, although there are insufficient placebo-controlled data to determine whether ACE inhibitors can delay the long-term progressive decline in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

ACE inhibitors may produce hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients with autonomic neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, renal impairment and when used in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Cathartic and/or diuretic abuse should be suspected when hypokalaemia occurs in young patients suspected of having an eating disorder. NSAIDs may occasionally produce hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment or when used with ACE inhibitors. Sympathomimetics and theophylline derivatives may lower serum potassium levels, but this is usually only of clinical significance when overdosage occurs.",

The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and perindoprilat and the hormonal and haemodynamic responses following a single oral dose were studied in 12 Chinese and 10 Caucasian healthy, normotensive volunteers on two occasions.

Plasma was sampled for assay of perindopril, perindoprilat, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, angiotensin I (AI) and ACE activity. Urine was collected for perindopril and perindoprilat assay. A radioimmunoassay technique was used to measure the prodrug and its active metabolite. 2. The time to maximum concentration (tmax) for perindopril was shorter for the Chinese group after the 4 mg dose (median 0.5, range 0.5-1.5 h vs median 1.0, 0.5-1.5 h P < 0.05) and also tended to be shorter after the weight-adjusted dose (median 0.5, range 0.5-1.0 h vs median 1.0, range 0.5-3.0 h). Cmax and AUC tended to be higher after the 4 mg dose in the Chinese group who had a lower body weight than the Caucasians. 3. The tmax of perindoprilat tended to be shorter for both doses and there was a tendency towards a higher Cmax after the 4 mg dose in the Chinese group but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. 4. There were no differences in the levels of PRA, plasma AI, plasma aldosterone or the degree of ACE-inhibition for either dose in the two ethnic groups. 5.

    "469": "The antihypertensive effects of moexipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and verapamil-SR as add-on therapy to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were investigated in patients with moderate to severe (stages II and III) essential hypertension. Of 147 patients treated for 4 weeks with 25 mg/day HCTZ, 108 whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was 100 to 114 mm Hg inclusive were randomized to 7.5 mg/day moexipril (56 patients) and 180 mg/day verapamil-SR (52 patients) in addition to 25 mg/day HCTZ. If after 4 weeks of treatment the SDBP was > or = 90 mm Hg, the dose of moexipril was increased to 15 mg/day and that of verapamil-SR increased to 240 mg/day; the patients were followed for an additional 8 weeks. Blood chemistries, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone were done during the study. Both moexipril and verapamil-SR were safe and well tolerated and decreased the sitting and standing blood pressure similarly (P < .001). This study demonstrated that the addition of moexipril and verapamil-SR to low dose HCTZ is effective for the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "470": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on insulin resistance, and the mechanism by which ACE inhibitor improves insulin-dependent glucose uptake (insulin sensitivity) in an insulin-resistant hypertensive rat model (fructose-fed rats, FFR) and in essential hypertensives (EHT). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed on fructose-rich or standard chow for 4 weeks and treated either with 10 mg/kg/day of delapril (n = 8), 1 mg/kg/day of TCV-116 (AII receptor antagonist; n = 13), or vehicle (n = 9) for the latter 2 weeks. Steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) was measured with the subjects in the conscious state; simultaneously, we infused insulin (2.5 mU/kg/min) and glucose (8 mg/kg/min) to determine insulin sensitivity in each group. Thirteen EHT were hospitalized and the 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp (GC) method was performed in a fasting condition before and after 2 weeks' administration of TCV-116 (8 mg/day) in 7 EHT and of delapril (120 mg/day) in 6 EHT. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated as M-value calculated from the infusion rate of glucose. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was higher in FFR (137.7 +/- 73.8 mm Hg, P < .05) compared to controls (120.8 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), and was lower in both the delapril (108.1 +/- 6.3 mm Hg, P < .05) and TCV-116 (112.8 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, P < .05) groups than in FFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "471": "A study was undertaken to determine how variations in chronic pressure overload imposed on the left ventricle (LV) regulate both its mass and the relative level of expression of the slow beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) in rodents. Systemic mean arterial pressure was varied by the following interventions: 1) abdominal aortic constriction (AbCon), 2) unilateral nephrectomy coupled with salt and deoxycorticoacetate treatment (Nx-D), and 3) treatment with the angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg.kg-1.day-1) in combination with the other interventions. Results showed that both AbCon and Nx-D induced significant elevations in both beta-MHC protein and mRNA expression relative to the control state. beta-MHC expression (protein and mRNA) strongly correlated with blood pressure as well as LV mass over a wide range. Although captopril treatment significantly reversed the elevations in mean arterial pressure, LV mass, and beta-MHC content in the AbCon group, it had very little effect on these variables in the Nx-D group. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the expression of beta-MHC in the rodent heart is strongly dependent on the arterial pressure imposed on LV. Although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated fully as to how alterations in blood pressure are translated to the regulation of the beta-MHC gene expression, these findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is not an obligatory factor for inducing cardiac hypertrophy or beta-MHC expression in some models of hypertension.", 
    "472": "There is considerable evidence from clinical and experimental studies that blood pressure is lowered by converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) irrespective of whether the plasma renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is stimulated. New insights into the molecular biology of the RAS--in particular, the gene expression of renin and angiotensinogen in various tissues--support the view that the antihypertensive properties of CEIs may be mediated, at least in part, by interaction with tissue RAS. To investigate this possibility further, stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive male rats (SHRSP) were treated orally for 28 days with different CEIs or a peripheral vasodilator to study the effects of the various drug treatments on the gene expression of the RAS in selected tissues. Different effects of different CEIs on tissue gene expression suggest localized action and some degree of organ specificity of the drugs. The experiments involved: (1) untreated controls; and rats treated with either (2) 50 mg/kg of captopril; (3) 10 mg/kg of lisinopril; (4) 10 mg/kg of cilazapril; (5) or 30 mg/kg of the vasodilator hydralazine with 10 rats/group. All of the study drugs reduced systolic blood pressure to normotension. Cardiac hypertrophy and the heart:body weight ratio were significantly decreased only in the CEI-treated animals, and kidney renin mRNA was increased by the CEIs whereas hydralazine had no effect on heart weight or kidney renin mRNA. Plasma renin activity increased in parallel with kidney renin mRNA levels. Liquid hybridization and Northern blotting assays revealed drug-specific regulation of the angiotensinogen mRNA level in the adrenal gland, with cilazapril producing the most marked stimulation of adrenal angiotensinogen gene expression. Both lisinopril and cilazapril suppressed hypothalamic angiotensinogen mRNA. There were no significant changes in angiotensinogen gene expression observed in the kidney or liver with any of the CEIs. In conclusion, these data show that CEIs interact differentially and drug-specifically with tissue RAS, and have class-specific effects on cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "473": "1. The transplacental transfers of three drugs (enalapril, captopril and losartan) which block the renin angiotensin system and have different lipophilicities were studied in chronically catheterized foetal sheep (125-139 days gestation). 2. The ability of the foeto-placental unit to convert enalapril to enalaprilat was studied in two chronically catheterized foetuses. Enalapril (3 mg kg-1, 7.9 mumol kg-1) given i.v. to the foetuses abolished the foetal pressor response to 5 micrograms angiotensin I (AI) in one foetus and attenuated the pressor response in the other. 3. Enalapril (100 mg, 5.7 mumol kg-1) given i.v. to the ewe (n = 5) abolished the maternal pressor response to 2.5 micrograms AI (n = 1) and attenuated the maternal pressor response to 5 micrograms AI (n = 5, P < 0.001). The foetal pressor response to 5 micrograms AI (n = 2) and 10 micrograms AI (n = 3) did not change. The maternal and foetal pressor responses to angiotensin II (AII; n = 5) did not change. 4. Foetal pressor responses to 5 micrograms AI (n = 1) and 10 micrograms AI (n = 2) were attenuated within 11 min of their mothers (n = 3) being given i.v. captopril (15 mg, 1.5 mumol kg-1). Foetal pressor responses to 5 micrograms AII (n = 1) and to 10 micrograms AII (n = 2) did not change. 5. Losartan (100 mg, kg-1, 21.7 mumol kg-1) given i.v. to the foetus (n = 9) attenuated the foetal pressor response to 5 micrograms AII (P < 0.001) but the maternal pressor response to 5 micrograms AII did not change. 6. Losartan (100 mg, 21.7 MICROmol kg-1) given i.v. to the ewe (n = 5) attenuated the maternal pressor response to 5 microg AII (P <0.002) but the foetal pressor response to 5 microg AII did not change.7. It is concluded that the foeto-placental unit of the sheep can metabolize enalapril to enalaprilat.Captopril readily crosses the sheep placenta but enalapril and losartan do not. Thus, the transplacental transfer of these drugs does not parallel their lipid solubilities. Furthermore the results show that AT1 receptors are important in mediating the vasoconstrictor effects of AII in the foetus.", 
    "474": "1. This study analyses the receptors mediating the effects of bradykinin (BK) and analogues on neurogenic twitch contractions of the mouse isolated vas deferens evoked, in the presence of captopril (3 microM), by electrical field stimulation with trains of 4 rectangular 0.5 ms pulses of supramaximal strength, delivered at a frequency of 10 Hz every 20 s. 2. BK (0.1-300 nM) induced a graded potentiation of twitches, with an EC50 (geometric mean and 95% confidence limits) of 4.5 nM (1.7-11.6) and an Emax of 315 +/- 19 mg per 10 mg of wet tissue (n = 6). Similar results were obtained in tissues challenged with Lys-BK, [Hyp3]-BK, Met,Lys-BK and the selective B2 receptor agonist [Tyr(Me)8]-BK (0.1-300 nM). 3. The selective B2 receptor antagonists, Hoe 140 (1-10 nM) and NPC 17731 (3-30 nM), caused graded rightward shifts of the curve to BK-induced twitch potentiation, yielding apparent pA2 values of 9.65 +/- 0.09 and 9.08 +/- 0.13, respectively, and Schild plot slopes not different from 1. Both antagonists (100 nM) failed to modify similar twitch potentiations induced by substance P (3 nM) or endothelin-1 (1 nM). Preincubation with the selective B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (1 microM), increased the potentiating effect of BK on twitches at 30-300 nM. 4. In contrast to BK, the selective B1 receptor agonist, [des-Arg9]-BK (0.3-1000 nM) reduced the amplitude of twitches in a graded fashion, with an IC50 of 13.7 nM (10.4-16.1) and an Imax of 175 +/- 11 mg (n = 4). The twitch depression induced by [des-Arg9]-BK (300 nM) was not affected by Hoe140 (30nM) or NPC 17731 (100nM), but was abolished by the selective B1 receptor antagonist,[Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (1 microM), which did not modify the twitch inhibitory effect of clonidine (1 nM) or morphine (300 nM).5. In non-stimulated preparations, BK (100 nM) also potentiated, in a Hoe 140-sensitive (10 nM)manner, the contractions induced by ATP (100 microM), but not by noradrenaline (10 microM), whereas[des-Arg9]-BK (300 nM) did not modify the contractions induced by either agonist.6. It is concluded that the mouse vas deferens expresses both B1 and B2 receptors, which modulate sympathetic neurotransmission in opposing ways. Neurogenic contractions are inhibited by stimulation of possibly prejunctional B, receptors, whereas activation of B2 receptors increases twitch contractions,in part by amplifying the responsiveness of the smooth muscle cells to the sympathetic co-transmitter ATP.", 
    "475": "Captopril was effective in the long term reduction of serum sodium and aldosterone in normotensive rats, the addition of HCT produced a further decrease in serum sodium and was also useful in preventing hypokalemia produced by HCT. On the other hand, the concurrent therapy with Diclofenac attenuated the hypotensive effect of Captopril and HCT, it was observed that to combine Diclofenac with captopril was more beneficial as regards the metabolic parameters.", 
    "476": "Renal extraction and renal plasma clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide from pigs with complete unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and from intact anaesthetized pigs were determined from arteriovenous differences in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and measured renal plasma flow. The effect of administration of either a cyclooxygenase inhibitor or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was examined during UUO. Renal extraction ratio and renal clearance rate of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the intact pig was stable during the 15 h observation period. UUO resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) temporary increase in renal extraction ratio and a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the renal clearance rate of atrial natriuretic peptide. During cyclooxygenase inhibition there was a significant increase in the renal extraction ratio of ANP. During angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibition, renal handling of atrial natriuretic peptide did not differ from that observed in control animals. The present data demonstrate that atrial natriuretic peptide is extracted by the obstructed kidney. Despite the significant reduction in renal blood flow during indomethacin administration, renal clearance of ANP was unaltered. The increase in ipsilateral renal extraction of atrial natriuretic peptide immediately after ureteral obstruction and indomethacin administration could be explained either by a direct influence of PGE2 on the renal haemodynamics altering renal extraction of ANP, or by a compensatory mechanism attempting to preserve renal function.", 
    "477": "Thirteen diabetic patients with hypertension (mean diastolic blood pressure 96.2 +/- 1.1 mmHg) were included in a study to assess the effects of lisinopril (20 mg day-1) on measures of nerve function. Patients had nerve conduction velocity (NCV), temperature discrimination threshold (TDT), and vibration perception threshold (VPT) measurements. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, there was a significant improvement in median motor NCV (mean change +/- SEM 2.7 +/- 0.6 m s-1, p < 0.0001), median sensory NCV (2.1 +/- 0.9 m s-1, p = 0.03), peroneal motor NCV (1.0 +/- 0.4 m s-1, p = 0.03), and sural sensory NCV (1.9 +/- 0.7 m s-1, p = 0.01) values. There were also significant improvements in warm TDT and VPT. Diastolic BP decreased significantly, but there was no significant change in HbA1. Double blind controlled studies are now needed to confirm the effect of lisinopril on measures of nerve function.", 
    "478": "The measurement of renal function has been a major field of interest in nuclear medicine. Many studies in the literature are still dedicated to this subject, with the aim of replacing the traditional urinary clearance methods with simpler and easier techniques. Simplified plasma clearance methods appear of sufficient accuracy to estimate global kidney function, except in very low function in which urinary clearance is still indicated. Gamma-camera methods have also been developed that, although of a lesser accuracy than the in vitro techniques, offer the important advantage of allowing renal imaging with the estimation of separate kidney function. Because of the intimate link between kidney function and structure, the diagnosis of nephrourological diseases has represented an important goal of nuclear medicine research. The functional information attainable with radionuclides is a valuable complement to the morphological information of imaging techniques such as x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Recent contributions of nuclear medicine to the progress of clinical nephrology include the evaluation of renal function and the diagnostic work-up of renovascular hypertension, obstructive nephropathy, urinary tract infection, and renal transplantation.", 
    "479": "Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipemia are associated with an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, these risk factors are frequently clustered. We investigated whether long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril can improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in this particular group of patients. We selected 10 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (age 59.4 +/- 3.2 years, body mass-index 29.7 +/- 1.5 kg.m-2, blood pressure 169 +/- 6/92 +/- 1 mm Hg, total cholesterol 6.6 +/- 0.3 mM). Using venous occlusion plethysmography, we recorded the increases in forearm blood flow (FBF) in response to three vasodilator stimuli: (a) 5 min of forearm ischemia, (b) infusion of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator methacholine (Mch) into the brachial artery (0.03, 0.3, and 1.0 micrograms/min/100 ml), and (c) intraarterial infusion of the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP 0.06, 0.2, 0.6 microgram/min/100 ml). This procedure was repeated after 6 months of treatment with perindopril 4-8 mg/day. Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was calculated by the quotient of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the FBF. Perindopril reduced blood pressure (BP) by 19/10 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and increased baseline FVR, but improved neither the maximal percentage decrease in vascular resistance induced by Mch (from -80 +/- 2 to -82 +/- 2%) nor that induced by SNP (from -73 +/- 3 to -72 +/- 3%). Perindopril decreased the FVR reached after the ischemic stimulus from 6.5 +/- 1.2 to 4.8 +/- 0.6 U (p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "480": "We investigated the effect of a genetically engineered recombinant human hemoglobin (rHb1.1), specially designed to be used as a blood substitute, on the ability of various well-known vasodilators to relax the rabbit isolated aortic rings precontracted with the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) or with KCl (for nifedipine only). The vasorelaxant effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) and of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), two nitrovasodilators whose effects are mediated by nitric oxide (NO), were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by rHb1.1 (1.5 and 15 microM). Those elicited by isoproterenol, papaverine, histamine, adenosine, atriopeptin II, hydralazine, nifedipine, and cromakalim were comparatively little affected or not affected by rHb1.1 (15 microM). The ability of captopril to inhibit the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin I (AT1) in the rabbit aortic rings was not reduced by rHb1.1 (15 microM). Our results suggest that rHb1.1 shares with purified human Hb the ability to inhibit selectively the vasorelaxant effect of NO-releasing substances such as NTG and SNP. Because the targeted plasma concentration of rHb1.1, when used as a blood substitute, is greater (approximately 50 times) than the highest concentration of rHb1.1 used in this study, significant drug interactions can be predicted between NO donors and rHb1.1.", 
    "481": "This small open study in elderly patients with essential hypertension investigated the effects of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist on red blood cell haematology and haemorheology. Administration of losartan over a 1-year period was not associated with a significant reduction in haemoglobin or plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations and haemorheological indices remained unchanged. These findings are in contrast to similar studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that have shown a significant reduction in erythropoietic activity and a decrease in blood viscosity. Our results indicate therefore that blocking the angiotensin II AT1 receptor does not affect erythropoiesis. Losartan has no adverse haemorheological effects and was associated with a small and statistically insignificant decrease in blood viscosity.", 
    "482": "Zinc-dependent metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon, captopril and a peptide hydroxamate were studied as potential pretreatment compounds by examining their ability to delay the onset or to prolong the time to 50% block of nerve-elicited muscle twitch tension in the mouse phrenic-nerve diaphragm (in vitro at 36 degrees C) after botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A and B (BoNT-A, BoNT-B). Addition of BoNT-A or BoNT-B (1 x 10(-10) M) produced 50% block of the twitch response at 56 +/- 9 min and 76 +/- 4 min, respectively. Preincubation (45 min) of muscles with phosphoramidon (0.2 mM) prolonged the time to 50% block by 15 min in BoNT-B-poisoned muscles with no effect on the time-course of paralysis in BoNT-A exposed muscles. When the same quantities of BoNT-A or BoNT-B (equivalent to 1 x 10(-10) M bath concentration) were preincubated for 2 hr with phosphoramidon (equivalent to 0.2 mM final bath concentration), and the incubation mixture was added to the muscle chamber, the times to 50% block were prolonged by 38 min and 18 min for BoNT-B and BoNT-A, respectively. Preincubation of diaphragms with captopril (up to 10 mM) or peptide hydroxamate (75 microM) failed to antagonize BoNT-A or BoNT-B-induced neuromuscular block. Among the three metalloprotease inhibitors examined here, only phosphoramidon showed a significant protection against both serotypes of BoNT. A search for better inhibitor compounds specifically tailored to match the active site on BoNT molecule deserves attention.", 
    "483": "In this study we infused phenylephrine into adult Wistar rats and used losartan to test for a possible role of angiotensin II in the phenylephrine-induced fibrosis. Phenylephrine, given by Alzet minipumps at a rate of 25 mg.kg-1.d-1, produced a rapid and striking fibrotic response that was obvious after 1 day and progressed throughout a 3-day infusion period. Northern and Western blot analyses showed large increases in cardiac fibronectin expression and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA, corresponding to fibroblast proliferation and myocyte hypertrophy, respectively. Cardiac fibrosis, fibronectin mRNA, and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA were blocked by prazosin (7 mg.kg-1.d-1). Administration of losartan (10 mg.kg-1.d-1) resulted in a threefold decrease in interstitial and perivascular fibroblast proliferation, as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoreactivity (p < .05), a marked reduction of fibronectin mRNA in the heart, and a moderate reduction of cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. The data suggest that effects mediated by a1-adrenergic and angiotensin type 1 receptors may promote cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "484": "New studies suggest that vasodilator systems may play an important role in restraining the rise in peripheral vascular resistance associated with the evolution of arterial hypertension. We characterized in conscious dogs the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of 4 weeks of feeding either the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine (3 mg.kg-1.d-1) or the nitric oxide precursor L-arginine (0.3 mg.kg-1.d-1) during the evolution of two-kidney, one clip hypertension. Inhibition of nitric oxide production elicited a form of hypertension more severe than that produced in placebo-fed two-kidney, one clip dogs. The higher levels of blood pressure were accompanied by lower levels of plasma renin activity and lower angiotensin II concentrations. During the chronic phase of renovascular hypertension, the fall in blood pressure produced by acute systemic injections of lisinopril or losartan was significantly reduced in dogs given the nitric oxide inhibitor. In contrast, chronic administration of L-arginine had no effect on the magnitude of hypertension or on the increases in renin activity and hyperangiotensinemia associated with the evolution of renal hypertension. Likewise, the fall in blood pressure produced by pharmacological blockade of angiotensin II was not different from that recorded in untreated renal hypertensive dogs. The vasodilator component of the blood pressure response due to intravenous injections of angiotensin-(1-7) (1 to 100 nmol/kg) was augmented in both untreated and L-arginine-treated two-kidney, one clip hypertensive dogs, but was significantly attenuated in hypertensive dogs fed the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "489": "The history of the treatment of heart failure may be divided into three stages, the consequences of different conceptions of the physiopathology of the disease, with diuretics to counteract salt and water retention, vasodilators to improve conditions of cardiac load, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to limit the effect of neurotumoral and sympathetic activation. There are two main reasons for using calcium antagonist in heart failure, the first being arterial vasodilatation leading to improve systolic function and the second being the beneficial effect on ventricular relaxation. However, their use has been controversial because of the results obtained with the first generation of these drugs. New molecules derived from dihydropyridine have been developed. Clinical trials with these second generation calcium antagonists are analysed.", 
    "490": "New agents for treating chronic heart failure include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, betablockers and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The ACE inhibitors represent the major therapeutic advance of the 1980-1990 decade. This is the most effective class of drugs on survival, whatever the stage of heart failure and it shows the evolution towards symptoms in asymptomatic patients. Studies currently under way are evaluating the dose-effect relationship of ACE inhibitors. Betablockers improve the quality of life and physical performance but a benefit on mortality has not been shown in two recent trials. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors improve quality of life and physical performance at the price of an increase in mortality. Therefore, they are not indicated in the treatment of heart failure. However, new molecules such as vesnarininone or pimobendan are under trial. Finally, in the next few years, the introduction of antagonists to Angiotensin II receptors is eagerly awaited.", 
    "491": "The aims of treatment of chronic heart failure are to improve the symptoms and the quality of life, reduce mortality and prevent left ventricular dysfunction. Before the first symptom occurs, neurohormonal activation takes place (increased catecholamines and atrial natriuretic peptide levels). Diuretics improve symptoms and are irreplaceable for the elimination of salt and water overload. Loop diuretics are used more often than the thiazides. Their deleterious effects on electrolyte balance are well known. The fact that they activate the renin angiotensin system is a more recent acquisition; the increase in plasma renin activity is a poor prognostic factor. Diuretics potentialize the vasodilator effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors which inhibit the neurohumoral activation induced by the diuretics. This therapeutic association is very logical, effective and allows reduction in the dosage of the diuretic. To date, there are no large scale controlled studies of the effects of diuretics on mortality. Spironolactone corrects hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia induced by loop diuretics. Moreover, it has been shown experimentally in renovascular hypertension and in hyperaldosteronism, that this molecule can prevent myocardial fibrosis, a factor which leads to ventricular dysfunction. The RALES study will analyse the effect of associating spironolactone to diuretic and ACE inhibitor therapy on the mortality of patients in NYHA classes III-IV. The value of digitalis in heart failure patients with sinus rhythm is a classical controversy. Digitalis has a positive inotropic effect (inhibition of NaK-dependent ATPase). More recently, a favourable neurohormonal effect has been reported; digitalis decreases the activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "492": "The effect on myocardial function and structure of long-term administration of quinapril (10-20 mg daily), an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was investigated in 24 patients (18 men, 6 women; mean age 48 [20-65] years) with chronic isolated asymptomatic aortic or mitral regurgitation. Coronary heart disease had been excluded angiographically. After one year's treatment the regurgitation fraction, compared with the pretreatment value, had decreased by 27% in those patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) and 42% in those with mitral regurgitation (MR) (P = 0.0001). The mean left ventricular enddiastolic volume was reduced from 150 +/- 33 to 128 +/- 30 ml/m2 in patients with AR, from 146 +/- 26 to 109 +/- 24 ml/m2 in those with MR (P = 0.0001). The mean endsystolic volume fell from 55 +/- 27 to 44 +/- 28 ml/m2 in patients with AR and from 63 +/- 43 to 47 +/- 29 ml/m2 in those with MR (P = 0.002). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and on exercise rose slightly in patients with AR, remaining unchanged in those with MR. The left ventricular mass, as measured by echocardiography, was reduced by 35% in patients with AR, and the left ventricular hypertrophy, demonstrated in all patients, regressed. In patients with MR the left ventricular mass decreased by 15% and septal thickness became normal (borderline hypertrophy). These data indicate that, after one year's treatment with quinapril, left ventricular dilatation, mass and hypertrophy regressed and left ventricular function improved in patients with AR or MR.", 
    "493": "There is a renewed interest in the kininase I pathway of kinin metabolism, because des-Arg9-bradykinin (des-Arg9-BK) and des-Arg10-Lys-BK are selective and potent agonists of the B1 receptors, that are apparently upregulated by tissue injury. We have developed a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against des-Arg10-Lys-BK. In a radioimmunoassay for des-Arg10-Lys-BK, this antiserum exhibited high specificity. Notably, native kinins with the C-terminal Arg residue, bradykinin (BK) and Lys-BK, did not cross-react to a significant extent, whereas des-Arg9-BK and digoxigenin (DIG)-des-Arg9-BK exhibited a complete cross-reactivity. The antibodies were used to set up a sensitive chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) using the DIG-anti-DIG system as intermediate for the revelation of the immune complexes. The detection limit and the half-maximal saturation concentration for des-Arg9-BK were 27 and 1530 fmol/ml respectively. This assay, as well as another for BK quantification, have been applied in vitro to rabbit plasma activated by kaolin. The conversion of BK into des-Arg9-BK was generally efficient, and the persistence and concentration of both peptides were increased in the presence of enalaprilat an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI). Rabbits treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide exhibited an increase of plasma immunoreactive des-Arg9-BK that was potentiated in animals also treated with ACEI.

Captopril was associated with a non-significant reduction in 4-week mortality (617 [9.05%] captopril-allocated vs 654 [9.59%] placebo-allocated deaths; 2p = 0.3). There was a significant excess of hypotension, mostly early after the start of treatment, but no evidence of any adverse effect on early mortality (even among patients who were hypotensive at entry).

The treatment comparisons were: (i) 1 month of oral captopril (6.25 mg initial dose titrated up to 50 mg twice daily) versus matching placebo; (ii) 1 month of oral controlled-release mononitrate (30 mg initial dose titrated up to 60 mg once daily) versus matching placebo; and (iii) 24 h of intravenous magnesium sulphate (8 mmol initial bolus followed by 72 mmol) versus open control. There were no significant \"interactions\" between the effects of these three treatments, and the results for each are based on the randomised comparison of about 29,000 active versus 29,000 control allocated patients. Captopril There was a significant 7% (SD 3) proportional reduction in 5-week mortality (2088 [7.19%] captopril-allocated deaths vs 2231 [7.69%] placebo; 2p = 0.02), which corresponds to an absolute difference of 4.9 SD 2.2 fewer deaths per 1000 patients treated for 1 month. The absolute benefits appeared to be larger (perhaps about 10 fewer deaths per 1000) in certain higher-risk groups, such as those presenting with a history of previous MI or with heart failure. The survival advantage appeared to be maintained in the longer term (5.4 [SD 2.8] fewer deaths per 1000 at 12 months). Captopril was associated with an increase of 52 (SD 2) patients per 1000 in hypotension considered severe enough to require termination of study treatment, of 5 (SD 2) per 1000 in reported cardiogenic shock, and of 5 (SD 1) per 1000 in some degree of renal dysfunction. It produced no excess of deaths on days 0-1, even among patients with low blood pressure at entry. Mononitrate There was no significant reduction in 5-week mortality, either overall (2129 [7.34%] mononitrate-allocated deaths vs 2190 [7.54%] placebo) or in any subgroup examined (including those receiving short-term non-study intravenous or oral nitrates at entry). Further follow-up did not indicate any later survival advantage. The only significant side-effect of the mononitrate regimen studied was an increase of 15 (SD 2) per 1000 in hypotension.

Patients received concomitant diuretic therapy but not digitalis. Primary end points were mean change in maximal treadmill exercise time and occurrence of prospectively defined clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure (most to least severe): death, withdrawal for worsening heart failure, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, need for supplemental diuretic or emergency room visit for worsening heart failure, and no event. At study end point, treadmill exercise time had improved in the fosinopril versus the placebo group (+28.4 vs -13.5 seconds, p = 0.047). New York Heart Association functional class had improved at end point more frequently (24% vs 13%) and deteriorated less frequently (18% vs 32%) in the fosinopril group (p = 0.003).

At 10 months of age, all substrates and products and flux through the CK reaction were measured in isolated perfused hearts by 31P magnetization transfer and chemical assay. Compared with normal hamsters, the myopathic hamsters exhibited significantly lower body weights and higher biventricular heart weights, which were partially reversed by drug treatment. The Langendorff-perfused hearts showed decreased isovolumic contractile performance with identical load conditions. This was partially reversed by drug treatment. In the failing hearts, the following substrate and product concentrations and enzyme activities were decreased compared with nonfailing hearts but were unchanged by drug treatment: ATP (-28%), phosphocreatine (-48%), free creatine (-64%), ADP (-51%), and CK (-34%, primarily MM isoenzyme). Flux through the CK reaction for the untreated cardiomyopathic hamster hearts was decreased by 67%, and this decrease was almost completely reversed by enalapril treatment. The increased CK flux is due to an increase in the rate constant for the reaction, since substrate concentrations are unchanged, and is not predicted by the rate equation. In enalapril-treated failing hearts, phosphoryl transfer via the CK reaction increased with contractile performance. This was not observed in the nonfailing hearts, in which energy reserve is adequate to support changes in contractile performance.",

Enalapril treatment results in increased phosphoryl transfer through the CK reaction in failing myocardium, and this increase is coupled to improved cardiac performance. Decreased CK flux in failing hearts is due to a combination of decreased Vmax and lower guanidino pool; this mechanism fails to explain changes in CK flux in enalapril-treated failing hearts.",

After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive either trandolapril 0.5 mg or enalapril 2.5 mg once daily. At 2-week intervals, trandolapril was titrated to 1, 2, or 4 mg and enalapril to 5, 10, or 20 mg in order to achieve a goal supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) of <90 mm Hg. In addition to casual BP measurement, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at the end of the placebo period (baseline) and after 10 weeks of stable therapy at optimal and/or maximal dosage. Both drugs induced significant and comparable decreases in clinic systolic and diastolic BPs. The mean doses used were 3.2 mg for trandolapril and 16.6 mg of enalapril. The maximal effect was obtained at the highest dosage for both drugs in most patients with a mean decrease in supine diastolic BP of 8.6 mm Hg and 7.3 mm Hg for trandolapril 4 mg and enalapril 20 mg, respectively. Moreover, both agents significantly and similarly reduced mean 24-h as well as awake and sleep ambulatory BPs. Heart rates remained unchanged throughout the study. Our results demonstrate that both trandolapril and enalapril given at high dose exhibited significant decreases in clinic as well as in 24-h, awake, and sleep ambulatory BPs with no clear-up difference between the two treatment regimens. Moreover, our results emphasize the role of ambulatory BP monitoring when assessing the efficacy as well as the duration of action of new antihypertensive agents.",

An effort is made throughout the review to relate the changes that occur in this model to clinically relevant observations. For example, the progression to heart failure in these rats is similar to what happens when a patient sustains a large myocardial infarction, survives, but goes on to develop heart failure without another ischemic insult. In both rats and people with large infarctions, the noninfarcted myocardium, even though not damaged at the time of the infarct, cannot compensate sufficiently to prevent the eventual development of heart failure. In addition to being a good approximation of human disease, the responses to pharmacologic interventions, like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, in rats has proved useful in predicting what will happen in humans given the same treatment. More recent data on the molecular control of ventricular remodeling emphasizes how this model will provide important information in the study of integrated physiology by examining biochemical, pharmacologic, and physiologic changes in the same tissue.",

Fifty-three patients from the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study with severe chronic heart failure were evaluated with M-mode echocardiography and determination of plasma concentrations of ANP(99-126). In 35 patients, the plasma level of N-terminal ANP(1-98) was also measured. A significant negative relation was found between ANP(1-98), ANP(99-126), and left atrial diameter (r = -.28, P = .05 and r = -.41, P < .005, respectively). Plasma concentrations of both ANP(1-98) and ANP(99-126) were related to left ventricular systolic function as determined by the systolic time interval index (r = .4, P < .05 and r = .29, P < .05, respectively). A significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function was found in the enalapril group but not in the placebo group. After 6 weeks of therapy, no correlation was found between changes in left atrial size or systolic function or changes in either the ANP(1-98) or ANP(99-126) concentration. The results indicate that high ANP(1-98) or ANP(99-126) plasma concentration is determined by the depressed left ventricular function rather than increased left atrial size in patients with chronic severe heart failure. The findings suggest that the ANP release relation to atrial pressure/atrial size is distorted in severe heart failure.",

This study was designed to test whether the ACEI captopril increases skin microvascular blood flow by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. Local changes in microvascular blood flow were measured in the skin of rabbits and of human volunteers using a laser Doppler flow probe. Captopril injected intradermally increased skin blood flow over the dose range of 10(-12)-10(-8) mol site in rabbits and humans. In both species the response was abolished by coinjecting either a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Intradermal bradykinin also increased rabbit skin microvascular blood flow; at 10(-11) mol site it increased mean +/- SE basal blood flow by 88 +/- 12%. The responses to bradykinin or captopril were abolished by coinjecting a bradykinin antagonist, a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, or inhibitors of NOS or cyclooxygenase. Injecting a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist at a dose that antagonized the constrictor effects of exogenous angiotensin II did not cause a significant increase in rabbit skin blood flow. This suggests that endogenous angiotensin II does not influence microvascular blood flow in this model. The results indicate that captopril increases skin microvascular blood flow in rabbits and humans secondary to an increase in endogenous tissue bradykinin; this stimulates B2 receptors with subsequent release of prostaglandins and nitric oxide. ACEIs may increase microvascular perfusion by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism.",

The bradykinin antagonist Hoe 140 (3 x 10(-7) M) prevented the relaxation of ciliary arteries to bradykinin (P < 0.001), but not to acetylcholine. In perfused eyes, Hoe 140 reduced the vasodilation to bradykinin (P < 0.01). Ang II (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) evoked a contraction of ciliary arteries and was more potent than Ang I.

Elevated levels of PAI-1 are a risk factor for recurrent myocardial infarction, and locally increased PAI-1 expression has been described in atherosclerotic human arteries. Recent studies have shown that the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduces the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction in selected patients. Since angiotensin II (Ang II) has been reported to induce PAI-1 production in cultured astrocytes, we have hypothesized that one mechanism that may contribute to the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is an effect on fibrinolytic balance. In the present study, we examined the interaction of Ang II with cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and the effects of this peptide on the production of PAI-1. 125I-Ang II was found to bind to BAECs in a saturable and specific manner, with an apparent Kd of 1.4 nM and Bmax of 74 fmol per mg of protein. Exposure of BAECs to Ang II induced dose-dependent increases in PAI-1 antigen in the media and in PAI-1 mRNA levels. Induction of PAI-1 mRNA expression by Ang II was not inhibited by pretreating BAECs with either Dup 753 or [Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II, agents that are known to compete effectively for binding to the two major angiotensin receptor subtypes. These data indicate that Ang II regulates the expression of PAI-1 in cultured endothelial cells and that this response is mediated via a pharmacologically distinct form of the angiotensin receptor.",

To investigate the mechanisms that regulate smooth muscle cell ACE expression, we studied the effects of steroids on ACE activity and mRNA in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. ACE activity was present at low levels independent of growth state. In response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (100 nmol/L for 72 hours), ACE activity (hydrolysis of [3H]benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro) increased 10.1 +/- 3.1-fold. The increase in activity occurred within 12 hours and peaked after 72 hours of treatment. The increase in ACE activity was specific for glucocorticoids and paralleled their potency (dexamethasone > hydrocortisone = prednisolone). Dexamethasone increased the steady-state level of ACE mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner (21.4 +/- 0.4-fold at 100 nmol/L for 72 hours). Dexamethasone stimulation of ACE expression appeared to be due to both increased transcription and stabilization of ACE enzyme mRNA. This was suggested by the finding that dexamethasone stimulated nuclear run-on expression of ACE mRNA by only threefold, in contrast to the 21-fold increase in steady-state mRNA. These findings establish that ACE is a dynamically regulated enzyme in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. In addition, the present findings suggest an important role for stress steroids in the vascular response to injury in vivo.",

Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, and lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The study had a single-blind crossover design: nifedipine and lisinopril were given for 8 weeks each after washout periods of 4 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure to the same extent (P < .01); cardiac output remained unchanged in both nifedipine- and lisinopril-treated groups. Lisinopril increased renal flow significantly (P < .01), but nifedipine did not. Common carotid, vertebral, celiac, and superior mesenteric arterial and diaphragmatic and terminal aortic flows did not show a significant change with either nifedipine or lisinopril. The specific action of lisinopril on the thoracic aorta was a marked improvement of aortic compliance compared with nifedipine, which might be partly responsible for an increase in renal flow.

In this study, we set out to develop a sensitive radioimmunoassay for ACE to compare results obtained with this method with results of ACE activity and calculated ACE specific activity in patients suffering from a variety of lung diseases.

    "528": "Thirty-one hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy were treated with ACEI (16 with enalapril; 15 with lisinopril) for 1 year. Serial changes were recorded in LV mass index, LV systolic function, and plasma concentrations of BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).", 
    "529": "ACEI therapy significantly reduced LV mass index at 6 months, and more so at 1 year. Septal and posterior wall thicknesses were also reduced. Plasma BNP and ANP were markedly elevated at study entry, but only BNP levels correlated with LV mass index. Both peptide levels declined after 6 months, and this decline was enhanced at 1 year. There was a close relation between BNP decline and LV mass index reduction overall and with enalapril and lisinopril separately. Changes in ANP and in LV mass index were not related.",

The nephropathy was isolated without signs of disseminated thrombotic microangiopathy or progressive systemic sclerosis. Similarities with sclerodermatous kidney and an increase in plasma renin activity led us to initiate treatment with aspirin and captopril, with excellent control of the renal syndrome. We believe this therapeutic regimen may be an effective means of treating the renal microangiopathy of APS.", 
    "532": "Cost-effectiveness analyses were reviewed in the following diagnostic and treatment categories: acute myocardial infarction (MI) and diagnostic strategies for coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), congestive heart failure (CHF), and arrhythmias. In the case of acute MI, coronary care units, as presently used, are rather expensive but could be made much more efficient with more effective triage and resource utilization; reperfusion via thrombolysis is cost-effective, as are beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors post-MI in appropriate patients. Cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests depends strongly on the prevalence of disease in the population studied. Cost-effectiveness of CABG surgery depends on targeting; eg, it is highly effective for such conditions as left-main and three-vessel disease but not for lesser disease. PTCA appears to be cost-effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, eg, severe ischemia and one-vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; coronary stents also appear to be cost-effective. In preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition for CHF dominates, ie, saves both money and lives. Cardiac transplant appears to be cost-effective but requires further study. For arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are cost-effective, especially the transvenous device, in life-threatening situations; radiofrequency ablation is also cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome apart from asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers have not been analyzed except in the case of biofascicular block, where results were variable depending on the situation and preceding tests.", 
    "533": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) facilitates adrenergic neurotransmission in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to depress circulating catecholamine concentrations in some studies. We investigated the effect of local intra-arterial infusion of Ang II into the brachial artery of healthy volunteers during blockade of postsynaptic alpha-receptors with phentolamine. The response was compared with that seen with Ang II infused during nitroprusside administration at a dose designed to give a dilator response similar to that with phentolamine.",

Forearm blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. The percentage reduction in forearm blood flow produced by Ang II 100 pmol/min in the phentolamine-predilated vascular bed was significantly lower than that seen in the sodium nitroprusside-predilated forearm bed (28.1 +/- 2.9% versus 52.9 +/- 4.2%; P = .006). Comparison of the rate of change of blood flow in response to quadrupling doses of Ang II during blockade of alpha-receptors with phentolamine and during nitroprusside administration was calculated from the mean slope of the regression line of log-transformed blood flow versus dose of Ang II. The mean slope during nitroprusside administration (-0.16 +/- 0.025) was significantly greater than that during blockade with phentolamine (-0.098 +/- 0.020) (P = .046).",

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate fibrogenic activity in patients with essential hypertension by measuring serum PIIIP and PIP. Furthermore, since hypertensive heart disease is characterized by myocardial accumulation of collagen type III and type I, a second aim of the study was to assess whether some relation exists between the serum concentrations of PIIIP and PIP and several parameters of left ventricular anatomy and function in hypertensive patients.", 
    "537": "The study was performed in 50 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in 30 normotensive control subjects. Measurements were repeated in 43 hypertensive patients after 6 months of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. The serum concentrations of PIIIP and PIP were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Two-dimensional, targeted M-mode and Doppler ultrasound recordings were obtained in every subject to determine several parameters of the left ventricle anatomy and function. Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed in each patient, and the recorded ventricular arrhythmias were categorized according to Lown-Wolf classification. Baseline serum PIIIP and PIP were increased (P < .001) in hypertensive patients as compared with normotensive subjects. An inverse correlation was found between serum PIIIP and the ratio between maximal early transmitral flow velocity and maximal late transmitral flow velocity measured during diastole (r = .3786, P < .01) in the group of hypertensive patients. Serum PIP was correlated directly with the left ventricular mass index (r = .3277, P < .05) in the group of hypertensive patients. Serum PIP concentrations increased in parallel with the increase in the grade of ventricular arrhythmias in the group of hypertensive patients. Treated patients attained normalization in blood pressure, amelioration of diastolic filling, regression of left ventricular mass index, and a diminution in the number of daily ventricular extrasystoles. In addition, serum PIIIP and PIP concentrations decreased significantly (P < .001) to normal values in patients treated with lisinopril.", 
    "538": "These findings suggest that tissue synthesis of collagen type III and type I is abnormally increased in essential hypertension and can be normalized by treatment with lisinopril. On the other hand, our results suggest that serum PIIIP and PIP are related to several anatomic and functional alterations of the hypertensive left ventricle. Serum procollagen peptide measurements may therefore provide indirect diagnostic information on the myocardial fibrosis associated with arterial hypertension.", 
    "539": "This study was designed to evaluate effects of enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on hemodynamic and hormonal responses during surgery at endotracheal intubation, incision, and limb-tourniquet inflation. Thirty patients undergoing limb procedures with general anesthesia (N2O/narcotic technique) and a pneumatic tourniquet were randomized to receive either preoperative enalaprilat (1.25 mg intravenously [i.v.] 20 min prior to induction) or intraoperative enalaprilat (0.625 mg i.v. at the onset of tourniquet-associated hypertension), with appropriate placebo controls. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly in response to intubation in the placebo group. Although there were no significant differences in catecholamine levels, plasma renin activity was significantly increased at postincision in the preoperative-enalaprilat group versus the placebo group. This suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system may play a key role in mediation of intraoperative hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. With respect to tourniquet hypertension, preoperative or intraoperative treatment with enalaprilat reduced neither the pressor response to tourniquet inflation nor the amount of enflurane subsequently required to control arterial blood pressure. These findings suggest that this response is mediated by pain pathways, and may be treated more effectively with anesthesia/analgesia.",

In a randomized, prospective study, the response to intravenous (i.v.) administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat (0.06 mg/kg) on important controllers of the circulation was investigated in 14 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass grafting with a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) > 85 mm Hg after induction of anesthesia. Fourteen patients received saline solution as placebo (control group). Endothelin (ET), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), catecholamine (epinephrine, norepinephrine) plasma levels, and ACE activity were measured from arterial blood sampled before injection of enalaprilat or NaCl solution (baseline values), 10 min and 30 min thereafter, immediately before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), immediately after CPB, and at the end of surgery. MAP, heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were also monitored. ACE activity was similar at baseline in both groups; after i.v. injection of enalaprilat, it significantly decreased (from 35.1 +/- 11 to 4.4 +/- 1.0 U.min-1.L-1 30 min after injection) and remained reduced until the end of the operation (295 +/- 31 min after injection). ANP plasma levels were increased beyond normal (> 100 pg/mL) at baseline in both groups. They increased significantly in the control patients, but remained almost unchanged in the enalaprilat-treated patients within the entire study period.

Hypothermic, nonpulsatile CPB and either opioid or ketamine-benzodiazepine anesthesia were common features of the operations. At least two vasoconstrictor infusions (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine) were required for low perfusion pressure despite adequate cardiac output after CPB in 7.7% of 519 ACE-inhibited patients and 4.0% of 3782 patients not receiving ACE inhibitors (P = 0.0001). In the first 4 h after arrival in the intensive care unit, the need for vasoconstrictor infusions to treat hypotension with adequate cardiac output did not differ, although more ACE-inhibited patients (6.4%) exhibited low values of systemic vascular resistance (< 600 dyne.s.cm-5) than patients not receiving ACE inhibitors (2.8%; P = 0.0002). Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative ACE inhibitor use, congestive heart failure, poor left ventricular function, duration of CPB, reoperative surgery, age, and opioid anesthesia as independent risk factors for requiring > or = 2 vasoconstrictor infusions after CPB. No other preoperative drug therapy significantly altered this outcome.",

    "552": "Cardiac anaphylaxis, an acute ischemic dysfunction comprising coronary vasoconstriction and arrhythmias, is a model of clinically recognized immediate hypersensitivity reactions affecting the heart. Bradykinin, a mediator of hypersensitivity, is also a potent coronary vasodilator, acting via nitric oxide and prostacyclin production. Because ischemia increases bradykinin outflow from the heart, we questioned whether bradykinin might mitigate anaphylactic coronary vasoconstriction. Antigen challenge of hearts isolated from presensitized guinea pigs was associated with an approximately 30% increase in bradykinin overflow. Furthermore, (1) when the half-life of bradykinin was prolonged with the kininase II/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat, anaphylactic coronary vasoconstriction was attenuated and reversed, and arrhythmias were alleviated; (2) the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist HOE 140 prevented these effects; and (3) HOE 140 exacerbated both anaphylactic coronary vasoconstriction and arrhythmias. During cardiac anaphylaxis, the coronary overflow of cGMP, a marker of nitric oxide production, and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, a stable prostacyclin metabolite, increased two-fold and fourfold, respectively. Because neither enalaprilat nor HOE 140 affected these changes, the enhanced overflow of cGMP and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha is likely to reflect the actions of other hypersensitivity mediators (eg, histamine and leukotrienes). We postulate that bradykinin plays a protective role in cardiac anaphylaxis by accumulating at the luminal surface of the coronary endothelium and promoting, in an autocrine mode, a B2-receptor-mediated production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin in concentrations sufficient to elicit a paracrine effect on coronary vascular smooth muscle, thus opposing the vasoconstricting effects of other anaphylactic mediators.", 
    "553": "The gynecologist is competent to perform an initial evaluation and workup on the patient with hypertension. The use of effective medications, such as the thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should control most patients. Patients with mild hypertension who have abnormal laboratory values or multiple other systemic diseases, or do not respond to therapy should be referred to an internist. Patients who present with markedly elevated systolic or diastolic pressure (e.g., a systolic reading higher than 160 mm Hg and a diastolic higher than 110 mm Hg) also should be referred to an internist for further evaluation.",

A glaring exception is the rubric \"calcium channel blocker,\" under which strikingly dissimilar drugs have been lumped. Although the phenylalkylamines (verapamil and gallapamil) and benzothiazepines (diltiazem and TA3090) bind at different receptors on the alpha 1 component of the calcium channel, they are reasonably similar in their clinical pharmacology. For example, both types of drugs slow the heart rate and there are intravenous preparations that are used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. The dihydropyridines (nifedipine and many others) bind to another receptor on the alpha 1 component, but have markedly different pharmacologic properties. For example, they tend to increase the heart rate, do not cause constipation, but are more likely to cause peripheral edema. I propose that we refer to this entire class of drugs as \"calcium antagonists,\" that we continue to refer to verapamil, diltiazem, and similar drugs as \"calcium channel blockers,\" but recognize the very different properties of nifedipine and like drugs by referring to them as dihydropyridines or DHPs.", 
    "555": "The effect of 20 mg of enalapril with and without 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide on glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity and lipids was evaluated in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Ten mild to moderate hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were treated for 8 weeks with 20 mg enalapril once a day, and then divided into two groups of 5 patients each for a second 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg once a day. Blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, lipids and insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin sensitivity were measured at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks. Results were analyzed by the ANOVA test for repeated measures and all values are given as mean +/- SD. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after the first and second period of enalapril and after the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Glycosylated hemoglobin dropped significantly after the first and second period of enalapril monotherapy. Plasma triglycerides and fasting plasma insulin decreased significantly after the 16 weeks of enalapril. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake increased significantly after 8 and 16 weeks of monotherapy with enalapril. No significant difference was observed in any of the metabolic characteristics, including insulin sensitivity, between the values after 8 weeks of enalapril alone and the final values of the enalapril-treated and the enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide-treated groups.

Before starting treatment, at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year, patients were subjected to gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies, from which resistance-size arteries were dissected to be studied. The media width to lumen diameter ratio of arteries from patients in the cilazapril group was 7.5 +/- 0.3% before starting treatment, and decreased significantly (P < .05) to 6.3 +/- 0.2% at the end of the first year, and to 5.8 +/- 0.2% at the end of the second year, at which time it was not different from that of arteries from normotensive subjects (5.2 +/- 0.2%).

Thus, treatment for 2 years with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril resulted in progressive normalization of the structure (media-to-lumen ratio) of gluteal subcutaneous fat resistance arteries of essential hypertensive patients, whereas there was no change in patients treated with the beta-blocker atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "558": "As part of the ECTIM Study, the medical treatment given to male patients (25-64 years) 3 to 9 months after myocardial infarction (MI) were analysed in France and Northern Ireland. On univariate analysis, hypolipidaemic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antiarrhythmic drugs were found to be prescribed more frequently in France, while beta-blockers were more common in Northern Ireland. No differences were found for diuretics, calcium channel blockers, antithrombotic and anti-anginal drugs, although the Northern Irish patients were mainly on antiplatelet drugs and nitrates, while the French patients received nitrates and non-nitrates, as well as oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs in similar amounts. These differences remained after adjustment for personal history of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and previous myocardial infarction, but the beta-blocker prescription was no longer significant. When the French centres were analysed, patients from Strasbourg were more frequently on oral anticoagulants and diuretics and less frequently on antiplatelet drugs, while patients from Toulouse had fewer anti-anginal drugs. Hence, although the current guidelines for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction are generally well applied in France and Northern Ireland, significant differences exist regarding the choice of the active drug.", 
    "559": "From pharmacological investigations and clinical studies, it is known that ACE inhibitors exhibit additional local actions that are not related to hemodynamic changes and that cannot be explained only by interference with the renin-angiotensin system by means of an inhibition of ANG II formation. Because ACE is identical to kininase II, which inactivates the nonapeptide BK and related kinins, potentiation of kinins might be responsible for these additional effects of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibition, concentration, and time dependently increased the formation of NO and PGI2 in cultured endothelial cells of different origin and from different species, including humans. The specific B2 kinin receptor antagonist, icatibant, suppressed the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in endothelial cyclic GMP accumulation index for NO-formation and, in parallel, attenuated the increase in PGI2 release. In renovascular models of hypertension associated with a stimulated renin-angiotensin system (two-kidney, one-clip), blood pressure reduction by ACE inhibitors was attenuated by icatibant, whereas in rats with genetic hypertension with normal to low plasma renin, blood pressure reduction through ACE inhibitors was not affected. In experimental atherosclerosis in rabbits, ACE inhibitors were able to preserve endothelial function and vascular reactivity and to reduce surface involvement. In the balloon denudation model of carotid arteries in rats, it was found that ACE inhibition markedly reduced neointima formation. However, when the ACE inhibitor was given together with icatibant, its effect was significantly blunted. Perfusion with ACE inhibitors induced a reduction of the incidence, as well as of the duration, of ventricular fibrillation and improved cardiodynamics and myocardial metabolism. BK perfusion induced comparable cardioprotective effects. In addition, perfusion with ACE inhibitors markedly increased the outflow of BK and related kinins from isolated rat hearts. The antiischemic effect of ACE inhibitors and BK were abolished by the addition of L-NNA (1 x 10(-6) mol/l) or icatibant (1 x 10(-9) mol/l). Similar results were found in dogs and rabbits with myocardial infarction. BK and related kinins also seem to be involved in preconditioning and remodeling. The effect of ACE inhibition in LVH was investigated in rats made hypertensive by aortic banding. ACE inhibition with ramipril, in the antihypertensive dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, prevented the increase in blood pressure and the development of LVH. A lower, nonantihypertensive dose of the ACE inhibitor (10 micrograms/kg/day for 6 weeks) had no effect on the increase in blood pressure or on plasma ACE activity, but also prevented LVH after aortic banding.4+ off", 
    "560": "In this multicentre, double-blind trial in 461 patients with essential hypertension, amlodipine (5-10 mg once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg once daily) were compared in terms of quality of life, efficacy and tolerability after 1 year of treatment (part 1). In part 2, 177 patients successfully treated with amlodipine in part 1 continued in an open evaluation of efficacy and safety of antihypertensive treatment with amlodipine for a further 2 years. In part 1, both drugs were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) (although significantly more enalapril patients required a diuretic) while maintaining quality of life. Apart from class-typical effects, such as oedema for calcium antagonists and cough for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, both drugs were equally well tolerated, with few adverse effects of clinical significance. Only a few patients (eight amlodipine (4%), nine enalapril (4%)) were withdrawn from the trial because of drug-related adverse events, demonstrating that the tolerability was good. Neutral to slightly beneficial effects were found in blood lipid concentrations after treatment with amlodipine. The BP reduction seen in the amlodipine patients after part 1 was maintained during part 2. Also, blood lipids and safety variables remained virtually constant. It is concluded that, at similar BP reduction, quality of life is equally well maintained on amlodipine and enalapril therapy. Thus, amlodipine compares favourably with enalapril as an effective and well-tolerated anti-hypertensive agent over the first year. Additionally, amlodipine patients evaluated over a 2-year extension maintained good BP control and the drug was well tolerated.",

In five of six nephrectomised salt-loaded SHR, increases in BP, urinary excretion of protein and serum creatinine were attenuated by the administration of 2 mg/kg/day of amlodipine. The progression of renal histological damage was also markedly decreased. The protective effects of amlodipine against renal damage were similar to those of enalapril.

The role of proton-linked solute transport in the absorption of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalapril maleate and lisinopril has been investigated in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cell monolayers. 2. In Caco-2 cell monolayers the transepithelial apical-to-basal transport and intracellular accumulation (across the apical membrane) of the hydrolysis-resistant dipeptide, glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar), were stimulated by acidification (pH 6.0) of the apical environment. In contrast, transport and intracellular accumulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, were low (lower than the paracellular marker mannitol) and were not stimulated by apical acidification. Furthermore, [14C]-lisinopril transport showed little reduction when excess unlabelled lisinopril (20 mM) was added. 3. pH-dependent [14C]-Gly-Sar transport was inhibited by the orally-active ACE inhibitors, enalapril maleate and captopril (both at 20 mM). Lisinopril (20 mM) had a relatively small inhibitory effect on [14C]-Gly-Sar transport. pH-dependent [3H]-proline transport was not inhibited by captopril, enalapril maleate or lisinopril. 4. Experiments with BCECF[2',7',-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein]-loaded Caco-2 cells demonstrate that dipeptide transport across the apical membrane is associated with proton flow into the cell. The dipeptide, carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) and the ACE inhibitors enalapril maleate and captopril, all lowered intracellular pH when perfused at the apical surface of Caco-2 cell monolayers. However, lisinopril was without effect. 5. The effects of enalapril maleate and captopril on [14C]-Gly-Sar transport and pHi suggest that these two ACE inhibitors share the H(+)-coupled mechanism involved in dipeptide transport. The absence of pH-dependent [14C]-lisinopril transport, the relatively small inhibitory effect on [14C]-Gly-Sar transport,and the absence of lisinopril-induced pHi changes, all suggest that lisinopril is a poor substrate for thedi/tripeptide carrier in Caco-2 cells. These observations are consistent with the greater oral availability and time-dependent absorption profile of enalapril maleate and captopril, compared to lisinopril.", 
    "564": "Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) induces bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to bradykinin but not to acetylcholine. We examined whether this was mediated through the inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity and/or through the enhancement of airway microvascular leakage (AML) by IL-1 beta. We administered human recombinant IL-1 beta (500 U) or saline intratracheally and 24 h later measured the airway responses to bradykinin (1 mM; 45 breaths). IL-1 beta-treated rats showed a decrease of 18.5 and 21.1% of NEP activity in the lungs and tracheobronchial tree, respectively (P < 0.05), associated with an augmented response in total lung resistance to bradykinin but with no increase in Evans blue dye extravasation used as a marker of AML. Phosphoramidon (0.1 and 1 mM; 90 breaths), an NEP inhibitor, induced a dose-dependent increase in lung resistance to bradykinin without further enhancing BHR induced by IL-1 beta. Bradykinin-induced AML was not enhanced by phosphoramidon in either saline- or IL-1 beta-treated rats. Similarly, after captopril (1 mM; 90 breaths), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, there was no further enhancement of BHR to bradykinin induced by IL-1 beta. BHR to bradykinin induced by IL-1 beta may result from an inhibition of peptidase activity, such as NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and is not associated with an enhancement of AML.", 
    "565": "We developed a procedure for measuring pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme kinetics with fluorine-18 fluorocaptopril and positron emission tomography (PET). The method is based on the application of a compartmental receptor model that represents the kinetics of two species of ligand, presumably the trans and cis conformers of captopril. The input function was characterized and includes corrections for the labeled metabolites of fluorocaptopril. Application of the procedure to lung time-activity data obtained with PET produced estimates of kinetic parameters demonstrating fast kinetics for one conformer and slower kinetics for the other. Simulation studies were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated parameters to errors in the model assumptions and in measured values for variables required for analysis of the PET data. Estimates for two of the kinetic parameters, the amount of perfused unbound functional enzyme normalized to regional lung volume and the association rate constant for the trans conformer, were relatively stable even with large errors in the input data, varying < 30% from true values for all perturbations. Thus, the procedure produces reliable estimates of the kinetics of the trans conformer of captopril as well as theoretical curves that are close to the observed data.", 
    "566": "Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolysed in vivo to release the active metabolite, ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life, permitting once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been confirmed in large-scale noncomparative studies conducted in general practice as well as in more rigorously controlled clinical trials. In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy is lower in patients with severe hypertension (around 40%), although the blood pressure lowering effect can be enhanced with the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus and preliminary data indicate that the drug has the beneficial effect of decreasing urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of this effect per se remains to be established. The large-scale Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study demonstrated that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, even if transient. The beneficial effect of ramipril was apparent by 30 days of treatment and appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe ventricular damage after infarction. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or fewer patients discontinuing therapy because of drug intolerance. The data available suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to that of other established ACE inhibitors. Thus, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the treatment of patients with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",

Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen over the aorta and kidneys, and time-activity curves generated. The ratio of integrated aortic counts to renal counts, from the time of injection to arterial peak, was calculated. The difference in the value of this index between captopril and basal scintigraphies was -17 +/- 12 and -16 +/- 13 for the right and left kidneys, respectively, in the group of patients with essential hypertension, whereas in the patients with renovascular hypertension, these values were 24 in the stenotic and 14 in the non-stenotic kidney.

Full sigmoid barocurves were produced in 62 rabbits by i.v. injection of phenylephrine (PE 1-15 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (NTG 1-20 micrograms/kg) after pretreatment with saline or with AII, enalapril, or losartan. In group II, AII had a biphasic effect on baroreflex sensitivity; at 10 and 50 ng/kg/min, it increased the gain from 3.47 +/- 0.21 to 4.75 +/- 0.44 and 5.13 +/- 0.28 beats/min/mm Hg (p < 0.05 and p < 0.025, respectively), but had no effect at 100 ng/kg/min.

BP was measured indirectly from the finger by a noninvasive device (Finapres). The stress test was a computerized version of the Stroop color word conflict test (CWT). The influences of acute (single dose) beta 1-selective blockade by bisoprolol or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by lisinopril were analyzed by a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. During the placebo phase, the efficiency of the stress test was confirmed by a significant increase in SBP (25 +/- 11%), HR (36 +/- 23%), and plasma concentrations of epinephrine (Epi, 54 +/- 37%) and norepinephrine (NE, 27 +/- 35%). Stress induced a significant increase in the amplitude of SBP and HR oscillations in the medium-frequency band (MF, 70- to 140-mHz range), which corresponds to the Mayer waves (27 +/- 32 and 42 +/- 43%, respectively for SBP-MF and HR-MF). The stress-induced increase in NE correlated significantly with the increase in HR (r = 0.68, p < 0.05). The stress-induced increase in SBP-MF correlated significantly with the increase in Epi (r = 0.69, p < 0.05) and in HR-MF (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). A significant decrease in SBP-MF at rest was observed with a single oral (p.o.) dose of bisoprolol, but not of lisinopril. As a noninvasive method, spectral analysis of the variability in SBP and HR may be of benefit in stress-induced modifications of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "571": "The cardioprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion damage is assumed to result largely from inhibition of the enzymatic breakdown of endogenous bradykinin (BK). We assessed the role of nitric oxide (NO) in mediating the beneficial actions of BK and the possible mechanism of the effect of NO. We experimentally infringed myocardial function in a working guinea pig heart preparation by ischemia (15 min) and reperfusion. The parameter external heart work (EHW), determined before and after ischemia, served as criterion for quantitation of recovery. We assessed oxidative stress during reperfusion by measuring glutathione release in coronary venous effluent; lactate release was used as a measure of ischemic challenge. The principal ability of NO to scavenge oxygen radicals was separately investigated in a chemiluminescence (CL) assay with the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and lucigenin. The ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (RT 25 microM) improved postischemic function significantly (55% recovery of EHW vs. 29% for controls). BK 1 nM was even more cardioprotective (71% recovery). The NO-synthase inhibitor Ng-nitro-L-arginine (NOLAG 10 microM) inhibited the effects of RT and BK (18% recovery each). SNP (0.3 microM) improved recovery to 57%, the prostacyclin analogue iloprost (ILO, 0.1 and 3 nM) had no beneficial effect (21 and 20% recovery, respectively). With 8-bromo-cyclicGMP, a membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, function was not better than control (30% recovery).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to act beneficially on circulation by various mechanisms. The influence of continuous i.v. administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat on regulators of circulation was studied in 45 critically ill patients. According to a prospective randomized sequence, either 0.25 mg/h (group 1, n = 15) or 0.5 mg/h (group 2, n = 15) of enalaprilat or saline solution as placebo (control group, n = 15) were continuously given. Infusion was started on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and continued for the next 5 days. From arterial blood samples, plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), renin, vasopressin, angiotensin-II, and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) were measured. All measurements were carried out before infusion (= baseline values) and during the next 5 days. In both enalaprilat groups, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased similarly; heart rate (HR) and central venous pressure (CVP) did not change, and were without differences in comparison to the untreated control. Except for ET, plasma levels of all vasoactive substances exceeded normal range at baseline. Angiotensin-II plasma concentrations significantly decreased during enalaprilat infusion (0.25 mg/h: from 53.1 +/- 11.3 to 22.1 +/- 9.3 pg/ml; 0.50 mg/h: 62.1 +/- 14.4 to 17.9 +/- 7.9 pg/ml), but they remained significantly elevated in the untreated control patients.

From age 1 to 6 months, 22 CSH randomly received either perindopril 1 mg/kg/day in distilled water (PE, n = 11) or distilled water only (PL, n = 11), and seven control golden Syrian hamsters (C) received distilled water by force-feeding. Compared to C, PL had a lower Vmax (p < 0.01), a lower amount of alpha-MHC (p < 0.01), and an unchanged twitch duration. In PE, as compared to PL, there was a higher Vmax (p < 0.05), a higher alpha-MHC (p < 0.05), and an unchanged twitch duration. There was a positive relationship between Vmax and alpha-MHC in the population taken as a whole (p < 0.01), and when muscles from C and PL groups were plotted together (p < 0.001), but neither within each group, nor when PL and PE were plotted together. Our study indicates that in CSH (a) the preserved contractility with ACE-inhibitor treatment is associated with limitation of isomyosin shift induced by the myopathic process, but no cause-to-effect relationship could be demonstrated on the basis of our data, and (b) adaptive changes in twitch duration were not observed either in untreated CSH or in perindopril-treated CSH, despite significant changes in alpha-MHC content.",

The parameter estimates used in the t statistics were assumed to be normally distributed with a common variance, which was a known multiple of an unknown sigma(2), and known correlations which were equal. In the present article, we show how the procedure can be extended to include unequally correlated parameter estimates.

There was a significant correlation between both initial and mean plasma total cholesterol values, and the decline in renal function and the rise in albuminuria in the placebo treated patients. This correlation persisted after stratification for blood pressure. Treatment with enalapril did not eliminate these correlations. Cholesterol may be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. ACE inhibitors may have a modest cholesterol lowering effect in diabetic patients mediated, in part, through the decline in albuminuria.", 
    "580": "Plasma norepinephrine levels, which reflect sympathetic nervous system activity, are almost universally elevated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. This elevation occurs in patients with overt, symptomatic heart failure (HF) and in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Evidence suggests that the elevation in plasma norepinephrine levels can be at least partly attributed to an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. It has become evident that elevated plasma norepinephrine levels are directly related to prognosis; patients with levels > 900 pg/ml have a poor prognosis and shortened life expectancy. However, plasma norepinephrine levels bear little relationship to physiologic and clinical variables observed in HF, including ejection fraction and exercise capacity. Data from the V-HeFT II show that at 2-year follow-up, a progressive rise of plasma norepinephrine was observed in both treatment arms, suggesting that disease progresses despite treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, or vasodilator therapy with hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.

Ibopamine stimulates the DA1 and DA2 dopaminergic receptors, the beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, and the alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors. Ibopamine has varying degrees of affinity for these various families, being the highest for the dopamine receptors and the lowest for the alpha adrenergic receptors. In the clinical setting, there is a dose-related hemodynamic and neurohormonal response. In patients with heart failure (HF), low doses appear to exert beneficial neurohormonal, hemodynamic, and renal effects, without increased inotropic effects. However, at higher doses (> 200 mg) ibopamine exerts effects that do not appear to be clinically useful in long-term treatment of chronic HF. Several small trials have suggested a benefit of ibopamine on exercise performance in patients with mild to moderate HF. On the basis of these studies, ibopamine is now being used in Europe to treat patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). At doses of 100 or 200 mg/t.i.d., there has been no evidence of significant safety problems. Ibopamine may have a role in the treatment of patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction who remain symptomatic despite therapy with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

The results showed that in large 2nd-order arterioles, endothelial impairment did not affect the vasoconstrictor activity of AII and NE, nor did it alter ACE activity. However, in small 4th-order arterioles, endothelial impairment significantly reduced angiotensin conversion without altering the vasoconstrictor responses to either AII or NE. Thus, the endothelium plays differential roles in the modulation of local angiotensin conversion in these distinct segments of serial-arranged arterioles. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the vasoconstrictor response to AII in these arterioles is modulated by the endothelium through a pathway involving the release of EDRF or PGs.",

The proteinuria was in the nephrotic range, which is unusual in renovascular hypertension, but gradually disappeared after correction of the high renin state by removal of the renin-secreting kidney or administration of an ACE inhibitor. Accordingly, when there is marked proteinuria in the presence of new-onset or rapidly progressive hypertension, hypokalaemic alkalosis, and a high peripheral PRA, renal artery stenosis should be considered since the proteinuria may be reversible after nephrectomy, repair of the ischaemic kidney or medical therapy.",

Converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate the breakdown of bradykinin and therefore enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis mediated by bradykinin. Evidence was found of such a prostaglandin E2 mediated contribution to ventricular unloading by enalapril, which was blocked by salicylate. The contribution, however, was small and variable, and salicylate addition had on average no significant de-unloading effect during the day. Unloading was abolished in only three of the 20 patients in the short term study and in one of the 12 in the extended study. At night, when other effects of enalapril on blood pressure had waned and the bradykinin induced effect persisted, salicylate significantly reduced the remaining small unloading effect. No effect was seen of salicylate addition on reversal of remodelling. Enalapril reduced angiotensin II induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2 and thromboxane A2, initially only during the day, but later also at night. It thereby masked suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis by salicylate, which is the effect to which reinfarct prevention by salicylate is attributed.", 
    "597": "The risk is low that salicylate will substantially reduce the benefit of enalapril in patients with heart failure by de-unloading the ventricle. Like other effects induced by bradykinin significant de-unloading occurs in only a minority of the patients. In the presence of enalapril, however, salicylate will probably not be as effective as expected in reducing reinfarction risk, because enalapril already reduces thromboxane A2 synthesis effectively in patients with heart failure and no further reduction by salicylate was found.",

    "599": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the feeding of low protein diets to rats during pregnancy induces hypertension in their offspring. Maternal-diet-induced hypertension has been previously associated with elevated pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. In the present study, the importance of the renin angiotensin system, and in particular ACE, in the maintenance of the hypertensive state, is investigated. Pulmonary and plasma ACE activity were determined in rats of different ages, following in utero exposure to 18 (control) or 9% (deficient) casein diets. No maternal diet induced changes in pulmonary ACE were noted, but at 4 and 13 weeks of age, plasma ACE activity was increased by 34 and 134%, respectively in 9% casein exposed rats relative to controls (P < 0.001). Thirteen-week-old rats had significantly raised systolic blood pressure (28 mmHg, P < 0.05), and tended to have higher diastolic blood pressure (not significant). These hypertensive animals had slightly raised plasma angiotensin II concentrations (30% higher, not significant), but similar renin activities, when compared with normotensive controls. Treatment of normotensive and hypertensive rats with the ACE inhibitor captopril demonstrated that higher plasma ACE activity may play a major role in the maintenance of maternal-diet-induced hypertension. Whilst normotensive rats showed no significant response to drug treatment, systolic blood pressure in the hypertensive rats fell rapidly to the level observed in the normotensive control group. Blood pressure remained at this lower level until treatment was withdrawn, at which time pressure began to increase slowly, but steadily. A period of 7-8 weeks was required following cessation of captopril administration for the restoration of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "600": "Renin inhibition represents an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition for pharmacologic interruption of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of kinin and result in accumulation of powerful renal vasodilator prostaglandins and bradykinin. We were therefore surprised by the large renal vasodilator response achieved with the renin inhibitor enalkiren, because substrate-specific renin inhibitors reduce the formation of angiotensin II without affecting other vasodilator mechanisms. To determine whether previous findings were reflective of the renin inhibitor class, we studied 12 healthy men on a sodium-restricted diet, each of whom received two or three escalating oral doses of zankiren, a new agent. Plasma renin activity decreased with the smallest dose (5 mg), and this effect was sustained. The increase in renal plasma flow was clearly related to dose (r = 0.86, F = 9.67), reaching a maximum of 134 +/- 26 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 250 mg, the highest dose. Renin inhibition exerts a remarkable renal vasodilator action, perhaps reflecting the lipophilicity of the agents developed to date, an action that may have clinical implications for the prevention of renal injury in patients at risk.", 
    "601": "The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) is based on the finding of the combination of elevated urinary and/or plasma aldosterone and suppressed renin activity in patients with hypertension and hypokalemia. However, PA consists in a number of subsets, and diagnostic criteria for a correct identification of surgically remediable forms are of great interest. The methods and the results concerning our series of 113 patients with primary aldosteronism are presented in this review. Aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) were the most frequent forms, 51% and 44% respectively. They had similar BP levels, but hypokalemia was most frequently found in APA. Urinary and upright plasma aldosterone were similar, but supine plasma aldosterone was lower in IHA. Plasma aldosterone response to upright posture and angiotensin II infusion was absent in most cases of APA and present in IHA, but occasionally renin-responsive adenoma were found. Captopril failed to decrease plasma aldosterone in most patients with APA, and in a subgroup of patients with IHA. Patients with adenoma had also higher values of the aldosterone precursor 18-OH-B, and of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), probably as a consequence of a greater degree of volume expansion. Among morphological studies, CT scan and adrenal radio-cholesterol scintiscan provided similar results (85% accuracy): adrenal vein catheterization clarified almost all the remaining cases. Among the subsets of PA, 3 familiar cases of dex-suppressible hyperaldosteronism were recognized, with characteristically high levels of aldo, 18-OH-B, 18-OH-cortisol and 18-oxo-cortisol, due to the genetic abnormalities of the 11-18 hydroxylase system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "602": "1. The effects of locally applied parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP), a putative autocrine/paracrine hormone, on vascular diameters and glomerular blood flow (GBF) in the split hydronephrotic rat kidney were studied. As PTHRP interacts with parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors in all tissues tested so far, the effects of PTHRP were compared with those of PTH. 2. Preglomerular vessels dilated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner that was almost identical for PTH and PTHRP. A significant preglomerular vasodilation (5-17%) occurred at a threshold concentration of 10(-10) mol l-1 PTH or PTHRP, which raised GBF by 20 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 4%, respectively (means +/- S.E.M., n = 6). PTH or PTHRP (10(-7) mol l-1) increased preglomerular diameters (11-36%) and GBF (60 +/- 10 and 70 +/- 8%, respectively) to near maximum. The most prominent dilatation was located at the interlobular artery and at the proximal afferent arteriole. 3. Efferent arterioles were not affected by either PTH or PTHRP. 4. Estimated concentrations of half-maximal response (EC50) for preglomerular vasodilatation and GBF increase were in the nanomolar to subnanomolar range. 5. After inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme by 2 x 10(-6) mol kg-1 quinapril I.V.

We conclude that the renal vasculature of the hydronephrotic kidney is highly sensitive to vasodilatation by PTH and PTHRP, which, in addition, may constrict efferent arterioles by stimulating renin release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "603": "The lipophilicity of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) available in France has been compared using two complementary methods. Studies have been performed both on active ACE-I and prodrugs. The first study used reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to measure the n-octanol water partition coefficients. They were measured at 3 pH values (2.5, 4.7 and 7.4). The second study was performed on the basis of computer drawn chemical formula. The lipophilic area to hydrophilic area ratio was calculated from the three dimensional structure of each ACE-I. A calculated n-octanol water partition coefficient was then determined. Whatever the method, a broad range of values was seen. The HPLC n-octanol water partition coefficient ranged from -1.86 (captopril) to 1.02 (trandolaprilate). The lipophilic to hydrophilic ratio ranged from 1.33 (captopril) to 2.74 (trandolaprilate) and the computer determined n-octanol water partition coefficient ranged from -0.36 (perindoprilate) to 0.69 (quinaprilate). A strong correlation (r = 0.97 p = 0.0001) was found between the lipophilic/hydrophilic area ratio and the HPLC partition coefficient. The classification of the ACE-I was very close whatever the mode of determination. The less lipophilic ACE-I are lisinopril and captopril and the most lipophilic are quinalapril and trandolapril. Clinical consequences of such differences remain unknown.", 
    "604": "1. We investigated the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the cardiovascular effects of N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP), a peptidase inhibitor selective for metalloendopeptidase (EP) E.C. 3.4.24.15. 2. In conscious rabbits, cFP (5 mg kg-1, i.v.) markedly slowed the degradation of [3H]-bradykinin, potentiated the depressor response to right atrial administration of bradykinin (10-1000 ng kg-1), and inhibited the pressor response to right atrial angiotensin I (10-100 ng kg-1). In each of these respects, the effects of cFP were indistinguishable from those of the ACE inhibitor, captopril (0.5 mg plus 10 mg kg-1h-1 i.v.). Furthermore, the effects of combined administration of cFP and captopril were indistinguishable from those of captopril alone. 3. In experimentally naive anaesthetized rats, cFP administration (9.3 mg kg-1, i.v.) was followed by a moderate but sustained fall in arterial pressure of 13 mmHg. However, in rats pretreated with bradykinin (50 micrograms kg-1) a more pronounced fall of 30 mmHg was observed. Captopril (5 mg kg-1) had similar hypotensive effects to those of cFP, and cFP had no effect when it was administered after captopril. 4. CFP displaced the binding of [125I]-351A (the p-hydroxybenzamidine derivative of lisinopril) from preparations of rat plasma ACE and solubilized lung membrane ACE (KD = 1.2 and 0.14 microM respectively), and inhibited rat plasma ACE activity (KI = 2.4 microM). Addition of phosphoramidon (10 microM), an inhibitor of a range of metalloendopeptidases, including neutral endopeptidase (E.C.3.4.24.11), markedly reduced the potency of cFP in these systems. 5. Taken together these findings suggest that the actions of cFP in vivo are attributable to inhibition of ACE rather than EP 24.15. Given that cFP is a poor inhibitor of ACE in the presence of phosphoramidon in vitro, it is likely that cFP is cleaved by a phosphoramidon-sensitive metallopeptidase in vivo to liberate N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala, a potent ACE inhibitor.", 
    "605": "Orthostatic hypotension occurs in 10 to 30% of the elderly. In several studies it has been linked to recurrent falls and syncope. Generally, it has multiple causes, of which autonomic dysfunction plays an important role in elderly people. Very often orthostatic hypotension is induced by the use of drugs. In other cases, it is already present subclinically, and is worsened by the use of drugs to become symptomatic. For most drugs, changing pharmacokinetics result in a delayed elimination and/or in a greater bioavailability in the elderly. This results in a more pronounced effect for drugs with a desired hypotensive action [e.g. diuretics, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors]. For those drugs in which hypotension is a known but unwanted adverse effect (e.g. nitrates, anti-Parkinsonian drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotics), responses will be greater in the elderly and orthostatic hypotension will occur more frequently. For elderly people, doses have to be reduced and/or the dose intervals prolonged in order to avoid such adverse reactions.",

In nine hypertensive patients with enalapril-induced cough the effect of altering the dose of enalapril on subjective cough and the cough response to inhaled capsaicin was examined in a random single-blind balanced cross-over study.

The cough response to inhaled capsaicin was also measured in two control groups: hypertensive patients on long-term enalapril treatment with no cough (n = 18), and hypertensive patients taking nifedipine (n = 17). 3. In patients with enalapril-induced cough there were significant dose-responses for enalapril as regards severity of cough (P < 0.05) and night time waking by cough (P < 0.05), but not for frequency of cough. Although the cough was less severe (P < 0.02) and caused less night time waking (P < 0.03) on the lowest dose of enalapril (mean 5 mg daily) it did not disappear completely in any patient. 4. The sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin did not differ significantly on the three doses of enalapril. The relative potency of capsaicin on enalapril 20 mg compared with enalapril 5 mg was 1.0 (95% CI 0.4-2.2).

Bronchospasm and cough occurred at a higher rate in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, no links with sex, past history of bronchospasm, drug type or dose were found. 2. Cohorts of 1013 patients on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 1017 patients on lipid lowering drugs (LLDs) were compared for the occurrence of new bronchospasm, relapse of previous bronchospasm, increase of current bronchospasm, and cough. 3. The prevalence of bronchospasm was 5.5% for patients on ACE inhibitors and 2.3% for patients on LLDs, P < 0.001. The relative risk of a bronchospasm adverse reaction for a patient on an ACE inhibitor compared with a patient on a LLD was 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.47 to 3.90. 4. No ACE inhibitor specificity, or significant sex differences were found in the prevalence of bronchospasm or cough after correcting for bias implicit in the original cohorts. The bronchospastic reactions were not dose dependent. 5. The prevalence of a past history of bronchospasm in patients reporting ACE inhibitor-induced bronchospasm (16%) was not significantly different from the prevalence in patients on ACE inhibitors without an adverse reaction (13%), P = 0.447. 6.

    "609": "There is a wide variety of diuretic-induced metabolic abnormalities of unequal severity. Renal failure can be caused by excessive sodium loss, or by certain drug combinations comprising, for instance, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or an ACE inhibitor. Hyponatraemia is uncommon. It is encountered with thiazides, especially among women. A sodium level less than 120 mmol/L may result in neurological complications. Hypokalaemia is frequent and might increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Hyperkalaemia induced by potassium-sparing diuretics is often combined with another contributive cause. Glucidic, lipidic and uric acid abnormalities are common, but their clinical effects are slight. They do not seem to worsen cardiovascular risks among elderly patients. Nevertheless, prescribing diuretics for elderly patients requires special precautions. Reducing the diuretic dose, as is now recommended for treating hypertension, seems to lessen adverse effects, and despite all the adverse reactions just mentioned, it has been proven that diuretics are beneficial in many diseases.", 
    "610": "The nocturnal increases in blood pressure in cases of obstructive sleep apnea are discussed as causes in connection with increased cardiovascular mortality in sleep apnea. Previous antihypertension therapy studies revealed the antihypertensive action of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril averaged over NREM (NR) and REM sleep (R). In the present study, the effect of this drug on the blood pressure increase within the stress segment of obstructive apnea in NR and R was investigated in a double-blind randomized study versus placebo. Data were collected in digital form with the help of cardiorespiratory polysomnography and intra-arterial blood pressure measurements; a total of 640 apnea in 16 patients were evaluated. Relevant increases in blood pressure occurred during the apnea which were, as expected, more pronounced in R (150/74 mmHg) than in NR (135/69 mmHg). The antihypertensive action of cilazapril was also stronger in R (systole--11.9/diastole--6.4 mmHg) than in NR (systolic--9.0 mmHg/diastolic--5.7 mmHg). Placebo caused significantly lower decreases in blood pressure (systolic--3.7 mmHg/diastolic--2.4 mmHg in R, systolic--2.8 mmHg/diastolic--1.8 mmHg in NR). Thus, evidence is provided for a clinically relevant blood pressure lowering effect of the drug cilazapril on the stress-induced blood pressure increases accompanying obstructive apnea both in NREM and in REM sleep.",

During a 3- to 4-week pretreatment stabilization period, group 1 received a mean of 37.7 mg of HCTZ daily and group 2 received 34.9 mg daily. After 6 weeks and 12 months of treatment, improvement was noted in both treatment groups on five measures of cardiac function: exercise tolerance, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), ejection fraction, blood pressure, and heart rate.

    "614": "Diltiazem hydrochloride is a benzothiazepine derivative calcium-channel blocker with proven antianginal and antihypertensive capabilities. Its primary mechanism of action is vasodilatation, which results in diminished vascular resistance and improved perfusion to various vascular beds and target organs. The antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem in various demographic groups has been studied and compared with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other calcium-channel blockers. These studies have shown that the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is similar to that of the other therapies. Diltiazem does not adversely affect electrolytes or carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, and it may have beneficial effects on the heart and kidneys. Diltiazem reduces myocardial hypertrophy and exerts antianginal effects on the heart through coronary vasodilation and reduction in the blood pressure double product. Diltiazem improves renal perfusion and attenuates proteinuria. These effects may be helpful in limiting the progression of renal injury. Overall, the efficacy and tolerability of diltiazem, as well as its salutary effects on the heart and kidneys, make it an important therapeutic consideration for patients with hypertensive disease.",

Mechanistic treatment end-points of hypertension (normalization of endovascular pressure) may not correct nonhypertensive components of the pathobiology of hypertension. Estrogen replacement therapy, antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and manipulations of nitric oxide metabolism may have beneficial effects on vessels in the absence of blood pressure normalization. Estrogens and L-arginine, the precursor of nitric oxide, can partly correct impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, a pathophysiologic hallmark of hypertensive states. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors preserve endothelium-dependent vasodilation and protect arteries against the atherogenic effects of hypercholesterolemia by a non-hypolipidemic, non-hypotensive mechanism.", 
    "616": "In North America and Western Europe, diabetic nephropathy is the commonest cause of renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Glomerular filtration rate normally declines with increasing age. The decline in glomerular filtration rate observed in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy can be limited by adequate control of blood pressure with conventional therapy. In hypertensive diabetic patients with nephropathy or microalbuminuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have specific renoprotective effects in addition to their hypotensive activity. Normotensive patients with microalbuminuria also benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, probably because this group of patients are relatively hypertensive when measured using 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Good glycaemic control will reduce the incidence of microalbuminuria, but its role in progression of microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy is controversial. These issues are discussed in the context of optimal care for patients with diabetic renal disease.",

In both groups, tissue ACE activity was dependent on chloride anion concentration in the assay buffer. Substituting citrate for chloride abrogated, in part, this response. We conclude that cardiomyopathy is associated with significant changes in cardiac and lung ACE activity in aging hamsters in comparison to age/genetically-matched controls. However, regulation of tissue ACE activity in vitro is similar in both groups.", 
    "620": "The effects of TCV-116, a new non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on systemic and renal hemodynamics were studied in conscious normotensive and renal hypertensive (2-kidney, 1-clip Gold-blatt type) dogs. When orally administered at 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg, TCV-116 inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin II in conscious normotensive dogs in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 and IC100 values were 0.06 mg/kg and 0.86 mg/kg, respectively. TCV-116 at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg dose-dependently and persistently decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both dogs with acute renal (hyperreninemic) and those with chronic renal (normoreninemic) hypertension. Even a high dose of TCV-116 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) increased effective renal plasma flow without affecting blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate in normotensive dogs. Furthermore, even at this high dose, TCV-116 did not reduce effective renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate in dogs with renal hypertension despite marked reduction in systemic blood pressure. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg, p.o.) had renal hemodynamic effects similar to those of TCV-116. These findings indicate that TCV-116 has potent hypotensive effects not only in dogs with acute renal hypertension but also in those with chronic renal hypertension, but does not appear to adversely affect renal hemodynamics.", 
    "621": "The renin-aldosterone axis was evaluated by captopril test in 22 normotensive normoalbuminuric insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients with and without glomerular hyperfiltration. Patients were divided into those with glomerular hyperfiltration (Hf-IDDM) and with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR; Nf-IDDM) according to the upper limit of GFR (134.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Sixteen normal individuals were also studied. GFR was measured by the 51Cr-EDTA single injection method, extracellular fluid volume as the distribution volume of 51Cr-EDTA, and blood volume using 51Cr-sodium chromate-labelled red blood cells. Twenty-five mg of captopril were administered per os and plasma renin activity (PRA; RIA), plasma aldosterone (RIA) and blood pressure were measured at 0 and 120 min post-captopril. PRA at time zero (Hf-IDDM = 2.4 +/- 1.7; Nf-IDDM = 2.5 +/- 1.9; controls = 1.0 +/- 0.6 ng/ml/h) and at 120 min (Hf-IDDM = 9.9 +/- 8.3; Nf-IDDM = 11.2 +/- 8.9; controls = 5.4 +/- 5.7 ng/ml/h) was higher in IDDM patients than in controls (P = 0.01). The increase of PRA was similar in patients (Hf-IDDM = 7.5 +/- 7.3, and Nf-IDDM = 8.7 +/- 7.2 ng/ml/h) and controls (4.4 +/- 5.3 ng/ml/h). There was no difference in PRA levels between Hf-IDDM and Nf-IDDM patients. PRA did not correlate with GFR, aldosterone, blood pressure, blood volume, duration of diabetes, 24-h urinary sodium and metabolic control indexes. Plasma aldosterone and the magnitude of its decrease after captopril was similar among patients and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "627": "The articles found in a bibliographic search through the data bases MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica and Indice M\u00e9dico Espa\u00f1ol, all in CD-ROM, for the period 1982-1991. The notifications found of cases relating to cough produced by ACE inhibitors were evaluated through a minimum information data questionnaire.", 
    "628": "A minimum information questionnaire was used. 119 cases of patients were found in 53 articles. The average of authors and references per article was 2.88 and 8.54, respectively. The most frequent type of article was the letter, with Enalapril being the drug responsible for the cough in the majority of cases. All the articles studied included data from at least 6 of the minimum information items, the most common being: age, gender, dosage, reason for prescription, remission of the adverse reaction on stopping the medication and information on previous publications. Primary Care authors contributed more information in their articles than those authors who did not come from Primary Care. There is a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005) in the information items which refer to information on the presence of other illnesses and to the study of other pathological processes.", 
    "629": "The Primary Care authors published less cases of cough caused by ACE inhibitors, although their quality is similar to those from other sources. The information contributed which can be considered minimum was superior to that reviewed in previous studies.", 
    "630": "A case is reported describing severe pre-eclampsia, treated firstly with antihypertensive drugs and Caesarean section. Contrary to expectation blood pressure did not fall and proteinuria still remained. Blood pressure reducing drugs had no effect at all. The patient was then treated with Renitec (enalapril), an ACE-inhibitor, with good result--even when given in a small dosis. No influence on lactation was documented for five weeks. Teratogenicy has been reported using ACE-inhibitors, and only a little is known about their effect on lactation. We found Renitec to have a good effect on reducing blood pressure postpartum and no effect on lactation at all.", 
    "631": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which contains two similar domains, each possessing a functional active site. Respective involvement of each active site in the degradation of the circulating peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, was studied by using wild-type recombinant ACE and two full-length mutants containing a single functional site. Both the N- and C-active sites of ACE exhibit dipeptidyl activity toward AcSDKP, with Km values of 31 and 39 microM, respectively. However, the N-active site hydrolyzes the peptide 50 times faster compared with the C-active site, with kcat/Km values of 0.5 and 0.01 microM-1.s-1, respectively. The predominant role of the N-active site in AcSDKP hydrolysis was confirmed by the inhibition of hydrolysis using a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the N-active site. The N-domain specificity for AcSDKP will aid the identification of specific inhibitors for this domain. This is the first report of a highly specific substrate for the N-active site of ACE, with kinetic constants in the range of physiological substrates, suggesting that ACE might be involved via its N-terminal active site in the in vivo regulation of the local concentration of this hemoregulatory peptide.",

Pre-pravastatin values returned three weeks after stopping therapy. Levels of total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions and triglycerides remained constant or deteriorated in the placebo group. Pravastatin therapy was well tolerated. An integrated coronary risk score showed a 40% reduction in risk.",

Medication was started between 2 hours and 18 hours from the onset of infarction. The two groups were matched for age, infarct location, and time of intervention. With exception of one patient in either group, all were concurrently given nitroglycerin. The necrosis parameters were provided by the quantitative measurement of the QRS complex.", 
    "639": "The Q wave decreased with captopril treatment (-0.003 mV), but increased with placebo (+0.14 mV) (p < 0.05). The number of ventricular premature beats at 24 hours from the start of treatment was 25/h with placebo, and 9/h with captopril (p < 0.02). Ventricular fibrillation occurred 7 times in the placebo group, but did not occur in the captopril group. The creatine kinase (CK) infarct weight was 59 gram-equivalents (gEq) with placebo, and 45 gEq with captopril (p = NS). The mean arterial pressure was reduced by 12 mmHg with captopril treatment.",

    "641": "This study investigated the effects of captopril, hydralazine and losartan on the locomotor activity, tailflick and hot plate latencies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their genetic controls the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). The increased hot plate latencies normally exhibited by the spontaneously hypertensive rat were reduced or abolished by captopril (95 mg/kg/day p.o.) and losartan (18 mg/kg/day p.o.) treatment, but were unaffected by hydralazine (19 mg/kg/day p.o.). There were no observable effects of any of the drugs on tailflick latencies or locomotor activity. The results highlight a potential role for angiotensin II in analgesia that is independent of blood pressure change.", 
    "642": "Human and porcine big ET-1 and big ET-2 are similarly potent in contracting parenchymal strips of the guinea-pig lung while big ET-3 is inactive, suggesting that the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) which converts big ET-3 is not present and that at least two distinct ECE activities exist, one selective for big ET-1 and big ET-2 and one for big ET-3. Metalloendoprotease inhibitors (phosphoramidon and DL-thiorphan), but not captopril, inhibited the contractions elicited by human big ET-1 and big ET-2 but DL-thiorphan was less active, suggesting that a non-selective enzymatic process is involved in conversion of big ET-1 and big ET-2 in addition to a phosphoramidon-sensitive ECE. Big ET-1 and big ET-2 induced much higher contractions than their corresponding mature peptides. Both metalloendoprotease inhibitors, but not captopril, similarly potentiated contractions induced by ET-1, ET-2 or ET-3 to the level of those evoked by big ET-1 and big ET-2, indicating that only mature ET isopeptides and not their precursors are susceptible to degradation by metalloendoproteases."
