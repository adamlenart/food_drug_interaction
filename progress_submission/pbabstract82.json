Enalaprilat pharmacokinetics were characterised after both doses of enalapril to investigate the effect of saturating ACE binding sites by pretreatment with captopril. 3. The pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat were best described by a one compartment model with zero order input incorporating saturable binding to plasma and tissue ACE. 4. Values of AUC (0.72 h) for enalaprilat were 419 +/- 97 and 450 +/- 87 ng ml-1 h in the presence and absence of captopril, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant nor were there any other differences in model parameters. 5. Induction of ACE by captopril resulting in an increase in the number of ACE binding sites, may have obscured any effect of captopril on the occupancy of ACE binding sites by enalapril.", 
    "1": "The present studies examine the effect of the nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) type 1 receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on water intake in rats treated with dipsogenic stimuli, which are thought to induce drinking via release of renin and subsequent formation of AII. Subcutaneous administration of DuP 753 in doses that are known to inhibit drinking induced by AII failed to inhibit the water intake of rats following subcutaneous administration of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. The peptide antagonist1 Sar, 8Ileu-AII, which blocks both AII type 1 and AII type 2 receptors, also failed to inhibit isoproterenol-induced drinking, suggesting that neither subtype is involved in this drinking response. Additional studies verified previous reports that acute subcutaneous administration of both the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril could block the drinking response to subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol. Subcutaneous administration of DuP 753 also failed to inhibit the drinking responses to subcutaneous administration of serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, hypertonic saline, and polyethylene glycol. However, central intraventricular administration of DuP 753 inhibited the drinking response to subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of AII in mediating isoproterenol-, serotonin-, and 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced water intake and suggest a need to readdress this mechanism.", 
    "2": "Most converting enzyme inhibitors share a predominantly renal dual elimination pathway consisting of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Since enalaprilat has two functional acidic groups, it is likely that it may be secreted via the proximal tubule organic acid system and, thus, its clearances would exceed that of glomerular filtration rate markers. We therefore examined the renal clearance of enalaprilat in normal volunteers and compared it with simultaneously measured inulin and creatinine clearances to explore the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal elimination of the drug. Twelve healthy male subjects with an age range of 24 to 58 years (mean +/- SE, 33.1 +/- 2.8) were studied. They had representative height (178.6 +/- 1.99 cm) and weight (73.3 +/- 2.1 kg) and had normal renal function as judged by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L [17 +/- 0.8 mg/dL]), plasma creatinine (88 +/- 3 mumol/L [1.0 +/- 0.03 mg/dL]), and creatinine clearance determined by a prestudy 24-hour urine collection (123.2 +/- 6.2 mL/min). Results are as follows: mean creatinine clearance, 2.12 mL/s (127 mL/min); mean inulin clearance, 119.1 ml/min mean creatinine clearance/inulin clearance, 1.07 mean enalaprilat protein binding, 37.9% unbound enalaprilat clearance, 222.4 ml/min; and the mean fractional enalaprilat clearances were: enalaprilat clearance/creatinine clearance, 1.72 (P less than 0.05, difference from 1.0); enalaprilat clearance/inulin clearance, 1.85, (P less than 0.05, difference from 1.0). Our results demonstrate that the clearance of free enalaprilat exceeds that of inulin and creatinine, suggesting that elimination of the drug proceeds through two complementary pathways, namely glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.", 
    "3": "The heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) is a circulating biologically active product of the renin-angiotensin system. In this study, we evaluated the role of the vascular endothelium in the formation of angiotensin-(1-7). Metabolism of 125I-angiotensin I was investigated using confluent cultured bovine and human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells. The fetal calf serum-supplemented medium was replaced by serum-free medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. One hour later, this medium was replaced by serum-free medium containing 125I-angiotensin I. After incubation of 125I-angiotensin I for various intervals at 37 degrees C, the medium was collected and analyzed for formed products by high-performance liquid chromatography. Products of angiotensin I metabolism were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of radiolabeled standards. The contribution of proteases released into the medium was evaluated by incubation of 125I-angiotensin I with medium previously incubated for 1 hour with endothelial cells. Incubation of 125I-angiotensin I with bovine and human endothelial cells produced a time-dependent generation of 125I-angiotensin-(1-7) greater than 125I-angiotensin II greater than 125I-angiotensin-(1-4). Generation of angiotensin peptides was not due to the presence of proteases in the medium. When human umbilical endothelial cells were incubated in the presence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (1 microM), generation of angiotensin II was undetectable. In contrast, angiotensin-(1-7) production increased by an average of 30%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "We examined the angiotensin-induced potentiation of noradrenergic transmission in the isolated mesenteric arteries of one-kidney, one clip (1K1C) hypertensive rats. The angiotensin converting enzyme activity measured in plasma did not change during the development of hypertension, whereas the activity measured in the aortic tissue was significantly augmented 28 days after the renal artery was clipped. Although the pressor responses to nerve stimulation were basically unaltered, a significant increase in the sensitivity to norepinephrine developed during hypertension. The 1K1C preparations presented an increased sensitivity to the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II on the response to periarterial nerve stimulation. The facilitatory effect of angiotensin II on both nerve stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine was blocked by saralasin. Angiotensin I induced similar facilitatory action on noradrenergic transmission that was inhibited by saralasin. When a high concentration of angiotensin I was used, the facilitatory effect was significantly higher in mesenteric arteries from 1K1C rats than in controls. Captopril reduced the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I in 1K1C preparations, whereas the responses of the normotensive control rats were unaffected by captopril. These findings are consistent with angiotensin I acting directly on angiotensin II receptors or with angiotensin I being converted to angiotensin II by an alternative pathway not involving angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "5": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is present on endothelial cells and plays a role in regulating blood pressure in vivo by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II and metabolizing bradykinin. Since ACE activity is decreased in vivo in sepsis, the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to suppress endothelial cell ACE activity was tested by culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) for 0-72 hr with or without LPS and then measuring ACE activity. ACE activity in intact HUVEC monolayers incubated with LPS (10 micrograms/ml) decreased markedly with time and was inhibited by 33%, 71%, and 76% after 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr, respectively, when compared with control, untreated cells. The inhibitory effect of LPS was partially reversible upon removal of the LPS and further incubation in the absence of LPS. The LPS-induced decrease in ACE activity was dependent on the concentrations of LPS (IC50 = 15 ng/ml at 24 hr) and was detectable at LPS concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. That LPS decreased the Vmax of ACE in the absence of cytotoxicity and without a change in Km suggests that LPS decreased the amount of ACE present on the HUVEC cell membrane. While some LPS serotypes (Escherichia coli 0111:B4 and 055:B5, S. minnesota) were more potent inhibitors of ACE activity than others (E. coli 026:B6 and S. marcescens), all LPS serotypes tested were inhibitory. These finding suggest that LPS decreases endothelial ACE activity in septic patients; in turn, this decrease in ACE activity may decrease angiotensin II production and bradykinin catabolism and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of septic shock.", 
    "6": "Tetrodotoxin has been reported to cause prolonged systemic hypotension without resultant ischemic damage. We tested its ability to protect the kidney during 60 minutes of warm ischemia in uninephrectomized rats. Protection was observed when tetrodotoxin was given intravenously at two microgram./kg. and four microgram./kg. as assessed by serial plasma blood urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements over two weeks. Tetrodotoxin was protective when given immediately before or immediately after the ischemic period. The renal protection of tetrodotoxin was not due to its effects on renal nerves as renal denervation did not protect the kidney from the ischemic damage. The renal protective effects of four microgram. tetrodotoxin/kg. were similar to those of four mg. captopril/kg. but the combination of the two was paradoxically without effect. We tested whether tetrodotoxin and captopril chemically antagonized each other, but in the presence of tetrodotoxin, captopril was still a potent inhibitor of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. These results indicate that tetrodotoxin could be useful in elucidating the sequence of events associated with ischemic-reperfusion renal injury and in identifying ways of preserving renal function during renal surgery.", 
    "7": "The antinociceptive effects produced by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of dermorphin and [D-Arg2]dermorphin were compared in conscious mice, using the combined administration of peptidase inhibitors. Nociception was assessed using a tail pressure assay. Dermorphin-induced antinociception was not potentiated by simultaneous administration of amastatin or captopril as judged from the ED50 values. Co-administration of dermorphin and amastatin gave a longer duration than with dermorphin alone, whereas there was no significant effect on duration with captopril. The antinociceptive activity of dermorphin was significantly enhanced when the heptapeptide was injected simultaneously with both peptidase inhibitors. This result indicates that the heptapeptide sequence is required for the full expression of intrinsic opioid activity of dermorphin. In contrast, co-administration of amastatin brought about a significant enhancement of the antinociceptive activity induced by i.c.v. administration of [D-Arg2]dermorphin, whereas the effect of [D-Arg2]dermorphin was markedly decreased by the concurrent administration of captopril or thiorphan. The potency of captopril was much greater than that of thiorphan. The present results suggest that [D-Arg2]dermorphin may be transformed metabolically to a peptide which has potent antinociceptive activity.", 
    "8": "Effective therapy is available but the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension is often elusive. Those affected constitute a minority of the hypertensive population, and traditional screening tests have poor sensitivity and specificity. The merits and limitations of the captopril challenge test and the captopril renogram, alone or in combination, are discussed.", 
    "9": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to inhibit neointimal proliferation in response to endothelial injury in the rat carotid artery. Since ACE inhibitors block degradation of kinins, our objective in this study was to determine whether kinins mediate the antiproliferative effect of the ACE inhibitor ramipril. Endothelial denudation was achieved in the left carotid artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats using a balloon catheter. The rats were divided into four groups: a) vehicle (saline); b) DuP 753 10 mg/kg/day; c) ramipril 5 mg/kg/day; and d) ramipril 5 mg/kg/day plus Hoe 140 70 micrograms/kg/day. Ramipril markedly reduced neointimal proliferation compared to control (vehicle) (p less than 0.05) and DuP 753-treated groups (p less than 0.05). When ramipril was given together with Hoe 140 its effect was significantly blunted (p less than 0.05). These results show that kinins are important mediators in the antiproliferative effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "10": "A novel metallo-endopeptidase from human neuroblastoma NB-OK-1 cells was partially purified and characterized. This enzyme activity was detected in the culture medium and could be detached from intact cells by gentle washing, suggesting a peripheral localization of the enzyme. This endopeptidase inactivated Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) by a unique and selective cleavage of the Ser123-Phe124 bond. It also produced hydrolysis at the Xaa-Phe, Xaa-Leu, or Xaa-Ile bonds of other peptide hormones such as bradykinin, somatostatin 14, litorin, substance P, neuromedin C and angiotensin II. The substrate selectivity and inhibition profile of the enzyme showed obvious similarities with the peptide hormone inactivating endopeptidase (PHIE) recently purified from Xenopus laevis skin secretions and indicated a thermolysin-like activity distinct from neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and from angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1).", 
    "11": "We conclude from our studies and data from the literature that ACE inhibitors belong to the proper basic therapy of cardiac failure because of their marked influence on progression and death by pump failure.

    "12": "Hydrolysis of [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin was determined in samples of pooled whole mouse plasma in vitro by using HPLC-ECD to measure accumulation of Tyr-containing metabolites. More Tyr-Gly-Gly accumulated from [Met]enkephalin than from [Leu]enkephalin hydrolysis, and [Met]enkephalin's half-life in mouse plasma was approximately half that of [Leu]enkephalin. Comparisons of metabolite formation in the presence versus the absence of inhibitors with high selectivity for various peptidases demonstrated that a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, presumably aminopeptidase M, as well as enkephalinase and angiotensin converting enzyme, participate in the hydrolysis of enkephalin in mouse plasma.", 
    "13": "Eleven studies (10 randomised controlled trials and 1 large open study) that evaluated quality of life (QOL) are reviewed. The areas of QOL measured by the studies are compared and a consensus is reported that health-related QOL measures in patients with hypertension should include: symptomatic and psychological well-being, activity (work, leisure, sleep, sexual activity and social participation), cognitive function and life satisfaction. Recommended methods for measuring these aspects of QOL are noted. Seven studies included atenolol as 1 of the treatments and the effects of this drug on QOL are reviewed. The drug appears to maintain QOL as well as the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalapril and cilazapril. One trial also suggests that verapamil maintains QOL as well as atenolol, although this was not suggested by the nonrandomised study. Nifedipine slow release (SR) and propranolol both fared worse than atenolol in 2 separate trials, but 1 trial suggested that nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) was preferred to atenolol in terms of QOL. In the latter study, however, only patients completing the prescribed therapy revealed a preference for nifedipine GITS; this was absent in an intention-to-treat analysis. The rate of discontinuation of nifedipine therapy was high, underlining the necessity for an intention-to-treat analysis in trials assessing QOL.",

    "15": "In the present study we investigated the effects of central (i.c.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of a 2 micrograms dose of lisinopryl, an inhibitor of angiotensin I(ANGI)-converting enzyme (CE), on water intake. I.c.v. but not s.c. injection of lisinopryl abolished drinking in response to s.c. isoprenaline (100 micrograms/kg) and significantly reduced drinking in response to 24 h water deprivation or s.c. polyethylene glycol (30% w/v, 10 ml/kg). Lisinopryl had no effect on water intake induced by cellular dehydration (s.c. injection of hypertonic saline (2 M NaCl)). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that lisinopryl acts as a CE blocking agent in the brain. The thrist challenge induced by hypotension using isoprenaline acts primarily by generating ANGII systemically and centrally. The other thirst challenges such as cellular dehydration are independent of the ANGII in the brain. This conclusion was made possible by utilizing a new CE blocking agent at a smaller dose than normally used for other ANG I-CE inhibitors.", 
    "16": "Sudden death is a frequent complication of heart failure occurring in 35 to 45 per cent of the cases. This multifactorial event may be of haemodynamic origin (acute heart failure, electro-mechanical dissociation) or, more often, of rhythmic origin (torsade de pointe, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, asystole). Numerous structural, haemodynamic, metabolic, ionic, neurohormonal and iatrogenic factors facilitate ventricular hyperexcitability. The main predictive factors of sudden death in heart failure are the presence of coronary heart disease and of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; the prognostic value of ventricular rhythm disorders is controverted. Prevention of sudden death begins with correcting those factors which facilitate disturbances in rhythm and conduction. Beta-blockers are effective in the post-infarction period, but there is no evidence that other drugs are useful. Identifying patients at high risk and determining the therapeutic approach that reduces this risk are still incompletely resolved problems.", 
    "17": "Quinapril, a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, was evaluated in ten New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) II-III CHF patients to determine its effects on regional blood flow [effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), hepatic blood flow (HBF), hepatic vascular resistance (HVR), segmental limb pressure (SLP), creatinine clearance (CRCL)] and cardiac function [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)]. Previous vasodilator therapy was withdrawn 2 weeks before baseline measurements. Stable regimens of digoxin and diuretics were continued throughout the study. ERPF was assessed using p-aminohippurate (PAH), HBF by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance, and LVEF by radionuclide scintography. Segmental limb pressures were measured by Doppler flow detection. Measurements were performed at baseline (B) and after 4 weeks of quinapril therapy (10 mg BID). Quinapril increased renal (P less than 0.05) and hepatic blood flow (P = 0.06) and significantly reduced renal and hepatic vascular resistance. Glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular ejection fraction were unchanged. Mean arterial pressure and brachial segmental pressures decreased without change in heart rate. Noninvasive cardiovascular assessments indicate that quinapril improves regional blood flow while exhibiting no change in left ventricular ejection fraction, in patients with NYHA FC II-III CHF.", 
    "18": "Pemphigus lesions appeared in a 58-year-old man who was taking captopril for his hypertension. Drug withdrawal resulted in complete remission of the eruption. The subsequent use of enalapril as an antihypertensive agent caused a recurrence of pemphigus lesions along with onset of itching and dermographism. Intercellular antibodies were not found. Discontinuance of enalapril therapy had no effect on the clinical course. Steroid treatment was needed to resolve the eruption. Recently repeated immunofluorescent studies disclosed intercellular IgG antibodies in the serum at a low titer. Pemphigus induction could be initially related to the thiol acantholytic property of captopril. Subsequent production of intercellular antibodies and drug-activation of the kinin system could be responsible for relapsing.", 
    "19": "The present study determined whether inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) can ameliorate radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary fibrosis in rats sacrificed 2 months after a range of single doses of 60Co gamma rays to the right hemithorax. Four indices of pulmonary endothelial function were monitored: right lung ACE and plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. Hydroxyproline (HP) content served as an index of pulmonary fibrosis. Rats consumed either control powdered chow or feed containing one of five modifying agents continuously after irradiation. The modifiers included three ACE inhibitors: Captopril, CL242817, and CGS13945, respectively, a thiol, a thioacetate, and a nonthiol compound. All of the ACE inhibitors are analogues of proline. Two additional modifiers were tested: penicillamine, a thiol with no ACE inhibitory activity; and pentoxifylline, a vasodilator that is neither a thiol nor an ACE inhibitor. Radiation produced a dose-dependent decrease in lung ACE and PLA activity, and an increase in PGI2 and TXA2 production and in HP content. All ACE inhibitors attenuated the radiation-induced suppression in lung ACE and PLA activity. All thiol or thioacetate compounds ameliorated the radiation-induced increase in PGI2, TXA2, and HP. The two agents that were both thiols and ACE inhibitors (Captopril and CL242817) spared all of the radiation reactions, while the compound that was neither a thiol nor an ACE inhibitor (pentoxifylline) spared none of the reactions. These data suggest a novel application for ACE inhibitors in general, and for Captopril in particular, as modifiers of radiation pneumotoxicity.", 
    "20": "We examined the autoregulation of renal blood flow (RBF) and renal function in anesthetized dogs during nitro-L-arginine (NLA)-induced blockade of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO). Intrarenal infusion of NLA (50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) increased systemic arterial pressure (AP) and renal vascular resistance (RVR). RBF decreased by 27 +/- 3%, but glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. There were reductions in urine flow (24 +/- 5%), urinary sodium excretion (42 +/- 10%), and fractional excretion of sodium (40 +/- 11%). The vasodilatory responses to intrarenal injections of ATP (1, 5, 10 microM) were reversed, whereas such responses to doses (10, 50, 100 ng) of acetylcholine (ACh) were attenuated during NLA infusion. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg iv) treatment further reduced but did not completely abolish ACh-induced vasodilation, suggesting that factor(s) other than EDNO and prostaglandins may also mediate ACh-induced vasodilation in the kidney. Although there was a suppression of the plateau of the AP-RBF relationship with a rightward shift in the slope of the linear portion of the curve during EDNO blockade, the normal autoregulatory pattern remained intact. Similar responses were seen in dogs treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, MK-422. These data indicate that EDNO contributes to the normally low renal vascular tone by influencing an autoregulation-independent component of RVR. However, the basic capability to adjust RVR (autoregulation-responsive component) in response to changes in AP is essentially autonomous from EDNO activity.", 
    "21": "Uterine renin may regulate uteroplacental blood flow locally through changes in vascular resistance or systemically by supporting arterial blood pressure. Captopril (5 mg/kg) was given i.v. to 14 conscious pregnant rabbits at day 27.5 +/- 0.3 of gestation for the purpose of investigating the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on uteroplacental blood flow and oxygen consumption. Control measurements (mean +/- S.E.M.) were compared to measurements made at 1 hr (n = 14) and at 3 to 4 hr (n = 7). Arterial blood pressure decreased from 80 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than .01, and then declined further to 56 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than .01. Cardiac output was unchanged at 1 hr, 799 +/- 79 vs. 705 +/- 61 ml/min, but was decreased to 634 +/- 29 ml/min by 3 to 4 hr, P less than .01. There was no change in renal blood flow from 102 +/- 13 ml/min. Total uterine blood flow decreased from 37 +/- 5 to 29 +/- 5 ml/min, P less than .01, and then to 23 +/- 1 ml/min, P less than .01, whereas placental blood flow decreased from 25 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 3 to 15 +/- 3 ml/min, P less than .01; there was no significant change in myoendometrial flow. Oxygen delivery per uterine horn decreased from 2.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min, P less than .005.

    "22": "The objectives of this study were to identify angiotensin I (ANGI) analogs that antagonize angiotensin II (ANGII) receptors and/or block angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in vivo, to determine whether any receptor antagonist activity was direct (i.e., mediated by the intact peptide) vs. indirect (i.e., mediated by conversion of the intact peptide to corresponding smaller peptide fragments via ACE) and to determine whether the potency of a given ANGI analog was influenced by circulation through a tissue (lungs) rich in ACE. The effects of six ANGI analogs on mesenteric vascular responses to intramesenteric artery (IMA) infusions of ANGI and ANGII were examined in nephrectomized rats in the absence and presence of captopril. ANGI analogs were infused either intravenously (i.v.) or IMA. It is concluded that: 1) the ANGI analogs did not inhibit ACE sufficiently to attenuate responses to ANGI; 2) Thr8-ANGI does not block ANGII receptors, either directly or indirectly; 3) infused IMA Ile8-ANGI is a weak direct antagonist; however, given i.v., its potency is increased 30-fold due to conversion by pulmonary ACE; 4) Phe4-Tyr8-ANGI is a moderately potent indirect antagonist infused either IMA or i.v.; 5) infused IMA Cys8-ANGI is a moderately potent direct antagonist, and given i.v., its potency is increased 20-fold due to conversion by pulmonary ACE; 6) Val8-ANGI is a highly potent antagonist infused either IMA or i.v. due to both direct and indirect actions; and 7) Leu8-ANGI is a highly potent antagonist infused either IMA or i.v., and its antagonist properties do not require ACE. Possible applications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "23": "Exogenous obesity is characterized hemodynamically by expanded intravascular (plasma) volume associated with an increased cardiopulmonary volume and cardiac output. In contrast, essential hypertension is related to an increased total peripheral resistance that is more or less uniformly distributed throughout the component organ circulations associated with a contracted plasma volume in proportion to the height of arterial pressure. Thus, both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance are elevated in obesity hypertension, and both impose a load on the left ventricle, resulting in both a volume and a pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy. Although renal vascular resistance is not as increased as it is in lean hypertensive patients, these patients are subjected to hyperfiltration and proteinuria. Additionally, these hemodynamic alterations coexist with carbohydrate intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia. With weight reduction and associated pressure reduction, the hemodynamic and metabolic changes reverse toward normal. However, should this not be achievable, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists provide rational physiological approaches to drug therapy. With these agents pressure reduction is achieved through a fall in vascular resistance without intravascular volume expansion, and this is associated with reduced left ventricular mass and preserved cardiac and renal function, and without exacerbation of preexisting metabolic perturbations. Hence, these two classes of antihypertensive agents may provide a rational and physiological means for reversing the pathophysiological alterations of hypertensive disease in those obese patients in whom weight control is not possible.", 
    "24": "All surviving patients in a double-blind study comparing the effects of enalapril and placebo on survival in severe congestive heart failure were recommended to be treated with active drug after stopping the trial. Two-year follow-up from the end of the blinded trial demonstrated that among 77 survivors of 127 patients originally allocated to the group with enalapril, 38 were still alive. Of 126 patients allocated to the group with placebo 58 survived the blinded study, and after 2-year follow-up 26 were still alive. Thus, the difference between the original treatment groups remained, despite that treatment with enalapril was made available to all surviving patients and that those in the group with enalapril were sicker at baseline than those in the group with placebo. If enalapril was prescribed, the mortality was 47% compared with 75% if it was not. Life-table analysis suggests a marked carry-over effect of treatment in the group with enalapril that lasted for up to 15 months before mortality rates became comparable in the 2 treatment groups. This strongly suggests that enalapril confers structural protection to the failing myocardium.", 
    "25": "Pimobendan, a new oral cardiotonic and vasodilator agent, increases myocardial contractile force through specific inhibition of phosphodiesterase type III and increased calcium sensitivity of the myocardial contractile elements. The effects of pimobendan on left ventricular performance and maximal exercise capacity were studied in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 52 patients with severe congestive heart failure despite diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The acute hemodynamic evaluation included three single doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg of oral pimobendan, which was subsequently administered at a daily dose of 5 or 10 mg for 4 weeks. Acute administration of pimobendan significantly increased the resting cardiac index and lowered pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in a dose-dependent manner, whereas heart rate and systemic arterial pressure were not substantially altered. Patients receiving pimobendan, 5 and 10 mg daily, had a significantly greater increase in maximal exercise duration than those receiving placebo, that is, 144 +/- 30 and 124 +/- 33 seconds versus 58 +/- 25 seconds (p = 0.05). Peak oxygen uptake increased by 1.7 +/- 0.8 and 2.2 +/- 1.3 ml/kg/min in patients receiving pimobendan at a daily dose of 5 and 10 mg, respectively, whereas it decreased by 0.1 +/- 0.6 ml/kg/min in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.06). Thus pimobendan acutely improves resting left ventricular performance and chronically increases exercise duration and peak oxygen uptake in patients with severe congestive heart failure concomitantly treated with digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

    "27": "Blood pressure responses were measured 1 hour after randomized, double-blind administration of the renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 (600 mg p.o.) or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg p.o.) in 20 healthy men on an ad libitum sodium diet. Effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by either compound was indicated by increases of immunoreactive renin associated with an increase of angiotensin I production rate of 67.8 +/- 33.6% after captopril and a decrease of 79.5 +/- 16.4% after Ro 42-5892. Furthermore, Ro 42-5892 decreased plasma renin activity by 64%. Whereas intra-arterial diastolic (60 +/- 5.1 to 51.4 +/- 7.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and mean arterial (77.7 +/- 6.0 to 71.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures decreased after captopril, they remained unchanged after Ro 42-5892. Captopril, but not Ro 42-5892, increased forearm blood flow (2.4 +/- 0.8 versus 1.9 +/- 0.8 ml/min/100 ml, p less than 0.01) and significantly enhanced the increase of forearm blood flow to brachial artery infusions of bradykinin (0.15, 1.5, 5, 15, and 50 ng/min/100 ml; 5 minutes each) from 744 +/- 632% to 1,383 +/- 514% (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, repeat bradykinin infusions resulted in further decreases of blood pressure (from mean pressure of 71.4 +/- 8.5 to 63.2 +/- 7.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) only after captopril. Changes of blood pressure after captopril were unrelated to baseline plasma renin activity but correlated with captopril-induced enhancement of vasodilation to bradykinin (r = 0.68, p less than 0.05).", 
    "28": "The lack of blood pressure effects of renin inhibition in contrast to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition suggests that the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute significantly to blood pressure control in normotensive, sodium-replete subjects. The hypotensive activity of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may result from additional hormonal effects, for example, inhibition of bradykinin degradation and/or subsequent increases of vasodilating prostaglandins or endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s).", 
    "29": "Normotensive patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus (n = 18) were given 25 mg captopril (b.i.d.) and placebo for 3 mo in a randomized double-blind crossover study. Patients had normal renal function, and none had retinopathy. Albuminuria was less than 20 micrograms/min in 12 patients and between 20 and 200 micrograms/min in the other 6. Patients were examined at the end of the placebo and captopril phases. Captopril caused little reduction in blood pressure obtained by 24-h ambulatory monitoring (systolic 126.0 +/- 2.7 to 123.9 +/- 2.4 mmHg, P less than 0.08; diastolic 74.2 +/- 1.9 to 72.1 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P less than 0.09). Captopril lowered glomerular filtration rate from 99.5 +/- 7.7 to 71.0 +/- 5.5 ml.min-1. 1.73 m-2 (P less than 0.01), whereas renal plasma flow (443.9 +/- 15.2 ml.min-1. 1.73 m-2) remained unchanged. Filtration fraction was reduced from 22.4 +/- 1.4 to 17.4 +/- 1.4% (P less than 0.01). Urinary albumin excretion was reduced from 59.1 +/- 0.15 to 27.7 +/- 13.9 micrograms/min (P less than 0.1). Reduction was related to the extent of initial albuminuria (r = 0.997, P less than 0.001), a relationship that remained significant after logarithmic transformation (r = 0.540, P less than 0.02). Dextran clearance was used to determine glomerular capillary function. Angiotensin inhibition caused reduction in effective glomerular pore size and also reduced flow via the nondiscriminatory shunt. Angiotensin inhibition in normotensive patients with type I diabetes was well tolerated. Reduction in albuminuria is mediated by a combination of hemodynamic changes and alterations in glomerular capillary function.", 
    "30": "In this study the authors evaluated the effect of captopril on coronary flow (CBF) dP/dT ratio and on reperfusion ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmia (VHA) in 15 isolated and perfused (Langendorff's procedure) rabbit hearts following acute experimental ischaemia. The final goal was to determine whether pretreatment with captopril (administered before induced ischaemia or during the perfusion period) could protect the heart from the effects induced by acute ischaemia. Acute ischaemia was produced through 15-min ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery at its origin. After the ischaemic period, the hearts were subjected to a perfusion procedure for 45 min. Isolated hearts were connected to an intraventricular transducer system to evaluate intraventricular pressure curves, associated with a monitoring electrocardiogram system. Renin activity was detected by the RIA method from perfusion fluid samples. The 15 isolated and perfused rabbit hearts were subgrouped into 3 experimental groups as follows: Experiment No. 1: in this model the effects of acute induced ischaemia were evaluated in 5 rabbits without treatment and used as controls. At the end of the ischaemic period a relevant percent decrease in CBF (-36%) and in Dp/dT ratio (-33%) was found; after perfusion period a further percent decrease in CBF (-41%) and in Dp/dT ratio (-41%) was observed. Renin activity increased significantly only during the ischaemic period. In all the rabbits ventricular premature beats (VPB) were found and in 3 rabbits ventricular fibrillation (VF) was also detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) have now been shown to improve symptoms and survival in patients with mild, moderate and severe chronic heart failure. Their mechanism of action is thought to be a combination of RAAS suppression and augmentation of bradykinin and prostaglandins. Although ACE inhibitors improve hemodynamics post myocardial infarction, we do not yet have consistent data on their effects on symptoms or survival in these particular patients. One other potential benefit is their effects on reperfusion injury and free radicals. As yet only minor differences have been found to exist between different ACEIs but increasing attention is now being focussed in this direction.", 
    "32": "Thirty-three anaphylactoid reactions occurring in 19 ACE inhibitors-treated patients dialyzed with AN 69 membrane--plate and hollow fibers--dialyzers are reported. A careful analyze of these observations strongly suggests the preventive role of alkaline rinsing of the membrane.", 
    "33": "Early screening for hypertension in diabetic patients and for glycoregulation abnormalities in hypertensives is justified by the additive cardiovascular risks when hypertension and diabetes co-exist and by the accelerated development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy if hypertension co-exists. In insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension is generally preceded by microalbuminuria, known to be reduced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The requirement for nephropathy prevention and the hemodynamic and/or tissular effects of this therapeutic class could justify their use at a blood pressure level less than that conventionally considered hypertensive. This strategy must be confirmed by prospective trials, already underway, evaluating the nephroprotective efficacy of this therapy. In non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension is often present before the diabetes is diagnosed and antihypertensive therapy, especially thiazide diuretics, could play a demasking or favorizing role. The optimal blood pressure level to which these patients at high renal and coronary risk should be lowered still has to be determined. A prospective study, comparing the effects of strict (treated diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg) and less strict (treated diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mmHg) hypertensive control on coronary event prevention in essential hypertension, is in progress and will have important implications for hypertension treatment in diabetics. Appropriate treatment of other risk factors, such as hyperlipidaemia and smoking, contributes to coronary and renal prevention in all diabetic hypertensives.", 
    "34": "In order to assess the prevalence of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and of the association of both diseases, and furthermore, to underline the behaviours and feelings of French physicians in front of these combined diseases, a survey has been undertaken by the SOFRES Medical institute and by Laboratoires Hoechst, which involved 304 physicians in private practice and 67 hospital doctors. After face-to-face interviews, each participant had to fill up a questionnaire dealing with his general feelings and attitudes, and then completed 2 case record forms (5 cases for hospital doctors) from their last patients who presented with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. All these informations have allowed us to describe their behaviours. The 304 physicians have been selected with a regional stratification by a random survey quota method that gave a valid sample from the French medical population: 213 general practitioners (GPs), 67 cardiologists, 24 endocrinologists have been involved in the survey. They have been able to observe 149 hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients and 470 hypertensive non insulin-dependent diabetic patients (respectively 24% and 76%). In addition, 67 hospital doctors (32 cardiologists, 17 diabetologists, 18 nephrologists) have been involved and have filled 255 case record forms (120 insulin-dependent and 135 non insulin-dependent diabetic patients). The association between hypertension and diabetes mellitus is very common: 55% out of the diabetic patients treated by GPs presented with hypertension, 20% out of the hypertensive patients presented with diabetes mellitus. The discovery of hypertension is usually followed by the discovery of non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The opposite feature is observed for the insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The majority of the doctors feels that the cardiovascular prognosis of the association is worse than each single disease. The level of blood pressure that is suitable to start an antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive insulin-dependent and non insulin-dependent diabetic patients is generally lower than for non diabetic hypertensive patients, especially for the diabetologists. Concerning antihypertensive treatments, discrepancies have been observed in between feelings and behaviours of physicians. The class of drug that is thought to be used is obviously different from the one which is really used: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists, two rather new classes of drugs are popular while classical classes of antihypertensive agents like diuretics and betablockers are still commonly used. Non pharmacological interventions which are useful for both the treatment of hypertension and diabetes mellitus are not commonly recommended by GPs and specialists.", 
    "35": "Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-nephrotic rats show high plasma renin, low plasma angiotensinogen (Angt), and increased urinary excretion of renin and Angt. In this work, we studied the effect of captopril on urinary excretion of total protein, renin, and Angt for 25 days after PAN injection. Captopril had no effect on total protein urinary excretion; however, captopril did enhance the urinary excretion of renin and did decrease the urinary excretion of Angt. This seems to be due to the fact that captopril magnifies the increase in renin and the decrease in Angt in the plasma of PAN-nephrotic rats.", 
    "36": "The study aimed at evaluating tolerability and efficacy of the combination enalapril 20 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (co-renitec) as first line therapy in black patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension. Fifty patients completed a twelve weeks of open clinical study preceded by two weeks of washout period. They were evaluated every four weeks and haematological, biochemical urine microscopy and electrocardiographic tests were undertaken before the start and after the completion of study. Pre-treatment values of mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 172.16 mm hg (+/- 20.41) and 104.38 mm hg (+/- 7.339) respectively. The usual daily dosage was one tablet which was increased to two after eight weeks in case the DBP was not normalized, i.e. less than or equal to 95 mm hg. In 44 (88%) patients, the DBP was normalised at the end of the study period; three patients (6%) were resistant to treatment and another three (6%) exhibited labile response to the treatment. Clinical tolerance was considered to be very good with only five episodes of headache, backache and anxiety, probably not related to the test drug. Biological tolerance was excellent: there was no change in the haematologic parameters; there was a decrease of 5% in mean blood urea, of 9% in the mean serum creatinine and of 4% in the mean serum uric acid and a 5% increase in plasma potassium from 3.99 to 4.28 mmol/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The diuretic and natriuretic response to an intravenous dose of frusemide 40 mg was assessed in the erect and supine positions in 10 patients with cardiac failure who were being treated with enalapril 10 mg twice daily in addition to diuretics (Enalapril group) and in 10 patients with cardiac failure taking diuretics alone (Control group). Total 4 h diuresis in the erect position was 728 ml and in the supine position was 824 ml in the patients taking enalapril compared to 655 ml in the erect position and 1166 ml in the supine position in those patients taking diuretics alone. Total 4 h natriuresis in the erect positions was 78 mmol and in the supine position was 85 mmol in patients taking enalapril 10 mg twice daily but in those patients taking diuretics alone total 4 h natriuresis in the erect position was 67 mmol increasing to 120 mmol in the supine position. Measurements of plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration confirmed effective converting enzyme inhibition, in the group of patients taking enalapril, but in those patients taking diuretics alone the erect position was associated with an increase in plasma renin activity, and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone. We conclude that the renin angiotensin system is a major factor in mediating the effect of posture on loop diuretic drugs.", 
    "38": "1. During the past 30 years many antihypertensive agents, acting at differing levels on the mechanisms controlling arterial blood pressure, have been introduced. 2. Whereas the usefulness of early drugs was limited by side effects, the discovery of successive classes of agents has resulted in the gradual introduction of drugs causing fewer adverse effects with consequent improvements in patient compliance. 3. The recent appearance of angiotensin II antagonists and potassium channel openers, together with increased knowledge of the roles played by atrial natriuretic factor and endothelial cell-derived autacoids in control of vascular tone, hold prospects for still further improvements in therapy.", 
    "39": "The effect of aging on the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was studied in 30 patients with renovascular hypertension and 33 patients with essential hypertension. Plasma renin decreased with age in patients with renovascular hypertension and essential hypertension. However, in patients with renovascular hypertension, the change was not statistically significant. Plasma aldosterone concentration showed a tendency to decrease with age in both groups. Stimulated plasma renin activity and the net increase in plasma renin activity after captopril administration in patients with essential hypertension showed a significant decrease with age. In patients with renovascular hypertension, exaggerated response of renin secretion was observed in younger patients, but middle-aged and elderly patients did not demonstrate this hyper-responsiveness. The degree of decrease in blood pressure by administration of an angiotensin (Ang) II analog ([Sar1,Ile8] Ang II) was the same in both younger and elderly patients with either disease. These results suggest that the effect of aging on the RAS occurs not only in patients with essential hypertension, but also in patients with renovascular hypertension. Furthermore, although the Ang II analog infusion test and captopril stimulation test are considered to be useful screening tests for renovascular hypertension, we consider that the combination of Ang II analog test and captopril test may be favorable to screen renovascular hypertension, since the captopril stimulation test had a lower sensitivity in younger (under 35 years old) patients.", 
    "40": "The antihypertensive efficacy of sustained-release nicardipine compared to placebo as third-line therapy has been assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in severely hypertensive patients with clinically unsatisfactory blood pressure control on 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide o.d. and 75 mg captopril b.d. Forty-two patients, 31 m and 11 f, with supine diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mm Hg after a 4 week run-in period on open hydrochlorothiazide and captopril, were randomly allocated to sustained-release nicardipine 45-60 mg/d or placebo. At a visit to the clinic blood pressure and heart rate were measured 12 h after the evening dose by a trained observer unaware of the treatment. Twenty-four hour ambulatory monitoring was performed at the end of baseline and after 8 weeks of blinded medication. There was no significant change in BD at the visit or on ambulatory monitoring in the placebo treated patients. In contrast, nicardipine produced a significant reduction in both blood pressures without affecting heart rate. Nicardipine also decreased the mean 24-h blood pressure by 14/10 mm Hg in patients whose clinical hypertension had been confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring but by only 3/2 mm Hg in ambulant patients who were normotensive on two-drug therapy. One patient experienced an episode of severe symptomatic hypotension while on nicardipine. Otherwise, the numbers and percentages of patients from each group reporting adverse experiences were similar. It is concluded that nicardipine appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used as third line therapy with diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with severe hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Metabolism of proteins which compose capillary basement membrane is altered in diabetic patients. In the kidney, this leads to an impaired permselectivity of glomerular basement membrane and consequently to onset of proteinuria. Proteinuria which is often increased by hemodynamic factors, initiates and promotes the development of diabetic glomerusclerosis. Aside from near-normal metabolic control, special antihypertensive treatment can reduce proteinuria and retard loss of kidney function in proteinuric diabetic patients. The beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors on course of diabetic nephropathy is generally thought to be a consequence of decreased systemic and intraglomerular pressure. However, recent longterm studies in Type I and Type II diabetic patients with nephropathy showed that ACE-inhibition can reduce proteinuria independent from their hemodynamic effects and, thus, improves the filtration properties of glomerular basement membrane. This may be due to an influence of ACE-inhibition on metabolism of basement membrane proteins.", 
    "42": "Protein meals and infusion of amino acids cause an increase of glomerular filtration rate in humans and animals with normal renal function despite the circulating renin concentration remaining unchanged. The renal hemodynamic response is not altered by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, but it is obliterated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. By contrast, chronic exposure to high protein diets raises circulating renin and increases messenger RNA of renin (but not of angiotensinogen) in kidney tissue. Chronically high protein intake raises the glomerular filtration rate and reduces glomerular permselectivity; the reverse is seen with low protein intake. In patients with renal failure, acute amino acid infusion or protein meals cause a paradoxical drop in glomerular filtration rate which is not influenced by converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "43": "Epidemiological data reviewed suggest that diabetes itself increases the cardiac risk of diabetics (types I and II), independently from the development of coronary heart disease and in addition to other risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, smoking and others), presumably by a specific myocardial disease called \"diabetic cardiopathy\", or according to the recommendations of the WHO, \"diabetic heart muscle disease.\" Disturbances of the left and right ventricular function as well as the autonomic function of the heart can be understood as signs of this specific cardiopathy. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease are not yet fully known; however, recent evidence is presented that diabetes leads to a facet of metabolic dysfunctions regarding glucose and energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis and the expression of specific proteins that diminish the ability of the heart to respond to increased workload and increase the vulnerability of the heart in diabetes. Since preliminary experimental data indicate that inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme can protect the heart in diabetes, it is intriguing to suggest that increased release of angiotensin II plays a significant role in the change from reduced adaptability to irreversible damage of the heart in diabetes.", 
    "44": "The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the eye has not been clearly established, nor is it known whether it is of importance in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy. Circulating renin is produced in the kidney and other tissues; its main importance is in the control of blood pressure. Elevated levels have been found in diabetic patients with microvascular complications. There is also some suggestion that the prorenin content is elevated in diabetics and that this is an indicator of the development of microvascular complications in the next few years. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been found to reduce the leakage in early diabetic retinopathy, but it is possible that this was only due to a reduction of blood pressure. Angiotensin II was found to induce neovascularisation in corneal pocket experiments, and the replication of aortic endothelial cells has been reported. We were unable to find any increased replication of retinal endothelial cells treated with angiotensin II. It is possible that the main function of the renin-angiotensin system in the eye is the regulation of local blood flow.", 
    "45": "Lymphocyte potassium and magnesium were measured before and 3 months after the introduction of captopril in 18 patients taking diuretics for congestive heart failure. Compared to 32 healthy controls, 9 patients who had been on potassium supplements plus frusemide had decreased baseline lymphocyte magnesium and potassium concentrations (p less than 0.01), in spite of similar plasma electrolyte levels. There was a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in both lymphocyte potassium and magnesium levels after 3 months' treatment with captopril and frusemide in these patients. Nine patients who had been taking a potassium-sparing combination diuretic also had an increase in lymphocyte magnesium (p less than 0.05) following the introduction of captopril. Increased intracellular potassium and magnesium may be one mechanism whereby angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced arrhythmias and improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "46": "The venom of the Brazilian snake Bothrops jararacussu, was found to contain peptides capable of potentiating the smooth muscle contracting activity of bradykinin (BK). Chromatographic separation on Sephadex G-25 and Sephadex G-10 respectively, yielded an active peptide which at a concentration of 0.6 micrograms/ml doubled the effect of a single dose of BK on the isolated guinea-pig ileum. HPLC chromatography showed this material to contain one major and 4 minor components. The active peptide was 2-3 times more active than Captopril in the potentiation of the effects of BK on rat arterial blood pressure and on the isolated guinea pig ileum. It also showed marked capacity to inhibit angiotensin I-converting enzyme.", 
    "47": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of primary degenerative dementia, is the leading cause of cognitive impairment in the geriatric population. It is a devastating illness, both to the patients and the families involved. Although much research continues to be conducted, the etiology and effective treatment for the disease remain to be found. One of the primary hypotheses of the disease is that the cognitive decline of AD involves the loss of related cholinergic neurons. Although the cholinergic theory is still valid, efforts aimed at increasing levels of acetylcholine have yielded disappointing results. Currently, in the United States, several drugs are in various stages of development for the treatment of AD. The mechanisms of these agents include cerebral protectants, enhancers of neuronal signal amplification, tonic stimulation, and nerve growth factors. Other avenues being investigated include the development of novel drug delivery systems to enhance CNS concentrations of therapeutic agents.", 
    "48": "Antihypertensive effects of FRC-8653, a new 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, and its combined effects with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a diuretic, and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent were examined in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). When administered intravenously to SHR (10, 30 micrograms/kg), FRC-8653 lowered blood pressure more slowly and sustained it longer than nifedipine and nicardipine. Consecutive once-daily administrations of FRC-8653 to SHR (3 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a stable reduction of blood pressure throughout the experimental period of 29 d. When blood pressure was continuously measured for 24 h in conscious unrestricted SHR, orally administered FRC-8653 produced a long-lasting reduction in blood pressure. When concomitantly used with atenolol (30 mg/kg, p.o.), the antihypertensive effect of FRC-8653 was augmented in both potency and duration. However, simultaneous administration of captopril (30 mg/kg, p.o.) or hydrochlorothiazide (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) did not modify the antihypertensive effect of FRC-8653.", 
    "49": "Wholesale data from Estonia covering all drug supplies during the period 1983-1989 have been studied using the defined daily dose (DDD) methodology. The use of all major pharmacological groups was compared with the corresponding statistics from the Nordic countries. The patterns of drug use showed large differences between the Nordic countries and Estonia. Many drugs were used in large quantities in Estonia although they are no longer considered to be first-line medications in the Nordic countries because of their high risk to benefit ratio. These included the pyrazolones (phenylbutazone, aminophenazone), chloramphenicol, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and Rauwolfia alkaloids. On the other hand, several groups of effective drugs were available in Estonia only in limited amounts, including the histamine (H2) receptor antagonists, hormonal contraceptives, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and cephalosporins. There were also differences in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood pressure lowering agents, and anti-asthmatic drugs. Amongst the factors influencing drug usage it appears that economic status, the ordering and invoicing routines of the pharmaceutical services, and therapeutic traditions were the main reasons for the differences found.", 
    "50": "All 98 cases of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia reported by the 30 regional drug-monitoring centers between 1985 and 1990 were analyzed: 46 with gliclazide, 40 with glibenclamide, 5 with glipizide, 1 with glibornuride and 6 with first-generation sulfonylureas. These cases of hypoglycemia were often serious. The patients were 61% female and their mean age was 78.9 years. The average number of medications being taken was 3.4, but ranged up to 14. The risk factors were: reduced food intake (4.2%), renal failure (4.2%), prescription error (3.2%), voluntary or accidental overdose (5.2%), alcohol (1.1%), suspected drug interactions (50%), unknown (32.6%). The most frequent drug interactions involved miconazole (8 cases), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (9 cases), lipid-regulating agents (fibrates) (7 cases), co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 5 cases), metformin (4 cases), histamine H2-receptor antagonists (4 cases). The mechanisms of these interactions are discussed.", 
    "51": "Studies investigating the antiischemic action of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have, after single dosing, provided evidence for mechanisms of action such as coronary vasodilation and reduction of myocardial oxygen-consumption due to pre- and afterload reduction. Measurements of exercise-induced ST-segment depression and exercise duration as criteria for clinical efficacy have revealed contradictory findings. Patient characteristics, which may be important for a satisfactory response to CEI treatment, have yet to be identified. Patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction may benefit from CEI therapy. Neurohumoral factors, e.g., plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide, may also be relevant. The anti-ischemic efficacy of CEIs given as monotherapy has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. The protective effect of CEI treatment with regard to ventricular enlargement after myocardial infarction seems to be established; however, data on mortality are still outstanding.", 
    "52": "Several bradykinin potentiators were identified in the venom of Bothrops jararacussu by chromatographic techniques and biological assays. One of them which was isolated inhibited the angiotensin-converting enzyme in vitro and potentiated the bradykinin-induced lowering of the arterial pressure in the rat.", 
    "53": "In recent controlled trials using clinic-based manometry, thiazides and beta-blockers prevented cerebrovascular and coronary deaths in patients aged 60-79 years with cryptogenic hypertension (diastolic 90-119 mm Hg). Elderly patients should usually take low-dose thiazide with potassium replacement. beta-Blockers also postpone death, but may mask hypoglycaemia. Calcium blockers and low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear preferable in diabetes, and thiazides or ACE inhibitors in heart failure or peripheral vascular disease. Maintaining average diastolic pressure at 80-84 mm Hg impairs function of the kidneys, and possibly the myocardium. Metabolic reactions worsen with age. Drug treatment should match individual daily function. By clinic manometry, the protection:risk ratio of antihypertensive treatment progressively decreases with age, reaching less than 1.0 in patients over 80-85 years. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure information should guide treatment more reliably in patients greater than or equal to 60 years.", 
    "54": "Congestive heart failure is in large part a disease of patients with advancing age. As our population ages, the incidence and prevalence of this disorder will continue to rise. The etiology of CHF in the elderly is multifactorial and one must take into account normal changes associated with aging, the heterogeneity of the elderly population, and possible noncardiac as well as cardiac disorders. Therapy must be aimed at the primary pathophysiologic process affecting the heart. Despite a number of therapeutic advances with medical therapy, CHF usually signals a generally irreversible process with a high mortality, especially in those patients with advanced disease. Therefore preventive measures should assume a paramount role in this disorder. Modification of risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, obesity, sedentary life style, and hypercholesterolemia should be aggressively stressed and pursued in patients of all ages. These preventive measures may have a substantial impact on the incidence of CHF in the elderly.", 
    "55": "Tensiomin treatment was applied in 20 hypertensive patients with impaired renal function but not requiring dialysis therapy and in 18 patients undergoing regular dialysis. In patients still not requiring dialysis the slowing down of the progression of renal failure, in the dialysed patients insufficient earlier therapy were the indications of Tensiomin treatment. Tensiomin was found to be an effective hypotensive drug in both groups, the majority of the side-effects were mild and of temporary character. The progression of renal failure was slower in the non-dialysed patients compared to the control group but the differences were statistically insignificant.", 
    "56": "Vasoconstriction, caused by activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to myocardial damage during ischaemia; the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, suppresses angiotensin formation. We investigated the effects of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and captopril on coronary flow, function and energy metabolism before, during and after ischaemia in 59 Langendorff rat hearts. Angiotensin I (100 nM) and II (10 nM) caused reduction of coronary flow at constant perfusion pressure by 31% (P less than 0.005) and 27% (P less than 0.05), respectively. During reperfusion these compounds decreased flow by 30% (P less than 0.005) and 12% (P = 0.40), respectively. Captopril (0.4 mM) inhibited vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin I, but not by angiotensin II. The drug itself increased flow by 42% (P less than 0.005). We did not detect significant effects of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, or captopril on cardiac function or high-energy phosphate content. Developed tension in captopril-treated hearts tended to recover faster from ischaemia than controls, with concomitant lower ATP catabolism. We conclude that the isolated rat heart contains an active angiotensin-converting enzyme. Captopril, used at a concentration of 0.4 nM, blocks its activity. The drug has no significant effect on myocardial function or energy metabolism but increases coronary flow during normoxic perfusion.", 
    "57": "The clinical usefulness of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on the posturally induced fall in creatinine clearance (ClCr) was studied in patients with biopsy-proved chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN). After a change from supine to upright position, ClCr fell significantly in all patients. This fall was significantly ameliorated by the pretreatment with captopril (fall in ClCr 28.8 +/- 14.3% for nontreated vs 16.5 +/- 11.5% for treated patients; n = 12; p less than 0.05). The ameliorating effect was more marked in patients with mesangial cell proliferation (MP) than those without it (fall in ClCr 7.2 +/- 6.3% for MP vs 17.1 +/- 12.3% for no MP; n = 6; p less than 0.05). The results suggest that captopril apparently had a renoprotective effect on the orthostatic acute fall in ClCr in patients with CGN, especially those with MP.",

Fifteen animals were sacrificed on day 20 of pregnancy and 19 were allowed to progress into partum. Placentas were smaller in E10-20 rats (-15%, p less than 0.05) and had a simple hypocellular cordonal structure; in E1-9 animals the predominant pattern was a combination of complex and simple structure. At day 20 the fetuses in the treated groups were smaller than the controls (-5% in E1-9 and -16% in E10-20, p less than 0.05); differences disappeared on the 13th day postpartum. Two fetuses from treated mothers presented incomplete skull ossification. We believe this report adds arguments to preclude converting enzyme inhibitors in pregnancy.", 
    "59": "The effect of chronic hypoxic lung disease on the activity of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system and the role the RA system plays in the pulmonary vascular changes that accompany hypoxia remain controversial. We have measured transpulmonary generation of angiotensin II (A II) and pulmonary haemodynamics in nine patients with airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 = 0.741) and arterial hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 = 8.4 Pa) before and after captopril. In each patient pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, systemic arterial pressure, arterial and mixed venous blood gas tensions and arterial and mixed venous A II were measured at rest and at intervals for a total of 3 h after 25 mg captopril orally. The patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (mean = 29 mmHg) and slightly raised A II levels (mean = 47.2 pg ml-1) but no step-up in A II levels across the lung. After captopril, both arterial and mixed venous A II levels fell by, on average 80% (SEM 2%), but the transpulmonary gradient for A II remained unchanged for each subject. The systemic arterial pressure fell by an average 18% (SEM 5%). In seven patients pulmonary vascular resistance fell (mean = 31%, SEM 6%) and in two patients it rose. There was no significant change in blood gas tensions. These findings suggest that patients with chronic hypoxic lung disease have decreased conversion of A I to A II in the lung but stimulation of the extra-pulmonary renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibition appears to cause a fall in PVR in most patients with severe chronic airflow obstruction without deterioration in gas exchange.", 
    "60": "The authors report the successful control of labile hypertension associated with orthostatic hypotension in a 75-year-old male patient, by means of L-DOPS, a synthetic precursor of norepinephrine in combination with antihypertensive drugs. He had been known to be hypertensive for 15 years and developed a persistent floating sensation 2 years age. Despite good control of hypertension after admission, orthostatic hypotension was still observed. Passive tilt produced a blood pressure reduction of 60/20 mmHg. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability showed a disturbance in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Treatment with L-DOPS attenuated the blood pressure reduction in response to passive tilt (35/12 mmHg) and improved the sympathetic response. Because of an increase in blood pressure by L-DOPS, addition of either a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was necessary. These combinations of treatment successfully controlled blood pressure as well as orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "61": "Experimental animal studies have demonstrated a renal protective effect of ACE inhibition therapy in diabetes mellitus and the remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure. The mechanism of this effect is secondary, at least in part, to the drugs' effects on glomerular hemodynamics. In addition, there is further evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may influence other pathogenic mechanisms of progressive renal insufficiency. Preliminary data in clinical studies suggest that ACE inhibition therapy decreases proteinuria and may ameliorate the decline of the glomerular filtration rate in diabetic nephropathy and progressive renal insufficiency of other etiologies. However, before this conclusion can be definite, a large, prospective, randomized clinical trial is required to compare ACE inhibitors to conventional antihypertensive agents. Since calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral in that they do not increase serum cholesterol or glucose levels and generally do not cause orthostatic hypotension, they may be ideal agents for such a comparison study.", 
    "62": "While studying the effect of peroral captopril injections on the activity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II content from anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, medulla and adenohypophysis of intact rats has been established to decrease. Captopril administration decreases ACE activity which increases after hydrocortisone injection in rat medulla and striatum. Captopril results in no potentiation of hormonal effect in hypothalamus and in adenohypophysis where ACE activity decreases following hydrocortisone injection. A decrease in the RAS activity of brain structures and adenohypophysis induced by captopril administration to rats is accompanied by the inhibition of the activity in the pituitary-adrenal system. A decrease in ACTH level and in 11-hydroxycorticosteroids of the rat blood plasma has been determined after single captopril injection in the dosage of 10 and 50 mg/kg of body weight. Duration of the effect depends on the captopril dosage.", 
    "63": "The pathogenetic relationship between tumour and hypertension was investigated in 129 patients with renal cell carcinoma, of whom 41 (31.8%) were hypertensive. Of these 41 patients with renal tumours and hypertension, 6 (14.6%) were found to have primary reninism. In these patients the plasma renin activity in blood from the renal veins showed a tumour kidney to contralateral kidney ratio of between 4 and 7, and 2 patients also had secondary hyperaldosteronism. In the same 6 cases the renin content in the renal tumour tissue was significantly higher than that in tissue from the adjacent tumour-free renal cortex of the ipsilateral kidney. Immunohistochemical demonstration of renin in the tumour was only possible in these 6 cases. In 5 of these patients blood pressure returned to normal following nephrectomy; in the 6th case there was a drop in blood pressure after nephrectomy. In 3 renin-positive tumours examined, autonomous renin production was demonstrated in cell culture. Renin-producing renal cell carcinomas are an uncommon cause of renal hypertension. The differential diagnosis of hypertension should therefore also include renal tumour.", 
    "64": "In order to study why the diagnostic sensitivity of 123I-hippurate renography for a renal artery stenosis is improved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-) inhibition we used the model of the conscious chronically instrumented two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive dog. Urine flow (UV), renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured (with constant infusion of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippurate, respectively) for both kidneys separately before and after a bolus injection of a mild unilateral renal artery stenosis (approximately 30% reduction of RBF). During ACE-inhibition, there were remarkable falls in poststenotic GFR (from 37 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 2 ml/min, p less than 0.05), ERPF (from 111 +/- 13 to 21 +/- 10 ml/min, p less than 0.05) and UV (from 0.86 +/- 0.15 to 0.075 +/- 0.045 ml/min, p less than 0.05), whereas RBF of the poststenotic kidney slightly increased (from 193 +/- 18 to 237 +/- 27 ml/min, p less than 0.05). The concentration of hippurate and thalamate in the blood remained remarkably constant while the excretion of the tracers by the poststenotic kidney diminished and renal retention of 123I-hippurate was seen on the renogram. In 2 dogs, the experiments were repeated during mannitol infusion. In that situation, there was a much smaller decrease of poststenotic UV and GFR whereas ERPF even showed a small increase comparable to the RBF changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Experimental evidence indicates that angiotensin II can modulate sodium channel and gap junction function. This raises the possibility that variations in angiotensin II could alter the effect of drugs that act on these mechanisms. In this study, the influence of changing salt status and angiotensin II activity has been investigated by evaluating the QRS prolonging effects of the sodium channel blocking drug, desmethylimipramine. In control rats with a normal salt intake, intravenous infusion of desmethylimipramine (0.8 mg/kg/min) over 60 min increased QRS duration over time to 150% of control by 60 min; mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were decreased. In salt-deplete rats, the response to desmethylimipramine was similar to controls for 30 min. Thereafter, QRS duration increased more rapidly than controls. In rats on a high salt diet, the same desmethylimipramine infusion produced no change in QRS duration for 30 min, despite equivalent reductions in mean arterial blood pressure. Thereafter, QRS duration increased, reaching values similar to control by 60 min. In rats on a normal salt diet pretreated with captopril, there was a similar blunting of the QRS response to desmethylimipramine to that observed in salt-loaded rats. The QRS response to desmethylimipramine and salt-loaded rats on normal salt diets receiving captopril returned to the control pattern after a subpressor infusion of angiotensin II (3 ng/min), while a higher rate of angiotensin II (10 ng/min) further enhanced the QRS prolonging effect of desmethylimipramine. These data demonstrate that endogenous angiotensin II contributes to the regulation of the cardiac electro-physiological response to DMI.", 
    "66": "While it is known that randomly bred normotensive Wistar stock and hypertensive rats alter their alcohol consumption when activity in the renin-angiotensin (R-A) system is modified, the effect of manipulations to the R-A system on alcohol intake in genetically selected alcohol-preferring P and -nonpreferring NP rats has not been assessed. In Experiment 1, nine P rats and 8 NP rats were injected with the saline vehicle and offered limited access to 10% (v/v) alcohol for 40 min each day for 7 days. When intake stabilized both groups were given daily intraperitoneal injections of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ceranapril (20 mg/kg) 45 min prior to alcohol access for 11 days. Ceranapril (SQ 29,852) reduced alcohol intake in both the P and NP animals, while saline had no effect. In Experiment 2, these same two groups of P and NP rats were injected with three doses of angiotensin II (ANG II) (100, 200, 400 micrograms/kg) immediately prior to alcohol access. Each dose was tested for 10 consecutive days, with a 14-day period of no drug preceding and following the ANG II treatments. ANG II reduced alcohol intake in the NP rats and produced a dose-dependent reduction in the alcohol consumption of the P rats. These findings indicate that the renin-angiotensin system can modify alcohol consumption in rats selectively bred for high and low alcohol intake.", 
    "67": "The clinical efficacy of enalapril was investigated in 21 patients with severe heart failure. For each subject, the following parameters were compared before and one month after enalapril maintenance treatment. NYHA functional class, Killip's class, cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), left ventricular (LV) function estimated by echocardiography and gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography, Holter ECG recordings, serum digoxin concentration (SDC), plasma remin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, plasma norepinephrine concentration (PNE), etc. Short- and long-term hemodynamic responses to enalapril were also studied, with simultaneous measurement of enalapril concentration by radioimmunoassay. After maintenance therapy, patients showed a significant improvement as judged by NYHA functional class, Killip's class, and CTR. The LV fractional shortening and the ejection fraction significantly increased. The frequency of ventricular tachycardia showed a significant tendency to decrease after the therapy. The SDCs were unchanged, which indicates no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between digoxin and enalapril. Hemodynamic assessment showed a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, a reduction in mean blood pressure, and an increase in the cardiac index. No major side effects were observed during the study period. According to a multivariate analysis, the coefficient of determination of PNE was the highest for the final global improvement rating. This may reflect the neurohormonal improvement of congestive heart failure by enalapril therapy. In conclusion, enalapril is recommended for treating patients with severe CHF.", 
    "68": "We studied the plasma renin activity (PRA) and blood pressure (BP) responses to a single oral dose of captopril in children with renal scarring due to vesicoureteral reflux. The test was performed on 19 children, of whom 13 were normotensive and 6 hypertensive. Basal PRA was within the normal range for age for all except 1 patient. Mean basal PRA values for normotensive and hypertensive patients were not significantly different. At 90 min post captopril, the mean PRA increase was 3.61 ng/l per second (SD = 7.07) in the normotensive group but only 0.77 ng/l per second (SD = 0.83) in the hypertensive group. In 11 patients the average systolic BP 60-90 min post captopril was 0.9%-12.4% lower than the basal value. Diastolic BP decreased after captopril administration in 10 patients and increased in 9. The changes in mean arterial pressure and PRA between 0 and 90 min post captopril were inversely correlated (r = 0.605, P less than 0.01). Because of the PRA responsiveness in the normotensive patients with renal scarring, we suggest that there was activation of the renin-angiotensin axis in this group. However, it is not apparent whether such patients are more at risk of developing hypertension at a later time.", 
    "69": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a group of effective drugs with a unique mechanism of action. These drugs have proven to be useful for hypertension and congestive heart failure. Early clinical trials of captopril used doses that are now known to be inappropriately high, and dose-related adverse effects were observed frequently. The recognition that lower doses are effective has reduced the incidence of adverse reactions and resulted in improved patient tolerance. When patients are properly selected and correctable risk factors are removed, serious side effects are uncommon. Unfortunately, the early reputation of nephrotoxicity persists, as does the belief that significant blood dyscrasias, endocrine effects and rash are serious risks for the average patient. After wide use of captopril, enalapril and lisinopril, and investigational trials of nearly a dozen newer agents, a sufficiency of clinical observation, experimental evidence and accurate postmarketing recording of events is accumulating to allow insight into the major toxicities with regard to more intelligent patient selection, more rational dosing and proper identification of risk factors. The most common adverse reactions are cough and skin rash. It appears that the agents are generally not cross-reactive with regard to skin rash, although it is not clear whether this effect is drug-specific or class-specific with regard to cough. Statistically but not clinically significant lowering of haemoglobin and hematocrit is common; these effects are inconsequential in most patients. Neutropenia, once thought to be prevalent, now appears to be so only in patients with autoimmune or collagen-vascular disease; the majority of patients outside these groups are at low risk. Hyperkalaemia is a frequent occurrence. This should not be surprising in view of the effect of the ACE inhibitors on plasma aldosterone. When dietary potassium intake is regulated and sources of altered potassium excretion are identified, hyperkalaemia is seldom a serious problem. Identification of sodium and water deficits allows correction before the drugs are started, and the frequency of hypotension and hyperkalaemia caused by the drugs is quite low if these factors are properly managed. An unexpected finding emerging in recent years is the dry cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Its mechanism is not definitely known. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may control this symptom in some patients. The frequent observation of proteinuria in patients taking ACE inhibitors has gained notice and sometimes caused undue alarm. It is difficult to separate disease effects in diabetes and hypertension from true drug effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Diastolic dysfunction is often present in patients with arterial hypertension. It is not only the consequence of an increased left ventricular muscle mass but also due to a progressive fibrosis of the cardiac interstitium. Experimental studies have shown a close relationship between the degree of interstitial cardiac fibrosis and the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Reversal of collagen deposition can be induced by inhibition of the RAS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ACE inhibitors not only in lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, but also in normalizing an impaired diastolic filling pattern in the left ventricle. Monotherapy with a single dose of 2.5-5 mg Cilazapril for a period of 6 months was effective in reducing mean arterial blood pressure by about 10 mmHg over the entire 24-h interval. The main reduction occurred throughout the day, but lower blood pressure values during the night were hardly affected at all. The pre- and post-treatment values of the 24-h blood pressure were subjected to a modified Fourier analysis, which did not reveal any disturbances in the circadian blood pressure rhythm by the ACE inhibitor. Left ventricular mass, as calculated from echocardiographic measurements, was reduced by 30% after 6 months of treatment. The degree of regression of LV hypertrophy was closely related to the drug-induced fall in mean arterial pressure. The abnormal left ventricular filling pattern before treatment with a predominance of the late diastolic filling period was corrected by 6 months of ACE inhibitor treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effect of the new ACE-inhibitor, fosinopril, on insulin sensitivity (SI), glucose homoeostasis and lipid profile has been examined in 24 young, healthy, normotensive men. SI, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, serum total triglycerides (Tg) and lipoprotein cholesterol (C) fractions, and ACE activity were assessed after subjects had taken placebo for 1 week and after 3 further weeks either on placebo (12 subjects) or fosinopril 20 mg daily (12 subjects), administered in a double-blind, randomized order. Measurements were made after 3 days on a standard diet (2500 kcal/d, 45% carbohydrates, 40% fat and 15% proteins) and after an overnight fast. Compared with control values at the end of the run-in placebo phase, fosinopril reduced plasma ACE activity (from 106 to 24 nmol.ml-1.min-1), Significantly increased plasma potassium and lowered upright systolic blood pressure. It also improved the k-value of the glucose disappearance rate after glucose load (from -1.70 to -1.88%.min-1) and tended to increase SI slightly although not significantly (from 10.2 to 12.0.10(-4).min-1.microU-1.ml-1). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, serum total, high-, low-, and very-low density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions and total triglycerides were unchanged following fosinopril and placebo. The findings indicate that in healthy lean humans, ACE inhibition with fosinopril is neutral with regard to lipoprotein and carbohydrate metabolism, and that it may slightly enhance cellular glucose disposal. This calls for further evaluation in individuals at high risk of developing insulin resistance and in patients with impaired insulin sensitivity related to hypertension, obesity, decreased glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus.", 
    "72": "From 1986 to 1989, 68 patients with 79 stenoses (11 bilateral, 4 unilateral) underwent renal angioplasty in the Radiology Departments of Udine (34 cases) and Pisa (34 cases). Fifty-eight patients were arteriosclerotic (mean age 58) and 21 fibrodysplastic (mean age 32). The fibrodysplastic lesions were treated in Pisa. Recovery was obtained in 64/68 patients and 75/79 stenoses (residual stenosis less than 20%). Renovascular hypertension was cured or reduced in 57/64 cases. The angiographic follow-up (mean 15 months) of 54/75 stenoses demonstrated recurrence in 2/19 fibrodysplastic and in 6/35 arteriosclerotic lesions; 2 patients underwent angioplasty and 2 surgery: one patient per group exhibited no change in hypertension values. Thus, we believe that hypertension should be better defined (e.g. by selective reninemia sampling and Ace-inhibitor renal scintigraphy). The follow-up (mean 22 months) of hypertension in 48/64 patients (arteriosclerotic: fibrodysplastic = greater than 33/15) showed complete recovery in 8/33 and in 10/15 cases (24% and 66%, respectively); a significant improvement was obtained in 15/33 and in 2/15 cases (45% and 14%, respectively). Our results confirmed the higher efficacy of renal angioplasty in the treatment of fibrodysplastic lesions; as for arteriosclerotic lesions, angioplasty has been observed to improve vascularization rather than to cure hypertension.", 
    "73": "Cilazapril is a new once-daily angiotensin-converting (ACE) enzyme inhibitor which has been administered to 4,500 patients with mainly mild to moderate essential hypertension in a multinational clinical research program. Sitting diastolic blood pressure was reduced by about 9 mm Hg from baseline (p less than 0.01) after 4 weeks of treatment with cilazapril 1.25-10 mg/day in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Total responder rates to cilazapril were usually 50-60% compared with 30% to placebo. Adding hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day to cilazapril 5.0 mg/day increased the total responder rate from 52 to 71%. Double-blind dose titration studies for 8 weeks showed that cilazapril 2.5-5 mg/day possessed equivalent efficacy to usual therapeutic regimens of sustained release propranolol, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol and enalapril, Cilazapril did not affect heart rate. During long-term open administration for 52 weeks, or longer, cilazapril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, effectively maintained control of blood pressure. Treatment of patients with severe hypertension with cilazapril plus hydrochlorothiazide achieved a total responder rate of 73%. Adverse events were mostly observed within the first 8-16 weeks of treatment, with headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, cough and chest pain being the most frequent. Non-life-threatening angioedema, facial edema and mild hypotension occurred in less than or equal to 0.2% of patients, and orthostatic hypotension was reported in 2%. Abnormal laboratory test values were rarely found with cilazapril treatment. Of the 2.3% of patients with elevated serum creatinine, at any time point during the study and irrespective of outcome on continuation with cilazapril therapy, about two thirds had prior renal impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "In recent years, captopril has attracted considerable clinical attention as an agent for use in treating heart failure. We administered 15 mg/kg of captopril or 1.5 mg/kg of enalapril to 5-week-old J-2-N cardiomyopathic hamsters for 10 or 15 weeks, and investigated the roles of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and kallikrein-kinin systems in the onset and progress of cardiomyopathy. In the untreated group, serum creatine kinase levels increased in accordance with the progression of cardiomyopathy, but this increase was markedly inhibited by the administration of captopril. The rise in serum aldolase levels was similarly inhibited. Serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced by the administration of captopril. ECG findings and the ventricular myosin isoenzyme pattern were also markedly improved by captopril. The improvement in all these parameters was less with enalapril. These differences between captopril and enalapril suggest that increases in tissue bradykinin and vasodilatory prostaglandins may play an important role in the beneficial effects of captopril.", 
    "75": "Patients with carotid artery occlusive disease (CAOD) may be at increased risk of iatrogenic cerebral hypoperfusion. Using the 133xenon-inhalation technique, we evaluated the effects of enalapril on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 14 patients with chronic hypertension, 7 with CAOD and 7 without CAOD (no CAOD). Regional CBF and blood pressure were measured before and 60 minutes after a single dose of enalapril. Changes in mean arterial pressure after enalapril were not significantly different between the two groups: CAOD -4.67 +/- 8.7 mm Hg, no CAOD -6.18 +/- 8.2 mm Hg. Changes in mean CBF after enalapril were also not statistically different: CAOD -1.0 +/- 3.9, no CAOD 1.0 +/- 2.8. In the CAOD group only, however, changes in CBF were significantly related to increasing age (r = -0.9253, p less than 0.01), such that in patients 65 years or older CBF tended to decrease, whereas in younger patients it increased. Elderly patients with CAOD may be at increased risk of iatrogenic cerebral hypoperfusion, and it may be appropriate to evaluate prospectively the effects of antihypertensive medications on CBF.", 
    "76": "The increase in aldosterone secretion that occurs in response to Angiotensin II (AII) is enhanced when normal humans are in external balance on a low salt diet. The responsible mechanism has not been identified. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduces blood levels of AII and aldosterone, but does not decrease PRA or AI and does not modify adrenal responsiveness to AII in the sodium-depleted state. This study was designed to assess the possibility that the enhanced adrenal response reflects plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma AI concentration, or catecholamines acting via a beta adrenergic receptor. Nine healthy males were studied when in balance on a high sodium intake (200 mmol Na/day), a low sodium diet (10 mmol Na) and after 4 days of beta adrenergic blockade with either nadolol or propranolol. The adequacy of beta adrenergic blockade was assessed with a postural stimulus and significant blockade was achieved, somewhat more with nadolol (40 mg/day) than with propranolol (Inderal LA, 80 mg every 12 hrs). Beta blockade enhanced the renal vascular and pressor response to AII but did not modify the adrenal response to posture or to AII. This study confirms the role for AII levels in the modulation of renal vascular and pressor responses to AII and rules out a role for PRA, AI, or catecholamines acting via a beta adrenergic receptor in the modulation of adrenal responsiveness to AII.", 
    "77": "Circadian rhythms in ambulatory blood pressure profiles of eight primary hypertensive patients were analyzed by nonlinear fit of a combined cosine function. Significant circadian variation in systolic blood pressure was found in each patient, and in diastolic blood pressure in seven out of eight patients. The eight primary hypertensive subjects revealed typical circadian blood-pressure profiles with two daytime maxima and a single nighttime minimum. Whereas daytime maxima differed between the subjects, all nighttime minima occurred within a narrow range of 1:54 a.m. to 4:42 a.m. The PHARMFIT-program allows to analyze in more detail the circadian blood pressure profiles obtained by ABPM in single patients as well as in a group of hypertensives.", 
    "78": "The authors investigated whether the reduction of arterial pressure, induced by the oral administration of clonidine (CLO), enalapril (EN), and nifedipine (NIF), has any effect on peritoneal transport rates. The study was performed in nine hypertensive patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The patients were submitted to administration of CLO, EN, and NIF, each in randomized succession for two weeks, after withdrawal of any hypotensive therapy for eight days (washout period). The nine patients underwent a four-hour dwell exchange using a 2.27 g/dL glucose two-liter bag after washout and after each hypotensive period. The following parameters were analyzed: mean arterial pressure (MAP), performed in the sitting position; net ultrafiltration; effluent/initial dialysate glucose ratio (GL D/Do); peritoneal clearance of K, BUN, creatinine (Cr), phosphate, beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2), total proteins, and the ratio between beta 2 and Cr clearance. Moreover, residual renal Cr and beta 2 clearances were analyzed. The three drugs significantly reduced MAP at a similar rate. The peritoneal transport parameters after CLO were similar to the results in the washout period. On the contrary, after EN and NIF therapy, Cr and beta 2 clearances were significantly increased, and GL D/Do decreased in comparison to the washout period. The other peritoneal transport parameters after EN and NIF were similar to the washout period. Residual renal Cr and beta 2 clearances after the three drugs were similar to those in the washout. these data suggest that after two weeks of therapy with EN and NIF, glucose, Cr, and beta 2 peritoneal transports are influenced by these hypotensive drugs irrespective of the effect on the arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Noninvasive diagnosis of renovascular hypertension using nuclear medicine techniques has evolved in the past 30 years through improvements in imaging equipment, radiotracers, and, most recently, captopril intervention. Characteristic patterns of normal and abnormal renograms using typical radiotracers are demonstrated, including renal artery stenosis. Comparison with other tests, both invasive and noninvasive, are made with the aim toward identifying anatomic as well as physiologic definitions of renovascular hypertension. Pitfalls in the methodology are also described. The main advantage of captopril renography is enhancement of the sensitivity, and particularly the specificity, of the radionuclide diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Available investigations have identified captopril renography as the likely procedure of choice in the noninvasive identification of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "80": "Haemodynamic changes in the carotid and brachial arteries produced by single doses of four anti-hypertensive drugs (nicardipine, enalapril, atenolol, and urapidil) have been studied in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Measurements were performed noninvasively using a mechanographic method and B-mode pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. Within 7 h all of the drugs had caused a significant reduction in blood pressure, whereas heart rate showed a significant change only after atenolol. All the drugs produced a marked reduction in brachial pulse-wave velocity. Only nicardipine caused a significant reduction in vessel wall tension both in the carotid and brachial arteries, while brachial peripheral resistance was significantly reduced by all the drugs except atenolol. Neither atenolol nor enalapril caused any significant reduction in carotid peripheral resistance. The results show that all four antihypertensive drugs led to a beneficial increase in arterial compliance despite their different effects on peripheral resistance.", 
    "81": "We have given a series of incremental intravenous injections of captopril to ten patients with chronic cardiac failure. Small doses of captopril produced significant changes in pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure, up to a total cumulative dose of captopril of 2.5 mg, after which further injections had no significant effect. There were large changes in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure up to a cumulative dose of captopril of 5.0 mg, after which the injection of larger doses caused no further significant changes. Small doses of intravenous captopril produced large increases in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I concentrations up to a total cumulative dose of captopril of 1.25 mg, after which there were no significant further changes in either plasma renin activity or plasma angiotensin I concentration. However the plasma concentration of angiotensin II fell more slowly, no further change being recorded after a total cumulative dose of captopril of 10 mg. These results suggest that plasma renin activity is not the only determinant of plasma angiotensin II concentrations.", 
    "82": "The pharmacokinetics of temocapril hydrochloride, a novel prodrug-type angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been studied in patients with mild (Group II) to severe (Group III) renal insufficiency in comparison with subjects with normal renal function (Group I). The pharmacokinetic parameters of the active diacid metabolite, including Cmax, AUC and half-life (t1/2), showed only slight changes between the three groups: AUC (0-inaffinity) was significantly larger in Group III than Group I, and t1/2 tended to be prolonged in Group III, but the change was not significant. The urinary recovery of the diacid was significantly decreased in Group III. (Group I, 28.1%, Group II, 21.6%, Group III, 12.8%). Compared with other ACE inhibitors, which are mainly excreted through the kidney, the plasma concentration of the active diacid metabolite was hardly influenced by renal function. It was speculated that lowering of the dose of temocapril might be recommended only in patients with severe renal insufficiency.", 
    "83": "A 65-year-old man presented proteinuria in the nephrotic range that occurs in the setting of high renin hypertension. Proteinuria persisted after normalizing blood pressure by nifedipine. In contrast, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril) resulted in the prompt resolution of the proteinuria. Interestingly, proteinuria relapsed after removing the ACE-inhibition. These observations suggest a causal relation between the overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system in this patient and his proteinuria.", 
    "84": "The acute effects of captopril in cirrhosis are well known but there are few descriptions of the pattern of response to chronic administration of captopril in this disease. Nine nonuraemic cirrhotic patients with ascites and portal hypertension were studied after 1 week on fixed sodium and water intake (balance diet) and following acute and chronic treatment with captopril (three doses of 25 mg every 30 min and 75 mg.day-1 for three weeks, respectively). Whilst on the balance diet, 7/9 patients were unable to excrete the amount of sodium ingested. After the acute administration of captopril, a significant reduction was seen in arterial blood pressure (86.9 vs 77 mm Hg), with no change in the intra-hepatic pressures (free suprahepatic pressure, FSHP: 15.0 vs 12.1 mm Hg and wedged suprahepatic pressure, WSHP: 22.9 vs 20.7 mm Hg). After chronic captopril treatment, a drop was observed in portal pressure (FSHP: 9.4 mm Hg and WSHP 18.8 mm Hg, NS) and the arterial pressure returned to its basal level. The plasma aldosterone concentration decreased, whilst noradrenaline and dopamine increased significantly, the latter more than the former, leading to a reduction in the noradrenaline/dopamine ratio (14.5 vs 5.0). Seven out of nine patients showed enhanced natriuresis and the remaining two, who previously had had a positive sodium balance failed to do so. These haemodynamic, hormonal and renal changes were interpreted as evidence of blockade of angiotensin II generation by captopril, and also as a homoeostatic response by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "85": "A rapid and sensitive column-switching high performance liquid chromatographic procedures was described for determination of captopril in plasma and urine. p-Bromophenacyl bromide, a derivatizing reagent, was added to the plasma and urine samples to form an adduct which showed ultraviolet absorbing properties. After that, the urine sample was injected directly and for plasma the protein was removed with 6% of perchloride before injection. The column-switching system was equipped with a pre-column of 5 cm x 0.5 cm ID, packed with mu Boundapak C18, 37-50 microns, and an analytical column of 15 cm x 0.5 cm ID, packed with YWG-C18, 10 microns. After washing out the impures from pre-column with 0.2% acetic acid the retained substances were eluted into analytical column with acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (35:65:0.4). Captopril was detected at 260 nm. The method was linear within 20-1000 ng/ml for plasma and 10-200 micrograms/ml for urine. The recovery averaged 103.2% and 99.5% for plasma and urine, respectively. The coefficient variations were all less than 10%.", 
    "86": "High resolution X-ray crystallography has been used to determine the modes of binding to thermolysin of a series of different inhibitors including dipeptides, mercaptans, hydroxamates, N-carboxymethyl peptides and phosphonamidates. The interactions displayed by such inhibitors illustrate interactions that are presumed to occur between the enzyme and its substrates during catalysis. The crystallographic analysis, together with model building, suggest a detailed stereochemical mechanism of action for thermolysin and, by analogy, other zinc proteases such as carboxypeptidase A and the angiotensin converting enzyme. Analysis of a series of phosphonamidates, which are presumed to be transition-state analogues, has shown that chemically similar inhibitors can adopt dissimilar modes of binding. These different configurations provide a rationalization for large differences in the kinetics of binding that are observed for these inhibitors. Experiments with thermolysin as a test case suggest that knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or receptor will greatly facilitate the rational design of drugs directed at such targets.", 
    "87": "The high prevalence and poor prognosis of heart failure are a major concern. Hospitalization for heart failure accounts for a major proportion of health-care expenditure. A number of large clinical trials have been initiated to assess therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis for patients with this condition. Results from one of the largest and most recently completed of such studies, the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial, demonstrate that addition of the long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril to conventional therapy with diuretics and digoxin is associated with reduced rates of mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this condition. The effects of treatment with this ACE inhibitor may be related to the degree of RAAS suppression it affords.", 
    "88": "Serum lipids of 80 patients with moderately severe essential hypertension under four different antihypertensive therapies were compared to ten matched hypertensives on a placebo, after eight weeks of therapy. The results in the serum lipid parameters measured after therapy showed with enalapril a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and a decrease in the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio. With benazepril a significant decrease in the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio was obtained. With the diuretic combination Epitens the effect on serum sodium and potassium was minimal. No significant changes were found in the lipoprotein profile following the administration of the placebo. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril and benazapril) induced a significant improvement in the atherogenic ratio; as well as the calcium antagonist (isradipine), though to a less extent. The diuretic Epitens induced an insignificant deterioration of the atherogenic ratio.", 
    "89": "The sensitivity of isolated glomeruli from normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) strains to oxidant stress was studied by determining the incidence of pyknosis, karyohexis and karyolysis after incubation with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (4.7 x 10(-9) - 10(-3) M). Even though the proportion of glomeruli containing nuclei that demonstrated these features increased progressively with increasing concentrations of H2O2, the number of severely damaged glomeruli was relatively small even at concentrations of 4.7 x 10(-3) M. Examination of the surface epithelial cells of glomeruli using scanning electron microscopy revealed no evidence of disturbance of the macroscopic or podocyte structure or, of increased blebbing after H2O2-treatment. These data suggest damage to nuclei is an early result of ROS stress on glomeruli. Preincubation of WKY glomeruli with captopril or lisinopril resulted in a significant drop in the proportion of WKY glomeruli demonstrating structural damage after oxidant stress. In contrast, preincubation of SHR glomeruli with lisinopril had no effect on oxidant-induced changes in the morphology of SHR glomeruli, whereas captopril effected a significant increase in the proportion of glomeruli demonstrating damage at all concentration of H2O2.", 
    "90": "The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism is highly activated in juxtamedullary nephrons and considered to play a major role in intrarenal regulation of glomerular filtration rate. The vasculature of juxtamedullary nephrons is highly vasoreactive with a high ability for vasodilation. This vasoreactivity is a prerequisite for an important influence of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism on the medullary blood flow and its regulation.", 
    "91": "A bradykinin-potentiating factor was isolated and characterized from the scorpion Tityus serrulatus venom by chromatographic techniques and reverse phase followed by biological assays. This factor showed to be able to potentiate the contractile activity of the isolated guinea-pig ileum, inhibited the angiotensin-converting enzyme and potentiated the bradykinin-induced lowering of the arterial blood pressure in the rat.", 
    "92": "The ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat (40 ng/kg/min) was infused for 6 h into the left coronary artery of anesthetized dogs with ligation of the descending branch of this artery. This route of administration and the low dose were chosen to achieve local cardiac effects without affecting systemic hemodynamics. Ramiprilat significantly reduced infarct-size expressed as percentage of the area at risk. The cardioprotective effect of ramiprilat was mimicked by bradykinin and abolished by coadministration of a bradykinin antagonist. These results strongly suggest that bradykinin plays a role in the cardioprotective effect of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat.", 
    "93": "In experimental ischemic dog heart with coronary-constriction, no increase of coronary blood flow, Max dP/dt or MVO2 with no change of kinin in arterial blood were exhibited. Following sympathetic nerve stimulation, remarkable increases of kinin in coronary sinus blood were observed with a significant elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and an augmented production of lactate from the heart as well as an ischemic change of ECG-ST. Infusion of kinin into the left main coronary artery resulted in no change in the mean systemic blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance, cardiac function, myocardial metabolism or ECG-ST in the control and coronary-constricted groups. These data suggest that kinin was released significantly from the ischemic heart, however, such a level of kinin has no significant effect on coronary circulation or myocardial metabolism. In ischemia-reperfusion rabbit hearts, no significant influence of the ACE inhibitors, captopril and ramiprilat, were observed. Species differences may be responsible for the beneficial role of ACE inhibitors in the limitation of infarct size in the dog hearts, possessing collateral flow, that are not seen in the rabbit heart with poor collateral flow.", 
    "94": "Restoration of coronary blood flow in the ischemic myocardium is absolutely needed to prevent irreversible cellular damage but on the other hand may have potentially hazardous consequences. Since thrombolysis during myocardial infarction is designed to salvage a maximal number of myocardial cells threatened by ischemia, a concommitant intervention which reduces cellular damage due to reperfusion will improve the net result of such procedure. The adjunctive use of ACE-inhibitors with thrombolytic therapy early during acute myocardial infarction offers theoretic advantages. This article summarizes the results indicating that ACE-inhibitors do play an important role in cardioprotection in the acute phase of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion. Probably, their effect on bradykinin breakdown is at least partly responsible for this effect.", 
    "95": "Since converting enzyme and kininase II are identical enzymes and probably influences both, the biosynthesis of Ang II and the metabolism of bradykinin we investigated the effects of bradykinin, desArg-bradykinin and some bradykinin antagonists (desArg[9]-Leu[8]-bradykinin, HOE S 890307) on the sympathetic outflow of pithed SHR or Brown-Norway-Rats before and after acute or chronic inhibition of the converting enzyme by ramipril. bradykinin increased dose dependently the noradrenaline and adrenaline release in particular when the converting enzyme was inhibited. DesArg-bradykinin caused a dose-dependent increase in adrenaline release only after converting enzyme inhibition. The bradykinin-antagonists led to an increase in adrenaline release during ramipril administration. The weak but significant stimulation of adrenaline release by the bradykinin antagonists after converting enzyme inhibition might be due to unspecific actions on the adrenal medulla possibly induced by histamine release from mast cells.", 
    "96": "Cough induced by ACE-inhibitors may be related to bronchial hyperreactivity and/or to an accumulation of kinins. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study in asthmatic and hypertensive patients lung function and bronchial reactivity to histamine and bradykinin remained unaltered although in hypertensive patients with cough, reactivity to histamine tended to be more pronounced and bronchial hyperreactivity to be more frequent than in those without cough. The findings do not support a major role of kinins in ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "97": "In guinea pig plasma, bradykinin (BK) was degraded mainly to des-Arg1-BK by an aminopeptidase-like enzyme, which was inhibited by 2-mercaptoethanol. Besides this degradation, BK was also hydrolyzed by kininase I and kininase II from C-terminal end to des-Arg9-BK, des-Phe8-Arg9-BK and Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe ([1-5] BK). The formation of des-9-BK was strongly blocked by DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MGPA) and that of des-8,9-BK and [1-5] BK was inhibited by captopril. When guinea pigs were pretreated with a cocktail of 2-mercaptoethanol, MGPA and captopril, intravenous administration of leukotriene (LT) C4 (10 nmol/kg) caused an increase in the levels of free kinin in the bronchial washings of guinea pigs. This increase was accompanied with the increase in glandular-kallikrein activity, which could be inhibited by aprotinin. As BK is reported to induce both bronchoconstriction and bronchial secretion, the increased free BK induced by LTC4 might enhance the effect of LTC4.", 
    "98": "Trauma causes increases in total protease load in the circulation of the traumatized host animal or patient. This increase is due, in part, to Hageman Factor activation followed by down-line cascade system activation. Concomitant with the activation of these systems is a reduced host capacity to resist infection. Infection superimposed on a traumatized host increases the total host protease load even more by additional activation of Hageman Factor and cascade systems.", 
    "99": "Angiotensin II (AII) and bradykinin (BK) release into anterior interventricular vein (AIV) increased significantly 30 minutes after left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion in the absence of kidneys. Captopril enhanced BK release, but did not suppress the increase of AII release. Nafamostat suppressed both releases. Infarct size was significantly reduced by captopril but not by nafamostat. These results suggest that cardioprotective effect of captopril might be dependent on local BK accumulation, but not on suppression of local AII generation.", 
    "100": "The lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonate cascade in the platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats has been found to be significantly higher than in normotensive animals. Repeated oral administration of Captopril (in drinking water - 200 mg/100 ml) for 14 days resulted in an elevation in the activity of arachidonate cascade in the platelets of treated rats. At the same time the Captopril treatment induced the formation of 12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT), which molecule is known to be a potent prostacyclin (PGI2) releaser and/or synthesis inducer. PGI2 is one of the most potent vasodilatator molecule in living organisms. The in vitro experiments in rat platelets suggest, that very low doses of Captopril (10(-12) to 10(-10) M) result in a significantly elevated 12-HHT synthesis. Captopril might act through the 12-HHT--PGI2 mechanism, resulting in blood pressure reduction. The lipoxygenase pathway of platelets, the formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), was significantly elevated in vitro in the presence of low dose of Captopril (10(-11) and 10(-10) M).", 
    "101": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindoprilat evokes endothelium-dependent relaxations in perfused isolated canine arteries. Kininogens, the precursors of bradykinin, elicit endothelium-dependent relaxations which are potentiated by perindoprilat, inhibited by B2-kinin antagonists and partially impaired after inhibition of NO synthase. These observations suggest that locally produced kinins may stimulate the production of NO and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and that this action is potentiated by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "102": "In the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat attenuated bradykinin degradation by enzymes localized on vascular endothelial cells as well as on vascular smooth muscle cells by 26% and 32%, respectively. We conclude that the ACE inhibitor can attenuate vascular bradykinin degradation not only by inhibition of endothelial ACE but also by inhibition of other bradykinin degrading enzymes in deeper layers of the vascular wall.", 
    "103": "Bradykinin plays a role in the regulation of coronary blood flow. Under basic conditions the vasodilating effect is primarily mediated by stimulation of the endogenous nitrovasodilator endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). This effect is shortlasting but can be increased and prolonged by sulfhydryl(SH)-containing agents. ACE-inhibitors may cause coronary vasorelaxation by a bradykinin-mediated release of EDRF. This can be potentiated by the presence of SH-groups, as was shown with captopril and zofenoprilat. As a consequence, SH-containing ACE-inhibitors may potentiate nitrates, because they act as exogenous nitrovasodilators, and reverse tolerance to their therapeutic effect.", 
    "104": "Perindopril, a powerful ACE inhibitor contains 5 chiral carbons, thus there is the possibility of 2(5) = 32 stereoisomers for the general structure 1. These 32 stereoisomers were synthesized by cross-coupling the 8 stereoisomers of perhydroindole 2-carboxylic acid benzylester with the 4 stereoisomers of 2-(1-carbethoxybutylamino) propionic acid 4, then hydrogenating the resulting benzylesters. Each stereoisomer of perindopril furnished by saponification the corresponding diacid stereoisomer 2 of perindoprilate which is the active form of perindopril. For each of the 32 stereoisomers 2 the in vitro ACE inhibitory potency (IC50) was determined. Four of them, including perindoprilate, had activities in the nanomolar range, and four more were ca. 10 x less active. The four acid esters 1 corresponding respectively to the four most active diacids 2 in vitro were studied (1 mg/kg via the oral route) for their in vivo activity in dogs. It could be concluded that p.o. absorption of the active acid esters 1 and their activation to the active diacid 2 depended only on the chiralities of the two ring junction carbons of the perhydroindole ring.", 
    "105": "Experience gained with the use of captopril has been summarized in 5 patients with sclerodermic renal crisis (true sclerodermic kidney) as well as the results of the double blind clinical trial of captopril in 16 patients with Raynaud's syndrome. Captopril given for a long time in the dose 75-150 mg to the patients with true sclerodermic kidney turned out effective which showed up by a decline and stabilization of arterial pressure, decrease of the intensity of azotemia and headaches, and stabilization of renal function. No convincing data have been obtained, that may confirm a beneficial effect of captopril on Raynaud's syndrome. The drug was applied in a dose of 37.5 mg for 2 weeks.", 
    "106": "The chronic oral administration of 0.07 mg digitoxin o.d. for up to 58 days to 12 healthy volunteers caused a small drop in mean heart rate HR (95% CI: -7.9 to -1.6 beats.min-1), in mean diastolic blood pressure (95% CI: -8.3 to -0.4 mmHg), shortening of the QTc-interval (95% CI: -42 to -19 ms), shortening of the HR-corrected pre-ejection period PEPc (95% CI: -16 to -1 ms) and electromechanical systole QS2c (95% CI: -25 to -1 ms), and an increase in the impedance cardiographic Heather index (dZ/dtmax/RZ, 95% CI: 0.3 to 4.3) relative to the baseline measurements before digitalisation. The concomitant administration of 25 mg oral captopril b.d. did not significantly alter these responses relative to the concomitant double-blind administration of placebo, nor did it alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of plasma digitoxin at steady state. Thus, no relevant change in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of chronically administered digitoxin were induced by concomitant treatment with captopril.", 
    "107": "Two randomised, double-blind, cross-over studies in healthy volunteers given captopril 50 mg b.d. (n = 37; Study I) or enalapril 20 mg o.d. (n = 40; Study 2) and placebo for 2 weeks have been done to examine general well-being. Subjective experiences were evaluated using the standardised, Minor Symptoms Evaluation-profile (MSEP), which was completed during Run-in and on Days 1, 4, 7 and 14 in the morning. In comparison to placebo and the Run-in period, neither captopril nor enalapril affected the MSEP dimensions of Vitality, Contentment and Sleep. Captopril treatment was also assessed by applying the Quality of Life Clinical Questionnaire during Run-in and on Days 7 and 14. No improvement in the quality of life was demonstrated during treatment in comparison with the placebo or the Run-in period. Thus, no mood elevating effect of the ACE-inhibitors captopril and enalapril was demonstrated in healthy volunteers. Cough, which is believed to be a common adverse effect of ACE-inhibitors, was no more frequent during the treatment with captopril or enalapril than with placebo. It is concluded, that short-term treatment with captopril or enalapril is not perceived differently by healthy volunteers than placebo or no treatment at all. Furthermore, the cough associated with ACE-inhibition may be dependent on the duration of treatment, and two weeks was apparently too short for it to emerge.", 
    "108": "Altogether 16 patients with arterial hypertension (AH) were examined. Of these, 11 were with stenosis of renal arteries, 4 had essential hypertension (EH) and I with nephrogenous parenchymatous AH. To estimate the influence of captopril on the total and separate renal function in patients with and without stenosis of renal arteries and the possibility of the use of the given pharmacological test in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH), all the patients underwent renal scintigraphy with 99Tc-DTPA on admission to the hospital and 1-7 days after a single intake of 25 mg captopril per os. Later on in the operated patients the results of the test were compared with the hypotensive effect of the surgery. The rate of glomerular filtration (RGF) was measured according to the Gates method. In patients with stenosis of renal arteries and EH, the total filtration renal function remained unchanged after the intake of a single dose of captopril. In patients with stenosis of renal arteries, there was a significant decrease of the RGF on the side of stenosis made for by an insignificant elevation of the RGF in the contralateral kidney, which was accompanied by an increase of asymmetry of the renograms. In patients with no hypotensive effect of the surgery, the test with captopril was negative, which supports the possibility of this test application in the diagnosis of RVH.", 
    "109": "The purpose of the study was to explore the dynamics of the concentration of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) in response to changes in arterial pressure including those induced by hypertonic crisis, 7-day hypotensive monotherapy with the drugs having different action mode, and the acute test with the basic hypotensive drugs. 75 patients suffering from arterial hypertension were entered into the study. Measurements of the concentration of ANH in blood plasma were performed by radioimmunoassay with the aid of the kits manufactured by the Amersham Company (Great Britain). The activity of renin and aldosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay according to the standard technique. A strong positive correlation was revealed between the concentration of ANH and the level of both systolic and diastolic AP. A significant rise of the concentration of ANH elicited by hypertonic crisis reflects the growth of the tension of the depressor mechanisms by which AP is regulated. The lack of significant changes in the level of ANH during the acute pharmacological tests and effective continuous treatment with the hypotensive drugs attests to the existence of the complex mechanisms that regulate ANH secretion, determined not only by the level of AP.", 
    "110": "In a 21-year-old Caucasian women with von Hippel-Lindau disease, norepinephrine-producing adrenal pheochromocytoma was identified as the underlying cause of severe hypertension. She was found to have extremely elevated levels of circulating renin and aldosterone, and she was markedly hypokalemic. Administration of captopril further enhanced renin secretion, while her blood pressure improved. The patient became normokalemic following tumor removal, and her blood pressure decreased to normal levels with reestablishment of normal circadian blood pressure rhythm. This case demonstrates that, in the absence of renovascular or malignant hypertension, pheochromocytoma can be the underlying cause for the clinical syndrome of hypertension associated with severe hypokalemia and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism.", 
    "111": "Hyperlipidemic Imai rats spontaneously develop hypercholesterolemia, proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. We investigated the effect of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on spontaneous hypercholesterolemia and the progressive renal injury in this rat strain. Male Imai rats (n = 7) were treated with enalapril at a dose of 50 mg/l in drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age. Body weight, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion and serum constituents were checked and compared with untreated controls (n = 5) up to 38 weeks of age. Enalapril treatment significantly reduced hypercholesterolemia (247 +/- 41 vs. 102 +/- 13 mg/dl, p < 0.01, at 38 weeks) and proteinuria (766 +/- 290 vs. 206 +/- 119 mg/kg/day, p < 0.01, at 38 weeks). The glomerulosclerosis index (SI) was significantly higher in untreated control rats than in the enalapril-treated group (227 +/- 57 vs. 27 +/- 9, p < 0.01). Although we could not clarify whether hypercholesterolemia is a primary event or secondary to the nephrotic syndrome, these results indicate that the ACE inhibitor has the property to protect remnant glomeruli from glomerulosclerosis in male Imai rats as well as in other animal models in which focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis is believed to represent a common pathologic pattern. This rat strain represents a unique model of a spontaneous proteinuria which can provide an important information on the pathogenesis of human focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "112": "Circadian blood pressure (BP) variation were studied in patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) and primary aldosteronism (PA). Ambulatory BP (ABP) was monitored every 5 min for 24 hrs in a ward setting in 23 patients with PA and 17 patients with RVH (13 patients with unilateral renal arterial stenosis and 4 with bilateral stenosis). In patients with RVH, ABP was monitored before and after treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was high before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in almost all patients with RVH and low in those with PA. Ordinary circadian BP variation, i.e. nocturnal fall and diurnal rise in BP, was confirmed in the patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty successfully normalized both BP and PRA in those with RVH. Normal circadian BP variation was observed in those with RVH before the treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as well as during treatment with the former and after treatment with the latter. Circadian BP variation in the patients with RVH was affected by the pathogenesis of renal artery stenosis alone, i.e, fibromuscular hyperplasia and atherosclerosis; with fibromuscular hyperplasia normal circadian BP variation was observed, while with atherosclerosis, nocturnal BP fall was restricted or eliminated. Circadian BP variation in those with PA before and after excision of adrenal adenoma was essentially similar to that in normal subjects and essential hypertensive patients. From these it seems that in patients with RVH or PA, circadian BP variation is not affected by hypertension per se or by pathogenesis of hypertension.", 
    "113": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used increasingly to treat cardiovascular diseases, and so, therefore, the number of patients scheduled for surgery and treated preoperatively with these drugs. Haemodynamic instability has sometimes been observed during anaesthesia in these patients, leading some authors to discontinue ACEI administration before anaesthesia. However, recent physiological data concerning the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and ACEI pharmacological data may increase our understanding of the mechanisms of cardiovascular interaction between ACEI and anaesthesia. The RAS is involved in blood pressure regulation when extracellular fluid volume is decreased and in case of hypovolaemia, by inducing vasoconstriction and longterm volume regulation. Arterial vasoconstriction is the target for ACEI. However, venoconstriction may maintain venous return and cardiac output in spite of reduced blood volume. On the other hand, ACEI treatment impedes cardiac adaptation to acute changes in extracellular fluid volume. This effect may be increased by underlying pathology (especially in hypertension) as well as by anaesthesia. A combination of an increased sensitivity to acute changes in ventricular load due to treatment with ACEI and anaesthesia in hypertensive patients or in patients with cardiac failure may carry a high risk of hypotension. Specific studies on haemodynamic tolerance of anaesthesia in patients chronically treated with ACEI are required to assess the prevalence of this risk and how to manage it.", 
    "114": "In a longitudinal study comprising a total of 18 patients, the paradoxical time course of hANP plasma levels, i.e. the reproducibility of the low levels previously reported in cases of extreme cardiac insufficiency after administration of amiodarone, was investigated over a period of 9 months. At the same time, the effect of the degree of cardiac insufficiency and arrhythmia on the secretion of hANP was observed. The patients had been admitted to hospital because of the diagnoses \"cardiac insufficiency secondary to cardiomyopathy\" or \"Grade IVb arrhythmia according to Lown's classification\". During in-patient treatment, antiarrhythmic therapy was commenced in all patients. Clinical examinations and determinations of humoral parameters during therapy showed a substantial number of patients, who exhibited no increase in hANP levels despite massive cardiac decompensation. As far as drug therapy of patients with severe arrhythmias secondary to congestive (dilated) cardiomyopathy is concerned, amiodarone has proved to be the drug of choice in combination with digitalis, ACE inhibitors and diuretics. There is a close correlation between the degree of cardiac insufficiency and plasma hANP levels.", 
    "115": "During the past years, several large trials (Consensus, VHEFT I and II, SOLVD) have shown a significant reduction of mortality in patients with moderate and severe heart failure. However, despite effective treatment with vasodilators, digitalis and diuretics mortality in these patients remains unacceptable high. It seems logic, to state treatment at an earlier stage of the disease to achieve more benefit. The main early pathophysiological disturbance is left ventricular hypertrophy, resulting from hypertension, coronary artery disease, increasing age and obesity. On the long run, LVH may lead to diastolic and systolic heart failure, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias and sudden death. With ACE-inhibitors LVH can be reduced within 1 month of treatment. The large SAVE- and SOLVD-prevention trials will show, whether this early intervention will improve proposis in patients with asymptomatic heart failure.", 
    "116": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is generally defined as a systolic pressure of 160 mmHg or more, with a diastolic pressure cut-off point below 95 mmHg in some studies and 90 mmHg in others. Its prevalence and incidence vary from 3 to 30% depending on the definition applied, methodology of measurement, as well as the population and the age and sex of the patients. Mechanisms that could lead to the development of isolated systolic hypertension are discussed, especially the role of atherosclerosis and sodium intake. Comparing results from different countries, the Intersalt study showed that the age related rise in systolic pressure was positively related to the mean sodium excretion in that country. A post-hoc analysis of data from 4 Belgian groups could not show such a correlation within our country. The risks of systolic hypertension on mortality and morbidity in the elderly are considered. The need for further studies to quantify the risk and to establish the effect of treatment is emphasized. Three such studies in patients above the age of 60 years with ISH were started. The studies are double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and the main purpose is to examine the influence of treatment on morbidity, mortality, and general well-being. In the American SHEP study the patients of the actively treated group received a diuretic and possibly a beta-blocker or reserpine. The results indicate a significant reduction in non fatal stroke, heart failure and myocardial infarction without a significant reduction in fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular or all cause mortality. Studies in other continents are still in progress, such as the Syst-Chin in China and the Syst-Eur trial in Europe. They may indicate whether the results obtained in the U.S.A. can be extrapolated to other continents and whether the use of other drugs without metabolic disturbances, such as calcium entry blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, produce a similar reduction in events. Additional studies are needed to establish the effect of reducing salt intake in younger age groups on the prevalence of ISH and of the related morbidity and mortality.", 
    "117": "The balance between prostaglandin (PG)I2, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation mainly produced by endothelial cells, and thromboxane (TX)A2, a vasoconstrictor and inducer of platelet aggregation and adhesion synthesized predominantly by platelets, seems to be relevant for the regulation of vessel tone and platelet aggregation. PGE2 has vasodilating properties, too. Thus, substances affecting the biosynthesis of PG and TX may have prophylactic and therapeutic, but also detrimental effects with regard to hypertension and atherosclerosis. A mechanism of action which is related to the PG system is discussed for a number of antihypertensive agents, e.g. propranolol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, furosemide and cicletanine. The vasoprotective effect of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by acetylsalicylic acid is well known. Calcium antagonists, dipyridamole, estradiol, aprotinin and interferon have also been reported to possibly exert beneficial effects on PG/TX levels, while cyclosporin A and streptokinase have shown undesirable interactions with the PG system.", 
    "118": "To ascertain the contribution of systemic hypertension in the progression of renal failure, we have studied the effects of pharmacological treatment of hypertension in rats with the remnant kidney model of renal insufficiency, streptozotocin diabetes, or nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril lowered systemic blood pressure in the remnant kidney and diabetic animals, but did not lower blood pressure in rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Proteinuria was reduced in all three models, and creatinine clearance improved in the remnant kidney and diabetic animals, when compared with untreated controls. In the remnant kidney and diabetic models systemic blood pressure was lowered to a similar degree by treatments with a calcium blocker, with no improvement in either proteinuria, or glomerular filtration rate. Further studies of the long-term effects of enalapril have been undertaken in rats with the two kidney one clip model of hypertension. Rats treated with enalapril had a lower blood pressure and improved survival over one year of treatment, compared with untreated rats. After 1 year of treatment however the clipped kidney was small and fibrotic, and non functional. Following withdrawal of enalapril therapy there was no functional improvement of the clipped kidney. The possibility that ACE inhibitors have a specific intra-renal effect reducing the rate of progression of renal disease now needs confirmation in human studies. In renovascular hypertension however, intra-renal changes induced by ACE inhibitors may cause irreversible renal damage.", 
    "119": "1. Perindopril (4 mg) was compared with atenolol (50 mg), captopril (25 mg b.d.) or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride 5 mg) in three studies involving a total of 503 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-125 mmHg. 2. A 4 week single-blind placebo period preceded 12 weeks of active treatment. Dose titration was at weeks 4 and 8 if supine DBP greater than 90 mmHg. The dose was doubled and if necessary a diuretic was added in the atenolol or captopril comparisons, and atenolol was added in the diuretic study. 3. The fall in supine blood pressure (BP) was 27/17 mmHg with perindopril and 21/16 mmHg for atenolol. Monotherapy controlled 55% of patients on perindopril and 48% on atenolol, increasing to 78% and 58% with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Captopril caused a BP fall of 19/12 mmHg compared with 27/18 mmHg for perindopril, with 49% of both groups being controlled on monotherapy. 4. Diuretic addition produced a greater antihypertensive effect with perindopril (75%) compared with 57% for captopril in achieving control. Perindopril caused a comparable fall in supine BP to the diuretic combination 27/19 mmHg and 31/18 mmHg, but the fall in erect systolic BP was significantly greater for the diuretic. At 3 months, 85% of the diuretic group and 78% of the perindopril group achieved the target BP. 5. A multicentre trial of 856 patients treated with perindopril (690 patients treated for 1 year or more) has shown that BP control is maintained in the long term with a low incidence of side-effects (7.9%) causing withdrawal from treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "120": "1. Perindopril's effectiveness in mild to moderate hypertension was evaluated in three studies. 2. Perindopril was more effective than sodium restriction in reducing blood pressure, and the effects were additive. 3. Perindopril was as effective as atenolol in reducing blood pressure, and was well tolerated. 4. Perindopril lowered blood pressure to the same extent as enalapril at peak drug levels but had a greater effect at the trough level of the drugs. 5. Perindopril is an effective antihypertensive agent with an acceptable side-effect profile in people with hypertension.", 
    "121": "1. Potential differences among ACE inhibitors include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. The presence of a sulfhydryl group conferring antioxidant properties, the administration as a pro-drug to delay the onset and prolong the duration of haemodynamic effects, and the route of elimination are examples of possible differences. 2. Adverse effects of ACE inhibitors may be mediated by effects on bradykinin metabolism at tissue sites, which may be separable from haemodynamic responses mediated largely by angiotensin II withdrawal. 3. Clinically important differences between ACE inhibitors in their adverse event profile have yet to be proven. Evidence is emerging that plasma ACE inhibition and haemodynamic responses are separable, and this may indicate the potential for other organ-specific effects to differ among ACE inhibitors. 4. At present, however, the greatest distinguishing features for one compound vs another are the time to onset and the duration of action, which determine the frequency of administration.", 
    "122": "1. Arterial remodelling is an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of hypertension and its complications, being involved in the decrease of vascular reserve, the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and the development of atherosclerosis. There is now evidence that, in addition to several other growth factors, vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin II may act as vascular smooth muscle growth-promoting substances. Based on these data, the effects of perindopril, a potent and long-lasting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on structural and mechanical properties of the arterial wall have been studied in animal models of hypertension. Perindopril completely reversed the aortic medial hypertrophy and arterial stiffening observed in renovascular hypertensive rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effect of perindopril was consistent with the potent inhibition of vascular ACE, and emphasized the potential role of angiotensin II as a vascular growth modulator. Whether the time constant of remodelling is similar or not in the heart and large vessels remains an important question that requires further investigation.", 
    "123": "1. Large artery dilatation may be produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in hypertensive subjects independently of blood pressure reduction. The resulting increase in arterial compliance may be due to both blood pressure reduction and to arterial smooth muscle relaxation. 2. In healthy volunteers and in hypertensive subjects, dosages producing large artery dilatation seem to be even higher than those causing arteriole dilatation with the resulting blood pressure reduction. 3. It may be important to consider such findings for the remodelling of the cardiovascular system produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "124": "1. It has been suggested that hypertension may be an important determinant of the rate of progression of diabetic microangiopathy. 2. Renal microvascular disease as assessed by urinary albumin excretion and glomerular ultrastructure was evaluated in a model in which streptozotocin diabetes was induced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 3. Diabetes was associated with increases in urinary albumin excretion, and hypertension resulted in a further increase in albuminuria. 4. Various antihypertensive regimens were administered to diabetic SHR, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and triple therapy (hydralazine, reserpine and hydrochlorothiazide) being more effective than the calcium antagonist (lacidipine) in retarding the increase in albuminuria in diabetic SHR. 5. Antihypertensive therapy appears to ameliorate the development of diabetic renal disease.", 
    "125": "1. Certain genes drive the blood pressure of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to stable hypertensive levels in adulthood. 2. Relatively brief blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in young SHR can reset the track of SHR pressure to a lower level for the life of the animal. This effect appears to be a characteristic of the SHR strain. 3. It is proposed that the expression of a particular SHR hypertensive gene depends on angiotensin and is limited to young animals. This hypothesis explains some of the phenotypic abnormalities observed in young SHR and the decremental long-term blood pressure effects following ACE inhibitor treatment. 4. The identity of the gene is unclear, but information from biochemical, physiological and pharmacological studies may direct attention to distinct candidate genes within specific chromosomal regions of interest. 5. Understanding these genetic mechanisms may have important implications for future preventive strategies.", 
    "126": "1. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on the development of atheroma in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. 2. The normal human carotid artery, like most large human arteries, has a preformed diffuse intimal thickening. To model this thickening, the right carotid artery of the 12-week-old rabbit had an expanded balloon catheter passed down it to remove the endothelium and partially damage the media. 3. Fourteen weeks after this operation, a myointimal thickening similar in almost all respects to the human intimal thickening had developed. The rabbits were then divided into six groups of six rabbits fed on: (i) a 1% cholesterol diet; (ii) a 1% cholesterol diet plus a hypotensive dose of perindopril (0.3 mg/kg per day); (iii) a 1% cholesterol diet plus a non-hypotensive dose of perindopril (0.01 mg/kg per day); (iv) a normal diet; (v) a normal diet plus a hypotensive dose of perindopril (0.3 mg/kg per day); and (vi) a normal diet plus a non-hypotensive dose of perindopril (0.01 mg/kg per day). 4. After 6 weeks of treatment the animals were sacrificed. There were ameliorating effects of both hypotensive and non-hypotensive doses of perindopril on the development of plaques, as determined by the area of intima covered by Oil Red-O-staining plaque and light microscopy. 5. Cell culture studies indicated that perindopril has no effect on smooth muscle proliferation, but increases collagen and non-collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells and decreases their binding of the atherogenic lipoprotein beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "127": "Common carotid blood flow and cold pressor test were evaluated in 16 patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after 30 days treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor Enalapril (20 mg). Enalapril decreased blood pressure and carotid vascular resistance with no significant change in heart rate. After treatment, despite a wide range of the responses, the changes in systolic blood pressure to cold test were significantly attenuated, whereas the heart rate responses were not. Acute random and double blind administration of either Cadralazine or Nitrendipine, two vasodilating drugs which are known to cause an activation of the autonomic nervous system, were performed before and after long term treatment by Enalapril. Whereas the blood pressure and heart rate responses to cold test was unmodified by these compounds before Enalapril treatment, significant changes were observed after converting enzyme inhibition: Cadralazine reduced the heart rate response whereas Nitrendipine increased it significantly. The study provides evidence that converting enzyme inhibition causes sympatho-inhibitory influences which are principally observed in stress conditions, with heterogeneous responses depending on the nature and the type of stimulation.", 
    "128": "Technetium-99m DTPA renograms were performed before and after angioplasty in a 63-year-old man with bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), hypertension, and renal insufficiency. Decreased isotope uptake after captopril by the right kidney assisted in the selection of the right renal artery for angioplasty. Post-angioplasty improvement in both blood pressure control and renal function was accompanied by an absence of effect of captopril on the isotope uptake by the right kidney. In bilateral RAS, the captopril renogram is a useful tool for selecting the site for angioplasty, for assessing the adequacy of the procedure, and for long-term follow-up.", 
    "129": "First-dose-response of captopril 1 x 25 mg (no prodrug) and ramipril 1 x 2.5 mg (prodrug) were compared in two groups of 17 patients with moderate or severe hypertension and stimulated renin-angiotensin system (because of continuous diuretic therapy) by means of 24-h blood-pressure measurement at the 1st and 7th day of therapy. In the ramipril-group the antihypertensive effect started after 2 h, had its maximum (mean: -13/-8 mmHg) after 4 h and remained unchanged for 8 h. The antihypertensive effect was significant for 24 h. There was a slightly but not significant improved blood-pressure reduction at the 7th day compared to the 1st. The captopril-group showed a fast and marked decrease of blood pressure within the first hour, and reached its maximum (mean: -18/-10 mmHg) after 2 h. After 7 h there was no antihypertensive effect detectable. At the 7th day blood-pressure reduction was less pronounced compared to the 1st day. The results show that initial decrease of blood pressure in risk-patients is less severe with prodrug-ACE-inhibitors with slow onset of action so that counterregulation can be activated and prevent severe, fast, ACE-inhibitor-induced hypotension. 24-h-blood-pressure measurement is a sufficient method to evaluate first-dose-response of ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "130": "Based on the concept of glucocorticoid-receptor induction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), approaches to inhibiting enzyme induction with drugs that suppress the function of type II cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors, (genuine glucocorticoid receptors), are suggested. Three types of inhibiting the function of type II glucocorticoid receptors by drugs were distinguished. Type I is characterized by competition of the drugs with natural and synthetic glucocorticoids for interaction with glucocorticoid receptors (cortexolone, progesterone); type II is determined by irreversible inactivation of type II glucocorticoid receptors (aminazine, tisercin); type III is related to an increase of interaction of transcorticoid receptors with natural glucocorticoids which is accompanied by a reduction of the interaction of natural glucocorticoids with genuine glucocorticoid receptors (analgin, amidopyrine). It has been established that the drugs that provoke irreversible inactivation of the function of type II glucocorticoid receptors decrease ACE activity in blood plasma and in the lungs, that may serve the main reason for their high hypotensive effect in arterial hypertension. A concept is advanced, providing evidence for the use of the classical ACE inhibitors and of type II glucocorticoid receptor inhibitors.", 
    "131": "The goal of an antihypertensive treatment is to prevent \"end-organ\" damage. Cerebral vascular complications are among the most important because they are life threatening and can occur even at an early stage of the disease. Recently, it has been shown that cilazapril can decrease the mortality of stroke-prone rats, suggesting a decrease in the incidence of strokes, which occur spontaneously in these animals. The present article reviews the different functional and morphological changes that may explain the cerebral protective effects of cilazapril, such as the normalization of cerebral vascular reserve, decrease in the media, increase in the external diameter, and normalization of the mechanics and endothelial function of cerebral arterioles. In addition, the inhibition by cilazapril of injury-induced proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the infiltration of the endothelium by macrophages could prevent the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "132": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is mainly involved in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and fluid balance. One of the main stimuli for the secretion of renin present in the renal juxtamedullary cells, but also in some other tissues, is provided by the sympathetic nervous system via the action of norepinephrine on beta 1-adrenoceptors. There is good evidence in animal experiments that angiotensin II (Ang II) facilitates sympathetic neurotransmission by several mechanisms, all of which seem to involve distinct, but perhaps heterogeneous, Ang II receptors. Acting within the central nervous system, angiotensin augments sympathetic nerve outflow directly, but probably also by inhibiting the reflex decrease in sympathetic nerve activity following an increase in arterial pressure. Ang II also stimulates adrenomedullary and ganglionic transmission as well as enhances the release of sympathetic transmitter by a presynaptic action. In addition, there is some evidence that angiotensin can inhibit norepinephrine reuptake and augment its biosynthesis and responses mediated via both extrasynaptic alpha 2- and intrasynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly when the endogenous renin-angiotensin activity is high, attenuate sympathetic neurotransmission. Despite a clear demonstration that the renin-angiotensin system augments the activity of the sympathetic nervous system in animals, evidence for such a role in humans is tenuous. This is probably mainly due to the difficulty in quantitatively monitoring and assessing the autonomic function in humans. It is possible that in congestive heart failure, where the renin-angiotensin system can be highly activated, sympathetic facilitation by angiotensin as well as its attenuation by converting enzyme inhibitors may be important.", 
    "133": "In these studies, we have investigated possible cognition-enhancing effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, and putative neurochemical correlates for these actions. In a mouse habituation model, ACE inhibitors improved basal performance and antagonized scopolamine-induced deficits. The performance of aged mice and those with lesions of the nucleus basalis was also improved. ACE inhibition also improved scopolamine-impaired performance of rats in a swim-maze model. Neurochemical studies showed that a low dose (10 micrograms/kg i.p.) of ceranapril caused significant alterations in ex vivo rat brain catecholamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and septum. In further studies, angiotensin II (Ang II) was shown to decrease potassium-stimulated [3H] acetylcholine release from slices of rat entorhinal and human temporal cortex, an effect that could be antagonized by the angiotensin receptor antagonist [1-sar,8-thr]Ang II. It is concluded that ACE inhibition can improve both basal and impaired performance in animal models of learning, and that this improvement may be in part a consequence of the removal by ACE inhibition of an inhibitory tone on central acetylcholine release, and/or an effect on central catecholaminergic function.", 
    "134": "Treatment of hypertension by conventional antihypertensive medications usually has no significant effect on renal function in patients with essential hypertension and normal glomerular filtration rate. In this condition, new agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) also do not appear to modify renal function. Reduction of arterial pressure is crucial for renal protection in patients with chronic renal disease and the effect of the new agents on the progression of renal failure remains unknown despite some promising reports. In patients with renovascular hypertension, mainly those with bilateral stenosis or stenosis of a solitary kidney, the use of ACE inhibitors may be associated with reversible renal deterioration, particularly in subjects with already impaired renal function and receiving diuretics. In this situation, reduction in arterial pressure by CCBs does not appear to lead to renal deterioration.", 
    "135": "Renal prostaglandins (PGs) help maintain renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate when the kidney is exposed to a vasoconstrictor stress. In addition, they aid pressure natriuresis and blunt the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could decrease renal PG synthesis by reducing angiotensin II (Ang II) formation or increase it by preventing kinin inactivation. Additionally, they could affect PG synthesis or catabolism directly. The effects of ACE inhibitors on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics appear to be largely independent of changes in renal PG synthesis. Similarly, there is no evidence that pressure natriuresis is modified by ACE inhibitors. A kinin induced increase in collecting duct PG synthesis may account for the water diuresis seen clinically with ACE inhibitors. A possible beneficial interaction between thromboxane synthesis inhibitors and ACE inhibitors may exist. Thromboxane synthetase inhibitors can reduce renal vascular resistance by redirecting PG endoperoxide synthesis toward prostacyclin. This effect may be offset by a prostaglandin-induced increase in renin release and Ang II formation. ACE inhibitors, by preventing Ang II synthesis, may increase the vasodilation due to thromboxane synthesis inhibition.", 
    "136": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are strongly associated conditions from epidemiologic, genetic, and pathophysiologic points of view. The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients with diabetes, and, conversely, many patients with essential hypertension are glucose intolerant. Proteinuria appears in 40-50% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 20-30% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Progressive renal failure occurs in 30-40 and 3-8% of patients, respectively, hypertension being a leading factor in its rate of progression. In various animal experiments, ACE inhibitors are able to prevent proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, presumably by lowering transglomerular capillary pressure. In the diabetic human, ACE inhibitors are powerful antihypertensive drugs, devoid of metabolic side effects. Clinical studies indicate that ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and possibly slow the rate of decline in renal function. Such an effect is not observed with beta-blockers. Large-scale studies are needed to confirm this very important hypothesis.", 
    "137": "The mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease is as yet unknown. A meta-analysis of studies on the effects of ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal hemodynamics in nondiabetic renal disease revealed that ACE inhibitors lower proteinuria more than other antihypertensives. Moreover, a close correlation (p less than 0.01) between changes in urinary protein loss and in filtration fraction was found, whereas such a correlation could not be detected between changes in proteinuria and in blood pressure. This suggests that, at least in nondiabetic renal disease, the fall in proteinuria during ACE inhibition is the consequence of the intrarenal effect of the drug more than the systemic effect. Data on the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in diabetic microalbuminuria and in diabetic overt proteinuria are less consistent. A fall in proteinuria on antihypertensive drugs in these patients can be observed also without a significant fall in blood pressure, and without any change in filtration fraction. We therefore conclude that one should be cautious in extrapolating the data from studies in diabetic renal disease to patients with nondiabetic nephropathies. Moreover, we argue also that nonhemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors also could be involved in the antiproteinuric effect of these drugs.", 
    "138": "In 13 normotensive subjects on a normal sodium diet, we studied renal vascular, blood pressure, and hormonal changes induced by infusion of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) (5 ng/kg/min) during baseline conditions and after 5 days of cilazapril administration. In both conditions, Ang II elicited a slight pressor response accompanied by renal hemodynamic and hormonal changes that were similar. This suggests that hourly changes in Ang II concentrations and/or in Ang II receptor density after short-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril does not significantly affect renal vascular reactivity. In addition, these results also indirectly suggest that most of the renal effects of ACE inhibition are mediated through suppression of Ang II formation.", 
    "139": "Roughly 40% of all diabetics, whether insulin dependent or not, develop persistent albuminuria, a decline in their glomerular filtration rate, and elevated blood pressure, i.e., diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world, accounting for over one-quarter of all end-stage renal disease. Systemic/glomerular hypertension plays a role in the initiation and progression of diabetic glomerulopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are superior to conventional antihypertensive drugs in preventing the development of glomerular lesions in insulin-treated streptozotocin diabetic rats. Lowering of glomerular hypertension may be the crucial factor involved. Human studies suggest that ACE inhibitors postpone the progression to clinical overt diabetic nephropathy in normotensive diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. ACE inhibitors combined with a diuretic reduce albuminuria and postpone renal insufficiency in hypertensive diabetics with overt nephropathy. No treatment modality other than antihypertensive treatment has yet been proven to be effective in protecting renal function in diabetic nephropathy. All previous reports dealing with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated a cumulative death rate between 50 and 77% 10 years after the onset of proteinuria. Effective antihypertensive treatment has reduced the cumulative death rate to 15-20% 10 years after the onset of nephropathy.", 
    "140": "PORTAPRES model 1 is a portable 24 h continuous noninvasive blood pressure recorder based on the same principles as FINAPRES, the volume-clamp method of Pe\u00f1az and the physiocal criteria of Wesseling. In addition, PORTAPRES measures two adjacent fingers in alternation every 30 min and automatically corrects hydrostatic effects due to height changes of the measured fingers. The device measures 255 x 210 x 60 mm and weights about 3,000 g, including a lithium battery pack and a TEAC cassette FM instrumentation tape recorder to record the finger pressure wave form, the height signal, and beat-to-beat derived systolic, mean and diastolic pressure as well as heart rate. It appears to be an excellent new tool for cardiovascular research in humans. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study the effect of oral administration of 2.5 mg cilazapril, a new potent long-acting, nonsulfhydryl-group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, given once daily for 7 days, was investigated in 16 healthy young men (mean age 25.3 +/- 1.6 years). Finger blood pressure and heart rate were measured with PORTAPRES for 24 h during everyday life and during standardized laboratory tasks, once about 1 to 2 h A.M. and once about 10 to 11 h P.M. once about 1 to 2 h A.M. and once about 10 to 11 h P.M. after drug administration. Physical activity was controlled by integrated thigh-EMG. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis it was shown that based on 64 s mean values, this measure of physical activity explains 34-77% of the heart rate variance within 24 h (median 53%), 10-52% (31%) of systolic, and 4-38% (25%) of diastolic blood pressure variance when up to 20 time lags of the EMG signal were introduced as possible predictors. This indicates that varying degrees of physical activity have a great impact on everyday blood pressure and heart rate. After one week cilazapril did not alter 24-h means of systolic and diastolic blood pressure or heart rate significantly, but reduced 30 min averages of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6-10 and 4-6 mm Hg between 1 1/2 and 4 or 6 h after drug administration respectively during everyday life (p = 0.0067-0.066) without changing heart rate. On adjusting cardiovascular variables for the effects of physical activity, this blood pressure reduction was confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "141": "In 11 subjects with mild hypertension (sitting arterial pressure of 146 +/- 5/97 +/- 2 mm Hg), the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (cilazapril, 5 mg p.o. once daily for 4 weeks) were studied at rest and during active standing by means of spectral analysis. Sympathetic vascular control was inferred from the power of the low-frequency (LF) component of the systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability, assessed noninvasively with a plethysmographic technique. Simultaneously, quantitative indices of neural control of the sinoatrial (SA) node were obtained with the power of the LF and of the high-frequency (respiration linked) component of R-R variability. Before treatment, active standing produced a clear increase in the LF components of R-R and SAP variabilities. At the end of the 4 weeks of cilazapril treatment, the LF component of SAP variability during standing was significantly lower than prior to treatment, while the increase in the LF component of R-R variability was left unchanged. These findings suggest an inhibitory effect of chronic ACE inhibition upon vasomotor sympathetic control, as assessed non-invasively by this technique.", 
    "142": "We investigated pressor sensitivity to infused phenylephrine (PE), 0.05 to 0.4 micrograms/kg/min, and angiotensin II (Ang II), 2.5 to 10 ng/kg/min, in 35 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, before and at the end of a 4-week treatment period with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day. Cilazapril lowered the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10.6/3.5 mm Hg, but had no effect on the dose-response curves of dose of PE or Ang II vs. the increase in systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure, or heart rate. There were also no significant effects of cilazapril on PD20 values, i.e., the dose of PE or Ang II required to increase mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 20 mm Hg, or on delta R-R/delta MAP (ratio of the increase of the ECG R-R interval to the increase in mean arterial blood pressure) as a measure of baroreflex sensitivity. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased by cilazapril therapy, but there were no changes in plasma concentrations of Ang II or atrial natriuretic factor. We conclude that cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor, does not alter alpha 1-adrenoceptor and Ang II receptor sensitivity to selective agonists, nor does it affect baroreflex sensitivity.", 
    "143": "This review mainly considers randomized studies where angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were compared with other antihypertensive drugs in terms of objectively assessed cognitive function, subjectively evaluated cognitive function, work performance, and general vitality. An overall assessment of the data suggests that ACE inhibitors may improve performance on tests of alertness but it is unlikely that they produce either deleterious or beneficial effects on memory. On the other hand, methyldopa interferes with cognitive function and work performance. Propranolol was also associated with impairment of activity and satisfaction at work. In subjective evaluation of cognitive function, two trials suggest an increased reporting of impairment with nifedipine but this has not yet been confirmed. Vitality was reduced on both methyldopa and propranolol. It is concluded that the ACE inhibitors, in common with atenolol and verapamil, do not appear to have any major effects on cognitive function in hypertensive patients.", 
    "144": "Anatomical changes of arteries and arterioles secondary to hypertension explain most of the late complications of this disease. Therefore, a series of experiments was performed to characterize the vascular protective effects of cilazapril in experimental hypertension. These experiments aimed to answer three types of questions: (a) In which vascular bed is cilazapril effective? (b) Are the vascular changes induced by cilazapril associated with functional effects? (c) Is the effect of cilazapril only preventive or can cilazapril also be effective when hypertension is already present? Our results show that cilazapril is acting on nearly every vascular bed. Its vascular morphological effects (decrease of vascular hypertrophy) are associated with functional changes such as improvements of coronary or cerebral vascular reserves. Cilazapril is active either as a preventive treatment or given when hypertension is already present.", 
    "145": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be effective therapy for hypertension, and also for severe congestive heart failure, whether due to hypertension or to other causes. The reduction in cardiac hypertrophy that follows the use of these drugs is undoubtedly due in part to their favorable hemodynamic effects of reducing peripheral resistance and inducing venodilation. The same factors reduce cardiac dilation and left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. The prevention of the hemodynamic effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) is probably the major factor in preventing end-organ damage, but there are some indications that Ang II may have an effect independent of blood pressure in promoting vascular hypertrophy. The separation of vasoconstrictor effects from any metabolic effects of Ang II is not easy, and final elucidation of the mechanisms involved is not yet available.", 
    "146": "The regulation of coronary hemodynamics is a complex process. One important factor that interferes with the regulation of coronary tone is the pathophysiological state of the vessels: stimuli that in normal vessels provoke no or only a slight vasoconstriction may cause a severe vasoconstriction in diseased vessels. This effect is related to the function of the endothelium and its ability to produce nitric oxide and prostaglandins. The presence of a local renin-angiotensin system implies the possibility of influencing the coronary flow via interference with this local system. Therefore, it is interesting to determine the effects of converting enzyme inhibitors on coronary flow. In animal experiments, a bradykinin-dependent coronary vasodilation by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is suggested. However, reports on the effect of converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with angina pectoris are not consistent. Some authors found an increase in coronary flow and others found no change or a decrease. The importance of the activation of the renin-angiotensin system is discussed. Moreover, it is shown that captopril reduces sympathetic-mediated coronary vasoconstriction during the cold pressor test and that captopril enhances the parasympathetic-mediated bradycardia during the diving response. In conclusion, the effects of converting enzyme inhibitors on coronary flow is an interesting but not fully understood topic. Therefore, the multifactorial mechanism of action of converting enzyme inhibitors deserves further investigation. There are probably subgroups of anginal patients who may benefit from converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. These subgroups have to be defined. Especially, the finding that a converting enzyme inhibitor reduces sympathetically induced coronary vasoconstriction seems promising.", 
    "147": "The effects of converting enzyme inhibition on coronary and systemic hemodynamics in the presence of a chronically activated renin-angiotensin system were investigated in five renovascular hypertensive patients with no ECG/echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Coronary blood flow (CBF, thermodilution technique), intra-arterial blood pressure, AVO2 difference (coronary sinus), heart rate, and coronary vascular resistance were measured at rest, during isometric exercise (handgrip to 50% of maximal effort for 3 min) before and 60 min after 2.5 mg of oral cilazapril. The drug induced a prompt, significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and a sustained increase in CBF. The performance of handgrip after cilazapril resulted in higher increases in CBF for a given increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. These observations suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) maintains the ability to alter the control mechanisms of CBF even under long-term conditions and that converting enzyme inhibition reverses the Ang II-induced effects on coronary hemodynamics.", 
    "148": "This study compared the effects of clinically prescribed doses of cilazapril, nifedipine, and atenolol on maximal exercise performance in physically active subjects. In a double-blind crossover trial, 10 healthy male volunteers performed progressive aerobic exercise to exhaustion for determination of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), after single dose ingestion of cilazapril, nifedipine, atenolol, and placebo. Measurements were made at exhaustion and at a single submaximal workload (250 W). Exercise time to exhaustion and peak workload were decreased by all agents (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo), but VO2 max was decreased by atenolol only (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). Although both atenolol and cilazapril decreased the maximum systolic blood pressure, the peak heart rate was decreased only by atenolol (p less than 0.001 vs. placebo). Whereas submaximal oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and blood lactate concentrations were not different between groups, ratings of perceived exertion were increased during submaximal exercise by atenolol and cilazapril (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). Cilazapril, nifedipine, and atenolol all impaired exercise performance and increased ratings of perceived exertion during submaximal exercise without altering rates of oxygen consumption or blood lactate accumulation. Maximal exercise performance was impaired to a greater extent by atenolol than by nifedipine or cilazapril. This study suggests that either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel antagonists might be preferable for the management of hypertension in athletic patients as they have a lesser effect on exercise performance, at least in healthy individuals.", 
    "149": "In both men and women left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major risk factor associated with the appearance of diastolic and/or systolic myocardial failure. It is not the growth of cardiac myocytes, however, that is responsible for an abnormal structural remodeling of the hypertrophied myocardium in pathologic LVH, but instead, nonmyocyte cells whose behavior and growth are altered by chronic elevations in circulating hormones. Hormone-mediated cardiac fibroblast proliferation and/or enhanced collagen synthesis, for example, account for myocardial fibrosis. The signals mediating nonmyocyte cell involvement in LVH may also involve locally generated hormones having paracrine properties. Herein we review experimental findings pertaining to the reparative and reactive fibrosis of the myocardium seen in various forms of acquired and genetic arterial hypertension, where circulating or tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems are respectively activated. These hormonal systems determine whether myocardial structure will be altered in arterial hypertension and, accordingly, if myocardial failure ensues. The mechanisms by which these hormones lead to myocardial fibrosis remain to be elucidated and correspondingly will determine if fibrosis can be effectively prevented. At the same time, experimental strategies that regress excess collagen in LVH have been identified, but need to be developed further to determine if myocardial failure, caused by fibrosis, is indeed reversible in humans.", 
    "150": "Possible cardioprotective effects are one of the most intriguing aspects of the expanding spectrum of clinical indications for the use of converting-enzyme inhibitors. Among them, the prevention of postinfarction ventricular remodeling--a deleterious process leading to eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and, eventually, to congestive heart failure--has attracted particular interest and attention. This communication examines the possible role of the endogenous cardiac renin-angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of ventricular remodeling. Although much of the evidence is indirect, there are several lines of investigation that strongly support the causative participation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system in ventricular remodeling.", 
    "151": "Hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy leads to myocytic hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and structural alterations of the coronary microcirculation. This structural remodeling of the myocardium results in an impairment of diastolic function of the left ventricle and of coronary flow reserve despite normal epicardial arteries. Consequently, an antihypertensive treatment should aim at (a) reversing myocytic hypertrophy, (b) regression of myocardial fibrosis, and (c) improvement of coronary flow reserve apart from blood pressure lowering. In recent years many clinical studies have shown that regression of hypertensive hypertrophy can be induced by long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, beta-receptor blockers, and antisympathonic drugs. However, vasodilators and diuretics, which stimulate adrenoceptor activity and increase angiotensin II levels, were found to be less effective in reversing LV hypertrophy. The trophic influence of catecholamines and angiotensin II on the myocardium counteracts the effect of systolic wall stress reduction due to blood pressure lowering. In respect of reversal of interstitial fibrosis, ACE inhibitors seem to be effective because the growth of fibroblasts was found to be stimulated by angiotensin II. Recently, clinical studies have confirmed previous experimental data that an improvement of the impaired coronary vasodilator reserve can be realized by long-term antihypertensive therapy. An antihypertensive treatment strategy which fully restores myocardial structure and completely repairs coronary microcirculation has to be considered as a causative treatment of hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "152": "Two models of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy in rats have been created and characterized: chronic myocardial infarction and pulmonary artery stenosis. A Millar ultraminiature catheter pressure transducer designed specifically for right heart catheterization was used for the measurement of RV function in closed-chest, anesthetized rats. Four weeks after coronary artery ligation, left ventricular (LV) function was depressed as evidenced by the reduction of LV systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximal rate of rise in LV pressure (LV dp/dtmax), cardiac output, and by the elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There was an increase in RVSP and an elevation in RV dp/dtmax as well as an increase in the RV weight/body weight ratio. Myocytes isolated from the RV 4 weeks after coronary artery ligation had a greater volume and cross-sectional area. In addition, 14 days after pulmonary artery stenosis, there also was an elevation in RVSP and in RV dp/dtmax. In this model, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril (1 mg/kg daily) was examined. The increase in RVSP from 35 +/- 2 to 61 +/- 4 mm Hg after pulmonary artery stenosis was not influenced by ramipril (63 +/- 4 mm Hg), neither was the elevation of RV weight. However, the increase in cell volume and cross-sectional area of myocytes isolated from the RV was less pronounced in the ramipril-treated group (+27% compared with +58% in untreated animals). Thus, ACE inhibition with ramipril altered the hypertrophic response at the cellular level.", 
    "153": "The first part of this article concerns the general relation between blood pressure lowering and cerebral blood flow. Factors known to affect cerebral blood flow are reviewed, and recent advances in the field of innervation of cerebral blood vessels are outlined. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of the phenomenon of autoregulation and how this is disturbed in patients with hypertension. Not all antihypertensive drugs exert the same action on the cerebral circulation to produce the same blood pressure-lowering effect. In addition, the actions exerted by common antihypertensive drugs on the cerebral circulation are described. The second part of the article provides a comparison between the effect of carvedilol and that of propranolol on blood pressure reduction and cerebral blood flow. In a double-blind, crossover study involving 14 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, carvedilol was shown to have no effect on cerebral blood flow, whereas there was a slight tendency for lower flows to occur with the use of propranolol. Because of the small sample size, statistical significance was not reached. These results are consistent with other recently published findings.", 
    "154": "Many factors, both local and systemic, are known to influence the caliber of peripheral vessels and regional blood flow. Methods of studying limb blood flow and its alteration by disease and drugs present considerable problems. We compared the effects of a series of antihypertensive drugs on limb blood flow and their functional effects in patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Results from studies with new antihypertensive drugs such as carvedilol are awaited.", 
    "155": "The influence of nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, metoprolol, and enalapril on the basal and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced elevation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) DNA was examined. Our results from four independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, are summarized by calculating the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the drugs. Nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem had IC50 values of 2.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(-6), 3.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6), and 6.6 +/- 2.8 x 10(-6) M, respectively. Metoprolol had an IC50 value of 49 +/- 16 x 10(-6) M, whereas enalapril was completely ineffective. All drugs used had no influence on the basal cell [3H]thymidine incorporation. This in vitro study allows one to conclude that the calcium-entry blockers can inhibit the Ang II-induced cell growth and thus may have beneficial effects on the development and regression of vascular growth, which is associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "156": "Enhanced platelet function and a decrease in fibrinolytic activity have been reported in patients with mild hypertension after treatment with various nonselective beta-blockers. Until now, such changes have not been reported during treatment with beta 1-selective drugs or with agents that have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics on platelet function and fibrinolytic activity has not been fully elucidated. Calcium antagonists of various types, however, are known to decrease platelet release in vivo whereas their effects on platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity are less clear. The new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist isradipine, when tested in a group of patients with mild hypertension, resulted in a decrease in platelet aggregation, a shortened euglobulin clot-lysis time, and a dramatic increase in t-PA (tissue-plasminogen activator) activity after 14 days of treatment. These changes remained stable throughout the 1-year study period. The fact that antihypertensive therapy does not always result in the hoped-for prolongation of life, despite satisfactory blood pressure reduction, may be in part due to an unfavorable impact on various components of the blood-clotting system.", 
    "157": "Hypothetically, certain ischemic and reperfusion arrhythmias may result from the activity of the calcium-dependent transient inward current. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindoprilat, on the transient inward current of guinea pig ventricular myocytes were studied. The transient inward current was evoked by superfusing the cell with a modified Tyrode's solution (5.4 mM CaCl2 and 0.54 mM KCl). Repetitive voltage clamp steps from a holding potential of -55 to +20 mV (1,000 ms, 0.1 Hz) were applied while dialyzing the cell internally. When administered simultaneously with the change over to the low K+ high Ca2+ solution, perindoprilat (1 microM) decreased the transient inward current from -9.55 +/- 0.31 to -3.24 +/- 0.24 microA/cm2 (p less than 0.05). A similar decrease was observed when perindoprilat was administered after first inducing the transient inward current. Perindoprilat also protected from the effects of norepinephrine (0.01 and 0.1 microM), which increased the amplitude of the transient inward current from -9.76 +/- 0.17 and -9.99 +/- 0.32 microA/cm2 at the end of the 15-min control period to -11.13 +/- 0.67 and -12.67 +/- 0.49 microA/cm2, respectively (p less than 0.05). The effects of perindoprilat were independent of angiotensin II, which in this preparation decreased the transient inward current. Based on our results, we conclude that perindoprilat decreases the transient inward current and prevents the action of norepinephrine on the transient inward current. The direct effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor observed on the transient inward current might explain why angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce calcium-dependent ouabain-induced or reperfusion arrhythmias.", 
    "158": "Syst-Eur is a multicenter placebo-controlled outcome trial designed by the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly to investigate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of stroke in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Eligible patients must be at least 60 years old and have a systolic blood pressure averaging 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg. The present paper is an interim report on the first 316 patients randomized into this trial. The placebo (n = 170) and active treatment (n = 146) groups were similar at randomization with respect to age (73 +/- 8 years; mean +/- SD), sitting blood pressure (178 +/- 12 mm Hg systolic; 85 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic), percentage of men (34%), and percentage of patients with cardiovascular complications (29%). After randomization blood pressure fell more (p less than 0.001) in patients on active treatment than in those in the placebo group (19 +/- 20 mm Hg systolic; 6 +/- 10 mm Hg diastolic vs. 7 +/- 19 and 1 +/- 10 mm Hg for sitting blood pressure). This first interim report on the Syst-Eur trial demonstrates that a multinational trial in elderly patients with ISH is feasible and that a significant blood pressure difference between the two treatment groups can be achieved and maintained. New centers are being recruited in order to randomize a total of 3,000 patients.", 
    "159": "Plasma and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities were measured in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after single or repeated oral (p.o.) treatment with a hypotensive dose (1 mg/kg) of quinapril and compared with those after administration of enalapril (1 mg/kg). The degree of ACE inhibition in response to quinapril varied in tissues; marked inhibition was observed in aorta, lung, and plasma by single treatment with quinapril, and inhibition in plasma and aorta caused by quinapril was more potent than that caused by enalapril. The prolonged ACE inhibition was observed in the aorta, a target organ, by repeated treatment with quinapril for 2 weeks. These results indicate that quinapril has a good pharmacokinetic profile, namely rapid absorption and easy penetration to the target organ. In addition, quinapril produced greater inhibition of cardiac ACE than did enalapril after either p.o. or intravenous (i.v.) administration, suggesting the beneficial effects of quinapril in treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF).", 
    "160": "Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid prodrug which, after oral administration, undergoes rapid hydrolysis to its active diacid, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinoprilat. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, fosinoprilat has a compensatory dual route of elimination and is cleared by the liver and kidneys. Thus, in patients with diminished renal function increased hepatic clearance of fosinoprilat is noted and, similarly, in patients with diminished hepatic function increased renal clearance seems to occur. Because of this compensatory elimination, fosinopril therapy for all patients can begin with the same recommended dosage. Fosinopril 10 to 40mg administered once daily is an effective antihypertensive regimen that has shown efficacy similar to that of enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day, propranolol 80 to 160 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day and sustained release nifedipine 40 mg/day in preliminary clinical trials. Generally, fosinopril is well tolerated and adverse events associated with the drug are usually mild and similar to those associated with other ACE inhibitors. Thus, fosinopril appears to be a useful alternative to certain 'established' agents used for treating patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "161": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on slow and fast twitch muscle contractile properties, nerve conduction and hypoxic resistance, and muscle and nerve capillary density were examined in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Prolongation of soleus contraction and relaxation were partially prevented by treatment (p less than 0.01). A 22% deficit in fast twitch extensor digitorum longus tetanic tension production was also ameliorated (p less than 0.01). Sciatic motor and sensory conduction velocity, 25% and 12% reduced by diabetes respectively, were 75% normalized by lisinopril (p less than 0.01). There was a 47% increase in resistance to hypoxic conduction block with diabetes (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril treatment resulted in normal hypoxic resistance. Capillarization of nerve and muscle was little affected by diabetes; however, there was a 17% increase in capillary density in sciatic nerve, and a 40% increase in extensor digitorum longus muscle with lisinopril (p less than 0.01). For soleus, a smaller treatment-induced increase in capillary density led to an elevated capillary/muscle fibre ratio (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that lisinopril promoted angiogenesis. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of preventive lisinopril treatment is likely to depend upon a reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and improvement of tissue blood flow, which implicates relative hypoxia as an important factor in the development of myopathy and neuropathy in experimental diabetes.", 
    "162": "Rapid endothelial cell migration and inhibition of thrombosis are critical for the resolution of denudation injuries to the vessel wall. Inhibition of the endothelial cell autocrine angiotensin system, with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or the angiotensin II receptor antagonist sar1, ile8-angiotensin II, leads to increased endothelial cell migration and urokinase-like plasminogen activator (u-PA) activity (Bell, L., and J. A. Madri. 1990. Am. J. Pathol. 137:7-12). Inhibition of the autocrine angiotensin system with the converting-enzyme inhibitor or the receptor antagonist also leads to increased expression of the proto-oncogene c-src: pp60c-src mRNA increased 7-11-fold, c-src protein 3-fold, and c-src kinase activity 2-3-fold. Endothelial cell expression of c-src was constitutively elevated after stable infection with a retroviral vector containing the c-src coding sequence. Constitutively increased c-src kinase activity reconstituted the increases in migration and u-PA observed with angiotensin system interruption. Antisera to bovine u-PA blocked the increase in migration associated with increased c-src expression. These data suggest that increases in endothelial cell migration and plasminogen activator after angiotensin system inhibition are at least partially pp60c-src mediated. Elevated c-src expression with angiotensin system inhibition may act to enhance intimal wound closure and to reduce luminal thrombogenicity in vivo.", 
    "163": "Oral pretreatment with aldosterone or corticosterone blocked the memory-enhancing effects of the calcium antagonist nimodipine, the ACE inhibitor captopril, the NMDA blocker CGP 37,849, and the glycine antagonist strychnine in a passive-avoidance test in mice. The memory-disturbing effects of phenobarbitone, diazepam, CGP 37,849 and scopolamine were not influenced by the hormonal pretreatment. These findings could indicate the involvement of a steroid-sensitive mechanism in drug-induced improvement of memory. In the light of clinical observations showing elevated cortisol levels in Alzheimer patients, the results might also explain why only a limited number of these patients respond to therapy with memory enhancers.", 
    "164": "Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass (LVM) is currently considered to be the most powerful risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, yielding prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, high blood pressure included. It has been considered logical to try to obtain regression of cardiac hypertrophy, even though the risk-reducing implications of such a measure remain to be fully established. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that some classes of antihypertensive compounds are less effective than others in causing reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in spite of being similarly efficacious in lowering blood pressure. In order to extract the maximum amount of information from clinical studies, a meta-analysis was performed. This analysis included 109 treatment studies, each conformed to strict present rules. Only studies with pharmacological antihypertensive therapy and echocardiographically determined LVM were included. An analysis of the effect of the four first-hand antihypertensive treatment principles, adjusted for differences between studies with ANCOVA, showed that the ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists all reduce LVM by reversing wall hypertrophy and that the effect is most pronounced with ACE inhibitors. Diuretics reduce LVM mainly by a reduction in left ventricular diameter. If the difference in ability to reverse LVH, between ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers/diuretics would correspond to a difference in prognosis, then the outcome of antihypertensive therapy might be expected to improve. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.", 
    "165": "In the present paper, the value of ambulatory blood pressure recordings is discussed. Such recordings can be very helpful in the management of high and low blood pressure. The fact that more readings are obtained and that they are made in normal life conditions are the strongest arguments in favour of those recordings. Whether ambulatory recordings predict long term prognosis better than office blood pressure is still open for discussion; the long term European study OvA should help clarifying this important question. Data coming from these techniques are especially useful when conflicting elements are present such as high pressure with no organ damage or blood pressure resistant to all drugs and side effects occurring with even minor doses of antihypertensive drugs. Short term episodes of high or low pressure are best documented with ambulatory blood pressure recordings and this holds particularly true in patients with arterial hypotension. Finally several research aspects can be approached by ambulatory recordings of pressure such as the study of pharmacokinetics of drugs and analysis of blood pressure variability.", 
    "166": "We performed renal function studies in dogs with chronic renovascular hypertension produced by complete occlusion of a renal artery. In addition, we evaluated in anesthetized dogs the acute effects of a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, CGS 16,617, on renal function and plasma neurohormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressin) 4 weeks after initiation of 2 kidney, 1 clip hypertension. CGS 16,617 effectively decreased blood pressure in renal hypertensive animals. This response was associated with suppression of angiotensin II indicating effective converting enzyme inhibition. In the non-clipped kidney, acute administration of CGS 16,617 increased effective renal plasma flow but not glomerular filtration rate and urinary sodium excretion. In the clipped kidney, CGS 16,617 caused no change in any parameter of renal function. Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and vasopressin were unaffected by administration of CGS 16,617. These studies showed that chronic occlusion of a renal artery does not result in renal infarction because of a compensatory increase in the amount of blood provided through capsular collateral vessels. The collateral circulation which has developed in the clipped kidney explains the lack of a converting enzyme inhibitor effect.", 
    "167": "A loss of the circadian rhythm pattern of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, as well as the development of hypertension have been found after heart transplantation (Htx). To study whether a return of this rhythm occurs in the long-term after Htx, we used 24-h ambulatory monitoring to study 62 patients 5 days to 6.5 years after Htx. Patients were divided into two groups (Group 1: less than 6 months after Htx (n = 30), Group 2: 6 months or more after Htx (n = 32)). Group 2 had a higher BP and heart rate, as well as a significantly higher difference between systolic day and systolic night BP than group 1. There was also a significantly higher difference in heart rate between day and night values in group 2. The return of the circadian rhythm pattern in the longer term after heart transplantation may result from partial reinnervation of the heart, although other neurohumoral factors or concomitant medication may play a role.", 
    "168": "To elucidate the mechanism underlying the sodium retention caused by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade in man, a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study has been made of the acute effects of bunazosin an alpha 1-antagonist, on urinary sodium excretion, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and the renin-aldosterone system in 7 healthy men. A single oral dose of bunazosin 2.0 mg caused a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in urinary sodium excretion after 0-2 h, 2-4 h, and 4-6 h. The mean values for plasma ANP, AVP, aldosterone, and cortisol concentrations at those times were similar after placebo and bunazosin, and plasma renin activity was significantly increased 2 and 4 h after bunazosin. Pretreatment with oral enalapril 10 mg, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, did not prevent the bunazosin-induced reduction in urinary sodium excretion. There was a significant positive correlation between the drug-induced changes in blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion. The results suggest that ANP, AVP, and renin-aldosterone may play little role in the sodium retention caused by acute alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade in man.", 
    "169": "To clarify the cardiovascular effects of central vasopressin (AVP), a chronic intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of AVP was performed in conscious Wistar normotensive rats. Animals were divided into 3 groups: 1) AVP 1 ng/hr (Low), 2) AVP 100 ng/hr (High), and 3) saline (control) ICV infusion. After a 6 day control period, AVP or saline was continuously infused into the lateral cerebroventricle at a rate of 1 microliter/hr using osmotic minipump for 7 days. As a result, a dose-related elevation of AVP concentration in CSF was achieved. Systolic blood pressure in both Low and High AVP infusion was slightly (7-12 mmHg) but significantly higher than that in control. ICV infusion of AVP did not alter urine volume, electrolytes excretion or osmolality, and AVP vascular antagonist injected intravenously failed to affect mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, plasma catecholamines and renin activity did not differ significantly among the groups. Thus, chronic ICV infusion of AVP induced the elevation of blood pressure, which is due to centrally mediated effect of AVP.", 
    "170": "The bolus ip. administration of a SRIF antagonist (SRIF-A) (60 nM/rat) significantly increased renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in rats, without affecting natremia, kalaemia and the blood levels of ACTH or corticosterone. SRIF-A also raised PAC in rats whose renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by combined captopril/angiotensin-II infusion and in which PRA was very low. The ip. injection of an equimolar dose of SRIF completely reversed these effects of SRIF-A, but the administration of SRIF alone did not affect either PRA or PAC. Taken together, these data would suggest that, in the rat, endogenous SRIF exerts, under basal conditions, a two-fold maximum tonic inhibitory effect on both renin release by kidneys and aldosterone secretion by zona glomerulosa cells.", 
    "171": "The cardinal hemodynamic disorder in established essential hypertension is increased total peripheral resistance. During exercise, the increase in stroke volume of the heart is abnormal. A 20-year follow-up study of the hemodynamics in essential hypertension demonstrated a progressive increase in total peripheral resistance and deterioration of the heart pump function. Long-term treatment with antihypertensive agents modifies the circulatory system in different ways. Vasodilators (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha 1-blockers, and calcium antagonists) all reduce total peripheral resistance, and in general, cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume remain unchanged. Calcium antagonists like verapamil and diltiazem reduce the heart rate approximately 10% during exercise, but since stroke volume increases, cardiac output is unchanged. Chronic treatment with conventional beta-blockers induces a permanent reduction in cardiac output and heart rate during exercise. In contrast, carvedilol--a beta 1,beta 2-blocker with alpha 1-blocking activity--prevents the immediate increase in total peripheral resistance during acute beta-blockade. In 19 patients followed by hemodynamic measurements over 6-9 months, blood pressure was well controlled by carvedilol. During exercise, total peripheral resistance decreased 6% (P less than 0.05), and the reductions in heart rate and cardiac index were less than on conventional beta-blockade. Echo-Doppler studies showed a significant reduction in the intraventricular septum of 13%.", 
    "172": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk indicator of cardiovascular disease. Obtaining reversal of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy seems to be a desirable objective of antihypertensive treatment. A total of 2,357 patients were included in a meta-analysis on the effect of antihypertensive pharmacological therapy on LVH. Overall left ventricular mass (LVM) was reduced by 11.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.1-13.7) in parallel with a reduction of mean arterial pressure of 14.9% (CI 14.0 to 15.8). When evaluating the effect of first-line therapies on calculated LVM using the same formula for all studies, the absolute reductions in g were 44.7 (ACE-inhibitors), 22.8 (beta-blockers), 26.9 (calcium antagonists) and 21.4 (diuretics) when adjusted for differences between studies (ANCOVA). It can be concluded that effective antihypertensive therapy reduces LVM. ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists reduce LVM by reducing wall hypertrophy, the effect of ACE-inhibitors being the most pronounced. Diuretics reduce LVM mainly through an effect on left ventricular inner diameter. How these effects affect prognosis is still an open question.", 
    "173": "To define the renal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in heart failure, we studied rats with heart failure after coronary artery ligation. The rats received either captopril (2 milligrams drinking water) or placebo for 4 weeks. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, urine volume, urinary sodium excretion and the percent fractional excretion of sodium were measured before and after an infusion of ANP (0.3 microgram/kg/min). To determine whether changes in ANP receptor binding and responsiveness occur in heart failure and after captopril treatment, we performed radioreceptor binding studies and measured guanylate cyclase activity. Atrial natriuretic peptide in sham-operated rats decreased mean arterial pressure from 118 +/- 5 to 95 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than .001), increased urine volume from 0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.16 +/- 0.05 ml/min/kg (P less than .05), urinary sodium excretion, 14.2 +/- 3.1 to 41.4 +/- 8.9 mu eq/min/kg (P less than .02), filtration fraction from 0.30 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.4 (P less than .05), and the percent fractional excretion of sodium from 0.84 +/- 0.19 to 2.85 +/- 0.61 (P less than .02). Atrial natriuretic peptide in untreated rats with heart failure produced no significant systemic or renal hemodynamic effects. In rats with heart failure treated with captopril, ANP decreased mean arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than .05) and increased hematocrit from 50 +/- 2 to 52 +/- 1 (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "174": "In view of the likely prohypertensive effects of hyperinsulinemia and the presence of insulin resistance in primary hypertension, the effects of various antihypertensive therapies on insulin sensitivity need to be identified. The evidence strongly supports major beneficial effects of weight reduction and aerobic exercise. Deleterious effects have been shown for diuretics and most beta-blockers, whereas probable beneficial effects have been seen with alpha-blockers, one angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and various calcium entry blockers. Improvement of insulin sensitivity and reduction of plasma insulin levels are desirable attributes of antihypertensive therapy that should be more carefully considered in the future.", 
    "175": "The failure of encainide and flecainide to reduce mortality after infarction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial and the failure of low-dose amiodarone to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction has shifted attention to other strategies, such as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, to prevent sudden cardiac death. Evidence suggesting that beta-adrenergic blocking agents might be useful, especially in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction, is accumulating. Previous data from studies using beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the mechanisms by which beta-adrenergic blocking agents might be of value in preventing sudden cardiac death are reviewed. These considerations and the availability of new investigational beta-adrenergic blocking agents with vasodilator properties provide a new opportunity to test the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in preventing sudden cardiac death, especially in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "176": "These studies were undertaken to evaluate different manifestations of structural cardiovascular changes and the effects of antihypertensive therapy in essential hypertension. A meta-analysis of 109 studies that had examined the effect of different pharmacological blood pressure lowering regimens on left ventricular structure, examined by echocardiography, was undertaken to increase the statistical power, to resolve uncertainty and to improve the accuracy of estimation of the magnitude of effect. Strict preset criteria were applied. The effect of different drugs in monotherapy and in particular first line antihypertensive therapies were compared, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists all reduced left ventricular mass (LVM) through a reduction in wall hypertrophy, the effect being most pronounced with ACE-inhibitors. Conversely, diuretics reduced LVM mainly through a reduction of left ventricular volume. Previously untreated males (n = 28, 86 kg, 46 years, 27 kg/m2) with non-malignant essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 95 mmHg 3-4 times (in triplicate) on placebo) were randomized to long-term double-blind treatment with enalapril (E) or hydrochlorothiazide (H). There were no significant differences between the groups at baseline. Vascular alterations in the retina (eyeground photo, refined grading), cardiac morphology (M-mode echocardiography, ASE), structural vascular changes of the hand (plethysmography, minimal resistance (Rmin)), total peripheral resistance ((TPR), calculated from dye-dilution) and blood pressure (intraarterial) were significantly interrelated at baseline except LVM and Rmin. After 6 months of therapy, E reduced the signs of vascular changes in the retina as well as Rmin in the hand circulation, while H did not change or increased these structural vascular changes. The blood pressure lowering effect of E (mainly through lowering of TPR) tended to be more pronounced, measured both intraarterially and indirectly, than that seen with H (mainly through lowering of cardiac output), however, there were no significant differences. LVM decreased progressively with E while the effect of H was non-significant. E reduced wall thickness but not left ventricular diameter and also improved left ventricular distensibility significantly. The effect on cardiac morphology was significantly different between therapies when taking change in blood pressure into account. After the longest follow-up on monotherapy (18 months) E had reduced LVM by 2.7 g/mmHg and H (14 months) by 1.3 g/mmHg (significant for E only). In univariate analysis the changes in cardiovascular structure were significantly related to the changes in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Subjects were classified according to Swedish standard criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was recorded in a random sample of normotensives and borderline hypertensives as well as in all the untreated hypertensives identified at screening and willing to participate. A subgroup of borderline hypertensives also carried out self-measurements of blood pressure (self-BP) both at work and at home. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. was compared in hypertensives at rest, during 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different durations of action) were also compared, with special focus on the early morning hours.",

The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between self-BP and office-BP; combining the two added little.

In these conditions symptoms of paraesthesia, finger numbness and blanching occur, so nerve conduction studies, vibration and temperature threshold measurements and neurovascular function tests are used for objective assessment of neurological dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to examine some factors which may confound quantitative neuro-vascular function measurements if used to assess neuropathy in diabetics. All subjects were consenting volunteers without exposure to known neurotoxic chemicals. The 5 groups were (a) healthy non-diabetic subjects not exposed to vibration (n = 10, mean age 52.3 yrs) (b) 2 insulin dependent and 8 non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects with a mean of 6 years treatment (n = 10, mean age 55.7 yrs) (c) maintenance employees exposed to high frequency pneumatic hand tools (n = 10, mean age 52.2 yrs) (d) subjects who were not diabetic or exposed to vibrating tools, but were being treated with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril 20 mg daily for hypertension (n = 5, mean age 54 yrs) (e) subjects who had smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily for at least 15 yrs (n = 10, mean age 51 yrs). Neurovascular tests included axon reflex responses measured by laser Doppler velocimeter evoked on the dorsum of the finger by iontophoresis of acetylcholine 16 mC in a circumferential chamber: cutaneous microvascular dilator responses to endothelial stimulation by iontophoretic application of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine 16 mC and to direct nitrodilator sodium nitroprusside 16 mC. The skin temperature of the digits was held between 33 degrees and 34 degrees C during testing and dilator responses were measured as flux change by on-line computer analysis using 'Perisoft'. There was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the neurovascular responses of both diabetics and vibration--exposed subjects to acetylcholine and, in the case of vibration-exposed subjects, to pilocarpine, but nitroprusside responses were not significantly different. Our findings of reductions in neurovascular responses in diabetics and in subjects exposed to higher frequency vibration is consistent with recent epidemiological findings. Furthermore, subjects treated with an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril) showed significant reduction in acetylcholine-evoked axon reflex responses, while the test group of smokers showed a significant reduction in their dilator response to pilocarpine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The hemodynamics were serially assessed before and after drug administration for at most 6 hours. Pimobendan reduced mean blood pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, total systemic vascular resistance, and total pulmonary vascular resistance but it increased heart rate. By contrast, captopril reduced mean blood pressure and double product. No significant changes were noted in the cardiac index, stroke volume index, AV-O2 difference or the arterial oxygen pressure between the 2 drugs. In conclusion, pimobendan seems to function as a strong arterio-veno-dilator rather than as an inotropic agent in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "183": "To study the effect of antihypertensive therapy on the regulation of renin gene expression, the levels of tissue renin messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured after treatment with a calcium channel blocker (manidipine hydrochloride 3 mg/kg/day) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (delapril hydrochloride 30 mg/kg/day), administered orally for 1 week, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR, aged 15 weeks old, were used in this study (n = 5 per group). Control rats were administered the vehicle alone. Tissue total RNA was isolated from kidney, adrenal gland, heart, and brain tissue, and tissue RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA), which was specifically amplified by polymerase chain reaction with labeled-primers for the rat renin gene. The radioactivity of the cDNA products was measured directly. Although delapril increased plasma renin activity (PRA) about 5-fold compared with the control group, manidipine did not change PRA. The kidney renin mRNA content was increased about 6-fold by treatment with delapril. Manidipine and delapril significantly decreased the renin mRNA content in the heart (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The level of renin mRNA in the adrenal gland and brain tissues was not significantly changed by treatment with either drug. These results suggest that tissue renin gene expression in SHR is regulated by a tissue-specific process independent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "184": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on vascular hypertrophy and vascular angiotensin II in vivo in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Hydralazine (10 mg/kg/day), delapril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; 20 mg/kg/day), manidipine (calcium channel blocker; 10 mg/kg/day), and vehicle were given by gavage to four groups of SHR between 4 and 5 months of age. The aortic angiotensin II level was measured by highly sensitive radioimmunoassay coupled with high pressure liquid chromatography; aortic morphologic studies were performed. Each drug treatment effectively lowered blood pressure to the same level. However, the aortic wall thickness, medial-intimal areas, and wall to lumen ratio of abdominal aorta decreased significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively) with delapril and manidipine but not hydralazine. Delapril significantly decreased aortic angiotensin II levels (p < 0.05), whereas manidipine treatment significantly increased them (p < 0.05). The aortic angiotensin II level was not changed by hydralazine. These results show that delapril and manidipine caused regression of hypertension-induced vascular hypertrophy in SHR. The probable mechanism of regression of aortic hypertrophy by delapril was inhibition of vascular angiotensin II formation, but the mechanism for manidipine was unclear.",

The patients were treated with either manidipine 10 mg/day (n = 12, mean age 63 +/- 2 years) or delapril 30 mg/day (n = 8, 62 +/- 3 years) for 12 weeks. Glucose and insulin (IRI) responses to 75 g oral glucose load, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c), serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride and apolipoproteins, and 24 h urinary excretion of C-peptide were measured before and at the end of treatment. Both manidipine and delapril showed adequate hypotensive effects. Neither manidipine nor delapril affected blood glucose and IRI responses to glucose load. Manidipine showed no effect on lipids whereas delapril increased HDL cholesterol (47 +/- 5 mg/dL to 61 +/- 7, p < 0.05), although total cholesterol and triglyceride were not altered. The ratio of TC-HDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol was decreased by delapril (3.44 +/- 0.30 to 2.61 +/- 0.45, p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in apolipoproteins. Both manidipine and delapril have adequate antihypertensive actions without unfavorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients with NIDDM. Delapril seems to have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism.",

Tissue AT1 receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) content was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Treatment with manidipine (3 mg/kg/day) or delapril (30 mg/kg/day) lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly (p < 0.01) (delta SBP; -73 mmHg or -67 mmHg, respectively). Although delapril markedly increased plasma renin activity (PRA), manidipine did not alter PRA. AT1 receptor mRNA content in the adrenal gland was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased by treatment with manidipine or delapril. In contrast, cardiac AT1 receptor mRNA content was significantly (p < 0.01) increased by treatment with either agent. There was no significant change in renal and brain AT1 receptor mRNA contents. These findings suggest that although the expression of AT1 receptor gene depends on the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS), it is regulated independently in a tissue-specific manner via the local RAS in each tissue of SHR.", 
    "187": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a powerful independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. This overview of 104 studies examines the ability of various types of antihypertensive therapies to reverse LVH as assessed by echocardiography. Combination therapy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and methyldopa were the most effective in reversing LV mass; vasodilators such as minoxidil and hydralazine had no effect on LVH. These differences were independent of the degree of fall in blood pressure and duration of therapy. beta-blockers were as effective as ACE inhibitors in decreasing LV wall thickness. Possible reasons for drug differences in reversing LVH are discussed. Preliminary evidence suggests that reversing LVH by antihypertensive drug therapy is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular complications.", 
    "188": "Alpha-blockers tend to normalize central hemodynamics and only modestly reduce the systolic blood pressure-heart rate (SBP x HR) product. Similarly, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists normalize central hemodynamics, but at the expense of an increased heart rate (which tends to normalize chronic treatment). Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists tend to reduce resting heart rate. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors normalize central hemodynamics with no change in heart rate. Classic beta-blockers, particularly the non-selective agents, lower heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise, with a reflex increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR), which lessens with chronic therapy. With dual-acting beta-blockers like carvedilol, the fall in blood pressure is accompanied by a fall in TPR and only a modest drop in cardiac output; the increase in AVO2 difference is less marked with carvedilol compared to a classic beta-blocker, suggesting that the body's reserve mechanisms may be less reduced.", 
    "189": "It is well-known that ketamine (Kt) anaesthesia produces a rise in blood pressure and heart rate in man. These cardiostimulatory effects were adscribed to several factors such as: a) increased sympathetic nervous system activity by direct stimulation of central nervous structures, b) increased catecholamine release from the peripheral sympathetic system, c) high plasmatic renin levels. However, the quantitative participation of these mechanisms in the cardiovascular effects of this anaesthetic agent is unknown. While some authors have shown a major rise in serum renin activity in experimental anaesthesia, others have been unable to confirm these results. The present study was undertaken to assess if the cardiostimulatory effects of Kt anaesthesia were due to an activation of renin-angiotensin system or to increased sympathetic activity. In consequence we used rats treated with enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or propranolol prior to anaesthetic procedures. Thirty male Wistar and six spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) weighing 240-300 g were used in all the experiments. The rats were randomly grouped into six groups. I- Non-anaesthetized rats, II- Anaesthetized rats (trained in the experimental procedures), III- Anaesthetized rats (without training), IV- Anaesthetized rats previously treated with enalapril, V- Anaesthetized rats pretreated with propranolol, VI- SHR treated with enalapril. The rats of groups IV and VI received enalapril p.o. for three weeks (25 mg/Kg body wt). The animals of group V were submitted to acute beta-adrenergic blockade. Propranolol dose: 10 mg/Kg body wt, was given i.p. 15 min before Kt anaesthesia.

    "191": "Glomerular hyperfiltration is thought to play a pivotal role in causing renal damage in essential hypertension. An increase in glomerular filtration rate can be experimentally induced by an acute oral protein load through still unclarified mechanisms, although hormonal factors have been postulated; in already hyperfiltering nephrons, the capacity to further increase glomerular filtration rate upon stimulation with an acute protein load (i.e. renal functional reserve) would conceivably be reduced, even in the presence of apparently normal renal function. The present study aimed at assessing whether renal functional reserve is preserved and/or is affected by different antihypertensive drugs in essential hypertensive patients without signs of renal function impairment; moreover, we tried to highlight changes in the plasma levels of natriuretic and antinatriuretic hormones potentially involved in the modulation of renal hemodynamics under the chosen experimental conditions. Renal hemodynamic parameters, plasma renin activity, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic factor were measured in fourteen essential hypertensives submitted to an acute oral protein load, alone or with a concomitant administration of either nifedipine or enalapril, as compared with a control carbohydrate meal. Glomerula filtration rate and renal plasma flow rose slightly but not significantly following an acute oral protein load as compared with a carbohydrate meal; no changes were noted in plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels, whereas plasma renin activity decreased. When nifedipine was administered together with the protein meal, both glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow increased significantly; there were also, parallel increases in plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic factor. Administration of enalapril was associated with a decrease in both glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow; plasma renin activity showed an expected marked rise, whereas the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor were only slightly but not significantly reduced and plasma aldosterone fell. In conclusion, our data suggest that in our patients renal functional reserve was blunted. Clear-cut hyperfiltration was brought about by administration of nifedipine together with a protein meal, whereas enalapril completely abolished even the small increase in glomerular filtration rate seen after protein meal alone. The concomitant alterations in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic factor seemed to play no major role in the determinism of the observed renal hemodynamic changes.", 
    "192": "Two metallopeptidases, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) are involved respectively in the release of angiotensin II which is a vasoconstrictor, and in the metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide which is diuretic and bradykinin which is a vasodilatator. The dual inhibition of these two peptidases represents a new way to regulate the blood pressure in various cardiovascular diseases. Taking into account the mechanism of action of metallopeptidases and the substrate specificity of ACE and NEP, dual inhibitors corresponding to the general formula HS-CH2-CH(R1)CONH-CH(R2)COOH and HS-CH(R1)CONH-CH(R2)CONH-CH(R3)COOH and having inhibitory potencies on each enzyme in the nanomolar range were designed. The most efficient inhibitors have been transformed into lipophilic prodrugs which were found to be active after oral administration. These compounds have been tested on an experimental model of hypertension in rats and, as expected, have been shown to be both diuretic (NEP inhibition) and hypotensive (ACE inhibition).", 
    "193": "Neutral endopeptidase (NEP; enkephalinase, EC 3.4.24.11) is a cell membrane associated zinc metalloprotease, which cleaves peptides like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the amino-side of hydrophobic amino acids. Although NEP is mainly located in reabsorptive epithelia (kidney proximal tubule), it is also present in non-epithelial cells like neuronal cells. As the renal NEP cannot account for the entire ANP metabolism, other locations were postulated. The present experiments show its expression in endothelial cells (EC) from arterial (bovine pulmonary, porcine and human aorta) and venous (human umbilical, rabbit ear marginal) origins. Three different methods were used to demonstrate the presence of the protein and its mRNA: 1) NEP enzymatic activity was estimated using both a synthetic ([D-Ala2, Leu5] enkephalin) and a natural substrate (bradykinin). Using the synthetic substrate, the enzymatic activity in EC was completely blocked by thiorphan, a specific NEP inhibitor with an IC50 value in the nM range. In contrast, captopril, bestatin, GEMSA, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases, respectively, were 10,000 times less active, revealing an inhibition profile similar to that of the purified enzyme. Bradykinin, a natural substrate of NEP, was in part metabolized by NEP, in presence of captopril, since 50% of the formation of the major metabolite bradykinin 1-7 was inhibited by thiorphan. 2) Immunoreactive NEP was detected on the plasma membrane of rabbit EC using a monoclonal antibody directed against the homologous renal enzyme. 3) NEP mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis on rabbit EC as a major transcript of 3.9 kb. Reverse transcriptase PCR amplification showed the presence of a specific transcript in all EC tested. Therefore, endothelial NEP could play an important role in the inactivation of ANP, bradykinin and endothelins by its localization facing the circulating vasoactive peptides.", 
    "194": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II, ECA) is a membrane bound enzyme anchored to the cell membrane through a single transmembrane domain located near its carboxyterminal extremity. Secretion of ACE by the cell occurs most likely as a result of a posttranslational cleavage of the membrane anchor and intracellular region. The ACE molecule is organized into two large highly homologous domains, each bearing consensus sequences for zinc binding in metallopeptidases. Site directed mutagenesis allowed to establish that both domains bear in fact a functional active site, able to convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II and to hydrolyze bradykinin or substance P. The two active sites of ACE, however, do not display the same sensitivity to anion activation (the C terminal active site being more chloride activatable) and also differs in kinetic parameters for peptide hydrolysis. The C terminal active site can hydrolyze faster angiotensin I and substance P and the N terminal active site is able to perform a peculiar endoproteolytic cleavage of an in vitro substrate of ACE, the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone. Both active sites bind with a high affinity, competitive inhibitors but the Kd of the reaction can vary up to 10 between the two active sites. All together, these observations suggest that ACE contains two active sites, whose structure is not exactly identical. They may have a different substrate specificity, however this remains speculative at the present time. Concerning the regulation of ACE gene expression in man, population studies indicated that the large interindividual variability in plasma ACE levels is genetically determined. An insertion/deletion polymorphism located in an intron of ACE gene is associated with differences in the level of ACE in plasma and cells. The physiological and clinical implications of these observations is discussed.", 
    "195": "The discovery of the components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in various tissues gave rise to the idea that functional \"tissue\" renin-angiotensin systems exist that are more or less independent of the hormonal RAS. Further support to this notion came from the recent demonstration of the mRNA for the protein components of the RAS in a number of organs. Last not least, the introduction of the CE inhibitors, generating an enormous scientific interest in the role of the RAS, has contributed to the concept of \"tissue\" RAS, since some of the effects of these drugs were thought to be reconciled better with \"tissue\" than with plasma RAS inhibition. However, this model of plasma vs \"tissue\" RAS still suffers from a number of conceptual problems that have to be dealt with. For instance, with respect to the \"tissue\" RAS in the vascular wall it is not clear at present whether ACE is at all active inside endothelial cells. In addition, all evidence available speaks against its localisation in the vascular media, while there may be some activity of the enzyme in the adventitial layer. Concerning the heart, there is at present no unequivocal evidence for a local ANG II production through angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in cardiac tissue outside the coronary vessels. The localisation of ANG II generation within tissue RAS in the adrenal gland or in the kidney, where ANG II may be generated through CE at the tubular brush border, is far from being elucidated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "196": "In Wistar rats, four experiments were carried out, studying specific inhibitors for ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), such as captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril and cilazapril, in presence of 20% and 95% ethanol induced gastric lesions. The effect of lisinopril and angiotensin I on the same injury was also studied. Subsequently, drugs with known role in gastric mucosa cytoprotection, such as enprostil, paracetamol, ketotiphen, levamisole, diazepam, bromocriptine, dopamine and clonidine, before and after absolute ethanol gastric injury were also studied. Finally, to examine the potential role of ACE in gastric cytoprotection, pretreatment with enalapril, followed by cytoprotective drugs, was carried out. We conclude that all ACE blockers aggravate the gastric lesion induced by 20% and 95% ethanol and are similar to the findings with angiotensin I. The gastric ACE probably plays an important role in the gastric mucosa defense. On the other hand, gastric ACE, as a physiologic regulator of microcirculation, acts by a double mechanism. a) converting the vasopressor amine, angiotensin I in angiotensin II. b) activating vasoactive peripheric receptors such as DA 2 dopaminergic and alfa 2 adrenoreceptors.", 
    "197": "Myocardial hypertrophy in response to hemodynamic overload is an established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Partially, this may be due to alterations in cardiac gene expression, resulting in a more fetal-like myocyte phenotype with a fragile Ca(++)-homeostasis. Depressed expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(++)-ATPase is the hallmark of this overload phenotype, contributing to prolonged cytosolic Ca(++)-transients, disturbed diastolic relaxation, altered force-frequency relation, and probably, electrophysiologic instability with susceptibility to malignant arrhythmias. Since angiotensin II is a growth-promoting factor in several cellular systems, the local formation of angiotensin II within the myocardium might contribute to the trophic response and the phenotype shift of overloaded myocardium. Several observations are consistent with this hypothesis: the cardiac expression of ACE and angiotensinogen is enhanced in experimental myocardial overload and in human endstage congestive heart failure; prolonged observations of experimental cardiac overload with hypertrophy-induced putative normalisation of myocardial systolic wall stress demonstrated a renormalization of ventricular tissue ACE activity and of ventricular sarcoplasmic Ca(++)-ATPase expression and activity; normalizing ventricular tissue ACE activity in experimental cardiac overload by chronic nonhypotensive ACE inhibitor therapy caused a parallel partial normalization of hypertrophy and underexpression of sarcoplasmic CA(++)-ATPase. This partial normalization of myocyte Ca(++)-homeostasis in overload hypertrophy by non-hypotensive chronic ACE-inhibition is attenuated by concomitant chronic application of bradykinin-2 receptor blockade, indicating an involvement of altered bradykinin metabolism in the phenotype modulation due to chronic ACE inhibition. While these observations are consistent with a direct influence of local ACE activity on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the cell type contributing to the enhanced ACE expression in overload and the specific mechanism of this influence are unknown.", 
    "198": "In recent years, thanks to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure and progress made in the pharmacology of cardiovascular drugs, new therapeutics have been advocated in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Among them, converting enzyme inhibitors are the most useful. However, the classical association of digoxin-furosemide and general measures remains a very effective first-choice treatment in most cases. Only in particular situations, such as cardiomyopathy and decompensated atrio-ventricular insufficiency, should priority be given to converting enzyme inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are essentially used within the context of post-cardiac surgery intensive care. Beta-blockers which have been recently proposed for treatment of adult patients must not be used, as there is still no data available on their effectiveness and tolerance in pediatric patients.",

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of two different antihypertensive drug regimens, an ACE inhibitor and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the low UAE rate observed in subjects with uncomplicated, mild to moderate primary hypertension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 49 patients (mean age 54 y) were randomly assigned in a double blind manner either to further 4 weeks on placebo (P, n = 15), 8 weeks on lisinopril (L, n = 17; 20 mg/40 mg o.d.) or 8 weeks on atenolol (A, n = 17; 50 mg/100 mg o.d.). The 24-h UAE was measured every second week. At entry and after 4 weeks the glomerular filtration rate and the renal plasma flow were measured. Both drugs lowered blood pressure (BP) to a similar extent after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment; the blood pressures were 160/106 (P), 159/104 (L) and 154/103 (A) at entry, and 133/83 (L) and 134/87 (A) at the end of the study after 8 weeks. On entry the 24-h UAE in all patients ranged from 4 to 49 mg (mean 14.1 mg), and it did not differ significantly between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "202": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has been suggested to have an immunomodulatory effect both in clinical and experimental studies. To further investigate this possible effect in organ transplantation, captopril was given to inbred rats before transplantation of an allogeneic heart. Captopril was found to prolong graft survival significantly compared to untreated controls. In rats treated with a tolerogenic dose of ATG, additional captopril administration tended to increase the proportion of rats with long-term functioning grafts, but this did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that captopril displays an immunosuppressive effect that seems to be weak, since no augmentation of ATG-induced transplantation unresponsiveness was seen.", 
    "203": "The acute effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on sodium ion transport systems were investigated in essential hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The passive sodium efflux through the erythrocyte membrane was significantly higher and erythrocyte sodium-potassium cotransport was lower in patients with essential hypertension when compared with normal subjects. However, sodium-potassium pump activity and sodium-lithium countertransport did not differ significantly between the hypertensive patients and the normal subjects. Immediately after captopril administration, erythrocyte passive sodium efflux and sodium-potassium cotransport returned to normal levels in the hypertensive subjects. Although the plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were altered by captopril, they did not correlate with changes in any sodium transport system. These results suggest that the changes in sodium transport systems which occur immediately after captopril administration may contribute, at least in part, to its antihypertensive action.", 
    "204": "For the first time by method of gel-filtration and ionexchange chromatography two bradykinin-potentiating peptides have been isolated in homogeneous state from Latrodectus tredecimguttatus spider venom. The homogeneity was proved by disk-electrophoresis, isoelectrical focusing, analysis of aminoacid content and rechromatography. Peptides are acid proteins with molecular mass 10,000 and 2500 D. Peptides prolong depressor effects of bradykinin, stimulate histamine releasing from cells, decrease blood pressure in rats.", 
    "205": "The intracerebral administration of kininase inhibitors produced an increase in arterial pressure of the SHR but not in normotensive animals. The SHR were several fold more sensitive to the pressor response elicited by the intracerebral injection of bradykinin, however SHR with low blood pressure showed decreased sensitivity to the bradykinin pressor effect. The results suggest that an endogenous kinin system plays a role in the central regulation of blood pressure of the SHR.", 
    "206": "We have evaluated the effects of a B2 receptor antagonist (B5630) of kinins on BK and captopril-induced acute hypotensive responses in anaesthetized SHR. Intravenous treatment of BK (1.0 microgram) and captopril (0.3 mg/kg) caused significant (p < 0.05) fall in the SBP and DBP. Whereas BK caused greater fall in the SBP (p < 0.05), DBP (p < 0.01) and duration of hypotension (p < 0.05) when administered after captopril (Fig 1 and 2). All the hypotensive effects of BK and captopril were significantly antagonised (p < 0.05) in the presence of B5630 (2.0 mg/kg). Further, the duration of hypotensive responses of BK and captopril were blocked (p < 0.05) by B5630. The agonists and BK-antagonist did not cause significant (p > 0.05) alterations in HR during the entire investigation. These findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that B2 receptor might be involved in the regulation of the hypotensive actions of BK and captopril. Kinins should also have valuable functions in the antihypertensive property of captopril-like drugs.", 
    "207": "This study investigates the action of PAF-stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) on myocardial integrity and function in Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts. Infusion of 10(6) PMN/ml resulted in a negative inotropic effect without larger biochemical evidence for myocardial tissue injury while infusion of PAF (1 microM) did not cause any permanent effect at all. However, the combined administration of PAF-stimulated PMN resulted in severely depressed myocardial contractile function and biochemical evidence for myocardial tissue injury. This was probably due to an enhanced uptake of PMN from the coronary perfusate and accumulation within the myocardial tissue. Ramiprilat, (10 microM) significantly improved left ventricular function and myocardial cell integrity. Similar results were obtained with bradykinin (1 nM). The data suggest a PAF-induced, PMN-mediated myocardial tissue injury as well as cardioprotective actions of ACE inhibition which are possibly related to stimulation of the kinin/prostacyclin axis.", 
    "208": "Like bradykinin the converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat concentration-dependently enhances the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin assessed by intracellular cyclic GMP accumulation and 6-keto prostaglandin F1. resp. Both ramiprilat-induced effects are completely suppressed by the specific kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140. The ramiprilat-induced cyclic GMP increase is totally blocked by the stereospecific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine.", 
    "209": "The effects of ACE-inhibitors on bradykinin metabolism and bradykinin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation were studied in isolated coronary arteries and endothelial cells in culture. The results suggest that ACE-inhibitors affect coronary vascular tone by at least two endothelium-dependent and bradykinin-mediated mechanisms: First, ACE-inhibitors decrease endothelial bradykinin degredation which is accompanied by an augmented bradykinin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation. Second, ACE-inhibitors evoke endothelium-dependent relaxations in coronary arteries stimulated with threshold concentrations of bradykinin, which cannot be attributed to an inhibition of bradykinin degradation. The effect appears to represent a new mechanism which may be based on an interaction of the bradykinin receptor and the angiotensin converting enzyme on the cellular level.", 
    "210": "It has been known for a long time that systemic infusion of angiotensin II in patients with coronary artery disease or normal control subjects causes a marked increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and systolic pressure (LVP) (1,2). In this setting angiotensin II produces a marked increase in afterload that makes it difficult to acknowledge possible local myocardial effects of the peptide. The studies (3-8) summarized in the present paper were designed to examine the physiological role of local cardiac angiotensin II generation and local bradykinin degradation on cardiac function in the normal and hypertrophied rat heart. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II, infused in isolated, well oxygenated, buffer perfused normal rat hearts, produced a mild increase in LVEDP with no change in systolic function (3). In contrast, in hypertrophied rat hearts, angiotensin I and angiotensin II caused a marked deterioration of diastolic function, increasing LVEDP from 10 to 25-37 mmHg on average (3,5). Preliminary evidence suggests that angiotensin II effects on diastolic function are mediated via a protein kinase C dependent pathway that might involve Na+/H+ exchange (4,5). When cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme was blocked by infusion of an ACE inhibitor prior and in parallel to angiotensin I infusion no changes in diastolic function were noted (6). Furthermore, ACE inhibition blunted the diastolic dysfunction during low flow ischemia in isolated hypertrophied rat hearts (7). This effect of ACE inhibition was even more remarkeable, since no exogenous angiotensin was infused in this experiment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "211": "The contribution of endogenous bradykinin to the chronic antihypertensive actions of the ACE-inhibitor, ramipril, was investigated in 2-kidney 1 clip (2K1C) hypertensive kinin-deficient Brown Norway Katholieke rats (BN-K) and 2K1C hypertensive Wistar rats (WI) as well as in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Treatment with ramipril plus the BK B2-receptor antagonist HOE 140 for 6 weeks significantly attenuated the antihypertensive effects of the ACE-inhibitor in 2K1C hypertensive WI rats, but not in 2K1C hypertensive BN-K rats and in SHR. Our data support the hypothesis that potentiation of endogenous kinins contributes to the chronic antihypertensive actions of ACE-inhibitors in experimental renal hypertension. Whether this holds also true for other forms of hypertension remains to be answered.", 
    "212": "The free thiol group of captopril is important in the action and metabolism of this drug. It has been postulated that the thiol group may allow captopril to act in a manner similar to glutathione and protect against oxidative injury. This study investigated the ability of captopril, enalaprilat, and N-acetylcysteine to prevent tertbutyl hydroperoxide induced oxidative injury in rat renal homogenates. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in homogenates from captopril-treated animals (p < 0.05), and following glutathione depletion this was further enhanced (p < 0.001). Renal glutathione content was significantly reduced by captopril treatment (p < 0.01). These results suggest that captopril does not act as an alternate source of reducing equivalents to glutathione and does not protect against renal oxidative injury in this model.", 
    "213": "In the present studies, ex vivo-, in vitro-, and in vivo-effects of three structurally different angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the kallikrein-kinin and eicosanoid systems are described. In the ex vivo- and in vitro-experiments using isolated rat aorta, vascular prostacyclin (PGI2) production is dose-dependently stimulated by the ACE inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, and ramipril. Furthermore, the ACE inhibitor-induced augmentation of vascular PGI2 synthesis observed in vitro was completely inhibited by the competitive bradykinin antagonist D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]bradykinin suggesting that ACE inhibitors stimulate PGI2 generation by an enhancement of kinin activity. In the in vivo studies in healthy volunteers, we used platelet cyclic adenosine-5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine-5'-monophosphate (cGMP) as indirect parameters of the activity of prostacyclin and the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, respectively. Since platelet cAMP and cGMP were unaffected by an acute dose of 10 mg of lisinopril, our data do not support the concept that the interference of ACE inhibitors with the kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin system observed ex vivo and in vitro participates in the haemodynamic effects of these agents in humans in vivo.", 
    "214": "The antinatriuretic effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) is generally attributed to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. We studied this by infusion of increasing amounts (1, 4, and 8 pmol/kg per min) of Ang II in seven water-loaded volunteers who were pretreated with enalapril and a high-salt diet. While mean arterial pressure increased from 92 +/- 3 mmHg to respectively 98 +/- 3, 110 +/- 2, and 116 +/- 2 mmHg, sodium excretion fell from 331 +/- 40 to 135 +/- 23, 65 +/- 17, and 63 +/- 22 mumol/min, and GFR from 138 +/- 9 to 128 +/- 6, 111 +/- 6, and 104 +/- 8 ml/min (P < 0.05 for each variable). At 1 pmol/kg per min, Ang II decreased maximal urine flow and the fractional excretions of lithium and uric acid. Urine sodium concentration decreased, whereas minimal urine osmolality remained unchanged. At 4 pmol/kg per min, these effects were more pronounced. Moreover, minimal urine osmolality increased from 58 +/- 4 to 72 +/- 8 mosm/kg, but sodium concentration decreased further. The step to 8 pmol/kg per min did not decrease sodium, lithium, or uric acid excretion further, but induced a further increase in minimal urine osmolality to 99 +/- 16 mosm/kg. These data suggest that the antinatriuretic effect of modestly hypertensive dosages of Ang II is not only due to a decrease in GFR and an increase in proximal sodium reabsorption, but also involves a rise in fractional reabsorption in a distal nephron segment. In addition Ang II decreases renal diluting capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "215": "In a randomized, cross-over, single-dose study of 19 elderly hypertensive patients (aged 62-84 y, SBP greater than 160 mmHg, DBP greater than 100 mmHg, creatinine clearance 11-93 ml.min-1) we have studied the pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril after a single oral dose of either 10 mg enalapril or 10 mg enalapril + 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The pharmacokinetics of enalapril were unaffected by hydrochlorothiazide, but there was a significant reduction in renal clearance and a significant increase in AUC(0-24 h) of enalaprilat after hydrochlorothiazide, resulting in higher serum concentrations of the active drug. This was independent of the individual degree of renal impairment and might be due either to an initial reduction of GFR by hydrochlorothiazide or to interference with the tubular secretion of enalaprilat. The relationships between serum enalaprilat and serum ACE activity were similar after both treatments, both consistent with a value for Ki of enalaprilat of about 0.1 nmol.l-1. Thus, serum ACE activity was not affected by hydrochlorothiazide but completely reflected the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat in both treatments.", 
    "216": "The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril 10-20 mg once daily and felodipine (extended release formulation) 5-10 mg once daily were compared in a double-blind, parallel group study of eight weeks duration involving 219 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. On lisinopril treatment sitting blood pressure fell from 166.3/102.9 +/- 17.5/5.8 mmHg to 146.7/89.7 +/- 19.5/8.7 mmHg and on felodipine blood pressure fell from 166.7/103.3 +/- 18.3/5.4 mmHg to 153.6/92.3 +/- 15.9/7.9 mmHg. The decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater on lisinopril than on felodipine treatment (p = 0.019 and p = 0.033). A subgroup analysis in elderly patients (age > or = 65 years) showed that lisinopril and felodipine were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. In young subjects (age < 65 years) felodipine treatment lowered systolic blood pressure less than did lisinopril treatment (p = 0.001). Lisinopril was better tolerated than felodipine. On lisinopril treatment, reports of headache and dizziness were reduced while that of cough increased. On felodipine treatment, dizziness was reduced but reports of flushing and oedema were increased. The results show a better antihypertensive effect and better tolerability for lisinopril compared with extended release felodipine.", 
    "217": "1. The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the tissue ACE were assessed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography after acute and chronic administrations of the drugs. 2. Following acute administration of lisinopril, perindopril or benazepril, ACE was markedly inhibited in the lung, kidney and blood vessels but not in the testis. In the brain, ACE was inhibited mainly in structures with a deficient blood brain barrier. 3. High doses of perindopril progressively inhibited ACE in other brain structures. Tissue ACE inhibition persisted after serum levels of the enzyme had returned to control levels. In the case of perindopril, the time course of tissue ACE inhibition correlated with the inhibition of the pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I. 4. After chronic administration of lisinopril or perindopril for 14 days, a similar pattern of ACE inhibition was observed in the kidney, lung and blood vessels. In the lung, however, lisinopril was found to increase total ACE by 30%, while plasma ACE was increased two-threefold by both lisinopril and perindopril. Testicular ACE remained unaltered by chronic lisinopril treatment. 5. Overall, the changes in tissue ACE after the administration of inhibitors more closely parallel the drugs' biological effects than changes in plasma ACE or drug levels. ACE in the testis and brain is protected by permeability barriers that limit access of the drugs.",

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to enalapril, perindopril and cilazapril have been studied in essential hypertensives (2, 4 and 8 mg perindopril and 2.5 mg cilazapril, single dose and steady state) and normotensive volunteers (10 mg enalapril, single dose). 2. Plasma levels of the active diacid compounds reached similar peaks after single dose administration of the drugs. However, perindoprilat levels persisted for 5 days whereas cilazaprilat levels were not detectable beyond 12 h. 3. The higher levels of perindoprilat were associated with a greater inhibition of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in both acute and steady state studies. 4. The potency of the active diacids in inhibiting plasma ACE activity was perindoprilat greater than cilazaprilat greater than enalaprilat. 5. There was a close relationship between plasma concentration, ACE inhibition and blood pressure decrease. Although both cilazapril and perindopril administration reduced blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, only perindopril exerted 24 h blood pressure control at the doses used.", 
    "219": "1. The components of the renin-angiotensin system exist in many cardiovascular tissues (heart vessels, kidneys, adrenal glands). 2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is similar in somatic cells from all these sites. 3. ACE contains two catalytic sites that have different conformation requirements. This suggests that each site may have different substrates and that specific inhibitors could be developed for each site. 4. The cardiovascular functions of tissue ACE may include the regulation of regional blood flow, modulation of local sympathetic activity, stimulation of hyperplasia and hypertrophy and the mediation of inflammation.", 
    "220": "It was possible to assess that ACE inhibitors bound to two different sites on the enzymes which consist in two homologous domains. Accordingly, it was also shown that testis ACE which consists in a single domain exhibits only one site for inhibitors. The common binding site of both enzymes contains Zn2+, bears the enzymatic activity, is less sensitive to added Zn2+ and Cl- and has a lower affinity for inhibitors than the first one, found only in duplicated domain enzymes and highly sensitive to the effect of ions.", 
    "221": "Normotensive male Wistar rats are susceptible to the development of glomerulosclerosis, a process which can be accelerated by partial renal ablation, while normotensive male Wistar Kyoto (WKy) rats are resistant to glomerulosclerosis. Long-term treatment with angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors prevents the development of glomerulosclerosis. We studied the acute renal vascular response to bolus injections of captopril (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was significantly less in Wistar rats compared to WKy and not influenced by unilateral nephrectomy. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) and the filtration fraction (FF) were significantly greater in sham and unilateral nephrectomy Wistar rats as compared to WKy. Captopril significantly reduced the RVR in all four groups, but at comparable doses, RVR remained greater in the Wistar sham and Wistar rats following unilateral nephrectomy compared to sham and uninephrectomized WKy respectively. Captopril reduced FF in Wistar rats only. These data indicate an enhanced level of activity of the renal renin-angiotensin system in glomerulosclerosis-susceptible Wistar rats compared to glomerulosclerosis-resistant WKy rats, suggesting that vascular reactivity involving the renin-angiotensin system is an important determinant of the genetically determined differences in susceptibility to glomerulosclerosis in these two rats strains. The strain-dependent difference in RVR at the highest dose of captopril indicates that additional, possibly structural features may play a role in the difference in susceptibility to glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "222": "Ramipril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, was first studied in rats with aortic stenosis, an experimental model of reno-vascular hypertension. In this study, ramipril has an antihypertrophic cardiac effect, independently to its hypotensive effect. The co-administration of Hoe 140, a specific antagonist of bradykinin receptors blocked totally the effect of ramipril on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and on concentration of cGMP. These effects can therefore be explained by an accumulation of bradykinins. Furthermore, we investigated the preventing effects of ramipril on left ventricular hypertrophy, on growth of cardiac capillaries using SHR rats, treated in utero and during the 20 weeks following birth with two doses: a relatively high dose (1 mg/kg/day) and a low dose (0.01 mg/kg/day). Animals treated with a low dose of ramipril presented a high blood pressure similar to that observed in the control group. At the end of the treatment, the converting enzyme activity was inhibited in both groups. An increase in the growth of cardiac capillaries and of the cardiac concentration of glycogen and a decrease in the cardiac concentration of citric acid was observed in both groups. The ventricular weight decreased only in the high dose treatment group. This results demonstrated that early treatment with converting enzyme inhibitor even with a low dose which was unable to prevent the development of hypertension and of left ventricular hypertrophy. We could therefore draw a hypothesis of an accumulation of bradykinin due to the converting enzyme inhibitor which could explain in part this effect through an improvement of cardiac metabolism.", 
    "223": "The relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and erythropoietin was studied in twenty patients with renal artery stenosis and hypertension. Ten of the patients had a unilaterally activated renin-angiotensin system (group 1), while ten patients had not (group 2). Plasma erythropoietin was simultaneously measured in a brachial artery and both renal veins before and 5 and 30 min after an intravenous injection of 1.25 mg enalaprilat. The mean (+/- SD) arterial erythropoietin concentration was 27.3 +/- 16.8 mU/ml in group 1 and 14.1 +/- 11.3 mU/ml in group 2 patients (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change after enalaprilat i.v. in either group. The venous erythropoietin concentration in plasma from the stenotic kidney did not differ from that of the contralateral kidney. The higher erythropoietin concentration in group 1 patients may be explained by a systemic stimulatory effect of the renin-angiotensin system on erythropoietin production. As no side-differences were found, renal vein as well as peripheral erythropoietin measurements cannot be used as a tool in the diagnosis of the functional significance of a renal artery stenosis.", 
    "224": "Technetium-99m pertechnetate equilibrium ventriculography was used to evaluate the effects of captopril in a single dose of 50 mg on the changes in ST segment depression during the identical bicycle ergometer exercise, as well as on systemic and regional hemodynamic parameters in 10 patients (mean age 52 years) with Functional Classes II-III exercise-induced angina pectoris. During exercise performed 45 and 90 minutes after captopril, ST segment depression decreased by 30 +/- 0 (p less than 0.05), and 32 +/- 10% (p less than 0.02), respectively as compared to baseline ST segment displacement. Following 90 minutes after the drug administration, end-systolic volume reduced both at rest and during exercise, resting stroke volume increased from 71 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 4 ml (p less than 0.01), whereas exercise stroke volume rose from 69 +/- 3 to 74 +/- 3 ml (p less than 0.03); with the drug, ejection fraction showed a 5% increase (p less than 0.02) at rest and a 4% increase (p less than 0.02) on exercise. Thus, captopril had a beneficial effect on the hemodynamics and reduced myocardial ischemia in patients with exercise induced angina.", 
    "225": "With captopril, it has been shown that an erroneous measurement of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) can be induced by the dissociation of the inhibitor-ACE complex during long-term storage. We have studied the possible dissociation of the fosinopril-ACE complex during the storage of serum samples from healthy male volunteers given a single dose of fosinopril. Serum samples were collected from 5 volunteers, 5 min before, then 4 and 24 h after a unique oral dose of 10 mg fosinopril. ACE activity was measured by a colorimetric and a fluorimetric assay during the hour following the sampling (day 0) and after 21 or 61 days of storage at -20 or -196 degrees C. The degree of ACE inhibition measured in vitro in fresh serum samples differed according to the technique used. Fosinopril has a long-lasting effect with 80% inhibition 24 hours after drug administration. Storage at -20 and -196 degrees C induced a significant decrease in the degree of inhibition measured with the colorimetric method. With the fluorimetric method, a decrease in ACE inhibition was only observed after storage at -20 degrees C but not at -196 degrees C.", 
    "226": "The effects of lisinopril 10-20 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg (each given once daily) on blood pressure, serum sodium, potassium and magnesium concentrations, total body potassium and urinary cation excretion were compared in a group of hypertensive patients using a double blind randomised crossover design. Each active treatment phase lasted six weeks and a total of sixteen patients completed the study. Both lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide produced clinically significant decreases in blood pressure. However, lisinopril treatment produced a mean reduction of 14 mmHg in sitting diastolic pressure compared with a 7 mmHg reduction for hydrochlorothiazide treatment. This difference was statistically significant. The decrease in the concentration of serum potassium during hydrochlorothiazide treatment was greater than that during lisinopril treatment (0.53 vs 0.01 mmol.1). The absolute value of serum potassium was significantly lower on hydrochlorothiazide than on lisinopril therapy. Neither treatment had an effect on serum magnesium concentrations, nor was there any significant effect of either treatment on urine volume or urinary excretion of sodium, potassium or magnesium. There was a trend towards increased total body potassium concentration on lisinopril compared with a decrease in total body potassium on hydrochlorothiazide. However, this difference was just outside the range of statistical significance. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. The results indicate slight superiority of lisinopril over hydrochlorothiazide with regard to control of diastolic blood pressure with a better effect on overall electrolyte balance.", 
    "227": "The effects of graded supine ergometry on blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma hormones were studied in 14 hypertensive heart transplant recipients before and after 2 weeks and 6 months of enalapril (20 mg/day) plus furosemide (20-80 mg/day) alone or combined with verapamil (120-360 mg/day). Each time, measurements were obtained at rest and at 25 and 50 W exercise. Antihypertensive therapy normalized blood pressure, while heart rate and the blood pressure response to exercise remained unaltered. Pretreatment resting plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were normal, while atrial natriuretic factor and cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations were elevated. All hormones increased significantly with exercise. During treatment, plasma renin activity increased and atrial natriuretic factor and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels decreased significantly, with a blunted exercise response; concentration of catecholamines increased significantly, with augmented exercise response. Thus, the chosen regimen allowed effective, lasting BP control in hypertensive transplant patients but was associated with significant changes in plasma hormones. Whereas the rise in plasma renin activity may be attributed to converting enzyme inhibition, the decreases in atrial natriuretic factor and cyclic guanosine monophosphate and increases in catecholamine levels seem to indicate marked changes in resting and particularly exercise hemodynamics during antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "228": "The pathogenesis of hypertension in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is unclear, but increased activity of the renin-angiotension system may contribute. The renal and systemic hemodynamic response to lisinopril, an angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in patients with ADPKD without renal failure was compared with the response in matched unaffected family members. Mean blood pressure and renal vascular resistance decreased in the affected group after lisinopril, with no significant change in the unaffected group. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unchanged and therefore filtration fraction fell significantly. Changes in urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and kallikrein suggested that increased renal synthesis of PGI2 or activation of the renal kallikrein-kinin system were not likely to be responsible for the hemodynamic effects. The acute decrease in renal vascular resistance without change in GFR suggests that ACE inhibition may have a particular value in the treatment of hypertension associated with ADPKD which should be assessed by further long-term studies.", 
    "229": "The effects of captopril on the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system were assessed from measurements in arterial plasma, renal venous plasma, and renal lymph from salt-depleted dogs. In the basal state, immunoreactive angiotensin II (Ang II) in renal venous plasma averaged only 60 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01) of arterial plasma, although the concentration of Ang II in renal lymph was 2.0 +/- 0.4-fold (P less than 0.05) greater. The Ang II concentration of renal lymph incubated ex vivo at 37 degrees C doubled in 10 to 15 min, which was the time taken to collect renal lymph samples. Compared with arterial plasma, renal lymph contained lower concentrations (P less than 0.01) of renin substrate and angiotensin-converting enzyme but higher concentrations of active (5.3 +/- 2.1-fold) and inactive (8.9 +/- 3.2-fold) renin. Although captopril increased the secretion of active renin into renal venous plasma by six-fold, the secretion of total renin was unchanged because of a reciprocal fall in the secretion of inactive renin. The percent reduction in renal vascular resistance with captopril correlated with the percent fall in Ang II in renal lymph (r = 0.70).", 
    "230": "(1) all components of the renin-angiotensin system are represented in the renal interstitium, as reflected in lymph; (2) Ang II concentrations in renal lymph in vivo approximate arterial levels; (3) increased secretion of active renin into plasma during intrarenal infusion of captopril into denervated kidneys is due predominantly to renin activation; and (4) renal vascular resistance may depend on the concentration of Ang II in the renal interstitium.", 
    "231": "We conducted a study to determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) inhibit endothelin secretion from cultured human endothelial cells. Confluent umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated in multi-well plates with culture medium containing either captopril (10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4) M) or enalaprilat (10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5) M) for 6 hours. Immunoreactive endothelin in the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Calf serum (CS) stimulated endothelin release in a concentration-dependent manner, and both ACEIs inhibited 5% CS-stimulated endothelin release in a concentration-dependent manner. To explore the mechanisms of ACEI-induced suppression of endothelin release, the effects of angiotensin II (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M), angiotensin converting enzyme (0.1, 1, 10 mU/ml), bradykinin (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M), and sodium nitroprusside (10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4) M) on endothelin release were also examined. Although angiotensin II and angiotensin converting enzyme had no significant effect on endothelin release, concentration-dependent suppression occurred with bradykinin and sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that ACEIs inhibit the stimulated release of endothelin from human endothelial cells, and provide indirect evidence that ACEI-induced ET suppression may be mediated via potentiation of autacoid formation from the cells.", 
    "232": "1-[(2s)-3-Mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L-proline (captopril), an antihypertensive and free radical scavenger, protected the rabbit lens from peroxidative and oxidative damage induced by 1 mM diquat in vitro. To evaluate the anticataract efficacy of captopril, an experimental group of five rabbits was treated with topical captopril (1% in 0.15 M NaCl, w/v), and 50 microliters was instilled onto both eyes four times a day for a total of 8 weeks. Following the same procedure, the eyes of five rabbits were treated with topical 0.15 M NaCl as a control for captopril treatment. At the end of the first week of treatment, a single intravitreal dose of 120 nmole diquat in 30 microliters of 0.15 M NaCl was injected into the right eye of each rabbit of both the groups. As a control for intravitreal diquat injection, the left eye of all the rabbits were injected with the diluent, 30 microliters per eye. The intravitreal diquat or its diluent injection was only for one time. From slit-lamp biomicroscopic observation of the diquat-injected right eyes, the anticataract effect of captopril in the treatment group was indicated by the finding that in four of five rabbits the cataract did not advance; whereas in four of five rabbits treated with the diluent the cataract progressed to grade 3. The lenses in the diluent-injected control left eyes of the rabbits treated with the captopril or diluent were normal. However, since the number of animals used for the in vivo studies was few, further confirmation of the anticataract effect of captopril is necessary. In diquat-injected right eyes of animals treated with captopril, the integrated rate of O2- production was about 50% less (p less than .001) in the aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and lens, compared with O2-, 33.49 +/- 2.26 microM (mean +/- SEM) in the aqueous humor, 17.12 +/- 0.75 microM in the vitreous humor, and 31.44 +/- 1.29 nmole/g wet weight in the lens of the diquat-injected right eyes treated with the diluent. Similar significant (p less than .01) differences in the production of .OH and H2O2 in eye tissues were also observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "233": "We describe our observations concerning differences in two groups of young hypertensive patients according to their renin activities after ACE inhibition. Seventeen of these patients (age 26 +/- 7 years), so far untreated, were investigated prospectively for hormone levels (renin, aldosterone, vasopressin), microalbuminuria, renal haemodynamics (inulin and PAH clearance) and signs of organ damage (echocardiography, fundoscopy). Secondary forms of hypertension were excluded by routine methods, including angiography. We differentiated two groups of young hypertensive patients. Group 1 (n = 9) had a false positive captopril test with elevated renin activities after ACE inhibition with captopril (8.4 +/- 5 ng/ml per hour) compared to group 2 (renin activity: 2.2 +/- 1.3 ng/ml per hour) or an increase of greater than 400% of renin activity after ACE inhibition. Baseline renin activities and sodium excretion did not differ between the groups. Group 1 also showed significantly greater GFR, FF, and microalbuminuria, as well as signs of organ damage, with left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive changes in fundoscopy. There were no differences between the groups concerning mean arterial blood pressure and duration of hypertension. In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that patients with highly stimulated renin activities showed signs of visceral organ damage and renal hyperfiltration compared to the normal renin activity group after ACE inhibition. Investigations of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ACE inhibitors might constitute a helpful indicator of renal changes and organ damages in young hypertensive patients.", 
    "234": "Changes in renal function caused by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be detected on 99mTc-DTPA renography so that DTPA scanning before and after a single dose of captopril can be used to screen for renovascular disease. We have performed captopril-DTPA scans with renal arteriography on 104 patients, of whom 27 had renal artery stenosis, all due to atheroma. Using a 5% fall in divided function or a delay of greater than 15 min in time to peak activity on one side after captopril, or the finding of greater than 90% divided function on one side before captopril as criteria for a positive scan, a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 70% was achieved. The negative predictive value of the test in our population was 93%. Bilateral improvement in renographic function after captopril was seen in patients with accelerated phase hypertension. The presence of bilateral renal artery disease did not reduce the sensitivity of the test, but sensitivity was reduced (75%) in patients with renal impairment. Clinical characteristics in our patients most strongly associated with renal artery stenosis were abdominal bruit, recurrent left ventricular failure, and peripheral vascular disease. In view of the well-publicized risks of ACE inhibitor therapy, care should be exercised in the use of these agents in such patients.", 
    "235": "During a 4-year period, acute renal failure was observed in 27 patients (mean age 65 years) treated by various angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension, heart failure, or a combination of both. None had significant renal artery stenosis on angiography. Overt volume depletion was present in 21 and hypotension in 12 cases. All patients received diuretic therapy and/or a low-salt diet. Other facilitating factors included cardiac failure, pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, combined therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and diabetes mellitus. Twenty-two patients had two or more of these factors at presentation. A renal biopsy performed in 10 cases showed severe arteriosclerosis of small renal arteries in eight and acute tubular necrosis in five instances. Therapy comprised volume expansion, and withdrawal of diuretics and, except in two patients, of ACE inhibitors. Twenty-one patients recovered normal renal function, two died, and permanent renal damage remained in four. These results suggest that sodium depletion has a critical role in inducing acute renal failure, whose outcome is not always benign. A combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors should be prescribed with caution, especially in older patients with small as well as with large renal vessel disease.", 
    "236": "We present a case in which a 39-year-old woman with correctable bilateral renovascular hypertension did not show abnormality during post-captopril technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) study. Post-captopril 99mTc-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) scintigraphy revealed the adverse effect of a stenosis of the artery supplying the upper part of her left kidney but failed to uncover the existence of severe multiple narrowings of the right renal artery. After bilateral renovascular reconstructive surgery, the hypertension completely disappeared. This case illustrates that DTPA may be more efficacious than DMSA in the detection of segmental loss of renal function induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.",

The study was multicentre (11 centres), open, random and carried out in parallel groups. After two weeks' placebo run in patients were randomly assigned to LIS 10-20 mg/o.d. or CAP 25-50 mg/b.i.d. treatment for 6 weeks. After this, patients with supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) greater than 90 mmHg were treated with the combinations LIS 20 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg/o.d. or CAP 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg/o.d. for 4 weeks; this dose was doubled if DBP was found to be greater than 90 mmHg after 2 weeks' combined therapy. A total of 175 patients were enrolled (92 females and 83 males) of which 153 completed the study. The LIS + HCTZ association caused a significant reduction of DBP in comparison to the other combined treatment (88.1 +/- 0.7 vs 90.3 +/- 0.7; p = 0.026). The statistical analysis of mean SBP values showed no significant difference between the two groups (144.0 +/- 1.3 vs 146.8 +/- 1.3; p = 0.15). At the end of the study 79.5% of patients treated with LIS + HCTZ presented normal results (DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg), whereas the percentage of similar results in the comparison group was 72%. The percentage of \"responder\" patients to therapy (DBP reduced by 10 mmHg or more in relation to basal values) was 96.3% in the LIS + HCTZ group and 86.7% in the CAP + HCTZ group. In the CAP + HCTZ group 0.6% of patients reported adverse reactions, while only 0.3% were observed in the LIS + HCTZ group.", 
    "238": "1. Perindopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was given to 23 hypertensive patients with stable chronic renal failure for 15 days. The dose of perindopril was 2 or 4 mg once a day according to the degree of renal failure. The creatinine clearance of the patients ranged from 6 to 67 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and perindoprilat, its active metabolite, were studied after acute and chronic administration of perindopril. 2. The drug was well tolerated and creatinine clearance was unaltered by treatment. 3. In both groups, steady-state was reached within 3 days of chronic treatment. 4. After both acute and chronic drug administration renal impairment had no effect on perindopril pharmacokinetics but the pharmacokinetics of perindoprilat were altered significantly. After chronic administration the serum accumulation ratio was 1.81 in patients with mild renal failure and 5.35 in patients with severe renal failure. Chronic administration did not modify the renal clearance of perindoprilat nor its elimination half-life. 5. A significant correlation between the renal clearance of perindoprilat and creatinine clearance was observed (r = 0.87 first dose, r = 0.83 last chronic dose). 6. A non-linear relationship between serum perindoprilat concentration and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme was described by a modified Hill equation. Values of IC50 were 1.11 +/- 0.07 micrograms I-1 (mean +/- s.d.) in patients with severe renal failure and 1.81 +/- 0.20 micrograms l-1 in patients with moderate renal failure.

    "239": "1. Some non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic patients show albuminuria without arterial hypertension. In these patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce urinary albumin excretion without producing any changes in systemic blood pressure and renal haemodynamics. However, up to now it has not been clear whether these favourable renal effects are specifically related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or not. 2. Twelve type II diabetic outpatients with persistent macroalbuminuria (greater than 300 mg/daily on at least three consecutive occasions), without any other signs of renal disease and whose blood pressure was persistently below 140/90 mmHg, were studied. 3. In a randomized sequence and in a double-blind fashion, after a 2-month run-in period, patients were allocated to receive 5 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of atenolol daily for the next 6 months. At the end of this first period and after 6 months on placebo in a cross-over fashion, active treatment was replicated. Blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were measured every 2 months, whereas the other variables studied were determined at the end of each period. 4. Kidney function and blood pressure did not change significantly, whereas albuminuria decreased significantly, after both of the drugs. 5. These data suggest that the inhibition of tissue angiotensin formation and the consequent reduction in glomerular permeability, rather than changes in renal and systemic haemodynamics, are the common mechanisms by which both enalapril and atenolol decreased albuminuria in our patients.", 
    "240": "Standard laboratory rats were maintained on a daily regimen involving deprivation of fluids for 22 h followed by a 2-h opportunity to drink water and a sweetened alcoholic beverage. Angiotensin II, in doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.25 mg/kg, dose relatedly decreased rats' mean intake of ethanol. All doses increased rats' mean intake of water. Angiotensin II, 0.25 mg/kg, reliably reduced intake of ethanol when it was presented alone during the 1st h of the daily 2-h drinking session, and reliably increased intake of water when it was subsequently presented alone during the 2nd h. Thus the reduction in intake of ethanol seen when the alcoholic beverage is presented concurrently with water is probably not merely due to the increase in intake of water. Lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg, dose relatedly decreased intake of ethanol, but only after several days of injections. Concurrent intake of water was increased dose relatedly. When injections of lisinopril ceased, intakes of both ethanol and water took several days to return to control levels. Pretreatment with lisinopril, 3.0 mg/kg, for 8 days, had no effect on subsequent intakes of either water or ethanol. Lisinopril, 3.0 mg/kg, had no effect on rats' intake of a sweet solution without ethanol. These results confirm previous work and extend the data base supporting the idea that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in modulating intake of ethanol.", 
    "241": "The purpose of this study was to determine if the changes in renal function acutely produced by an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the sodium-depleted conscious marmoset can be explained primarily by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Intravenous injection of a dose of the ACEI, enalaprilate (2 mg/kg), that produced a maximal lowering of blood pressure (BP), also decreased renal vascular resistance and increased renal blood flow. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged by enalaprilat, leading to a fall in the filtration fraction. In comparison, a dose of the renin inhibitory monoclonal antibody, R-3-36-16 (0.1 mg/kg), that also produced a maximal fall in BP, produced similar changes in renal hemodynamics to those observed after administration of the ACEI. Combined administration of 2 mg/kg enalaprilat and 0.1 mg/kg R-3-36-16 produced changes in BP and renal hemodynamics similar to those produced by the same doses of either agent administered alone. Enalaprilat (2 mg/kg) significantly increased urine volume (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). In contrast, these parameters were not significantly altered by 0.1 mg/kg R-3-36-16. However, when given at a 10-fold higher dose, the monoclonal antibody produced an increase in UNaV and UV identical to that produced by the ACEI alone. Enalaprilat did not increase UV and UNaV excretion to a greater extent than the high dose of the renin inhibitory antibody. These results demonstrate that acute administration of an ACEI affects BP and renal function in the sodium-depleted conscious primate primarily by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "242": "In an open two-month study with an initial placebo period, the effect of enalapril on glucose tolerance, insulin (IRI) sensitivity and lipid profile was evaluated in 20 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The following results were obtained: 1. Enalapril produced a favourable effect of blood pressure both in monotherapy and if combined with a diuretic. 2. Therapy did not lead to significant differences in blood glucose, IRI or IRI/glucose increase at 1 or 2 hours of oral glucose tolerance test either in patients with monotherapy or combination therapy, and with normal or disturbed glucose tolerance, respectively. 3. Serum lipids (total and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) did not change significantly in any group of patients.", 
    "243": "Glucose intolerance and noninsulin-dependent diabetes are commonly associated with hypertension. Epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. When hypertensive patients whether obese or of normal weight are compared with matched normotensive control subjects, an increased plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently observed. Studies using insulin glucose clamp techniques in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry have demonstrated that the insulin resistance in hypertensive subjects is located in muscles and restricted to glycogen synthesis. The relations between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure do not prove that the relationship is a causal one. However, at least four mechanisms may link hyperinsulinemia with hypertension: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Diuretics and beta-blockers may enhance insulin resistance, which is not affected by calcium antagonists, but decreased by the ACE inhibitor captopril. Weight reduction and regular physical exercise can improve insulin sensitivity and decrease blood pressure values. These nonpharmacological interventions should be more strongly recommended to diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive patients.", 
    "244": "Captopril and aspirin have been claimed to adversely affect renal function. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of concomitant administration of both drugs in patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure (CHF). The study group consisted of 10 patients with a mean age of 77.6 +/- 4.4 years and a mean New York Heart Association functional class of 2.6 +/- 0.5. Captopril was administered in a rapidly escalating dose regimen over a 4-day period to a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. Aspirin 0.25 g/day was added from day 5 on. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured by iodohippurate scan and the creatinine clearance test (Ccr) was used as an index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Both Ccr and RPF remained unchanged throughout the study period; 48.9 +/- 16; 48.2 +/- 16.5; 49.4 +/- 16, and 222 +/- 67, 241 +/- 97, 237 +/- 88 ml/min, for days 0, 4, 9, respectively. Only 1 patient developed a significant decrease in Ccr following the administration of captopril. This patient had a further decrease when aspirin was added. The decrease in Ccr was accompanied by a marked reduction in filtration fraction and in mean arterial pressure. Our data suggest that the administration of aspirin to elderly patients with moderate CHF treated with captopril is relatively safe and is not associated with further deterioration in renal function.", 
    "245": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are now widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. They are clearly as effective as other conventional antihypertensive agents in reducing blood pressure and combined with diuretics seem likely to transform current management of chronic heart failure. Myocardial infarction remains the major cause of death in patients with raised blood pressure and current studies should establish whether the attractive features of ACE inhibitors translate into reduction in the rate of infarction or its consequences. Similarly, whilst symptomatic benefit undoubtedly accrues from their use in heart failure it is less clear that they can prolong life particularly when used in the immediate setting of a myocardial infarction. Again a number of ongoing major trials are set to establish whether these drugs reduce death in patients with chronic heart failure (V-HeFT II, SOLVD) and in patients immediately after myocardial infarction (CONSENSUS II, SAVE,. AIRE, GISSI III and ISIS IV). The physician has a wide choice of ACE inhibitors with different pharmacological profiles for clinical use.",

Urinary sodium excretion was also measured at the same time points. There were no relevant differences in the 24-hour profiles of ANP and ADH. Ang II values dropped as expected on the first day of ramipril treatment from 11.2 pg/ml to 2.9 pg/ml at 3 h post administration and from 6.7 pg/ml (predose) to 1.8 pg/ml at 2 h post administration on day 15. Plasma aldosterone values increased slightly from day 1 to day 15, sodium excretion increased from 125.9 mmol to 166.5 mmol/24 h; however, both changes in the 24-hour profiles were nonsignificant. A clinically relevant improvement in the severity of CHF was observed. From a total of 121 reported symptoms according to McKee et al., 35 showed an improvement; 81 remained unchanged, in only 5 symptoms a deterioration was observed. According to the NYHA-classification 5 patients improved from grade III to II, 6 remained unchanged.",

The trial was conducted by 102 general practitioners in 770 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a response rate to a 4-week placebo therapy of 9.1%, 57.0% of patients given active treatment with ramipril responded to daily doses of 2.5 mg. Ramipril 5 mg daily was effective in 55.6% of the remaining patients.

In total, more than 90% of patients responded to treatment with ramipril by the end of the study. The incidence of adverse events was generally low, such as headache, cough, dizziness, asthenia, cramps and nausea. The incidence of cough appeared to be related both to the dosage of ramipril given and to outbreaks of influenza syndrome. Thirty-eight patients discontinued active treatment as a result of minor events such as cough, dizziness or diarrhoea, and one case each of myalgia and papular rash.

Echocardiographic follow-up could be obtained in 28 patients, 11 of whom showed more than a 10% increase in left ventricular systolic and/or diastolic volumes (captopril n = 3/15, placebo n = 8/13, p = 0.05). Volume increase was significantly associated with an impairment in exercise capacity (VO2 max in patients with vs. without volume enlargement 24.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 29.5 +/- 1.9 ml O2/kg/min; p < 0.05). Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II and catecholamines were normal in the acute and chronic postinfarction phase in patients on placebo as well as in patients 12-24 h after captopril intake. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (ANP) was increased immediately after myocardial infarction, but ANP levels almost normalized in patients with captopril treatment, while they continued to be elevated in patients on placebo. The only technical parameter able to predict left ventricular volume increases was the sphericity index (28.7 vs. 35.7; p = 0.07). We concluded that morphologic deformation and filling pressures as estimated from elevated ANP levels are major factors promoting remodelling following myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors might exert their favorable effect predominantly by reducing filling pressure.",

In the present study, echocardiography and Doppler cardiography were used to determine changes in cardiac size and transmitral filling dynamics over a 1-year period in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and determine the effect of captopril on these changes. The study population consisted of 27 patients with congestive heart failure in spite of therapy with digitalis and diuretics (NYHA class 3.2). Fifteen patients were started on placebo and 12 on captopril. Noninvasive evaluation was performed at 6-month intervals. Left ventricular size and left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly in either group. Forward stroke volume improved significantly only in patients on captopril compared to placebo (p < 0.05). No significant changes in transmitral flow dynamics were observed in the placebo group whereas the captopril-treated group showed a decrease in the peak velocity, flow velocity integral and rate of rapid filling wave (E) and an increase in the peak, integral and rate of filling during atrial contraction (A). The E/A ratio did not change significantly over time in the placebo group, whereas a reduction in the ratio was noted in the captopril-treated patients. These changes are sustained over 1 year with concomitant improvement in stroke volume, exercise duration and functional class.", 
    "252": "We consider the situation where a multiple-dose, combination-drug clinical trial is conducted to identify one or more combinations that satisfy regulatory requirements. Generally, these requirements involve a compound hypothesis with multiple comparisons. The min test has been shown to be an optimal alpha-level test for testing a single combination drug. Analysis procedures in a multiple-dose, combination-drug study have typically involved classical ANOVA models or multiple regression models in a response surface methodology (RSM) framework. An inferential procedure based on an ANOVA model uses a screening test to address multiple comparison issues and multiple min tests to explicitly identify combinations satisfying regulatory requirements. An exploratory procedure based on RSM modeling is used to build a segmented linear model and a stairstep linear model to describe dose-response relationships. The two procedures are mutually supportive of one another in providing a broader assurance in the identification of effective combinations.",

Ninety-eight double blind randomized patients (86 men and 12 women) showing symptoms of AMI anterior and undergoing thrombolytic treatment were admitted to our study and subdivided into 4 groups. Group A (25 pts) received thrombolytic treatment only, Group B (23 pts) received 3 g GL intravenously 15 min before thrombolysis and for 2 h thereafter, Group C (26 pts) received 6.25 mg CA orally 15 min before starting thrombolytic treatment, Group D (24 pts) received 3 g GL intravenously before thrombolysis and for 2 h thereafter, and captopril as well like group C. On the third day after AMI onset groups A and B received CA also. In all groups, the doses of CA were gradually increased according to blood pressure values. The following features were considered: a) the occurrence of early (within the first 2 h after thrombolysis) ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmias; b) CK peak; c) the normalization time of CK peak (NT); d) the occurrence of late ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmias (VHA) in the predischarge Holter test (Lown's class 2); e) ejection fraction (EF) being measured in 60 pts undergoing haemodynamic test.

    "254": "Hypertension is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which is a structural adaptation of the heart in order to attenuate the systolic stress on the left ventricle. As cardiac myocytes cannot divide, they increase in mass and volume, probably by activating second messengers and proto-oncogenes involved in cellular differentiation and proliferation. Various mechanisms, such as pressure overload and angiotensin II (Ang II), have been proposed to trigger cardiocyte growth and left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In both cases, activation of second messenger routes which increase the intracellular calcium concentration, protooncogene expression, and protein synthesis have been demonstrated. Ang II also facilitates the action of another trophic agent for cardiocytes, which is noradrenaline (NA). In addition, the prevention and reversal of LVH by inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) suggests a key role for Ang II. However, no conclusive evidence has demonstrated the role of a single pathophysiologic factor in LVH. Therefore, it is more attractive to suggest a link between high blood pressure, renin-angiotensin and other vasoactive systems, such as the adrenergic system, which might together lead in a synergistic way to cardiac hypertrophy.",

In recent years we have studied the effects of nutrients and drugs with antioxidant properties on the development of the cardiomyopathy. We have found that treatment of the Mg-deficient animals with alpha-tocopherol, a naturally-occurring antioxidant, significantly diminishes the number and size of lesions. In addition, treatment with lipophilic drugs with antioxidant properties (probucol, propranolol) or water-soluble drugs that scavenge hydroxyl radicals (captopril, epicaptopril), also provided significant protection. In view of these findings, we suggest that chronic hypomagnesemia results in a pro-inflammatory condition leading to excessive production of oxygen-derived free radicals.

    "258": "Six hundred and sixty-seven hypertensive patients were analyzed by captopril-enhanced scintigraphy. If time to reach maximal activity (Tmax) was > or = 5 min using 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or > or = 3 min with 123I-o-iodohippurate (OIH) and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and washout time > or = 15 min, a control study with nifedipine was performed. If the difference between Tmax under captopril and nifedipine premedication was > or = 5 min with 99mTc-DTPA or > or = 3 min with 123I-OIH and 99mTc-MAG3, the renogram was defined highly suggestive of renovascular hypertension. In the evaluation of bilateral abnormalities an additional parameter was considered, i.e. the presence of functional asymmetry of the emuntories susceptible of partial reversal in the control study under nifedipine. Based on these criteria, 58 out of 667 (8.7%) scintigrams were found to be abnormal. Thirty-five of these 58 patients and 32 of the remaining 609 scintigraphically negative cases underwent additional arteriographic examination. A renal vascular stenosis > or = 50% was found in 33 out of 35 (94.2%) patients with positive scintigraphy and in 3 out of 32 patients with negative scintigraphy. By examining results of the 67 patients undergoing arteriography, the sensitivity of captopril-enhanced scintigraphy was estimated to be 91.6%, with a specificity of 93.5%, an accuracy of 92.5%, and predictive values of a positive or negative result of 94.2 and 90.6%, respectively. By restricting analysis to bilateral stenosis, sensitivity was found to be 76.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "259": "Treatment of chronic heart failure with ACE-inhibitors has greatly improved the prognosis. In addition to ACE-inhibitors, diuretics seem to be necessary to decrease mortality, whereas the importance of cardiac glycosides has not been demonstrated unequivocally. Nevertheless, modern treatment of chronic heart failure in all stages should be a combination of diuretics, digitalis, and ACE-inhibitors rather than a stepwise addition of drugs depending on the severity of the disease. An increased heart rate leads to increased myocardial O2-consumption, decreased O2-supply, ischemia, and reduced contractility. Betablocker-induced reduction of heart rate does, however, not necessarily improve symptoms or hemodynamic conditions. The optimal heart rate in large failing hearts is not known yet. Probably, it is dependent on the type and severity of myocardial disease or impairment. In this respect, the sarcoplasmatic release and uptake of Ca2+ plays the most important role in the disordered force-frequency-relation in chronic heart failure.", 
    "260": "The use of ACE-inhibitors in patients with severe congestive heart failure is established on the basis of the results of the CONSENSUS I-study, which has shown that ACE-inhibitors in patients in NYHA class IV not only have improved functional parameters, but also improved survival. Recently published controlled data from studies including patients with mild to moderate heart failure (SOLVD-study) show a significant improvement of mortality in this subgroup. Comparing placebo and ACE-inhibitors, the effect of ACE-inhibitors on mortality is due to a reduction of progression of pump failure. Comparing vasodilator-therapy (hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate) and ACE-inhibition in the V-HeFT II-trial showed, despite a transient increase in ejection fraction and exercise capacity during the vasodilator-therapy, a significant improvement in survival in the patients treated with an ACE-inhibitor. This was achieved by a reduction of the incidence of sudden cardiac death. From these recent data it can be concluded that ACE-inhibition is the therapy of choice in patients with mild to severe heart failure.", 
    "261": "ACE-inhibitors improve symptoms and prognosis in patients with heart failure. The V-Heft II trial has demonstrated that the beneficial effect of these agents is superior to unspecific vasodilators. Besides sustained arterial and venous vasodilation the inhibition of the neurohumoral axis is thought to play an important role. Angiotensin II and catecholamines not only exert vasoconstrictor effects, but might also contribute to vascular and myocardial growth. Thus, it may not be surprising that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in heart failure only emerge during long-term therapy rather than after short-term administration. It has been shown that these agents improve blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise after chronic therapy (not acutely), and there is some preliminary evidence that improvement of endothelial function might be involved in this effect, i.e., by reducing the degradation of bradykinin, an endothelial vasodilator. ACE inhibitors reduce LV hypertrophy, an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and prognosis. Moreover, there is experimental evidence that ACE inhibitors can prevent and even reverse interstitial fibrosis in the left ventricle. Although the plasma renin activity may be normal in patients with chronic heart failure, recent data using polymerase chain reaction indicate that the tissue cardiac renin angiotensin system is activated in the failing human heart as assessed by measurements of angiotensin converting enzyme mRNA and angiotensinogen mRNA which may be an important target for ACE-inhibition.", 
    "262": "Preventive therapy by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is considered in hypertension and, more recently, in chronic heart failure. The mechanism of action of ACE-inhibitors is complex; most extensively studied, however, is their inhibitory effect on angiotensin-II production. ACE-inhibitors may act as vasodilators, reducing pre- and afterload. On the other hand, local renin-angiotensin systems may control growth processes both in myocardial and in smooth muscle cells. This may be another site of action for ACE-inhibitors. ACE-inhibitors are reliable antihypertensive drugs and may have additional specific effects on the heart and vascular smooth muscle. Clear evidence is, however, missing for their superiority above other drugs in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Most recently, the data of the \"study of left-ventricular dysfunction\" (SOLVD) and \"survival and ventricular enlargement\" (SAVE) study became available. These studies showed that ACE-inhibitors could prevent the incidence of heart failure in about one-third of patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction during 3 years of observation when compared with placebo treated patients. A new indication, therefore, for ACE-inhibitors could be left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. It remains unclear 1) what could be the adequate diagnostic procedures to identify patients for preventive treatment, 2) when therapy should be started, 3) about the duration of therapy, 4) about the doses of ACE-inhibitors for this indication, 5) what will be the side-effects when used in a broader population, and 6) will this prevention of heart failure be a specific effect of ACE-inhibitors?", 
    "263": "Arterial hypertension is the most frequent cause of a disturbance of coronary microcirculation. Inspite of having normal epicardial coronary arteries, patients with arterial hypertension often have symptoms of angina pectoris and a positive exercise tolerance test. The angina pectoris symptoms in patients with arterial hypertension are due to functional and structural alterations of the coronary microcirculation. Consequently, an antihypertensive therapy should not only aim at lowering blood pressure and reversing myocardial hypertrophy, but also to improve coronary microcirculation in order to avoid the consequences of chronic ischemia on the myocardium. Until now, only experimental studies have indicated that antihypertensive therapy can improve coronary flow reserve. To determine (also under clinical conditions) if coronary flow reserve can be improved, in 30 hypertensive patients maximal coronary blood flow, minimal coronary resistance, and coronary reserve (dipyridamol) were studied before and after a long-term antihypertensive treatment (9-12 months) with an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril 10-20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem 120-180 mg/d) and a beta 1-selective beta-receptor-blocker (bisoprolol 5-10 mg/d). To assess the chronic effects rather than the acute effects of the antihypertensive pharmacon, coronary microcirculation was studied after intermission of medical therapy for a period of 1 week. Along with a comparable decrease in LV muscle mass, coronary reserve was improved after enalapril by 48%, after diltiazem by 48%, and after bisoprolol by 22%. It is possible that the observed increase in coronary reserve is related to the reversal of structural vascular abnormalities on the level of the coronary microcirculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "264": "24 hour blood pressure monitoring is a well established method in the field of antihypertensive research. Patients self recorded blood pressure values are an additional option to overcome the disadvantages of casual office readings--however they are not frequently used within intervention trials. To prove the usefulness of selfrecordings in clinical trials we investigated both selfrecordings taken twice a day and casual readings within intervals of 1 to 3 weeks, in this study on the efficacy and tolerability of the ACE-inhibitor Accupro. 108 hypertensive patients (grade WHO I to II) were included in this trial for ten weeks. Although blood pressures were measured by the patients using sphygmomanometers of the same type and the physicians, decisions to treat or to increase dosage were based on the patients' recordings only. Accupro was dispensed according to the package leaflet at a daily dosage of 5 mg up to 40 mg. In case of failing response to monotherapy, Accupro was combined with Diltiazem or with a diuretic. 7 patients discontinued the treatment due to mild adverse events, one did not cooperate. 82 of the remaining patients were treated effectively with Accupro monotherapy--60 (73%) got one dose daily, 22 (27%) 2 doses per day,--and in 18 patients a drug combination was required. Therapeutic response (RRd < or = 90 mm Hg) was gained within 86 of the 100 evaluable patients according to the doctors' and 83 according to the patients' records. In this respect the two methods used gave comparable overall results. This somewhat surprising fact is due to the design of the study, because treatment decisions were based on the selfrecordings only. Clinical trials based on selfrecordings are in some points preferable to casual office readings: As patients being normotensive at home should not be included into an interventional study, a change of dosage within this group is avoided. Additionally the compliance of a cooperative patient taking his blood pressure twice daily is at a high level. Measurements of each single patient may be evaluated statistically by time series-analysis regarding longterm distribution of blood pressure-values. Taking the means of selfrecordings over adequate time-intervals eliminates the influence of \"outliers\" (occasionally extremely high or low values) and also reduces the standard deviation compared to that of the casual readings. Research work based on self recordings provides more information and therefore more security for treatment decisions.", 
    "265": "It has been proven that treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) with some modern drugs is able to reduce mortality in groups of patients with the severest grades of this disease. The risk of sudden death has been unchanged, however. Out of 49 patients on long-term follow-up, 28 patients are surviving (group A) and 21 died (group B). 52.3% of the dead patients died suddenly. Eight patients in NYHA classes I-II died, all of them suddenly. Contrary to this, sudden death was the cause of death only in three of 13 patients in NYHA classes III-IV (p < 0.001). More severe heart failure was present in group B (NYHA class 2.95 +/- 0.96 vs. 2.18 +/- 0.48 in group A--p < 0.1). Antiarrhythmic drugs were given more frequently in group B (in 47.6% of pts vs. 17.9% in group A--p < 0.05). It is concluded that the occurrence of sudden death is higher in patients with less severe forms of CHF and has not been reduced by the means employed. Use of antiarrhythmic drugs may be dangerous and their indication should be based on results of a comprehensive examination. Use of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator seems to be the most promising approach in indicated cases.", 
    "266": "The prognosis of patients with advanced left heart failure is fairly dismal. It was not until recently that studies were conducted demonstrating the poor prognosis can be modulated by drug therapy. Of the many vasodilators tested, positive data have emerged only from trials of high-dose nitrates with hydralazine and, most importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors believed to constitute the biggest step forward in the treatment of chronic heart failure. The agents included in this group improve the symptomatology, increase exercise tolerance and improve the prognosis. At present, they are indicated in cases of severe heart failure, and the potential of their use in the more severe forms as well as in patients after myocardial infarction is being intensively investigated. Still, diuretic remain the mainstay of drug therapy. The role of digitalis in the treatment of heart failure is being currently reviewed; its administration is unnecessary in most patients, especially those with maintained sinus rhythm. A number of other positive inotropic drugs, both catecholamine-based agents and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone, xamoterol, enoximone) have been tested. Their effect in the chronic form, unlike acute failure, is controversial, and there is no evidence documenting improved prognosis; some studies even show an adverse trend. As almost 50% of patients with heart failure die suddenly, it would have been only logical to administer antiarrhythmics to them. However, no data demonstrating an improved prognosis are available either. Results of studies conducted to date have proved to be rather disappointing, and a study with the most promising antiarrhythmic drug--amiodarone--is still under way.", 
    "267": "Impaired left ventricular diastolic function is often found preceding systolic functional abnormality in coronary artery disease. To assess whether captopril improves diastolic function, radionuclide ventriculography was performed before and 1 h after captopril administration in 10 stable effort angina patients with severe isolated stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and in 8 controls. Resting global peak filling rate (PFR) was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in association with significantly (p < 0.01) increased left ventricular diastolic asynchronous index (delta t) in patients with angina pectoris. Neither global PFR nor regional cardiac function was affected by captopril, although delta t was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced from 70 +/- 18 (SD) to 51 +/- 25 ms in patients with angina pectoris. A significant (p < 0.01) correlation was observed between percentage changes in peak ejection rate and in PFR in all subjects. Thus, captopril improves left ventricular asynchrony in patients with stable angina, although global diastolic function affected by systolic function remains unchanged.", 
    "268": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of enalapril on the frequency of ventricular premature beats in patients with congestive heart failure. The study group consisted of 30 patients with a mean age of 47 +/- 0.6 years with chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA classes III and IV) due to primary dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiomyopathy in the course of ischaemic heart disease. Initial therapy with digitalis and diuretics was supplemented with enalapril at a dose of 5-20 mg daily. Initially and at three months after enalapril, the following parameters were evaluated: NYHA functional class, the presence of premature ventricular beats in 24-hour ECG recording and left ventricular function by echocardiography. The scheduled therapy was completed by 23 patients; in 5 patients, the intake was discontinued because of hypotension, one patient died after 14 days due to worsening heart failure, and one patient was submitted for pacemaker implantation. Clinical improvement manifesting itself by a shift to lower NYHA classes was found in 20 patients. A reduced number of premature ventricular beats was observed in 52% of the patients. Termination of cardiac arrhythmias, especially of complex beats, was parallel to the circulatory improvement.", 
    "269": "Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is now recognized in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, essential hypertension, obesity, atherosclerotic heart disease, dyslipidemia, heart failure, and in heavy smokers. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and its relationship to hypertension; reduced sodium excretion, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased activity of the sodium/hydrogen pump, and stimulation of cellular growth. Some of the nonpharmacological methods to control hyperinsulinemia are of benefit in the management of hypertension, most notably weight loss, exercise program, and reduced salt intake. High-fiber and reduced-protein diets also reduce hyperinsulinemia. Thiazide diuretics can result in insulin resistance, and insulin secretion may be inhibited, possibly associated with concomitant hypokalemia. beta-Blockers result in some reduction of glucose tolerance and mask some of the features of hypoglycemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha-receptor blockers do not effect insulin resistance; probably the same is true for calcium antagonists. Although the effect on risk factors should not be discounted, it is the effect of treatment on hard end points, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, or death that is most important. Evidence in hypertension is at present restricted to diuretics and beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "270": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure; both conditions are complicated by resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The defect in essential hypertension is both tissue and pathway specific, i.e., confined to nonoxidative (glycogen synthetic) routes of intracellular glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, whereas heart failure and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are associated with more widespread abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, the mechanisms of the insulin resistance in hypertension, NIDDM, and heart failure are fundamentally different, so metabolic responses to drug therapy may not be the same in all insulin-resistant states. There have been conflicting reports about the effects of ACE inhibitors on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. A number of studies, both with captopril and with enalapril, have shown small increases in insulin sensitivity, and there is evidence that this is due to enhanced glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. The interpretation of these studies, however, is often compromised by poor trial design, lack of full placebo data, various indirect measurements of insulin sensitivity, and heterogeneous patient populations in whom the biochemical mechanisms of insulin resistance (and drug responses) may not be the same. Overall, there probably is a modest class effect of ACE inhibitors that enhances insulin-mediated glucose disposal; the mechanism of this effect is likely to be a combination of increased muscle blood flow, local renin-angiotensin system blockade, and elevated kinin levels.", 
    "271": "During the past decade, it became obvious that in contrast to defective insulin secretion in type I diabetes, defective insulin action (insulin resistance) is the most pertinent feature of type II diabetes. In addition, it has been known for a long time that obesity and insulin resistance are closely linked. Recently, hypertension also has been shown to often coincide with insulin resistance, although any causal relationships are still hypothetical. Last, several widely used pharmacological drugs such as diuretics, adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may influence insulin sensitivity. Therefore, growing interest has emerged to most accurately measure insulin sensitivity. Although considerable knowledge has accumulated as to the actual mechanisms of insulin-dependent glucose transport, the signal transduction pathway of insulin remains poorly understood. When insulin sensitivity is measured, it is the overall glucose uptake that is quantified under controlled conditions. Other actions of insulin, such as the transport of ions, (e.g., sodium and potassium), synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, translocation of transporter proteins, and regulation of enzyme activities, are much more difficult to quantify. Of the many approaches used to quantify insulin action, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique has emerged as the most reliable tool, fulfilling clinical and scientific demands equally. In combination with tracer methodology and calorimetry, a detailed view into the quantitative aspects of insulin action at different target cells is possible. Whether insulin resistance extends to other known actions of insulin in addition to those on glucose metabolism remains open to debate.", 
    "272": "The potential beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may be compromised by their adverse effects on serum lipid levels. In our study we compared verapamil and captopril and evaluated their effects on blood pressure and on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, with particular attention to lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. 20 hypertensive patients were treated with sustained release verapamil 240mg once daily or captopril 25mg twice daily for 3 months in a double-blind randomised study. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced from 100 +/- 3mm Hg to 87 +/- 6mm Hg (p < 0.01) and from 100 +/- 5mm Hg to 92 +/- 7mm Hg (p < 0.05) in the verapamil and captopril groups, respectively. Small but significant changes in serum lipid levels were noted: total cholesterol was reduced from 6 to 5.8 mmol/L (verapamil) and from 6.1 to 5.9 mmol/L (captopril); low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced from 4 to 3.8 mmol/L (verapamil) and from 4.2 to 3.9 mmol/L (captopril); apolipoprotein C-III was reduced from 0.3 +/- 0.07 to 0.2 +/- 0.06 mmol/L (9.7 +/- 2.5 to 9.2 +/- 2.3 mg/dl) [verapamil] and from 0.2 +/- 0.1 to 0.2 +/- 0.09 mmol/L (9.1 +/- 3.7 to 8.3 +/- 3.4 mg/dl) [captopril]; apolipoprotein A-II increased only with verapamil (p < 0.02). Lp(a) levels showed only minor changes in individual patients. In conclusion, in our study verapamil and captopril were effective antihypertensive agents and did not adversely effect the lipid profile.", 
    "273": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of diuretic-free antihypertensive therapy with a calcium antagonist and/or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in patients with diabetes mellitus. 54 hypertensive [blood pressure (BP) above 140/90mm Hg] patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 (n = 7) or 2 (n = 47) and normal serum creatinine levels (mean 82 +/- 6 mumol/L) received either verapamil or enalapril after a 2-week washout and a 4-week placebo phase. If BP remained elevated, both agents were combined. Verapamil or enalapril alone normalised diastolic BP (to less than 90mm Hg) in 36 patients; verapamil decreased BP from 159/98 to 147/87mm Hg (n = 19, p < 0.001) and enalapril decreased BP from 166/99 to 146/88mm Hg (n = 17, p < 0.001). In 18 patients who remained hypertensive after 10 weeks of monotherapy, a combination of both drugs decreased BP from 169/104 to 151/90mm Hg (p < 0.001). Overall, 87% of patients achieved a target BP response at 30 weeks. Urinary albumin as related to creatinine excretion (UAE; micrograms albumin:mg creatinine) was on average not significantly changed after verapamil or enalapril treatment, alone or combined. Nevertheless, in patients with initial microalbuminuria, UAE decreased (p < 0.05) during enalapril treatment. Serum potassium, total lipids, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin, serum C peptide and fructosamine levels were not significantly modified by treatment. Subjective tolerability of the drugs was also generally good. Thus, in hypertensive patients with diabetes, a diuretic-free therapy based on the calcium antagonist verapamil or the ACE inhibitor enalapril, alone or combined, can effectively decrease BP without adversely affecting carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.", 
    "274": "Patients with essential arterial hypertension demonstrate abnormal vasodilator capacity either during increased cardiac metabolic demand or during pharmacological vasodilation. Structural and functional damage to the coronary microcirculation has been proposed as one of the major causes of impaired coronary reserve in this disease. To assess the role of microvascular impairment in regional myocardial blood flow (MBF), 27 patients with essential hypertension were evaluated by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) at rest, during atrial pacing and after dipyridamole infusion and compared with 13 healthy subjects. All patients had normal coronary arteries, 17 had moderate to severe hypertension and 10 had mild hypertension. Baseline mean MBF of 0.97 +/- 0.25 ml/min/g was significantly increased to 1.60 +/- 0.38 during atrial pacing and 2.35 +/- 0.95 after dipyridamole infusion (p < 0.01); however, mean flow during atrial pacing and after dipyridamole infusion was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (2.15 +/- 0.73 and 3.71 +/- 0.86 ml/min/g, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The MBF response to atrial pacing and dipyridamole infusion was similarly depressed in patients with mild and severe hypertension. The study was repeated after 6 months of antihypertensive treatment with the calcium antagonist verapamil or the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in a subgroup of 20 patients as part of a randomised, single-blind clinical trial. This study is still in progress; the initial 16 patients treated with verapamil or enalapril showed an obvious improvement in MBF values during atrial pacing and after dipyridamole infusion after 6 months of therapy (mean MBF: 2.10 +/- 0.64 and 2.99 +/- 1.63 ml/min/g, respectively, p < 0.05 vs pretreatment values). In conclusion, obvious impairment of MBF during atrial pacing and after dipyridamole infusion was observed in hypertensive patients with normal coronary arteries and this appeared unrelated to the severity of hypertension. Therapy with verapamil or enalapril improved coronary reserve and MBF response to an increase in myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "275": "This paper reviews the evidence that, in patients with hypertension, end-organ damage correlates more closely with blood pressure values obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring than with those obtained by conventional sphygmomanometry. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not suitable for routine use in the clinical setting because of a lack of standard reference values and data regarding the prognostic significance of this method. Ambulatory blood pressure values are reproducible and this method avoids the so-called placebo effect; thus, this method is useful in clinical studies investigating the efficacy and duration of action of antihypertensive drugs. Data from 1 study in which hypertensive patients were treated with slow release verapamil 240 mg, enalapril 20 mg, nitrendipine 20 mg and placebo, given once daily for 8 weeks according to a double-blind parallel group design, showed that mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was reduced by all 3 drugs compared with placebo. Verapamil and enalapril showed similar antihypertensive efficacy and both drugs reduced night-time blood pressure more effectively than nitrendipine.", 
    "276": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important risk factor for sudden death and other cardiovascular morbidity and mortality irrespective of the level of arterial blood pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy, i.e. an increase in wall thickness at the expense of left ventricular volume, is an adaptive mechanism observed in patients with long standing arterial hypertension. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a reduction in left ventricular compliance, impaired coronary reserve, ventricular ectopy, and impaired contractile function. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be reduced by antihypertensive therapy; however, not all antihypertensive agents have the same effect on left ventricular hypertrophy despite their similar effects on arterial blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to be the most powerful agents for reducing left ventricular hypertrophy, followed by the nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists. In addition to reducing left ventricular mass and arterial blood pressure, certain calcium antagonists also improve left ventricular filling, suppress ventricular ectopy, and maintain or enhance contractile function. However, despite these beneficial effects, it is not known whether the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality can be prevented or reduced by specific antihypertensive agents.", 
    "277": "The effects of calcium antagonists on psychological well-being, cognitive function, activity and physical symptoms in hypertensive patients are reviewed. Effects on these aspects of quality of life appear to differ according to whether a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist such as nifedipine is employed or verapamil, which is a phenylalkylamine derivative. Nifedipine has been associated with a self-assessment of impaired cognitive function in 2 clinical trials. Nifedipine was also associated with more symptomatic complaints than both atenolol and verapamil in different studies. The problems with nifedipine centred on oedema, flushing and palpitations. Verapamil was associated with constipation. Compared with other classes of antihypertensive drugs, the position of calcium antagonists with respect to the maintenance of patients' quality of life is presently unclear. Verapamil has been associated with improved quality of life compared with propranolol (a beta-blocker) and nifedipine. Verapamil appears to have similar effects on quality of life as atenolol and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. The position of nifedipine remains unclear.", 
    "278": "Fosinopril, the first agent in a new chemical class of phosphorus-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, has unique pharmacologic properties. Fosinopril administration leads to complete inhibition of plasma ACE activity for 12-24 h. In patients with normal renal function, approximately equal amounts of the drug are eliminated via the hepatic and renal routes. With worsening renal function, increasing amounts of fosinopril are eliminated hepatically. This dual elimination allows for the administration of fosinopril using the same starting dosage to any patient, regardless of renal function. Fosinopril may provide end-organ protection against the effects of hypertension and antihypertensive therapy; this drug potentially protects the kidney by increasing renal functional reserve, while maintaining cardiac left ventricular performance. Moreover, despite marked blood reductions, cerebral blood flow is maintained. Controlled trials show that fosinopril in single daily doses of 10-40 mg is efficacious and safe for the long-term treatment of hypertension. At these doses, favorable responses were seen in up to 80% of patients. Fosinopril is equally effective in elderly as well as younger patients and works in black as well as in nonblack patients. The incidence of adverse events does not differ significantly between fosinopril- and placebo-treated patients. Fosinopril represents a clinically useful agent for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "279": "The past decade has seen a shift in the strategy for hypertension treatment from stepped therapy--a highly structured monolithic series of steps--to recommendations for a more individualized selection of treatment. Severe hypertension is a clear indicator to bypass traditional steps. Demographic factors, such as age, gender, and race, are often cited, but have proved to be less helpful. Concomitant medical conditions and problems are very common and are more often the crucial determinants in the selection of antihypertensive therapy. Coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, azotemia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary artery disease, anxiety, and depression are all common, and each has implications for the selection of antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure reduction is a surrogate for reduction of cardiovascular risk, and therefore, consideration of concomitant medical problems has extended to left ventricular hypertrophy, obesity, mild hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, as additional risk factors in hypertension. Consideration of all these factors makes it possible to individualize antihypertensive therapy in most patients today.", 
    "280": "The goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with high blood pressure. Despite our ability to reduce blood pressure, \"standard\" antihypertensive therapy has not produced a general decrease in coronary heart disease. This failure might be related to the adverse metabolic consequences of diuretics and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents used in most clinical trials. In the hypertensive patient population, however, the principal physiologic abnormality is increased systemic vascular resistance. This increase in vascular tone leads to compensatory changes in cardiac function that result in left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic filling abnormalities. Diastolic ventricular dysfunction is present in approximately 50% of asymptomatic hypertensive patients and might be a precursor of the syndrome of congestive heart failure with normal systolic ventricular function. In view of the prevalence of diastolic filling abnormalities in the hypertensive patient population, one should consider the effect of an antihypertensive drug on left ventricular function. In a comparison of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, lisinopril, and fosinopril, only fosinopril increased stroke volume, peak ejection rate, and peak filling rate, and decreased time to peak ejection rate. These favorable inotropic and lusitropic responses to fosinopril may reflect an effect on the myocardial renin-angiotensin cascade which is dependent upon the unique chemical structure of the fosinopril molecule.", 
    "281": "Although there is impressive documentation linking severe hypertension to renal insufficiency, corresponding data for mild-to-moderate hypertension are only now starting to emerge. As a result, it is only now becoming evident that a much larger portion of the hypertensive population could be susceptible to drug accumulation owing to renal insufficiency. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy routinely requires dosage adjustment in the instance of renal insufficiency, as all currently marketed ACE inhibitors are renally eliminated. Such dosage adjustments are usually considered a way to minimize side effects and to limit the duration of any induced hypotension. Dosage adjustment is usually considered at creatinine clearance levels between 30 and 60 ml/min. This is somewhat problematic, as physicians generally rely on serum creatinine determinations to assess renal function, and serum creatinine values are notoriously poor predictors of actual creatinine clearance. This is particularly true in the elderly population, where a greater disparity between the serum creatinine and creatinine clearance commonly exists, with moderate renal insufficiency frequently going unrecognized. Thus, the development of other ACE inhibitors eliminated via renal/hepatic routes may prove to be advantageous in that dosage adjustments might not be required in the setting of declining renal function, whether age-related or not. Fosinopril, a new phosphorus-containing ACE inhibitor, is administered as a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to the pharmacologically active diacid, fosinoprilat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "282": "The course and prognosis of chronic renal failure are much worse in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients with otherwise similar basic disease. Therefore, antihypertensive measures with a combination of diuretics, beta-blockers, and vasodilators have clearly been shown to improve the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has also been shown to have a favorable effect on the prognosis of chronic renal failure. In the past few years, more knowledge about the pathogenesis of hypertension and the development of hypertension-induced organ damage has been followed by changing attitudes to antihypertensive therapy and the introduction of calcium antagonists for the treatment of hypertension, even in chronic renal failure. ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists seem to be advantageous in the prognosis of chronic renal failure as they act on the humoral and trophogenic factors now known to be important in antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "283": "The antihypertensive efficacy of the new dihydropyridine derivative nilvadipine given once daily was compared in two randomized, double-blind studies with that of hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (HCT/T) and of enalapril. In the first study, arterial pressures were compared after 4 weeks of therapy with nilvadipine (16 mg q.d.) or HCT/T (25/50 mg q.d.) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in a parallel-group design. The combination of both treatments was administered after 4 weeks if diastolic arterial pressures were > 90 mm Hg. The blood pressure (BP) in the nilvadipine group (n = 125) was 161/102 +/- 17/7 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg after a 2-week placebo period and decreased after 4 weeks by -16/-13 +/- 22/12 mm Hg. The BP decreased in the HCT/T group (n = 124) compared to the nilvadipine group to a similar degree (p = 0.91, n.s.) from 160/103 +/- 17/8 mm Hg by -17/-13 +/- 18/11 mm Hg. A combination therapy was started after 4 weeks in 39 patients in the nilvadipine group and in 34 patients in the HCT/T group. This led independently of the treatment sequence, to a similar decrease in BP in the nilvadipine group (-17/7 +/- 16/10 mm Hg) and in the HCT/T group (-12/9 +/- 16/9 mm Hg). In the second study, the antihypertensive effect of nilvadipine (1 x .8 mg) was compared with that of enalapril (1 x 10 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Sixty-one patients with essential hypertension (WHO I-II) were treated over two 4-week periods following placebo periods of 2 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "284": "One of the earliest structural changes in the heart adapting to hypertension is left ventricular hypertrophy, which can now be exactly measured by echocardiography. Left ventricular hypertrophy increases the incidence of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and sudden death severalfold, independent of the blood pressure levels. Left ventricular hypertrophy requires specific antihypertensive therapy that controls both high blood pressure and increased left ventricular mass. Preliminary data from clinical studies indicate that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy leads to a better cardiovascular prognosis. Sympatholytic substances, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists are antihypertensive agents that effected adequate reductions in blood pressure as well as regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "285": "In vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) cultures from Sprague-Dawley (SD) and hypertensive transgenic rats for the mouse renin gene Ren-2 (TGR), the DNA synthesis, which was analyzed by the uptake of [3H]thymidine, was higher in TGR than SD VSMCs (2.5- to 8-fold, mean of 5.6-fold) under basal conditions. DNA synthesis was increased by fetal calf serum (10%) in SD cells more than in TGR VSMCs, and was decreased by heparin (400 micrograms/ml) and by phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (10(-7) M) in TGR VSMCs to a higher degree than in SD cells. Neither endothelin (10(-7) M), angiotensinogen (10(-8) M), the renin inhibitor CGP 29,287 (10(-4) M), angiotensin I (10(-7) M), captopril (10(-5) M), angiotensin II (10(-7) M), nor saralasin (10(-6) M) modified DNA synthesis in either type of VSMCs. Sodium nitroprusside (10(-4) and 10(-3) M) increased DNA synthesis in both kinds of VSMCs but in TGR cultures it became toxic at 10(-3) M. 8-Bromocyclic GMP (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) reduced DNA synthesis in SD cells more than in TGR VSMCs. These results suggest that (a) cellular mechanisms of proliferation appear to be more activated in TGR VSMCs, likely involving a protein kinase C-dependent pathway but not the renin-angiotensin system, and (b) in both type of cells, sodium nitroprusside possesses proliferative properties whereas 8-bromocyclic GMP has antiproliferative properties.", 
    "286": "We investigated the chronic effect of bradykinin B2-receptor blockade on the antihypertensive actions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril in three different hypertensive rat models, the two-kidney/one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive Wistar rat, the kinin-deficient 2K1C hypertensive Brown Norway Katholieke (BN-K) rat, and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Chronic blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors by subcutaneous infusion of the new bradykinin antagonist HOE 140 (500 micrograms/kg/day) attenuated the antihypertensive effect of ramipril only in 2K1C hypertensive Wistar rats, but not in 2K1C BN-K rats and SHR. Our data demonstrate for the first time that potentiation of endogenous kinins contributes to chronic antihypertensive actions of ACE inhibitors in experimental renal hypertension. Whether this holds also true for other forms of hypertension remains to be answered.", 
    "287": "The study was designed to evaluate the effects of chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the reactivity of the endothelium and the smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli in normal rats. Male rats were treated orally for 6 weeks with enalapril (10 mg/kg/day, n = 10) or with placebo (n = 10). Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine diphosphate were augmented in aortic rings from rats treated with enalapril compared with controls, whereas the response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator SIN-1 were similar. Contractions induced by phenylephrine and angiotensin II remained unchanged. Thus, the results suggest that chronic ACE inhibition enhances the release of relaxing factors from the endothelium in normotensive rats.", 
    "288": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their beneficial effects not only via endocrine mechanisms, but most probably also via interference with autocrine-paracrine actions involving local renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems with subsequent autacoid release. Inhibition of ACE (kininase II) results in the reduction of angiotensin II generation and kinin degradation, leading to beneficial cardiovascular effects. Bradykinin and prostacyclin release from isolated rat hearts was increased by local ACE inhibitions with ramiprilat. In different models the bradykinin-mediated effects of ACE inhibition were abolished with the specific B2 kinin-receptor antagonist Hoe 140: The cardioprotective effects of ramiprilat or ramipril such as reduction of postischemic reperfusion injuries in isolated rat hearts or the reduction in infarct size in dogs and rabbits were abolished by coadministration of Hoe 140. Furthermore, left ventricular hypertrophy in rats with aortic banding could be prevented or regression was induced when the ACE inhibitor was given in a non-blood pressure-lowering dose. These beneficial effects were also abolished by Hoe 140. In conclusion, in different experimental models, ACE inhibitors exert cardioprotective effects. An enhancement of endothelial autacoid formation (nitric oxide and prostacyclin) by inhibiting degradation of bradykinin may contribute to these effects.", 
    "289": "Endothelium-derived mediators are released in response to shear stress and a variety of endogenous substances including bradykinin and angiotensins. They may contribute to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular wall and in the kidney. Bradykinin is a powerful agonist at endothelial cells, and the actions of this peptide, which is generated by components of the vascular wall, during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may determine some of the vascular effects of ACE inhibitors. In vitro studies demonstrate that the relaxations to bradykinin are mostly endothelium dependent and are mediated by nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and/or vasodilator prostaglandins; however, these endothelium-derived relaxing factors do not always contribute simultaneously to the relaxations in every artery. The contribution of ACE in the termination of bradykinin action, relative to the other inactivation processes (including carboxypeptidases and internalization) also may determine the ability of ACE inhibitors to augment the effects of the kinin. Furthermore, it appears that the level of ACE activity and the potency of bradykinin, respectively, are not uniform in all preparations. In arteries in which bradykinin is very efficacious and in which ACE activity may be relatively low, ACE inhibitors may prolong but not amplify the responses to the peptide. The pharmacologic characteristics of the responses of the different vascular beds to bradykinin, together with the modulation of endothelium-dependent responses to other agonists (including purines), may be of importance in the heterogeneity of the vasodilator actions of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "290": "The cardiovascular effects of bradykinin require additional vasoactive mediators for a fully balanced response. This includes arachidonic acid (eicosatetraenoic acid) and its metabolites, the eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and others). Eicosanoid generation by bradykinin is started by binding of the peptide to specific B2 receptors at the plasma membrane. This initiates G-protein coupled stimulation of phospholipase C, IP3-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+, and stimulation of protein kinase C. Arachidonic acid is liberated from membrane phospholipids primarily via Ca(2+)-induced stimulation of phospholipase A2 and converted into tissue-specific eicosanoids by enzymes in the vicinity. In vascular tissue, most of the available arachidonic acid is converted into vasodilator prostaglandins, i.e., prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). These prostaglandins are involved in vasodilator actions of the kinins. There is also some evidence for generation of vasoconstrictor eicosanoids, such as thromboxane A2, under certain conditions. The biological significance of kinin-related prostaglandin formation becomes apparent after inhibition of kinin breakdown by ACE inhibitors. These compounds prevent generation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and stimulate endothelial eicosanoid formation via local kinin accumulation. There is evidence suggesting that kinin-induced prostaglandin generation contributes to anti-ischemic, inotropic, and blood pressure-lowering effects of the compounds. This also includes inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulation in injured myocardial tissue, which is antagonized by PGI2-related pathways, stimulated by ACE inhibition and/or bradykinin.", 
    "291": "The interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and bradykinin was investigated in isolated bovine and human coronary arteries. Rings with and without endothelium were mounted in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force. The effects of the ACE inhibitors lisinopril, enalaprilat, fosinoprilat, ramiprilat, and captopril were determined during submaximal stimulation with bradykinin or other vasodilators. Lisinopril and captopril alone did not affect vascular tone; however, in rings with endothelium partially relaxed with bradykinin (> or = 10(-10) M), all ACE inhibitors caused further relaxations. Lisinopril did not affect bradykinin concentrations in the incubation medium. Mechanical removal of the endothelium or incubation with nitro-L-arginine or the bradykinin2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 prevented the relaxations to bradykinin and lisinopril. Other vasodilators including acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, substance P, or SIN-1 did not prime the rings to respond to ACE inhibitors. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to lisinopril were also observed in human coronary arteries treated with bradykinin (> or = 10(-7) M). Thus, ACE inhibitors potentiate endothelium-dependent relaxations to submaximal concentrations of bradykinin in bovine and human coronary arteries. This local mechanism occurs regardless of elevated bradykinin concentrations in the blood and reduced angiotensin II generation.", 
    "292": "We have investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on intracellular Ca2+ levels in human cultured endothelial cells and on endothelial autacoid formation in endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries and in isolated perfused rabbit and rat hearts. Incubation of cultured endothelial cells with ramiprilat (0.3 microM) caused a maintained increase in resting intracellular Ca2+. This effect was long-lasting, accompanied by an increased formation of both nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2), and was abolished by the specific B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140. Ramiprilat also significantly enhanced the increase in intracellular Ca2+ elicited by bradykinin (3 nM). In endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries, moexiprilat (0.3 microM), like bradykinin (30 nM), caused a nearly twofold increase in the vascular cGMP content which was abolished by both NG-nitro-L-arginine (30 microM) and removal of the endothelium. The functional consequences of this ACE inhibitor-induced increase in vascular cGMP content were reflected by a distinct relaxation of the coronary segments preconstricted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. In the isolated perfused rabbit heart, ramiprilat (0.3 microM) affected neither resting vascular tone nor endothelial autacoid release; however, the vasodilation and release of PGI2 in response to exogenously applied bradykinin (10 nM) were significantly enhanced by ramiprilat. This effect was also seen using moexiprilat (0.1 microM) in the isolated perfused rat heart. Although these findings suggest that endothelium-derived bradykinin is not involved in the control of resting vascular tone in the coronary microcirculation of the rabbit and the rat, there appears to be significant ACE activity to modulate bradykinin-induced endothelial autacoid formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "293": "Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on sympathetic neurotransmission have generally been ascribed to their ability to block angiotensin II (Ang II) formation, but they also inhibit the degradation of vasoactive kinins, such as bradykinin. The latter may, in turn, lead to enhanced prostaglandin formation. Prostaglandins have been reported to influence sympathetic neurotransmission at different sites; much less is known about the influence of bradykinin due to the lack (until recently) of specific and effective bradykinin receptor antagonists, and difficulties with measurements of true plasma or tissue levels of bradykinin. Bradykinin may modulate sympathetic activity via a central stimulatory action and via activation of sensory input to the central nervous system; however, the importance of bradykinin for central effects of ACE inhibition remain to be established. At the sympathetic neuro-effector junction, results are more conflicting. Thus, bradykinin has been reported to enhance or reduce peripheral noradrenergic transmission or even lack any effect. Possible explanations for the differing results obtained include species and/or tissue differences in the responses to bradykinin. Also, the effects of bradykinin may be influenced by enhanced formation of prostaglandins and/or endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which may contribute to the confusion. As most studies have been performed under in vitro conditions and with high doses of bradykinin, the physiological relevance of the data may be questioned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "294": "Because converting enzyme and kininase II are identical enzymes and probably influence both the biosynthesis of angiotensin II and the metabolism of bradykinin, we investigated the effects of bradykinin and desArg-bradykinin on the sympathetic outflow of pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) before and after acute or chronic inhibition of the converting enzyme by ramipril. Sympathetic outflow was induced by preganglionic electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and measured as circulating, stimulation dependent norepinephrine and epinephrine by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrochemical detection. Bradykinin increased dose-dependently norepinephrine and epinephrine release, particularly when converting enzyme was inhibited. DesArg-bradykinin did not influence norepinephrine outflow but caused a dose-dependent increase in epinephrine release only after converting-enzyme inhibition. It is suggested that both bradykinin and desArg-bradykinin could compensate for the lack of effect of angiotensin II on sympathetic outflow.", 
    "295": "Bradykinin is a potent vasodilating and natriuretic peptide, which is potentiated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In our investigations we studied the effect of bradykinin on systemic and pulmonary circulation as well as on dorsal hand vein tone. The effects of bradykinin on systemic and pulmonary circulation were tested by injection of bradykinin into the right atrium. Parameters were determined for blood pressure, cardiac output, ECG and mean pressure in pulmonary artery. Heart rate, total peripheral resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary arteriolar resistance were calculated by these measured parameters. The data raised in our investigations showed clearly that bradykinin reduced blood pressure by reducing total peripheral vascular resistance in a dose-dependent manner. In pulmonary circulation bradykinin develops a direct effect. All circulatory actions of bradykinin are not mediated by prostaglandins, since inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin (100-150 mg) was without any effect. ACE inhibition by ramipril (5 mg) or captopril (50 mg) potentiated all effects of bradykinin about 20- to 50-fold, whereas it decreased angiotensin I effects only about four- to fivefold. These results suggest, that endogenous kinins, if they will be similarly potentiated by ACE inhibition like the exogenous bradykinin in our experiments, might play an important role in the blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Dorsal hand vein tone was reduced by bradykinin too, indicating that kinins can lower cardiac preload by increasing venous blood pooling.", 
    "296": "The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), and other peptidases in the endothelial degradation of bradykinin was investigated in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The major part of the kininase II activity on intact cells was attributed to ACE activity, the minor part to NEP activity. Amastatin, as aminopeptidase inhibitor, and DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropionic acid (MGTA), an inhibitor of kininase I, did not affect endothelial kininase activity. The decline of the bradykinin concentrations in the supernatant of intact endothelial monolayer indicated a total kininase activity of 289 +/- 27 fmol/min/dish. The calculated activity of ACE was 223 fmol/min/dish and the neutral endopeptidase activity was 51 fmol/min/dish. Thus, ACE and neutral endopeptidase are the main kininases in the degradation of bradykinin by intact endothelial cells. In contrast to the intact endothelial monolayers, in homogenates additional kininase activity was found which was not affected by either ACE and NEP inhibitors nor by amastatin and MGTA.", 
    "297": "We have investigated in human endothelial cells in culture the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2). Enalaprilat, moexiprilat and ramiprilat similarly potentiated the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by bradykinin and caused an increase in resting [Ca2+]i when given alone. The latter effect was long-lasting and accompanied by an increased formation of NO and PGI2. All of these effects were inhibited by the B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140, suggesting that the endogenous synthesis/release of bradykinin represents an autocrine mechanism for the stimulation of endothelial autacoid formation. Thus these findings strongly support the concept that ACE inhibitors promote local vasodilation by increasing the level of bradykinin generated in subthreshold concentrations by the endothelium.", 
    "298": "The influence of enalapril--an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor--on cardiac refractoriness was investigated. Strength-interval curves were initially obtained under control conditions and after exposing the muscles to Tyrode solution containing 50 micrograms/ml of enalapril. The results indicate that enalapril displaced the strength-curves to the right. The minimal current intensity required to elicit a propagated response was clearly increased by enalapril at all the intervals used. No change in action potential duration was found with enalapril but the action potential amplitude and the resting potential were both increased. The rise in cardiac refractoriness caused by enalapril might indicate that the drug has anti-arrhythmic properties.", 
    "299": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used for treatment of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). The beneficial effects consist of a combination of hemodynamic effects and interference with cardiac structural alterations. These effects are believed to depend on inhibition of angiotensin II (AII) formation and thus diminished angiotensin receptor stimulation. We administered the angiotensin II-1 (AT-1) receptor antagonist losartan during and after completion of the repair phase of an MI to investigate involvement of the AT-1 receptor in the above described effects of captopril. MI reduced cardiac output (CO) (sham 94 +/- 4 ml/min, MI 78 +/- 5 ml/min) and maximal CO (sham 154 +/- 4, MI 107 +/- 5 ml/min, respectively). Losartan (15 mg/kg/day) resulted in a rightward shift of the AII pressor dose-response curve by a factor of 32-40. Neither CO nor COVL,max was affected by losartan treatment in either phase (late treatment CO = 78 +/- 5, COVL,max = 118 +/- 9 ml/min). Although early treatment with losartan reduced cardiac hypertrophy measured as heart weight, DNA synthesis was reduced only slightly. In contrast, collagen deposition was inhibited completely. The results suggest that the effects of captopril in rats after MI are not dependent on AT-1 receptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "300": "The well-being of hypertensive patients may be adversely affected by the disease itself, its complications, and other concomitant processes such as anxiety, sedation, and side effects of prescribed drugs. Some recently developed antihypertensive agents have been suggested to be devoid of these deleterious effects on well-being expressed as quality of life. We compared the effect on quality of life of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the effect of bisoprolol as a representative of a new class of selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Fifty-seven patients with mild to moderate hypertension were eligible to enter an 18-week cross-over study, consisting of a single-blind 2-week run-in period and two 8-week double-blind cross-over periods. At the end of the run-in period and the two cross-over periods, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were assessed, as was quality of life perception by the Inventory of Subjective Health. During bisoprolol treatment, supine BP decreased from 163 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 144 +/- 3/86 +/- 1 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect was at least as good with bisoprolol as with enalapril. Quality of life perception as measured with the Inventory of Subjective Health was comparable for the two drugs. Spontaneously mentioned adverse effects were more frequent (74%) during enalapril than during bisoprolol treatment. At the end of the study, 69% of patients chose to continue antihypertensive treatment with bisoprolol. Our results show that the highly selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocking drug bisoprolol is at least as effective as enalapril and has no deleterious effects on well-being.", 
    "301": "We assessed whether local inhibition of myocardial converting enzyme by captopril and zofenopril reduces the functional and metabolic damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion. First we investigated the effects of zofenopril and captopril on the mechanical function, cellular redox state, and norepinephrine (NE) content of isolated and aerobically perfused rabbit hearts. Both drugs failed to modify the myocardial redox state. At concentrations > 10(-6) M, zofenopril, but not captopril, caused a reduction in myocardial NE content. At 10(-4) M, both drugs caused a reduction in developed pressure and an increase in diastolic pressure and release of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Second we investigated their effects on ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Both drugs exerted a cardioprotection; zofenopril was always more potent than captopril. Recovery of developed pressure on reperfusion improved, and peak release of NE was reduced, as was release of CPK. Calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function were maintained. Captopril had no effect on occurrence of oxidative stress during reperfusion, whereas zofenopril reduced it. In hearts treated with the converting enzyme inhibitors, peak release of NE was correlated to mitochondrial calcium content, production of ATP, and recovery of mechanical function on reperfusion. These data suggest that the cardioprotective effect of zofenopril and captopril is independent of hemodynamic changes or reduction of the toxicity of oxygen free radicals and that it could be related to a reduction in release of NE.", 
    "302": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of several drugs on the increase in cutaneous capillary permeability induced by intradermal injection of substance P (SP) and Sar9Met(O2)11-SP in guinea pig skin. On the one hand, the increase in cutaneous capillary permeability was partly reduced by spantide, promethazine, atropine or SR 40037, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. On the other hand, norepinephrine and B3824, a B2-antagonist of bradykinin, showed an enhancing effect. Our results suggest that the effect of SP and Sar9Met(O2)11-SP in guinea pigs is partly mediated by histamine and acetylcholine, and that there is a relationship between tachykinins and bradykinin.", 
    "303": "99mTc-Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) is a new 99mTc renal radiopharmaceutical with properties similar to orthoiodohippurate (OIH). 99mTc-MAG3 is highly protein bound and is efficiently extracted by the proximal tubules. While the clearance is only 50 to 65% that of OIH, the plasma concentration is higher and the rates at which the two tracers appear in the urine are almost identical. Studies comparing 99mTc-MAG3 and OIH in animals with renovascular hypertension (RVH) show comparable results. Preliminary studies comparing 99mTc-MAG3 renography with angiography in hypertensive patients show promising results and suggest 99mTc-MAG3 will probably have a sensitivity and specificity for detecting RVH similar to OIH. The optimal criteria for defining an abnormal study still need to be determined and then applied in a prospective study.",

    "305": "Several investigators have reported methods for the use of renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. We report the experience of Duke University Medical Center, and offer some suggestions for standardizing and optimizing the use of this potential screening tool. We evaluated 140 clinically selected hypertensive adults with postcaptopril renal scintigraphy (renography), pre- and postcaptopril peripheral renin activity, and conventional renal arteriography. Postcaptopril renography (using 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) to measure glomerular filtration and [131I]iodohippurate to measure renal plasma flow) was considered abnormal if one kidney contributed 47% or less of total activity. Postcaptopril renin was considered elevated if it was at least 4 ng/mL/h. Renovascular disease was defined as 50% or greater main renal artery stenosis. Of 140 subjects, 31 (22%) had significant renovascular disease. Captopril-stimulated DTPA renography suggested asymmetric function in 24 (74%) of these, but was also abnormal in 61 of 109 (56%) with normal renal arteries. Captopril-stimulated hippuran renography performed in a similar manner. Captopril-stimulated renin activity was elevated in only 58% of subjects with renal artery stenosis, and had a false positive rate of 24%. These data differ from reports from other centers, perhaps due to differences in renography methods, criteria for interpretation of renography, and/or patient selection criteria.",

This overview focuses upon the alterations in renal hemodynamics and function induced by renal artery stenosis (RAS) and reviews the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition upon blood pressure and kidney function in the various experimental models of RVHT. Understanding the effects of ACE inhibition upon the kidney distal to a stenosis and appreciating the potential effect of sodium balance or antihypertensive medications are crucial in anticipating the putative changes in the radionuclide studies of the renovascular bed following ACE inhibition.", 
    "307": "Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) is a randomized trial of enalapril versus placebo in reducing mortality in patients with cardiac dysfunction (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%). Before randomization, patients at risk for hypotension were hospitalized for a test dose of 2.5 mg of enalapril administered orally at baseline and again 12 hours later. As of February 1989, 89 of 7,539 (1.2%) patients had been studied during hospitalization. Baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 115 +/- 18 and 73 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively. After enalapril, systolic blood pressure decreased slightly but significantly 8 to 20 hours after the initial dose (mean reduction 8 to 11 mm Hg). In this highly selected group of 89 patients, symptoms relating to decrease in blood pressure were noted in 13 (15%). It is emphasized that most patients with cardiac dysfunction readily tolerate enalapril. However, the agent should be administered with caution to patients with advanced congestive failure and diminished baseline blood pressure, owing to a significant incidence of symptomatic hypotension.", 
    "308": "The inhibitory effect of various dipeptides on the neurotensin-degrading metallopeptidase, endopeptidase 24.16, was examined. These dipeptides mimick the Pro10-Tyr11 bond of neurotensin that is hydrolyzed by endopeptidase 24.16. Among a series of Pro-Xaa dipeptides, the most potent inhibitory effect was elicited by Pro-Ile (Ki approximately 90 microM) with Pro-Ile greater than Pro-Met greater than Pro-Phe. All the Xaa-Tyr dipeptides were unable to inhibit endopeptidase 24.16. The effect of Pro-Ile on several purified peptidases was assessed by means of fluorigenic assays and HPLC analysis. A 5 mM concentration of Pro-Ile does not inhibit endopeptidase 24.11, endopeptidase 24.15, angiotensin-converting enzyme, proline endopeptidase, trypsin, leucine aminopeptidase, pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I and carboxypeptidase B. The only enzyme that was affected by Pro-Ile was carboxypeptidase A, although it was with a 50-fold lower potency (Ki approximately 5 mM) than for endopeptidase 24.16. By means of fluorimetric substrates with a series of hydrolysing activities, we demonstrate that Pro-Ile can be used as a specific inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.16, even in a complex mixture of peptidase activities such as found in whole rat brain homogenate.",

In addition, an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker have been reported to control hypertension and reverse dialysis-dependent renal failure in a patient with undifferentiated connective tissue disease. We treated a patient with undifferentiated connective tissue disease who developed hypertension, pulmonary compromise, and renal failure requiring prolonged dialysis therapy. Due to allergy, the patient's hypertension could not be treated with ACE inhibitors initially, yet pulmonary function improved and renal function partially recovered with tenormin and minipress. When blood pressure became refractory to tenormin and minipress after 14 months of peritoneal dialysis, the patient was treated with lisinopril alone. Pulmonary function has remained stable and the patient has been off renal replacement therapy for 26 months, with a further substantial increase in creatinine clearance following treatment with lisinopril. The delayed and sustained recovery of renal and pulmonary function in the present case suggests undifferentiated connective tissue disease, like systemic sclerosis, may benefit from therapy with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "310": "Renal arteriography with concomitant renal vein renin profiling remains the diagnostic standard for evaluating the anatomic and physiologic significance of stenotic renal artery lesions in hypertensive patients. False-negative renal vein renin profiles with failure of lateralization in patients with anatomically apparent high-grade stenosis complicate the diagnostic process. Mannitol is frequently administered prophylactically to minimize the risk of dye nephropathy in these patients. Yet, the potential effects of mannitol on renal vein renin profiling in man have not been previously reported. Seven patients with renovascular hypertension were studied prospectively to determine changes in renal vein renin profiles before and after mannitol prophylaxis. Despite captopril stimulation, all patients demonstrated significant renin suppression leading to the loss of renin lateralization in patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension. In 60% of the patients, renal vein renin ratios fell to below the standard 1.5 to 1 ratio after mannitol infusion. In patients with bilateral renovascular disease, the least stenotic side suppressed completely, while the more stenotic side suppressed partially. Percent suppression analysis showed a mean suppression of 56.8% on the stenotic side versus 8.2% on the noninvolved side (P less than 0.002). In every study, suppression equaled or exceeded 32% on the involved side and was less than this on the noninvolved side. Thus, the degree of renin suppression following mannitol infusion may prove to be an important tool in the diagnosis of clinically significant stenotic lesions. The mechanism of mannitol-induced suppression remains undefined, but appears independent of volume expansions or dilutional effects. The inhibitory effects of mannitol on renin profiles can obscure the diagnosis of underlying renovascular hypertension.", 
    "311": "Patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure stabilized on furosemide therapy were entered into a randomized controlled trial comparing enalapril (n = 72) and digoxin (n = 73). End points were clinical outcome, treadmill exercise capacity and echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. Improvement in clinical outcome was defined as a reduction of at least one functional class or withdrawal because of an adverse clinical event. After 4 weeks, 13 patients receiving enalapril showed improvement, 55 had no change and 9 manifested deterioration compared with 7, 49 and 17, respectively, in the digoxin group (p less than 0.01). After 14 weeks, 13 patients receiving enalapril showed improvement, 50 had no change and 9 manifested deterioration, compared with 14, 37 and 22, respectively, in the digoxin group (p less than 0.025). More patients in the digoxin group were withdrawn because of an adverse clinical event (p less than 0.05). Exercise time and percent fractional shortening improved in both groups (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.05, respectively), with no significant difference between groups (p greater than 0.50). Both rate-pressure product and subjectively evaluated exertion during submaximal exercise were reduced only in the enalapril group. Although the majority of patients in both groups did well, those receiving enalapril experienced fewer adverse clinical events and had less fatigue during submaximal exercise.", 
    "312": "We evaluated the safety of enalapril administration in 20 very old (76 +/- 7 years) patients with rapidly progressive congestive heart failure (deteriorating from New York Heart Association class 2 to class 4 on admission). They were all given increasing doses of enalapril regardless of concomitant diuretic therapy and state of hydration. Renal function deteriorated in four patients (group A) and remained unchanged in 16 (group B). The mean pretreatment serum creatinine level in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (2.4 vs 1.3 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). No patient with a serum creatinine level less than 1.9 mg/dl on admission had further impairment of renal function. Groups A and B did not differ by age, concomitant diseases (including hypertension and diabetes mellitus), or medications (including diuretics) or by in-hospital serum electrolyte concentrations and blood pressure. Renal damage was noted during the initial four days of the study and was reversible following discontinuation of enalapril. Our data suggest that enalapril can be safely administered to very old patients with rapidly progressive congestive heart failure provided that the initial serum creatinine level is below 1.9 mg/dl. In patients with a higher serum creatinine level, careful monitoring and prompt discontinuation of enalapril administration can prevent irreversible renal damage.", 
    "313": "This manuscript describes changes in the steady state levels of aortic tropoelastin mRNA in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive controls (WKY) following treatment with two antihypertensive drugs. Three-week-old WKY and SHR rats were treated with hydralazine (15 mg/kg/day) or captopril (25 mg/kg/day). Tail artery blood pressure was monitored twice weekly. Both drugs prevented the development of hypertension in the SHR rat. At 6 weeks of age, total aortic RNA was extracted and the steady state levels of mRNAs coding for tropoelastin and pro alpha 1 (III) collagen were determined by slot blot hybridization analysis using radiolabeled tropoelastin and pro alpha 1 (III) collagen cDNA clones. Hydralazine treatment resulted in a threefold increase in tropoelastin mRNA levels in both the SHR and the WKY animals (P less than 0.01). Captopril-treated SHR animals demonstrated a similar significant increase. In contrast, no differences in pro alpha 1 (III) collagen mRNA levels were observed in the aorta of SHR or WKY rats following treatment with either captopril or hydralazine. These data suggest that antihypertensive agents can act specifically to directly induce tropoelastin mRNA levels in large arteries and thus may induce vascular remodeling independent of an increase in blood pressure.", 
    "314": "It is clearly settled that the management of overt heart failure offers poor prognostic impact due to the advanced setting of the disease. Relief of symptoms, objective benefits, as testified by short-term hemodynamic improvements, are as a matter of fact not reliable prognostic markers. Myocardial dysfunction starts early in the natural history of many cardiac diseases, and runs through the steps of progressive wall remodeling, witnessed by quantitative and qualitative changes in cells, interstitium and connective tissue. Experimental studies offered keys to interventions modulated to oppose the pathophysiological changes present in early myocardial dysfunction. At present, medical therapy has made great strides in testing early myocardial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which retard ventricular dilatation and thus may lower myocardial oxygen consumption requirements seem to offer a unique prognostic profile. Preliminary pilot studies on them and some of many large-scale multicentre trials still in progress reached evidence that this class of drugs is by this time a cornerstone of medical therapy, useful to lower cardiac events-rate in patients with heart failure.", 
    "315": "Restenosis after coronary angioplasty is due to a proliferation of smooth muscle cells growing in the vascular lumen, beneath the residual fragments of the atherosclerotic plaque, as seen in necropsy studies and examination of the specimens removed by atherectomy. At the histological analysis thrombi or their fibrocellular organization are not usually detectable. Smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to restenosis is very similar to the one observed in the experimental models of response-to-injury, so that these models are used to investigate into the pathogenetic mechanisms of restenosis. The main stimulus to the loss of the contractile phenotype and to the start of the smooth muscle cell proliferation is represented by the growth factors delivered by platelets adhered to the disendothelialized wall and by the smooth muscle cells themselves, stretched during the dilatation. Other stimuli can be growth factors delivered by monocytes and fibroblasts, by thrombin, endothelin, angiotensin and interleukin 1. The elastic recoil of the vessel wall, the plaque debris and the regional wall shear stress can also contribute to restenosis. The restenosis tissue is different from the atheromatous plaque in that it is almost only constituted by smooth muscle cells and intercellular matrix, while atheroma is much more complex due to the presence of various kinds of cells, of necrotic debris and lipid substances. The smooth muscle cells proliferation also contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but the stimuli starting this process have not been clarified yet; moreover this process is much slower than restenosis, interacting with several factors. Encouraging results have been achieved in the prevention of restenosis after angioplasty in experimental models, but not in man. In order to reduce the incidence of restenosis one should improve the results of angioplasty, even by the use of atherectomy and intracoronary stents. Among pharmacologic approaches anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents, calcium-channel blockers, corticosteroids all proved ineffective. Studies are in progress evaluating the effect of inhibitors of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), antitumor agents and radiation therapy, hirudin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "316": "Thirty hypertensive patients with increased left ventricular (LV) mass and impaired diastolic function received routinely 2 or 3 kinds of captopril, nifedipine and atenolol for a mean period of 98 days. The LV mass index (LVMI) decreased by an average of 21 g/M2, but no significant correlation between blood pressure reduction and decrease in LVMI was found. So there may be some direct effect of these antihypertensive agents on the myocardium in addition to the benefit from blood pressure reduction. Marked reduction in PVA, Ai, A/E and Ai/T-VTi (P less than 0.01) along with elevation in ratio of E/A, Ei/Ai and Ei/T-VTi (P less than 0.01) were also observed by Doppler transmitral filling studies. These results indicated that the impaired LV diastolic function in patients with hypertension can be much improved following reduction of blood pressure and LV mass.", 
    "317": "Cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension is related to increased peripheral vascular resistance and reduced aortic compliance. Non-invasive measurement of pulse wave velocities and systolo-diastolic variations of the diameter of the aortic arch show that an increase in the elastic modulus of the aorta is closely related to the increase in cardiac mass. This relationship holds even after correction for mean arterial pressure. Therefore, it has been suggested that, in hypertension, the decreased aortic compliance leads to a disproportionate increase in systolic blood pressure and end systolic wall stress, predisposing to cardiac hypertrophy. The blood pressure, arterial haemodynamics of the forearm (by pulsed Doppler flow measurement) and echocardiographic parameters were studied in 16 patients with permanent essential hypertension, before and 3 months after treatment with perindopril, an ACE inhibitor. In a simple blinded study versus placebo, perindopril was shown to significantly reduce the blood pressure (p less than 0.01) while brachial blood flow increased (p less than 0.01) because of a simultaneous increase in blood flow velocity and arterial diameter. During 5 minutes' occlusion at the wrist, blood flow velocity decreased more in patients taking perindopril than those on placebo (p less than 0.01) whilst the reduction in arterial diameter was equivalent, indicating that the increase in arterial diameter with perindopril could not be explained by flow-dependent dilatation alone but by a direct effect of the drug on the artery. During the treatment phase, brachial arterial compliance increased (p less than 0.01) and pulse wave velocity decreased (p less than 0.01) and there was no change in arterial shear stress defined as the product of mean blood pressure and arterial diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "318": "Changes in left ventricular remodeling due to antihypertensive therapy have been demonstrated in experimental animal studies although no quantitative relationship has been shown between correction of blood pressure and regression of myocardial mass. As regards the qualitative aspects of regression, only the ACE inhibitors have been shown to prevent the development and induce regression of the excess collagen content of the myocardium submitted to chronic pressure overload. The problems posed by remodeling in clinical practice are more complex: should regression of myocardial mass itself be the therapeutic objective in the absence of a practical method of analysing the interstitial factor of hypertensive disease or should we concentrate on the satellite problems of hypertrophy which are correction of ischemia, left ventricular filling abnormalities and arrhythmias. For each of these clinical problems, the benefits attributed to changes in remodeling, though probable, are to a large degree hypothetical. The benefits offered by these drugs which reduce ventricular hypertrophy are, however, considerable.", 
    "319": "The geometry of both the infarcted and non-infarcted zone of the left ventricle changes after myocardial infarction. Two mechanisms are involved: expansion of the infarcted zone and secondary dilatation of the non-infarcted zone. The necrosed area undergoes an inflammatory reaction followed by fibrosis which end up as a sca within a period of a few days to a few weeks. During this period if fibrous scarring the infarcted, thinned myocardium undergoes progressive expansion which starts in the first hours of the myocardial infarction. The loss of left ventricular systolic function related to the infarct and volumic overload created by expansion of the infarct influence the secondary development of dilatation of the non-infarcted zones. This dilatation results in restoration of left ventricular stroke volume but at the price of increased wall stress, which itself induces compensatory wall hypertrophy. These phenomena are more pronounced when the initial infarction is extensive and if they are sustained, they result in definitive myocardial failure. Several factors influence remodeling: the size of the infarct, arterial patency, wall stress and the quality of the scarring process itself. Therapeutic interventions of each of these factors can influence the remodeling. Limitation of infarct size by thrombolytic therapy, arterial revascularisation, even when performed late, seem capable of limiting expansion of the necrosed zone. Pharmacodynamic intervention of left ventricular afterload also affects ventricular remodeling. Nitrate derivatives, vasodilator therapy in general and converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be effective.", 
    "320": "A recently developed radiopharmaceutical with favorable characteristics for renal studies, 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3), was employed for renal scintigraphy in the detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in 102 hypertensive patients who underwent renal angiography within 4 weeks of scintigraphic assessment. Renal scintigraphy was performed with 120 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3 60 min after oral administration of 50 mg captopril. Studies were evaluated for renogram shape, relative tracer uptake, time to peak counts, and parenchymal transit time. In cases of normal outcome, no further scintigraphic test was requested. In all other cases a baseline study was performed within 2 to 3 days. Where an apparent improvement was found in baseline conditions compared to the provocative test (upslope of the renogram, increased tracer uptake, and reduction of parenchymal transit time), the study was considered positive for significant RAS. At renal angiography, 48 arteries were found affected by RAS greater than 50% and 27 by RAS less than 50%. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of RAS greater than 50% were 89.6% and 91.6%, respectively. In kidneys affected by RAS greater than 50%, captopril administration typically induced a prolongation in parenchymal transit time (324 +/- 90 sec, baseline conditions, v 408 +/- 122 sec, postcaptopril, P less than .01) as against 255 +/- 70 v 251 +/- 64, P = NS, in kidneys supplied by patent arteries or with RAS less than 50%.", 
    "321": "Captopril renography is a powerful tool for evaluating renovascular hypertension. In this article we examine four different protocols: 99mTc-DTPA, [131I]hippuran with captopril, [131I]hippuran with enalaprilat, and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3). In our experience, [131I]hippuran renograms are a reliable and reproducible test in patients both with and without azotemia. Although our experience with the new 99mTc-MAG3 technique is somewhat limited, it appears that this will also be a valuable test, which additionally has several advantages over hippuran, namely, a smaller turnaround time between test and baseline study, a smaller dose of radioactivity, better images, and more accurate counts. We look forward to the future development of this technique.", 
    "322": "To enhance diagnosis and predict improvement in blood pressure control following surgery or renal angioplasty in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis (RAS), we employed captopril renography in 113 clinically selected patients, all of whom had renal angiography to verify the diagnosis. Criteria for normal captopril renograms were established from an initial cohort of 23 hypertensive patients with normal angiograms who had been judged to be at high risk for RAS using the same clinical criteria. Renal revascularization or nephrectomy was performed in 45 patients and the success of the procedure was determined in the 40 patients for whom 3-month follow-up was available. In these 113 patients, 58 (51%) had RAS. Captopril renography was 91% sensitive and 87% specific in identifying or excluding RAS. Diagnostic utility was preserved in those patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine equal to or greater than 1.5 mg/dL) (n = 46). Scintigraphic abnormalities induced by captopril were strongly associated with cure or improvement in blood pressure control following revascularization or nephrectomy (16 of 19), while the lack of captopril-induced change was associated with failure of such intervention (17 of 21) (P = .0001). We conclude that captopril renography is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of RAS in a clinically selected high-risk group of hypertensives, and that the test accurately predicts the success or failure of therapeutic intervention.", 
    "323": "We treated 94 patients by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for renal artery stenosis (RAS). Prior to PTA, a renogram during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril was performed, but the result did not influence the decision to treat. The parenchymal time activity curves were judged by visual interpretation. Of the 94 patients, 51 had unilateral and 43 bilateral RAS. In 17 patients with bilateral RAS, PTA could be performed only in the least affected kidney; because of this the effect of PTA on their blood pressure could not be evaluated. Of the remaining 77 patients, a positive captopril renogram was seen in all 31 cured patients, in 22 of the 27 patients with improvement, and in six of the 19 patients with no change of their blood pressure. The sensitivity of the tests for cure and improvement of the blood pressure was 91% (53/58 patients) for all patients, 95% in patients with unilateral RAS (35/37), and 86% (18/21 patients) in patients with bilateral RAS, bilaterally treated. In 18 patients with a negative captopril renogram the blood pressure improved in five, and did not change in 13 patients. The success of PTA in patients with a negative captopril renogram was so poor that we feel it would have been better not to have performed angiography and PTA at all. In conclusion, captopril renography is a useful investigation in assessing the likelihood of blood pressure reduction after PTA of renal artery stenosis.", 
    "324": "This article describes the methods and the interpretation of captopril renography. The essentials of the methods are the discontinuation of diuretics, the refraining from solid foods before administration of 25 mg captopril, hydration to induce diuresis, the performing of 1-min sequential images, data acquisition with frame time not exceeding 30 sec, and the calculation of the left to right ratio. In most instances data from captopril renography can be interpreted without the presence of a baseline study. Abnormalities of the sequential images and the renal curves classified as grade 2 and 3 indicate the presence of renal artery stenosis. Besides, in unilateral stenosis, captopril induced renographic abnormality can also be observed in bilateral and segmental stenosis. Interpretation based on numeric parameters probably does not increase the sensitivity. Alterations on mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) studies are identical to the alterations observed on orthoiodohippurate (OIH) studies. In severe stenosis, alterations in diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid studies are different from those observed in OIH or MAG3 studies. Since MAG3 provides the best images, at present MAG3 is the radiopharmaceutical of choice.", 
    "325": "Research in nephrologic nuclear medicine is presently concentrated in two well-defined areas: interventional procedures and the use of mercaptoacetyltriglycine. The ongoing evaluation of mercaptoacetyltriglycine continues to be a source of interesting research activity, with the distribution volume and the extent of hepatic excretion remaining points of discussion. This tracer permits quantitative determination of renal function. As an imaging agent, mercaptoacetyltriglycine compares favorably with hippurate and with diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid, particularly in evaluating renal insufficiency. Renal function studies obtained during pharmacologic or physiologic intervention dominate research in hypertension and obstructive uropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improved the renographic detection of renovascular lesions. Interventional renography with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or ergometric exercise were both capable of generating useful prognostic data on the posttherapy blood pressure response in patients with renovascular hypertension. Interventional diuretic renography with furosemide permits surgical intervention to be reserved for organs at immediate risk because the degree of obstruction and the extent of renal function compromise are easily recognized.", 
    "326": "Seventeen patients with mild to moderate hypertension, as indicated by a diastolic blood pressure (DPB) of 95-115 mmHg (WHO I), were treated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel study, with either 5 mg of fosinopril, a new phosphinic acid-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide administered orally once daily for 4 weeks after a 4- to 6-week run-in period of placebo. The doses were increased to 10 mg of fosinopril or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide if DBP remained above 95 mmHg. The blood pressure (BP) fell from 157 +/- 12/104 +/- 7 mmHg (mean value +/- SD) at the start of the study to 146 +/- 21/97 +/- 8 mmHg (P less than 0.02) after 4 weeks, and to 149 +/- 19/97 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than 0.02) after 8 weeks of fosinopril treatment (n = 8). In the hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients (n = 9), BP fell from 153 +/- 9/105 +/- 5 mmHg at the start of the study to 140 +/- 11/97 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than 0.01) after 4 weeks, and to 131 +/- 11/94 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than 0.01) after 8 weeks. After the first dose, DBP fell from 102 to 99 mmHg (NS) in fosinopril-treated patients, and from 105 to 96 mmHg (P less than 0.02) in hydrochlorothiazide-treated subjects. Serum active fosinoprilate concentration increased to 5.6 ng ml-1, 25.9 ng ml-1, and 43.8 ng ml-1 after 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively, and remained at a level of 6.6-7.7 ng ml-1 after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Serum ACE activity decreased from 21.6 +/- 11.0 mumol min-1 l-1 at the start to 9.3 +/- 13.7, 4.4 +/- 4.6, and 2.9 +/- 2.8 mumol min-1 l-1 after 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively. No side-effects and no changes in blood counts, electrolytes or kidney function were attributed to fosinopril during the study. Fosinopril is a safe, long-acting antihypertensive drug with a smooth onset of action. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment caused potassium loss and an increase in the levels of uric acid and triglycerides. Diastolic blood pressure decreased to the same extent as a result of treatment with either drug, while systolic blood pressure was better controlled by hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "327": "To investigate the relation between the small artery structure and different blood pressure parameters, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated from 4 to 24 weeks of age (20 weeks in total) with five different antihypertensive therapies: two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril and captopril), a calcium antagonist (isradipine), a beta-blocker (metoprolol), and a vasodilator (hydralazine). At 24 weeks of age, 24-hour blood pressure was measured, and two mesenteric resistance vessels were taken from each animal. Blood pressure was 227/135 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) and 161/106 mm Hg in untreated hypertensive and normotensive control rats, respectively. Heart rates were 376 min-1 and 295 min-1 for the two strains. All treatments reduced all blood pressure parameters except for metoprolol, which did not reduce pulse pressure. In the small arteries, the media cross-sectional area was unaffected by the treatments. When a simple correlation analysis was made, pulse pressure was found to correlate more closely (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001) to the resistance vessel media/lumen ratio than any of the other pressure parameters studied: systolic (r = 0.51, p = 0.011), mean (r = 0.41, p = 0.05), or diastolic (r = 0.28, p = 0.19). When an analysis of covariance was performed that included pulse pressure, mean blood pressure, and heart rate, which also correlated significantly to the media/lumen ratio, 81% of the variation in the media/lumen ratio could be accounted for by the variation in the three covariates (p less than 10(-5)), pulse pressure being the major factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "328": "Short-term fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate were analysed in a group of eight males with essential hypertension. Indirect finger blood pressure was measured by a non-invasive device (Finapres). Analogue-to-digital conversion of the blood pressure was used to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate every second. The equidistant sampling allowed a direct spectral analysis using a fast Fourier transformation algorithm. The effect of 7-day administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, transolapril (2 mg/day), was assessed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study. After trandolapril there was a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure levels (-15 mmHg). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure did not reach significance. The standard deviation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were significantly reduced (-20% and -22% for systolic and diastolic respectively). Neither average heart rate nor standard deviations of heart rate time series was affected by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Spectral analysis of fluctuation in blood pressure showed a reduction in the variability underlying the standard deviation changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Trandolapril selectively reduced the amplitude of systolic and diastolic oscillations in the 66-129 mHz region, corresponding to Mayer waves. The significant decrease in the 10 s period oscillations of blood pressure after chronic angiotensin converting enzyme blockade with trandolapril could reflect reduced sympathetic outflow to vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "329": "Urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TXB2, PRA, ATII, blood pressure, urine volume, urinary sodium and potassium were measured by RIA in SHR after administration of captopril and indomethacin. The results suggested that captopril would significantly decrease ATII, and showed marked effects of hypotension, diuresis and caused variation of PG system. Urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 were significantly increased in both rat groups, but changes of TXB2/PGI2 ratio were different. The studies yet suggested indomethacin could antagonize the hypotensive effects of captopril.", 
    "330": "We have previously reported that acute oral administration of low doses (less than or equal to 12 mg/kg) of pyridostigmine bromide (PYR) to rats resulted in a dose-dependent decrement in reinforcement rate under two different multiple schedules of response-produced water presentation, which involved motivational dysfunction rather than motor impairment and alterations in visual perception. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine further if the anticipated operant behavioral deficits of PYR are mediated by central and/or peripheral cholinergic mechanisms. Lever-press responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained under a multiple fixed-ratio GO/differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate NO GO, brightness discrimination, schedule of water reinforcement. The effects of the muscarinic antagonists atropine (ATR) and methylatropine (MAT), both at doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg (SC), against a single oral low dose of PYR (12 mg/kg)-induced behavioral disruption were compared. ATR partially antagonized the reinforcement loss of PYR with concomitant dose-related increases in nonreinforced responses, whereas MAT completely antagonized the reinforcement loss without affecting the frequency of nonreinforced responses. These results suggest that in rats, the debilitating effects of oral PYR on operant behavior are primarily due to the stimulation of peripheral muscarinic receptors via its anticholinesterase activity. The increments of nonreinforced responses observed after coadministration of PYR with ATR may reflect a central, excitatory action of ATR which could affect the discrimination performance. The present results have practical implications for the clinical utilization of PYR in combination with the peripherally active muscarinic antagonist in situations where optimal performance is required.", 
    "331": "Graded isometric exercise (IE) testing was performed to study the effects of vasodilators from various classes on the hemodynamic response in 60 patients with mild and moderate essential hypertension (EH). Hemodynamic parameters were determined by rheography. Group I patients took captopril, 50 mg, Group II prazosin, 2 mg, and Group III nifedipine, 20 mg. Hemodynamic changes tended to deteriorate in patients with the EH syndrome during IET. Application of the vasodilators led to the alleviation of the changes both at rest and during IET, as manifested by lower absolute values of the parameters and their relative increase. The beneficial influences of drugs from various classes on some hemodynamic parameters were different.", 
    "332": "A novel renin inhibitor, YM-21095 [2RS), (3S)-3-[N alpha-[1,4-dioxo-4-morpholino-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)-buthyl]-L- histidil-amino]-4-cyclohexyl-1-[(1-methyl-5-tetrazolyl)thio]-2-but anol), has been synthesized in our laboratories. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacological properties of YM-21095 in in vitro and in vivo experiments. YM-21095 inhibited human renin with an IC50 value of 4.7 x 10(-10) mol/L. YM-21095 was also a potent inhibitor against squirrel monkey renin, but less effective against renins from dog, rabbit, and rat. The effect of YM-21095 is highly specific for renin, since it did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, or angiotensin converting enzyme up to a concentration of 10(-4) mol/L. YM-21095 was resistant to proteolytic actions of the enzymes (pepsin, chymotrypsin, trypsin) and squirrel monkey tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, small intestine). Intravenous infusion of YM-21095 (0.1 to 100 micrograms/kg/min) decreased mean blood pressure and inhibited plasma renin activity in a dose-dependent manner with no effect on heart rate in anesthetized sodium-depleted and sodium-replete squirrel monkeys. The hypotensive effect of YM-21095 in sodium-depleted squirrel monkeys was about ten times as potent as that in sodium-replete squirrel monkeys. Oral administration of YM-21095 to conscious sodium-depleted squirrel monkeys produced dose-related decreases of systolic blood pressure. We conclude that YM-21095 is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of primate renin and produces a blood pressure lowering effect.", 
    "333": "Dynamic cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies using acetazolamide or hypercapnia as a vasodilatory challenge have attempted to evaluate intracranial hemodynamics. We report two patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion in whom the vasodilatory stimulus was a single oral dose of antihypertensive medication (prazosin hydrochloride or enalapril maleate). In both patients, changes in regional CBF occurred that were larger than those seen in nine normal controls. One patient experienced an improvement in regional CBF with a reduction in probe pair asymmetry. In the other patient, who had bilateral carotid artery disease, a decrease in regional CBF in all 16 probes (mean decrease 12 percent) and an accentuation of the predose asymmetry were observed. Both patients remained asymptomatic throughout the study. Assessing these effects on cerebral circulation may help identify patients at risk for iatrogenic focal cerebral ischemia and provide information regarding the functional status of the cerebral vasculature.", 
    "334": "These experiments reevaluate earlier work in which salt intake was evoked by blood-borne angiotensin II. That work is inconsistent with recent demonstrations that cerebral, not blood-borne, angiotensin II is the synergist with aldosterone in arousing salt intake in the rat. We show, first, that the pharmacological doses of angiotensin II that were used in the earlier work are natriuretic (and dipsogenic). They cause urinary sodium losses that precede and exceed sodium intake. Second, we show that the excess sodium intake that is associated with pharmacological doses of intravenous angiotensin is not caused by endogenous aldosterone. Last, we show that this excess sodium intake is abolished by intracerebroventricular captopril thereby suggesting that it is caused by activation of cerebral angiotensin II and harmonizing its mechanism with current concepts.", 
    "335": "The effects of (S)-1[6-amino-2[[hydrozy(4- phenylbutyl)phosphinyl]oxy]-1-oxohexyl]-L-proline (SQ 29 852), a phosphorus-containing novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), which is synthesized aiming an ACEI with long-lasting activity and with few side effects, were studied using anesthetized dogs. SQ 29 852 was equipotent with captopril to modify blood pressure response of the animals to angiotensin I (Ang I) and bradykinin (Bdk). An intravenous infusion of SQ 29 852 at 0.1 mg/kg/min for 30 min caused a remarkable hypotension without reflex tachycardia in open-chest dogs. In these animals cardiac contractility (dP/dtmax of left ventricular pressure) appeared to be reduced by SQ 29 852 without any changes in right atrial pressure (RAP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and aortic blood flow (AoF, cardiac output). In sodium-restricted dogs, the hypotension and renal vasodilation by SQ 29 852 (at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg, i.v.) were slightly pronounced compared with animals fed with normal diet. It is demonstrated from these results that SQ 29 852 has comparable potency with captopril to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and as common a pharmacological profile as ACEI. SQ 29 852 may be a favorable antihypertensive agent, if its long-lasting activity and few side effects are confirmed.", 
    "336": "Angiotensin II facilitates sympathetic transmitter release in the heart. Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be assumed to suppress noradrenaline release in the heart. To test this hypothesis endogenous noradrenaline release was induced either by electrical stimulation of the stellate ganglion or by global ischaemia in rat hearts. Noradrenaline was determined by high performance liquid chromatography in coronary venous overflow. Endogenous angiotensin formation was blocked by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and ramiprilat and the activity of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system was modulated by variations in nutritional sodium load prior to the experiments. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors significantly reduced noradrenaline release evoked by nerve stimulation when the animals had been fed a low sodium diet. Following a high sodium diet, however, captopril and ramiprilat had no effect on stimulation-induced noradrenaline release. Global ischaemia (20 min) resulted in noradrenaline overflow from sympathetic nerves, independent of nerve stimulation. This ischaemia-induced noradrenaline release was not influenced by either converting enzyme inhibitor. In conclusion, the results suggest a sodium-dependent endogenous angiotensin formation in the heart which facilitates physiological noradrenaline release and is sensitive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast, noradrenaline release in ischaemia is not affected by converting enzyme blockers, due to a different, non-exocytotic release mechanism of noradrenaline during myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "337": "There are short-term and long-term modulations of cardiac function and cardiac composition by the endocrine and paracrine renin-angiotensin system. First, there is an enhancement of coronary vasoconstrictor tone in severe congestive heart failure due to stimulation of this system. Therapeutic interventions that block the RA-system are able to reduce the increased resistance to coronary flow. Second, there is a relationship between the occurrence of arrhythmias and the degree of sympathetic stimulation in congestive heart failure. The renin-angiotensin system may be involved in arrhythmogenesis because of presynaptic modulation of sympathetic neurotransmitter release. However, in the isolated perfused rat heart no class-specific antiarrhythmic properties could be found for ACE inhibitors during progressive myocardial ischaemia. Third, proliferation of the neointima following injury of a coronary artery is at least in part mediated by angiotensin II. Although ACE inhibition was an effective tool in animal experiments to prevent excessive proliferation of the neointima following ballooning, it was less effective in preventing restenosis in man following a repeat coronary angioplasty. Fourth, preferential proliferation of the cardiac interstitium in experimental hypertension has been associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In patients with essential hypertension ACE inhibitors were not only capable of controlling blood pressure but also of normalizing the previously pathological pattern of diastolic left ventricular filling. In summary, by therapeutic intervention that cause a blockade of this system, cardioprotective and cardioreparative processes can be supported.", 
    "338": "Arterial hypertension is frequently associated with metabolic abnormalities. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are found in obese patients, in non-insulin-dependent diabetics and in some hypertensive patients, irrespective of whether the patients are overweight or have diabetes mellitus. Membrane transport abnormalities, such as increased sodium-lithium exchange associated with hypertension are also significantly related to disturbances in lipid metabolism. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity is a well established feature of arterial hypertension and this may also affect glucose and lipid metabolism. The possibility of these metabolic alterations in the hypertensive patient must be taken into account when deciding upon treatment. Attention to diet is mandatory and includes advice to reduce energy, salt and saturated fat intakes and to increase the intake of less digestible fiber and of potassium; alcohol consumption should be limited. Energy expenditure by regular aerobic physical exercise should be encouraged and continuous effort is necessary to help patients stop smoking. In patients with high blood pressure and abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism, it is wise to start pharmacological treatment with drugs that are known to be neutral in their metabolic effects, such as calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or alpha-blocking agents.", 
    "339": "This is a report about our first experiences in diagnosis of renovascular hypertension using the renal sequence scintigraphy and the examination of peripherical renin activity before and 1h after p.o. application of captopril. Discriminating indicators for an unilateral artery stenosis are the captopril-induced delay of the maximum (greater than 1 min) and the lowering of the amplitude of one of the time activity curves, the pronounced cortical retention of the radiopharmacon at 20 min and the significant increasing of renin after captopril. Both methods are an improvement in the detection of renovascular hypertension, if the stenosis of the renal artery is more than 50%. If the stenosis is only less than 50% you cannot observe changes of the parameters. By means of further investigations it is to be proofed, if both methods are able as screening tests to fill the niche between clinical suspect and angiography and furthermore if they are predictive tests for lowering of the blood pressure by angioplasty or surgical correctur of the stenosis.", 
    "340": "Ambulatory blood pressure recording can provide information on blood pressure changes throughout the day and night and during normal daily activities. The former features are of particular use in evaluating the duration of action and dose-response relationships for new antihypertensive drugs, especially those developed for once daily dosing. Improved precision and multiple measurements through the dose interval may reduce the number of patients required in trials. We have recently used ambulatory blood pressure recording to assess the magnitude and duration of the first dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril, compared to placebo. In addition, the effects on blood pressure of long-acting calcium antagonists, alone and in combination, have been measured. Ambulatory blood pressure recording can complement conventional approaches in determining the dose range, frequency of administration and concentration-effect relationships of new and existing antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "341": "Arterial hypertension is present in 10-80% of newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics, and in 30-50% of Type 1 diabetics after some years. In patients with overt nephropathy, correction of hypertension is associated with a reduction in the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate. In most patients without clinical diabetic nephropathy, arterial pressure remains within normal limits as defined by usual criteria, whether or not microalbuminuria is present. Short-term studies of Type 1 diabetics with microalbuminuria suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors result in a fall in urinary albumin excretion rate more than calcium antagonists and diuretics. Additional studies assessing the long-term effect of different antihypertensive agents on the evolution of early diabetic nephropathy are needed before the superiority of any drug can be claimed. In addition, non pharmacological approaches, including optimal glycemic control as well as modification of dietary sodium and serum lipid profile, may alter the progressive course of elevation in arterial pressure and decline in renal function. The optimal level of blood pressure for diabetic patients remains to be determined.", 
    "342": "The effects of long-term reduction in blood pressure by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, as single therapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), were compared with those of metoprolol and/or hydrochlorothiazide in 91 hypertensive non insulin-dependent diabetics with normal renal function. Following a single-blind placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, treatments were assigned randomly in a double-blind fashion. During the study, weight and glycosylated hemoglobin remained elevated. After 9 months of treatment, blood pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.0001) in all treatment groups, with most patients achieving goal supine diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 85 mmHg. Whereas urinary albumin excretion (UAE) did not change in patients given metoprolol and/or HCTZ, captopril monotherapy (p = 0.0021) or captopril given in combination with HCTZ (p = 0.0002) decreased UAE without affecting glomerular filtration rate. These data are in favour of a renal beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors distinct from their effects on systemic blood pressure. Further studies are needed to determine whether this effect persists with longer treatment, and whether it would lead to better preservation of kidney function than other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "343": "Haemodynamic studies performed in patients with cardiac failure have shown that perindopril decreases right and left ventricular filling pressures, systemic blood pressure and peripheral resistances, slightly reduces the heart rate and increases cardiac output. Flammang showed that these haemodynamic changes are sustained after 12 months' treatment. A randomised double blind multicenter trial versus placebo was carried out over 3 months following a 15 days pre-inclusion period in 125 patients with NYHA Stage II and III cardiac failure stabilised by digitalis and diuretic therapy. Perindopril was administered at a dosage of 2 or 4 mg according to initial systolic blood pressure and efficacy was evaluated at 1 and 3 months according to the NYHA classification, a score of clinical severity, the duration of two exercise stress tests on a bicycle ergometer or treadmill and the cardiothoracic ratio. There were no cases of cardiac decompensation (NYHA Stage IV) in the group of perindopril whilst 3 cases were observed in the placebo group. Significant improvements in the clinical scores and effort capacity were observed in the perindopril group. The duration of exercise on the treadmill was 778 seconds with perindopril compared to 544 seconds in the placebo group. Systolic blood pressure did not change and there was a slight decrease in standing diastolic pressures. No significant increases in blood urea or creatinine levels were observed. To study the effects on blood pressure, a major factor in the management of a patient with cardiac failure, McFadyen compared the changes in blood pressure after a single dose of perindopril, enalapril, captopril and placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "344": "The primary hereditary cardiomyopathy of the Syrian hamster is a particularly interesting model of experimental cardiomyopathy 1) because of its slow progression to cardiac failure unlike acute experimental volume and pressure overloading; 2) because of the reproducibility and predictable nature of the mechanical, biochemical and electrophysiological abnormalities observed at each stage of the disease; 3) because of involvement of other muscle groups, and particularly, skeletal muscle. The physiopathology is not fully understood but a disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis appears to play a major role. From the therapeutic point of view, a number of calcium antagonists have been shown to be effective in restoring myocardial function, but they have no effect on skeletal muscular lesions. Recently, early prophylactic intervention with therapeutic doses of perindopril has been shown to prevent the decrease of certain parameters of myocardial contractility in vitro in the dilated group, before the appearance of any signs of cardiac failure. This study also showed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had no intrinsic negative inotropic effects.", 
    "345": "The most common cause of death in hypertensive patients is myocardial infarction (MI), being three times more common than stroke. Lowering raised BP results in 40% fewer strokes, but only 14% fewer MIs. This may be because other coronary risk factors that often accompany hypertension (e.g. obesity, lipid and thrombotic disturbances, insulin insensitivity, increased plasma renin activity and increased sympathetic activity) are either unaffected or exacerbated by some of the traditional antihypertensive agents. Some of these risk factors show a diurnal rhythm peaking at 07.00-10.00 hours, thus this time constitutes a 'vulnerable period' for sudden death or death from MI. beta-blockers and diuretics have been effective in preventing stroke, but diuretics (at least potassium-losing diuretics) might actually increase the incidence of sudden death and MI in young to middle-aged hypertensive subjects (though elderly patients may benefit). Quality of life can be impaired by some beta-blockers, and diuretics can cause metabolic upset and male impotence. Thus, antihypertensive agents that are not only effective and well tolerated but are beneficial to the broader coronary risk profile are desirable. ACE inhibitors should prove particularly useful in terms of: good quality of life; non-exacerbation or improvement of coronary risk factors; treating patients with impaired left ventricular function; reversing left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular wall hypertrophy, thus improving coronary flow reserve; atheroma regression; renal protection, particularly in diabetes; and prevention or regression of LV dilatation (remodelling) following MI.", 
    "346": "Hypertension, a condition characterized by narrowing of the arteriolar lumen, is related in part to vasoconstriction and in part to vascular hypertrophy. Complex and interlocking mechanisms involving the autonomic nervous system and both circulating and local vasoconstrictor and vasodilator hormones contribute to this narrowing. Endothelin, 5-HT (serotonin), the kinins and ouabain may all participate by altering sodium, potassium and calcium fluxes in vascular smooth muscle cells. Recently the concept of insulin resistance as a mechanism of hypertension has emerged. Insulin may be a vascular growth factor as well as a local hormone facilitating a rise in intracellular sodium concentration. The observation that ACE inhibitors lower BP when plasma renin and angiotensin levels are low has led to an increased interest in local non-circulating renin-angiotensin systems. These systems probably influence arteriolar tone as well as vascular hypertrophy, and their inhibition leads to reduction in BP and some reversal of arteriolar thickening. Thus the ACE inhibitors represent a logical and effective method of treating hypertension and their use is likely to increase in the next few years.", 
    "347": "Lipid peroxides and fluorescent serum proteins, possible markers of free radical activity, are increased in diabetic patients, particularly those with angiopathy. Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, scavenges free radicals in vitro independently of ACE inhibition. This is probably due to the presence of a sulphydryl group which is not present in other ACE inhibitor drugs. We have compared the effects of captopril and enalapril on free radical activity in thirty-two diabetic subjects with hypertension (BP greater than 160/95 mmHg). After a three week run-in period on no antihypertensive therapy, patients were randomly allocated to receive captopril or enalapril, the dose titrated according to BP response. After three months, BP was well controlled in both groups and glycaemic control unchanged. Both drugs were associated with a reduction of fluorescent IgG (captopril:Baseline [BL] 0.564 vs. 12 weeks [w] 0.428, P less than 0.05, enalapril:BL 0.603 vs. 12w 0.422 P less than 0.05) and thiobarbituric acid reactive material (captopril:BL 2.35 nmol MDA vs. 12w 1.46 nmol, P less than 0.05, enalapril:BL 2.44 nmol vs. 12w 1.72 nmol, P less than 0.01). In contrast to in vitro studies, there was no significant difference between the drugs when used in therapeutic doses, questioning a hypothesised advantage of captopril over enalapril.", 
    "348": "Heart failure has become a major worldwide public health problem. Several million patients suffer with this malady and large epidemiologic studies have documented mortality that can be in excess of 50% at 5 years. Furthermore, morbidity is great with this disease and hospitalizations are increasing yearly. Attention must be placed on pharmacotherapeutic strategies that can attenuate the morbidity and high mortality seen in the heart failure milieu. Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) is a large, multicenter, multinational, clinical research program with two, double-blind, randomized clinical trials designed to evaluate the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on heart failure morbidity and mortality. The program also includes a registry and several substudies that are designed to better clarify heart failure pathophysiology. With over 13,000 subjects participating in this program, SOLVD is the largest clinical heart failure study ever mounted. It is important to consider the design rationale of this program.",

    "350": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the sensitivity of radionuclide renography in the diagnosis of a unilateral renal artery stenosis was tested both in a conscious dog model and in the human situation. ACE inhibition (10 mg enalaprilic acid, intravenously) markedly improved the sensitivity of [123I]hippuran renography in 10 renovascular hypertensive dogs with a mild to moderate unilateral renal artery stenosis from 50 to 100%. This improved sensitivity was due to an ACE-inhibition-induced delayed tracer handling at the stenotic side without an appreciable change in the renographic curve at the contralateral side. A similar phenomenon was observed in 15 hypertensive patients with an angiographically proved unilateral renal artery stenosis. Both [123I]hippuran and 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) handling was delayed on the stenotic side after oral enalapril treatment. However, only a moderate increase in sensitivity was observed comparing control renograms to ACE-inhibition renograms: from 87 to 93% for hippuran, and from 60 to 86% for DTPA. Eight of these 15 patients underwent either surgery or angioplasty resulting in a successful correction of the stenosis. Hypertension was more or less cured in five patients. Each of these patients had shown an ACE-inhibition-induced change in the renogram at the stenotic side, suggesting that such a response may predict the curability of the hypertension. However, of the three patients that showed no blood pressure change upon successful revascularization, two showed a positive ACE-inhibition renogram. In conclusion, in an ideal setting as obtained in animal experiments, ACE inhibition improves the sensitivity of renographic studies to 100%. However, its value in the clinical setting needs more standardization.", 
    "351": "Hypertension in renal transplant recipients is an important risk factor for graft function and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms of posttransplant hypertension are not well understood. Most of the time, the nature of this hypertension is multifactorial. Rejection, both acute and chronic, recurrent renal disease, graft renal artery stenosis, native kidney disease and drug therapy with steroids and cyclosporin have all been implicated. Where a single cause can be identified, the therapy can be rational and often very successful. For this reason, the diagnosis of graft renal artery stenosis is important, because percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery can lead to the cure of hypertension and improvement of the graft function. Noninvasive testing, using captopril renography for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis, presently yields encouraging results.", 
    "352": "We have analyzed our use of captopril-diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) scanning in patients presenting to the Royal Free Hospital predominantly with renal impairment. The sensitivity was found to be as good in patients with bilateral disease or disease of a single kidney as in patients with unilateral disease. On a number of occasions, though, the scan suggested unilateral disease when bilateral disease existed. There were, however, a large number of patients for whom captopril-DTPA scanning was not performed because of severe renal impairment or the possibility of renal artery stenosis in a single functioning kidney.", 
    "353": "We have established an ongoing prospective investigation of hypertensive patients to examine the rates of false results in captopril scintirenography. This study is being conducted at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Cornell University Medical Center. Two large populations will allow an accurate assessment of both false positive and false negative results. We report here the results from the first 30 patients, results which will be useful in defining the bounds for future studies.", 
    "354": "Captopril radionuclide test (CRT) has been introduced in clinical practice as a screening test for renovascular hypertension, since it allows the detection of the decrease of glomerular filtration rate that may be induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (25 mg oral captopril) in kidneys ipsilateral to a renal artery stenosis. However, due to the low prevalence of the disease, experiences in single centers may hardly satisfy the need for representative series of patients to validate the test. Nineteen centers participated in a collaborative study (CRT European Multicenter Study) that collected data from 424 patients. Here we report on the first results obtained by inspective renographic analysis. The captopril radionuclide test greatly potentiated the diagnostic performance of conventional renography and the accuracy was maximal when relying simply on postcaptopril findings alone. Specificity was 84.1% in the overall population and 91.8% in uncomplicated patients without nephropathy and renal insufficiency. Taking into account the sole arteriographic diagnosis, sensitivity was 73.2% or 90.7% for the subjects with unilateral or bilateral stenosis and an angiographic degree of stenosis greater than or equal to 70%. On the other hand, when a successful outcome of blood pressure after revascularization or nephrectomy was considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, a high sensitivity was obtained (92.7%). Moreover, the test became negative after intervention in the great majority (88%) of patients who had a positive preintervention CRT and a normalization of blood pressure after revascularization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "355": "Captopril renography is an excellent technique for investigating renovascular hypertension and other renal disturbances. However, many variables affect the usefulness of renographic data. The choices of radiopharmaceutical, converting enzyme inhibitor, and the type of imaging done must be made with care. Additionally, the method for selecting a study population must be carefully examined. Incorrect choices can render a study's data valueless. In this paper we delineate the questions that need to be considered before undertaking a renographic study.", 
    "356": "We retrospectively analysed the effects of a 12-month treatment with captopril (Tensiomin) in 46 patients. All of the patients had hypertension lasting for years (9 essential, 37 with chronic renal failure), 32 of them had proteinuria. Captopril was given in addition to, or in exchange for, other antihypertensive drugs. Under treatment with ACE-inhibitors, a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (0.4 torr/month) and in proteinuria (0.19 g/month) was seen (regression analysis). Discriminant analysis showed proteinuria and diastolic blood pressure to be the more modifiable, the younger the patients, the higher the proteinuria at the beginning and the longer the history of hypertension. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum protein and serum potassium did not change.", 
    "357": "1. Maximal aerobic exercise capacity, submaximal endurance exercise performance, and exercise haemodynamics have been studied in sixteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension during treatment with captopril and atenolol. 2. Administration of atenolol (1 x 100 mg day-1) or captopril (1 x 100 mg day-1) for 6 weeks resulted in similar supine and erect systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Heart rate was significantly lower during atenolol treatment. 3. Exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly lower during atenolol than during captopril treatment, exercise diastolic blood pressure (at 100W) did not differ significantly. With atenolol exercise cardiac output was significantly lower and exercise stroke volume significantly higher than with captopril. 4. Maximal work rate, maximal oxygen consumption and maximal heart rate were significantly lower during atenolol than during captopril treatment (respectively 6%, 8% and 25%). Maximal respiratory exchange ratio and lactate concentration did not differ. 5. No statistically significant difference in submaximal endurance time between atenolol and captopril was found. Endurance time was reduced by 19% during atenolol and by 13% during captopril as compared with placebo. No difference in rating of perceived exertion between atenolol and captopril was present. 6. The results indicate that atenolol will reduce blood pressure during exercise more effectively than captopril in patients with hypertension. The limitation of submaximal endurance exercise performance by both agents is of similar magnitude. This may be regarded as an unwanted side effect in certain physically active patients with hypertension.", 
    "358": "1. To test the hypothesis that the in vivo inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in a patient who presents atopy, results in a significant increase in cutaneous bradykinin and prostaglandin production, the effect of enalapril on the cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction was examined in 10 atopic volunteers. 2. A crossover study design was used and volunteers were randomly allocated to treatment with either enalapril (10 mg) alone, or in combination with indomethacin (75 mg), with and without ketotifen (1 mg). Drugs were administered twice daily for 2 days. 3. Allergen (Southern Grass Mix) was administered intradermally 2 h after last drug dosage and the surface areas of the immediate wheal-and-flare-reactions were measured 15 min later. The late phase of the cutaneous response was evaluated 6 h later by determining skinfold thickness and surface area. 4. Enalapril alone had no effect on any of the parameters measured. 5. The cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction was significantly reduced with regard to both immediate and late cutaneous responses when the indomethacin and ketotifen combination was added to enalapril therapy. 6. When only indomethacin was added to enalapril pretreatment the flare reaction was significantly reduced, but whealing was unaffected. 7. This study presents further evidence that mast cell mediators other than prostaglandins are involved in the cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. Furthermore, that endogenous bradykinin production after enalapril pretreatment either never reaches the supraphysiological concentrations used in previous experiments, or that bradykinin is rapidly and effectively broken down to inactive peptides by other carboxypeptidase enzymes.", 
    "359": "The diagnostic utility of peripheral and renal vein renin estimations in relation to angiographic findings was evaluated in 13 patients with renovascular hypertension and non-specific aortoarteritis (NSAA, Gr I), in comparison with 10 patients with renal artery stenosis due to other causes (Gr II). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Blood samples were collected after angiography from the femoral vein and renal vein on the affected side followed by sampling from the less affected or unaffected side. Renal vein renin ratio (RVRR) was calculated from renal vein renin values. The effect of captopril (25 mg oral) on blood pressure, PRA, and RVRR was examined in 8 patients from each group. Normotensive volunteers (8) with moderately low salt intake were also included in the study for comparison of twenty-four-hour urinary sodium output, peripheral PRA, and response to captopril. The mean peripheral PRA was high in both groups as compared with normotensive controls; however, the values were lower in patients with NSAA. The rise in PRA in response to captopril was insignificant in Gr I (p greater than 0.05) and RVRR greater than 1.5 was observed in 5 of 13 patients in contrast to 9 of 10 in Gr II (p less than 0.05). A paradoxical ratio, ie, (high renal vein renin levels on the less stenotic side) was noticed in 3 patients of Gr I, whereas none of the patients of GR II showed such a ratio. An improvement in RVRR after captopril was observed in 50% of patients of Gr I as compared with a marked response in all patients of Gr II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "360": "During an 11 week period (May to July, 1990), we observed six anaphylactoid reactions (AR) in six different hemodialysis patients occurring at the onset of treatment with a new AN69 hollow-fiber dialyzer. Four patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation and one of these expired. Four patients were also receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor while the other two were not on medication known to affect the renin-angiotensin system. Only patients treated with AN69 dialyzers were affected. A review of the literature indicated that out of 1087 patients reported, 72 patients were on the combination of an AN69 dialyzer and ACE inhibitor therapy and 41 (57%) demonstrated AR. Only two patients (0.4%; both from our series) treated with an AN69 dialyzer without ACE inhibitor therapy developed AR. AR did not occur in patients treated with a variety of other dialyzers during this 11 week period, with or without ACE inhibition. Possible causes for AR are discussed and include: (1.) blood-AN69 membrane interaction leading to the production of bradykinin and other vasodilators, the breakdown of which may be delayed by the presence of ACE inhibitors; (2.) hypersensitivity to ethylene oxide; (3.) passage of bacterial products from dialysate to blood; (4.) changes in membrane manufacturing specifications. Recommendations are proposed for the prevention and treatment of AR.", 
    "361": "The effects of inhibition of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system on the natriuretic and diuretic actions of an intravenous dose of frusemide 40 mg in patients with chronic cardiac failure maintained on oral diuretics were studied in the supine and erect positions. In the patients studied in the supine position the total 4 hour diuresis was decreased from 995 (92) ml to 668 (66) ml and the total 4 hour natriuresis fell from 105 (14) mmol to 67 (14) mmol following the administration of captopril. Creatinine clearance fell from 87 (8) ml/minute to 52 (15) ml/minute. In the patients studied in the erect position the total 4 hour diuresis was 596 (87) ml without captopril and 562 (83) ml with captopril. Total 4 hour natriuresis was 71 (13) mmol without captopril and 65 (9) mmol with captopril. Creatinine clearance was reduced by captopril from 82 (7) ml/minute to 47 (12) ml/minute. The reduction in the diuretic and natriuretic response to frusemide caused by captopril in the supine position is mediated through a fall in glomerular filtration rate. However, in the erect position, which is associated with even further increases in activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, the reduction in diuresis and natriuresis that a fall in glomerular filtration rate would cause is offset by abolition of the rise in sodium retaining hormones, angiotensin II and aldosterone that mediate the antinatriuretic effect of the erect position.", 
    "362": "To determine the importance of the arterial pressure effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) on renal function during acute renal adrenergic stimulation, we examined the effects of a 2-h intrarenal arterial infusion of norepinephrine (NE) at 0.1 and 0.25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 on renal function in five conscious dogs during 1) control conditions, 2) servo-control of renal arterial pressure (RAP) at control levels, and 3) chronic captopril administration. The low rate of NE infusion produced an approximately 20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) and an approximately 8-mmHg increase in RAP in association with an approximately 2.5-fold rise in plasma renin activity (PRA). The high rate of NE infusion produced greater increments in both PRA and RAP and an approximately 50% reduction in GFR and RPF. Neither servo-control of RAP nor captopril administration significantly affected the above renal responses to the low rate of NE infusion. In marked contrast, when increases in RAP (approximately 20 mmHg) were prevented at the high rate of NE infusion by servo-control of RAP, both the PRA and renal responses were enhanced. Furthermore, when RAP was reduced (approximately 25 mmHg) as a result of chronically blocking the renin-angiotensin system with captopril, the renal responses to the high rate of NE infusion were exaggerated even further; in four of five dogs, total renal ischemia occurred in response to NE. These results indicate that ANG II indirectly ameliorates the renal actions of renal adrenergic stimulation by increasing RAP.", 
    "363": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazeprilat and the angiotensin II (Ang II), AT1-specific receptor antagonist, DuP753, were compared for their effects on intimal lesion formation as well as smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration in Sprague Dawley rats after carotid balloon injury. Both the ACE inhibitor (benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg/day) and the AT1 antagonist (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced intimal lesion formation after balloon injury (by 35% and 49%, respectively). Medial SMC proliferation after injury was reduced 53% by the AT1 antagonist; however, the ACE inhibitor had no effect on SMC proliferation. SMC migration was reduced 94% by the AT1 antagonist and 68% by the ACE inhibitor. These data demonstrate the importance of Ang II in SMC proliferation and migration after balloon injury. They also demonstrate that in the balloon injury model, the ACE inhibitor reduced intimal lesion size by inhibiting SMC migration alone without affecting SMC proliferation. A more pronounced reduction in lesion size was obtained after AT1 antagonism, however, when both SMC migration and proliferation were inhibited.", 
    "364": "Hypertension and renal disease are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population, with the presence of microalbuminuria established as a predictor of excess mortality. Numerous attempts, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, have been made to intervene in the disease process. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the converting enzyme inhibitors and, more recently, certain calcium antagonists have beneficial effects on renal function above and beyond those simply due to blood pressure control. These effects are likely attributable to favorable systemic and renal hemodynamic changes as well as to direct cellular effects. However, intervention with these agents in various rat models of diabetes or hypertension is initiated very early. Hence, some of the beneficial renal effects may not be as dramatic in clinical practice because of the more commonly advanced stage seen at the time of intervention. We present an overview of the histologic, renal hemodynamic, and antiproteinuric effects of these agents in the experimental setting, as well as the clinical evidence supporting the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and certain classes of calcium antagonists in diabetic renal disease.", 
    "365": "Intimal hyperplasia is an important factor in the pathophysiology of vein graft failure. Local renin-angiotensin systems recently have been shown to modulate the development of intimal hyperplasia in arteries after intimal injury. The effect of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the development of intimal hyperplasia in experimental vein grafts was examined in this study. Ten New Zealand White rabbits received 10 mg/kg of captopril daily in their drinking water. One week later the right carotid artery was divided and bypassed with the reversed right external jugular vein in these rabbits and in 10 matched controls. Captopril was continued for 28 days after operation, when all the grafts were harvested. Five grafts from each group were perfusion fixed, and the intimal thickness in the proximal, middle, and distal segments was determined. Rings from the remaining grafts (n = 20 in each group) were studied in vitro under isometric tension, and their responses to norepinephrine (NE), histamine (HIST), serotonin (5-HT), angiotensin I (AI), and angiotensin II (AII) was measured. The intimal thickness of the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the captopril-treated grafts were significantly less than controls, being reduced in all segments by approximately 40% (p less than 0.0001). With regard to vasoreactivity, the captopril-treated grafts were hypersensitive to 5-HT (control ED50 5.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) mol/L vs. captopril-treated 1.1 +/- 0.2 X 10(-6) mol/L; p less than 0.005) although the maximal response was significantly reduced (control 1.6 +/- 0.3 g vs. captopril-treated 0.8 +/- 0.1 g; p less than 0.05). There were no differences in sensitivity between control and captopril-treated rings with respect to NE, HIST, AI, or AII. Four of the ten captopril-treated segments, however, failed to respond to AI, and the maximal active tension of the responders was significantly reduced (control 0.47 +/- 0.06 g vs. 0.20 +/- 0.05 g; p less than 0.02). These results suggest that ACE is involved in the modulation of vein graft intimal hyperplasia, and that ACE inhibitors may have therapeutic applications in patients undergoing vein bypass procedures.", 
    "366": "Unlike nitrates, molsidomine is able to relax vascular smooth muscle without depending on the availability of sulfhydryl groups. To assess the clinical relevance of this property, the hemodynamic effects of a 24-h i.v. infusion of molsidomine were studied in 14 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy rendered tolerant to i.v. isosorbide dinitrate. In order to determine the role of neurohormonal activation, six of these patients were studied in the presence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 5 mg, b.i.d.) (group 2). Six patients out of eight in group 1 (without ACE inhibition) and all patients in group 2 responded to molsidomine with a marked reduction of pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) (49% +/- 5 and 50% +/- 4 versus baseline value, respectively). However, the reduction of PAWP in group 1 was no longer significant at 12 h, and at 24 h the loss of the peak effect reached 67% +/- 7. On the contrary, PAWP remained persistently reduced in group 2 (loss of peak effect, 20% +/- 3 at 24 h, p less than 0.005). In addition, a significant decrease in hematocrit and increase in epinephrine occurred in group 1 but not in group 2. These results suggest that both the absence of dependence on sulfhydryl groups and the blockade of neurohormonal reactions are needed to avoid nitrate tolerance.", 
    "367": "This randomized, double-blind, crossover study was aimed at detecting efficacy differences in blood pressure control and peripheral circulation in cerebral aortic and femoral districts of slow-release nicardipine, 40 mg, and captopril, 50 mg, given twice daily to 20 primary hypertensive patients (9 male, 11 female; age range 33-60 years) for a period of 4 weeks for each treatment. Blood flow velocities in the aorta, common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and common femoral artery were noninvasively measured using a 2.0- or 5-MHz Doppler probe. Systolic blood pressure fall was similar with nicardipine (from 156 +/- 12 to 139 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and captopril (from 158 +/- 13 to 146 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) while significant efficacy difference (p less than 0.005) in diastolic pressure control was detected (from 104 +/- 6 to 91 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 with nicardipine and from 102 +/- 6 to 98 +/- 7 mm Hg with captopril). Regarding regional hemodynamics, nicardipine increased (from 119 +/- 24 to 133 +/- 27 cm/s), and captopril did not affect systolic velocity in the aorta (difference between final data, p less than 0.03). In the common carotid artery systolic velocity was increased solely by nicardipine. No significant changes were detected in the other vessels explored.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "368": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is both a target organ response to chronic arterial hypertension and a disorder that may be responsible for cardiovascular events. Although an increase in ventricular wall thickness may initially be compensatory and decrease wall stress, numerous studies have indicated that LVH is associated with a reduction in coronary flow reserve, diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias, all of which predispose to morbid cardiovascular events, including acute coronary syndromes, congestive myocardial failure, and sudden death. Reduction in LVH has been accomplished with beneficial effects on diastolic function and ventricular arrhythmias, without pressure-induced deterioration in systolic or diastolic function. Although therapy with diuretics and vasodilators effectively lowers arterial pressure, these therapies are not usually associated with significant regression of LVH. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers, central adrenergic blocking agents, and possibly alpha-adrenergic blockers and diuretics with vasodilatory properties are associated with reductions in LV mass. However, studies are still needed to determine the relative effects of various antihypertensive therapies on LVH regression, coronary flow reserve, ventricular function, ventricular ectopy, and most importantly, on protection against major cardiac morbidity and mortality inherent to LVH.", 
    "369": "The paper presents the data showing the important significance of basic research into the mechanisms of circulation regulation in synthesizing new classes of antihypertensive agents. It also considers the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the antihypertensive effect of calcium antagonists, postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme blockers to treat hypertensive disease. The paper gives the data suggesting the effects of the drugs on the adrenergic and humoral mechanisms of vascular tone regulation.", 
    "370": "The effects of calcium antagonists in reducing blood pressure at rest and during exercise were examined in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The haemodynamic effects of calcium antagonists were evaluated at rest and during exercise. We also examined 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension taking lacidipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (4 mg once a day, at 0700 h). Compared with placebo, lacidipine induced significant mean reductions in 24-h blood pressure (P less than 0.001 for systolic blood pressure; P less than 0.002 for diastolic blood pressure). After 24 h, the blood pressure reductions were still significant (P less than 0.02 for systolic blood pressure; P less than 0.04 for diastolic blood pressure). The heart rate did not change. During dynamic exercise, blood pressure at maximal effort was reduced (P less than 0.01 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and the external workload reached at the anaerobic threshold was significantly increased (P less than 0.001), but not at maximum effort. Ventilation and tidal volume were similar at both the anaerobic threshold and peak exercise, while oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production were increased at the anaerobic threshold (P less than 0.02 for carbon dioxide production) but were similar at peak exercise.", 
    "371": "Renal vascular resistance is increased in essential hypertension, with a consequent reduction in renal plasma flow together with a normal or slightly reduced glomerular filtration rate. Non-specific vasodilators may exacerbate this effect while loop diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists may increase these renal hemodynamic parameters. We studied the effect of lacidipine, a new long-lasting calcium antagonist, on renal hemodynamics in 11 essential hypertensives. Lacidipine (4 mg once a day) acutely increased renal plasma flow without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. A transient, but non-significant, diuresis and natriuresis occurred. After 4 weeks of lacidipine treatment, all the parameters of renal function returned to basal levels. These results suggest that the well known renal effects of calcium antagonists are, at least in part, related to the onset of the antihypertensive effect being more pronounced with compounds such as nifedipine which have a rapid-onset, blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "372": "The normal kidney can increase its rate of glomerular filtration in response to an acute protein load. It has been suggested that this acute hyperfiltration represents a renal functional reserve (RFR). The RFR has also been proposed to reflect the chronic hyperfiltration found in diabetic patients and animal models of chronic renal failure. The physiologic role of the RFR is still unclear. On the one hand, the availability of an RFR may retard the progression towards end-stage renal failure. On the other hand, sustained hyperfiltration has been implicated as a potential deleterious factor in the progression of renal disease. Antihypertensive drugs used in the management of hypertensive patients with chronic renal disease modify both the systemic and the renal hemodynamics. Depending on their hemodynamic effects, they may thereby alter the ability to mobilize RFR. Today, it is still not clear whether an ideal compound should increase, decrease, or not affect RFR to preserve long-term renal function. Evaluation of the effects of various antihypertensive agents on RFR could become an important aspect of consideration in order to optimize both the control of blood pressure and the capacity of the therapy to prevent deterioration of renal function.", 
    "373": "Left ventricular modeling after myocardial infarction may be modified in three ways: firstly, by limiting the infarct size; secondly, by administering ACE inhibitors: these drugs limit infarct expansion and ventricular dilatation. They reduce the prevalence of secondary left ventricular failure and, in the animal, improve the prognosis. Glyceryl trinitrate also appears to be effective. The third therapeutic option is maintaining the patency of the artery responsible for the infarction, which has a beneficial effect on ventricular remodeling. The respective therapeutic indications of these three options are still a matter of discussion.", 
    "374": "There is controversy as to which BP-lowering manoeuvres and/or drugs can be combined effectively. Ideally, a combination therapy should show an additional BP-lowering effect over monotherapy. The effect should be of sufficient clinical significance, without short- or long-term adverse effects, and the patients should feel well. Combination therapy should be based on the understanding of the mechanisms of action of the different classes of drugs used and of their interaction. Rational combinations include an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker together with moderate salt restriction or a thiazide diuretic or a calcium antagonist. Less rational combinations include an ACE inhibitor with a beta-blocker, and a calcium antagonist with a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "375": "Several risk factors for cardiovascular disease are discussed, including blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, stress and smoking. Beta-blockers have a modest effect in reversing increased left ventricular mass, compared with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, although beta-blockers are as effective as ACE inhibitors in reducing posterior wall and interventricular septal thickness. Coronary events and many risk factors show a circadian rhythm. Beta-blockers can reduce the mid-morning (0700-1000 h) risk of ischaemic events and myocardial infarction. Catecholamine levels peak at 0700-1000 h, and catecholamine-induced myocardial necrosis can be significantly reduced by beta-blockade. Beta-blockers appear to be more effective than calcium antagonists in modifying the mid-morning vulnerable period and reducing the duration of ischaemia. However, the problems of using surrogate endpoints are discussed. In young to middle-aged hypertensives, beta-blockers are more effective in primary prevention of myocardial events than diuretics, though this is not the case for the elderly. Beta-blockers are also more effective than calcium antagonists in reducing morbidity and mortality after a myocardial infarction (i.e. secondary prevention). Patients with hypertension associated with ischaemic heart disease are most likely to get maximal benefit from treatment with beta-blockers.", 
    "376": "Experiments were performed in anaesthetized dogs to characterize the renal effects of the selective dopamine DA1-receptor agonist, fenoldopam. Intrarenal artery infusion of fenoldopam (0.01-10 micrograms/kg per min) caused dose-related renal vasodilation. At low doses (0.01-0.3 micrograms/kg per min), renal vasodilation occurred without concomitant falls in blood pressure but was accompanied by increased urine output. This diuresis was most probably a result of reduced tubular reabsorption since glomerular filtration rate was not increased. Both fenoldopam-induced renal vasodilation and diuresis were blocked to a similar extent by the selective dopamine DA1-receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (30 micrograms/kg, intravenously), suggesting that both effects were mediated by dopamine DA1-receptors. In the presence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1 mg/kg, intravenously, + 20 micrograms/kg per min, intrarenal artery), fenoldopam (0.01-0.3 micrograms/kg per min) significantly increased fractional excretion of sodium, despite reducing blood pressure; neither of these effects were observed in captopril-free dogs. These observations support the view that the inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on tubular function, and its vasodepressor activity, may be opposed by angiotensin II resulting from fenoldopam-induced renin release.", 
    "377": "Patient compliance with antihypertensive therapy can be improved by minimizing drug-induced sexual dysfunction. Impotence, decreased libido, impaired ejaculation and gynecomastia are potential side effects, depending on the agent prescribed. Centrally acting antihypertensive agents such as methyldopa and clonidine, nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics are the drugs most often associated with sexual dysfunction. Thiazide diuretics cause impotence but may otherwise play a minimal role in sexual dysfunction. Alpha-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have little adverse effect on sexual function. It is important to obtain an adequate history before and after initiating therapy. If sexual dysfunction develops in a patient, a different class of medication can be tried.", 
    "378": "In this article, the issues involved in the measurements of quality of life in clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs are discussed with emphasis on beta-blocker treatment. The extensive documentation available for beta-blockers makes it possible to evaluate different aspects of this class of drugs. Generally, beta-blockers have been shown to be safe with a low frequency of serious side effects. However, results of different studies have shown that this class of drugs affects various aspects of well-being and psychomotor tests both negatively and positively. Adverse effects often associated with beta-blockers are the subjective symptoms that are considered to be related to the central nervous system. Today there is increasing evidence that these can be quantitatively as well as qualitatively reduced by using beta-blockers in a low dose and avoiding high plasma peak concentrations. Considering effects on well-being and psychomotor tests, there seems to be no clinical difference between hydrophilic and lipophilic beta-blockers, when administered in comparable therapeutic dosages, whereas beta 1-selective blockers in clinically relevant doses seem to produce fewer and less severe adverse effects than nonselective blockers. Compared with other classes of cardiovascular drugs, there is no clear evidence of differences in well-being between selective beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists.", 
    "379": "A serial measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA), serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE), concentrations of plasma angiotensin II (AII) and plasma aldosterone (Ald) in 38 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or suspected AMI showed that PRA, AII and Ald levels increased in patients with AMI, especially within first week after onset, and were significantly higher in those cases with severe complications. ACE kept in normal range in all subjects. After small dose captopril therapy, ACE and Ald decreased significantly, PRA and AII increased in 6 patients with AMI. Small dose captopril could cause remarkable blood pressure reduction, but no effect on heart rate. The results suggested that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was activated during AMI, especially in cases with severe complications. Captopril could inhibit this system partially.", 
    "380": "Recent studies have more clearly defined the role of drug therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I) cannot be recommended at this time. The benefit of prophylactic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or vasodilators in patients at high risk for developing symptomatic CHF is currently being evaluated. Treatment of patients with symptomatic CHF (NYHA class II-IV) should be initiated with a combination of a diuretic, digoxin, and an ACEI. This combination has been shown to reduce the mortality rate in patients with NYHA class II-IV CHF. Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with this combination may benefit from the addition of the direct-acting, nonspecific vasodilators--hydralazine and a nitrate. The addition of the nonspecific vasodilators to an ACEI has not been tested in controlled trials. In patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with diuretics, digoxin, ACEIs, and nonspecific vasodilators, treatment options are not clear. The use of beta-agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and intermittent fixed-dose, fixed-interval dobutamine should be avoided as these agents are associated with a high mortality rate. Heart transplantation should be considered early in the course of CHF to allow for preservation of other vital organ systems. Unfortunately, heart transplantation is available to only a very small minority of potential transplant candidates.", 
    "381": "1. Treatment of young rats with vitamin D3 plus nicotine produced 31 and 4 fold increases in the calcium content of the aorta and the mesenteric arterial bed, respectively. 2. Aortic rings and perfused mesenteric arterial beds from vitamin D3/nicotine-treated animals showed a diminished contractile response to noradrenaline in vitro. 3. In vascular preparations from vitamin D3/nicotine-treated animals, precontracted with noradrenaline, relaxation by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, carbachol, was attenuated but responses to sodium nitroprusside were not modified. 4. Prolonged treatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, at a dose (1 mg kg-1) which did not significantly modify blood pressure, failed to prevent vascular calcium overload. 5. Perindopril treatment diminished noradrenaline-evoked vasoconstrictor responses of aortic rings in both groups, but restored responses in mesenteric arterial beds of vitamin D3/nicotine-treated rats. 6. Perindopril treatment also restored the maximal responses to carbachol of both aortic rings and mesenteric arterial beds of vitamin D3/nicotine-treated rats. 7. In conclusion, in the vitamin D3 plus nicotine model of calcium overload, reduced endothelial-mediated relaxation can be prevented by perindopril treatment.", 
    "382": "There is no doubt that under normal conditions powerful local metabolic regulation adjusts coronary blood flow to myocardial oxygen consumption. However, despite substantial experimental efforts the responsible mediators are still largely unknown. Adenosine, a purported mediator of local metabolic control of coronary blood flow, is probably only involved in transient flow adaptations but not in steady state coronary autoregulation. Even below the autoregulatory range a substantial vasodilator reserve persists, and recruitment of such a vasodilator results in improved regional myocardial blood flow and attenuated regional ischaemic dysfunction. Beta-adrenergic coronary dilation is of minor functional importance. Alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction acts to attenuate increases in coronary blood flow during sympathetic activation under normal conditions, so that myocardial oxygen extraction increases to match the increased oxygen consumption. Alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction remains operative in ischaemic myocardium, thus precipitating or contributing to acute myocardial ischaemia during sympathetic activation and exercise in experimental animals, as well as in patients with stable angina. The vagal transmitter acetylcholine-upon exogenous intracoronary infusion-induces critical constriction of epicardial coronary arteries with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, a vagal initiation of coronary spasm or myocardial ischaemia has not been documented so far. Similarly, peptide hormones/transmitters such as NPY, vasopressin and angiotensin can induce myocardial ischaemia upon exogenous administration. Their pathophysiological role in myocardial ischaemia, however, remains to be established.", 
    "383": "The long-term oral administration of TA-6366 (5 mg/kg/day) from 4-weeks old impeded the genetic hypertension development with only a slight decrease in heart rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, the lower dose (1 mg/kg/day) of TA-6366 did not affect the development, but it lowered blood pressure after the development was almost accomplished. Concomitantly, relative heart weights in both the groups were markedly decreased to almost the same degree. The reduction of ACE activity in the aorta, brain and lung of both groups was found at 24 hr after the final administration, particularly at the 5 mg/kg/day dose; and that of the aorta was kept at almost the same low level even on the 9th day after withdrawal. After withdrawal of TA-6366 (5 mg/kg/day), the significant decrease in blood pressure was sustained at least for 10 weeks. The beneficial effect of TA-6366 on the hypertension development in SHRs seems to be related to its strong and long-lasting ACE inhibition, especially in the vasculature.", 
    "384": "Early antihypertensive treatment with beta1 blockers and diuretics has proved to delay progression in diabetic nephropathy. Application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) may also be relevant. To elucidate possible differences in acute renal response to ACE-I and beta-blockers, kidney function was investigated before and after enalaprilat (10 mg) and metoprolol (10 mg) i.v. in 8 microalbuminuric insulin-dependent diabetic patients on no antihypertensive therapy (Study A). Glomerular filtration rate (clearance of 125I-iothalamate) was unchanged with both agents. ACE-I gave rise to efferent renal vasodilation: renal resistance and filtration fraction fell, renal plasma flow (RPF; 131I-hippuran) tended to rise (2p = 0.07) and blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE; radioimmunoassay) were reduced. In contrast, metoprolol caused a decline in RPF, an increase in renal resistance and filtration fraction, and no change in blood pressure or UAE. In 10 diabetic, nephropathic patients undergoing treatment with metoprolol and thiazide (Study B), the acute response to enalaprilat corresponded closely to that observed in Study A, including a decrease in UAE and blood pressure. Over 6 months the addition of enalapril (20 mg/d) to metoprolol and thiazide produced a more pronounced UAE-reduction, although no significant decrease in blood pressure was observed. The present findings support that ACE-I may process specific renoprotective effects. A combination therapy with beta1 blockers, ACE-I, and diuretics is suggested.", 
    "385": "We attempt to elucidate the putative indirect mechanisms by which endothelin-1 affects mean blood pressure and renal blood flow in normotensive awake rats. Endothelin-1 (700 pg/kg, i.v.) induced a short-lasting decrease followed by a prolonged increase in mean blood pressure (from 113 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 4 mmHg at 30 sec, 132 +/- 7 mmHg at 10 min, and 129 +/- 6 mmHg at 30 min, p less than 0.01), and caused a profound and long-lasting fall in renal blood flow as measured by Doppler flowmeter technique (from 2.87 +/- 0.29 to 1.40 +/- 0.37 kHz at 30 sec, 1.77 +/- 0.32 kHz at 10 min and 2.10 +/- 0.45 kHz at 30 min, p less than 0.01). Neither the receptor antagonist of bradykinin D-Arg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7-bradykinin (30 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) nor the antagonist of angiotensin II Sar1, Thr8-angiotensin II (4 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) altered the changes in mean blood pressure and renal blood flow induced by endothelin-1. The antagonist of EDRF synthesis, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (100 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) enhanced the endothelin-1-induced increase in mean blood pressure (endothelin-1: 20 +/- 2 mmHg vs endothelin-1 + EDRF antagonist: 39 +/- 3 mmHg at 10 min, p less than 0.01) and decrease in renal blodo flow (endothelin-1: -40 +/- 4% vs endothelin-1 + EDRF antagonist: -73 +/- 3% at 10 min, p less than 0.01).2+ mediated by the blockade of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "386": "Experimental myocardial infarction is a model of cardiac overload due to amputation of part of the cardiac muscle. The development of cardiac failure depends on the size of the infarct and the time factor. This model of overload is associated with changes of the phenotype of the remaining healthy muscle and with peripheral vascular modifications partially dependent of the activation of pressor and/or deactivation of dilator systems. These changes are proportional to the size of the infarction at a given time after induction of the model. The degree of right ventricular hypertrophy and the decrease in blood pressure reflect the severity of infarction and the deterioration of the remaining myocardial function, affecting the haemodynamics both before and after the left ventricle. The increases in the 1/3 forms of isomyosins, the amount of subendocardial collagen, the biosynthesis, stocking and secretion of ANF are related to the infarct size and degree of overload. Similarly, the concentration of cyclic GMP is proportional to the infarct size. These parameters reflect ventricular overload, the increase of stress and energy deprivation of the remaining healthy muscle. The activation of peripheral pressor systems is also dependent on the infarct size reflects the effect of cardiac pump dysfunction on the kidney, liver, brain and endothelium. Large infarcts are associated with increased circulating renin and renal concentrations, with a decrease in angiotensinogen levels related to its consumption by the renin and to reduced hepatic synthesis and also with increased secretion and biosynthesis of vasopressin by the hypothalamus. In this model, Perindopril is beneficial by decreasing the cardiac load. It reduces the blood pressure, causes regression of bi-auricular and right ventricular hypertrophy. Changes in myosin isoenzyme configuration regress and subendocardial fibrosis and ANF concentrations are normalised. The effects of ACE inhibitors in this context, though very beneficial, are limited by the impossibility of normalising cardiac load and stress when the initial amputation of cardiac contractile mass exceeds 40%.", 
    "387": "The fixed combination of lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (L/HCTZ) was compared with each of the monocomponents in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study involving elderly patients with mild to severe hypertension. At the end of the trial, a total of 278 patients had completed 8 weeks of treatment. SBP reduction from baseline in the L/HCTZ group was significantly greater, sitting and standing, compared with both the monotherapy groups. Sitting DBP reduction from baseline in the L/HCTZ group was significantly greater than in the hydrochlorothiazide group. Uric acid levels were raised significantly more in the L/HCTZ group compared with the lisinopril group, and the fall in potassium levels were significantly smaller in the L/HCTZ group compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group. Safety and tolerability were equivalent for the three groups.", 
    "388": "The pharmacokinetics of combined lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide have been studied following single and multiple oral doses to 'young' (reference), elderly and renally impaired hypertensive patients. Tablets containing the fixed combination of lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were administered as a single dose followed by daily administration for 6-8 days. Serum concentration and haemodynamic measurements were made at intervals up to 48 hours after the first and last doses. The serum profiles of both drugs were comparable with observations from previous studies, showing higher concentrations in the elderly and in the renally impaired patients. Similar differences have been reported for such patient groups when the drugs were administered separately, indicating an absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. Both drugs accumulated by about 30% on multiple daily dosing. There were no differences between the patient groups in the extent of accumulation. The combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide produced the expected hypotensive response, minimum BP values being recorded 4 and 6 hours after treatment. The higher concentrations in the elderly and renally impaired patients were not associated with a greater reduction in BP. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide given together to elderly and renally impaired hypertensive patients suggests that a fixed dose combination is appropriate and that no changes to the dosage regimen additional to those used for the individual agents are necessary.", 
    "389": "The efficacy, tolerability and metabolic effects of a fixed combination of lisinopril 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (L/HCTZ) and those of the monocomponents were compared in 286 mild to moderate hypertensive patients in a 17-centre study using a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in, patients were randomized to one of the three treatments for 8 weeks. Supine and standing BPs were measured at peak blood levels (4-8 hours post dose) after 4 weeks, and at trough blood levels (24-28 hours post dose) after 8 weeks. The BP reduction from baseline was greater with L/HCTZ than with the monocomponents at weeks 4 and 8; at week 8 the reduction was statistically significant vs lisinopril for standing DBP (P less than 0.027) but not for standing SBP; the reduction was significant with L/HCTZ vs hydrochlorothiazide at week 4 [P = 0.0002/0.0001 (SBP/DBP) supine; P = 0.0002/0.0002 standing] and at week 8 (P = 0.0001/0.0001 supine and standing). Response at week 8 (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) with L/HCTZ (87.0%) was greater than with hydrochlorothiazide (29.0%; P less than 0.0001) and marginally greater than with lisinopril (74.2%; P = 0.069). Heart rate fell statistically significantly more with L/HCTZ (by 3.3 beats/minute) than with HCTZ (by 0.86 beats/minute; P = 0.018). L/HCTZ treatment significantly increased plasma uric acid levels compared with lisinopril. L/HCTZ decreased potassium, while lisinopril increased potassium. L/HCTZ decreased cholesterol; HCTZ increased it. Adverse effects were more common on L/HCTZ vs lisinopril (P = 0.033) but not vs hydrochlorothiazide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "390": "Co-administration of drugs with complementary action is a rational approach to the treatment of hypertension provided that the drugs are free of mutual pharmacokinetic interactions. The pharmacokinetics of single doses of lisinopril 10 mg alone, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone, both drugs given concomitantly, and both given in a fixed combination tablet were studied in 24 healthy volunteers (including four women) using a randomized four-way crossover design with each treatment separated by 2 weeks. Timed blood and urine samples were collected for measurement of peak serum levels, area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) and urinary recovery of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. When given alone, peak serum levels of lisinopril (attained 6-8 hours post dose) were 44 ng/ml. Urinary recovery was 17.6% of the dose. Mean values after treatment with the combination tablet were only 2-6% lower, and co-administration with hydrochlorothiazide in free combination gave mean values 7% higher than the fixed-dose combination. Time to peak serum levels did not vary between treatments. Dosing with hydrochlorothiazide alone resulted in a mean peak serum concentration of 53 ng/ml, 2-6 hours post dose. The combination tablet resulted in a peak serum level and AUC for hydrochlorothiazide about 10% lower. The corresponding values for the free combination were only about 7% lower. The results indicate no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between the two components when administered in a single tablet.", 
    "391": "A total of 930 patients have been evaluated for safety in a programme of clinical trials for lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination treatment. Combination therapy with these two agents is generally well tolerated. In clinical trials, adverse experiences in patients treated with a lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination were dizziness (7.5%), headache (5.2%), cough (3.9%), fatigue (3.7%), orthostatic effects (3.2%), diarrhoea (2.5%), nausea (2.2%) and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2%). Withdrawals from treatment have been relatively infrequent comprising dizziness (0.8%), headache (0.3%), cough (0.6%), fatigue (0.4%), diarrhoea (0.2%), orthostatic effects and nausea (0.1% each). The most common laboratory adverse experiences in patients on therapy with the lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination are: increases in serum glucose, triglycerides, uric acid, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and blood urea; and decreases in serum potassium. However, in individual controlled studies, the addition of lisinopril to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide results in attenuation of some of the potentially adverse metabolic affects of the diuretic. Adverse experiences in the patients treated for periods of 50 weeks or more, the elderly and the renally impaired are similar to those seen in the total population. Overall the available data indicate that a fixed dose combination of lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide is a well-tolerated therapeutic option in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.",

After a 2-4 week placebo run-in period patients were randomized to L/HCTZ (n = 82) or C/HCTZ (n = 83) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, peak blood levels of both treatments showed lowered sitting BPs (-22.8/-14.3 mm Hg for L/HCTZ vs -22.8/-14.0 mm Hg for C/HCTZ), and standing BPs (-22.6/-13.1 mm Hg vs -21.6/-12.8 mm Hg, respectively). Between-drug differences were not significant (ns). At trough blood levels L/HCTZ lowered sitting BPs more than C/HCTZ, -23.6/-14.9 mm Hg vs -16.0/-11.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.02/less than 0.03), respectively. The effect on standing BP was similar, -22.0/-13.8 mm Hg vs -15.1/-10.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.03/less than 0.05) for L/HCTZ and C/HCTZ, respectively. Both treatments slightly increased heart rate (ns). Serum potassium fell more with C/HCTZ than with L/HCTZ (P less than 0.005). The fasting glucose level rose with L/HCTZ and fell with C/HCTZ. Uric acid, triglycerides and fasting cholesterol levels rose in both groups (ns). There were no differences between treatments with respect to adverse events. L/HCTZ appears to be a well-tolerated combination with efficacy on once-daily dosing superior to that of C/HCTZ.",

A total of 87 patients were randomized to lisinopril and 87 to captopril. Six weeks of treatment with lisinopril or captopril lowered supine BP by 13.3/8.8 mm Hg and 8.7/6.5 mm Hg, respectively. After 4 weeks of combination treatment, BP 24 hours post dose fell to 144.0 +/- 1.3/88.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in the L/HCTZ group vs 146.8 +/- 1.3/90.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in the C/HCTZ group (P less than 0.05 DBP; differences in SBP were not significant, ns). The proportion of patients normalized (DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was 79.5% vs 72% for L/HCTZ and C/HCTZ, respectively (ns). A total of 93.6% of patients on L/HCTZ achieved a fall in DBP of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, compared with 86.7% of patients on C/HCTZ (ns). One patient on lisinopril withdrew because of coughing. No statistically significant differences were observed between L/HCTZ and C/HCTZ with regard to adverse events. In conclusion, L/HCTZ was as well tolerated as C/HCTZ, but produced a greater fall in DBP.",

After 8 weeks of treatment the supine and standing BPs 4-6 hours post dose were 2.7/1.3 mm Hg lower in the L/HCTZ patients than in the L40 patients. However, thee differences did not reach statistical significance. When measured 24-26 hours post dose, no significant difference was observed between the two treatments with respect to change from baseline for supine and standing BPs. There was no significant difference between treatments. Adverse events related to treatment were reported in 13.2% of L/HCTZ and 20.0% of L40 patients (difference not statistically significant), and withdrawals from L/HCTZ and L40 (1.1% and 2.2%) were not significantly different. The results indicate that in patients uncontrolled on L20, switching to L/HCTZ is as effective as increasing the dose of lisinopril to 40 mg once daily.", 
    "395": "Two combinations of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (L/HCTZ, 20 mg/12.5 mg and 20 mg/25 mg) are currently marketed. The licences are based primarily on a dose ratio study and a parallel titration study. In the former randomized study of 209 patients with sitting DBP of 90-115 mm Hg, the antihypertensive effects of L/HCTZ 20 mg/12.5 mg and 20 mg/25 mg were significantly greater than either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy (P less than or equal to 0.01), while the effect of L/HCTZ 20 mg/6.25 mg, was greater than hydrochlorothiazide but not lisinopril monotherapy. In the latter study, 394 patients with sitting DBP of 90-120 mm Hg received lisinopril 20 mg, HCTZ 12.5 mg, or L/HCTZ 20 mg/12.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks of double-blind therapy. All of the dose regimens could be doubled at 4 and 8 weeks for adequate BP control. The L/HCTZ group had significantly greater effect than either monotherapy (P less than or equal to 0.01). Thus, concomitant therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide provides BP reduction beyond that of either monocomponent. Studies on new combinations of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are under way to increase prescribing options for practitioners.", 
    "396": "We investigated the effects of the human renin inhibitor, ES-8891, and captopril on renal renin secretion and storage in the marmoset. Either ES-8891 (30 mg/kg) or captopril (2 mg/kg) was given orally twice a day for 1 week to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets (n = 6 for each group). The ES-8891-treated group displayed a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma immunoreactive renin (PIR) compared with the control group. Kidney renin content was significantly increased compared with the control group and enlarged renin granules containing heterogenous internum were observed in juxtaglomerular cells after treatment with ES-8891. Treatment with captopril significantly increased PRA and PIR compared with the control day as well as increasing kidney renin content and the number of renin granules with crystalline content in juxtaglomerular cells compared with the control group. These results suggest that ES-8891 inhibits both PRA and renin secretion from the kidney, resulting in an increase in renal renin storage.", 
    "397": "Malignant stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (M-SHRSP) are a useful animal model for studying juvenile malignant hypertension. Using M-SHRSP males, the effects of SQ 29,852 [(S)-1-[6-amino-2-[[hydroxy (4-phenylbutyl) phosphinyl]oxy]-1-oxohexyl]-L-proline; 30-40 mg/kg per day], captopril (30-40 mg/kg per day), hydralazine hydrochloride (10-15 mg/kg per day) and a 33% fish meal diet on the prevention and therapy of malignant hypertension were examined. Drugs and diet were given separately, beginning at weaning, maturity or adulthood. Observed effects included antihypertension, prolonged life span and prevention and/or reversal of angionecrosis. Each treatment resulted in an antihypertensive effect, but some adult rats seemed treatment-resistant. SQ 29,852 was the most effective treatment for reducing blood pressure. The life span of animals in the treated groups was extended significantly beyond that of the controls. In particular, those rats treated with either captopril or SQ 29,852 lived in excess of 500 days. This included not only those in which treatment resulted in a lowering of blood pressure, but also those whose severe hypertension was not so reduced. Angionecrosis was observed in the organs of many of the non-treated animals, including the brain, heart, kidneys and testes. Both hydralazine and the fish meal diet had a limited effect, if any, on the prevention or reversal of angionecrosis. In contrast, almost none of the rats given either captopril or SQ 29,852 showed cerebrovascular lesions or angionecrosis of the brain, heart and kidneys; angionecrosis in adult M-SHRSP kidneys disappeared within 10 or 18 days after the initiation of SQ 29,852 or captopril, respectively. This data seems to support a possible role for these two drugs not only in prevention, but also in repair, of angionecrosis independent of markedly high blood pressure in M-SHRSP. Based on our overall observations, SQ 29,852 was seen as the most effective of the treatments studied.", 
    "398": "In a randomized, parallel, double-blind study, lisinopril (n = 412; average dose 18.8 mg) reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (change = 20.2/13.8 mmHg; P less than 0.01/P less than 0.01) more than nifedipine (n = 416; average dose 37.4 mg; change = 13.3/11.2 mmHg) after 10-week treatment in patients, aged 40-70 years, with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Lisinopril was better tolerated than nifedipine. The withdrawals from treatment were fewer in the lisinopril-treated group (11 versus 46; P less than 0.01). The frequency of adverse experiences reported after a general question of discomfort was significantly lower for lisinopril than for nifedipine (P less than 0.01). When questioned on specific symptoms, frequency of coughing was higher with lisinopril (P less than 0.01), while flushing, edema, palpitations, dizziness, tiredness and rash were reported more frequently (P less than 0.01, for all) in the nifedipine-treated group. Quality of life was assessed by both patients and spouses. No significant changes in wellbeing were observed for either drug, except for the highest dose level of nifedipine which caused a deterioration.", 
    "399": "B1 receptors for kinins are selectively stimulated by bradykinin (BK) or Lys-BK (kallidin) fragments without the C terminal arginine residue. The present study was performed using an established in vivo model of B1 receptor-mediated cardiovascular action. Rabbits pretreated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (25 micrograms/kg) and anesthetized 5 h later exhibit acute and transient hypotension in response to intra-arterial boluses of B1 receptor agonists. The naturally occurring B1 agonist Lys-des-Arg9-BK was more potent than des-Arg9-BK in the in vivo model, but the effect of either natural sequence was brief. Evidence derived from previous in vitro experiments suggests these peptides may be substrates for angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). In addition, Lys-des-Arg9-BK is hydrolyzed in vitro by aminopeptidase M. Therefore, we tested the hypotensive effects of Lys-des-Arg9-BK analogs selectively protected against ACE activity (Lys-[D-Phe8]des-Arg9-BK) or against both ACE and aminopeptidase M (Sar-[D-Phe8]des-Arg9-BK). Both analogs were found to elicit a biphasic response consisting of a brief hypotensive effect followed by a prolonged hypotensive state. Indomethacin prevented only the second, prolonged phase of the hypotension induced by the metabolically protected analogs. The duration of hypotensive episodes induced by Lys-des-Arg9-BK was increased in rabbits pretreated with either captopril, an ACE inhibitor, or the aminopeptidase M inhibitor amastatin, consistent with the prolonged effect of metabolically protected analogs. An infusion of the B1 agonist Sar-[D-Phe8]des-Arg9-BK (1 microgram/min) in lipopolysaccharide-pretreated rabbits led to a very important and persistent hypotensive state that was not prevented by indomethacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "400": "We compared the effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on components of the renin-angiotensin system in plasma and kidney of male Sprague-Dawley rats administered perindopril in their drinking water at two doses (1.4 and 4.2 mg/kg) over 7 days. Eight angiotensin peptides were measured in plasma and kidney: angiotensin-(1-7), angiotensin II, angiotensin-(1-9), angiotensin I, angiotensin-(2-7), angiotensin III, angiotensin-(2-9), and angiotensin-(2-10). In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme activity, renin, and angiotensinogen were measured in plasma, and renin, angiotensinogen, and their respective messenger RNAs were measured in kidney; angiotensinogen messenger RNA was also measured in liver. In plasma, the highest dose of perindopril reduced angiotensin converting enzyme activity to 11% of control, increased renin 200-fold, reduced angiotensinogen to 11% of control, increased angiotensin-(1-7), angiotensin I, angiotensin-(2-7), and angiotensin-(2-10) levels 25-, 9-, 10-, and 13-fold, respectively; angiotensin II levels were not significantly different from control. By contrast, for the kidney, angiotensin-(1-7), angiotensin I, angiotensin-(2-7), and angiotensin-(2-10) levels did not increase; angiotensin II levels fell to 14% of control, and angiotensinogen fell to 12% of control. Kidney renin messenger RNA levels increased 12-fold, but renal renin content and angiotensinogen messenger RNA levels in kidney and liver were not influenced by perindopril treatment. These results demonstrate a differential regulation of angiotensin peptides in plasma and kidney and provide direct support for the proposal that the cardiovascular effects of converting enzyme inhibitors depend on modulation of tissue angiotensin systems. Moreover, the failure of kidney angiotensin I levels to increase with perindopril treatment, taken together with the fall in kidney angiotensinogen levels, suggests that angiotensinogen may be a major rate-limiting determinant of angiotensin peptide levels in the kidney.", 
    "401": "Gonadectomy induced a significant retardation of systolic blood pressure (BP) in male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Captopril (5 mg/kg, i.p.), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, significantly decreased BP in all groups, except that the antihypertensive action was significantly inhibited by gonadectomy in both sexes. The plasma ACE activity was increased in orchiectomized males, but this effect did not appear in females. Neither plasma renin activity nor its concentration were changed by gonadectomy in either sex. Aorta ACE activity was not changed by gonadectomy in either sex, while the renin activity was increased only in gonadectomized females. Diencephalon ACE activity was not changed by gonadectomy in either sex, but the renin activity was decreased in these groups. These results suggested that the decrease of BP by gonadectomy in both sexes SHR was closely related to the decrease of renin activity in diencephalon by androgen deprivation with gonadectomy.", 
    "402": "Heart failure, often associated with ventricular enlargement and recurrent myocardial infarction, is one of the major causes of postinfarction mortality. This observation suggests that measures used to prevent ventricular enlargement may improve postinfarction survival. The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the purpose of evaluating the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on postinfarction death and ventricular dilation. This multicenter trial had a sample size goal of 2,220 patients between 21 and 79 years of age who had recently sustained a myocardial infarction and who have an ejection fraction determined by radionuclide ventriculogram (RVG-EF) of less than or equal to 40%. In addition to conventional therapy, patients were randomly assigned to captopril or placebo therapy commencing within 3-16 days following their myocardial infarction. A second RVG-EF is performed on all surviving participants at the end of the average 3.5-year treatment and follow-up period. The study has 90% power to detect a 25% improvement in postinfarction mortality or prevention of greater than or equal to 9 unit absolute reduction in radionuclide ejection fraction. Additional end points, design features, and the administrative organization of the trial are described.", 
    "403": "Treatment for clinical congestive heart failure is effective, but because severe ventricular dysfunction is often present at the time of clinical presentation, it may only be palliative. Recent clinical studies indicate that treatment of symptomless left ventricular dysfunction from 1 week following myocardial infarction or later may prevent further ventricular dilation and possibly reduce the occurrence of heart failure. Considering the potential for progressive ventricular dilation that exists from the time of myocardial infarction, early intervention following myocardial infarction may provide greater benefit. In a double-blind study, 100 patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomized to treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo, 24-48 hours following onset of symptoms. During 3 months of treatment, the placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices with ejection fraction unchanged. In contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but insignificant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and a significant reduction in end-systolic volume index with ejection fraction increased. Thus, early treatment of patients following Q-wave myocardial infarction with converting enzyme inhibition is effective in preventing ventricular dilation and provides an advantage over later treatment. Selection of patients with Q-wave infarction at 24 hours, after thrombolysis, provides therapy for those most likely to benefit, which is well tolerated without risk of hypotension.", 
    "404": "The pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) involves a sudden thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Spontaneous or pharmacologic thrombolysis may lead to myocardial salvage if patency is achieved within a narrow time window. However, patients in whom thrombolysis occurs late seem to demonstrate improved left ventricular (LV) function and prognosis, which may be independent of myocardial salvage. Preservation of normal LV geometry by reducing expansion of the infarcted segment is a likely mechanism for this benefit. Infarct expansion is most pronounced in patients with anterior wall AMI who have a persistently occluded infarct-related vessel. This process of expansion leads to early increases in LV volume and distortions of LV contour (abnormal LV geometry). Patients whose infarct segment is largest, patients who have manifested infarct expansion, and patients with a persistently occluded infarct-related artery are at highest risk for progressive LV dilation. Experimental data support the concept that reperfusion of occluded vessels that occurs too late for myocardial salvage will preserve LV geometry by limiting infarct expansion. Prospective clinical trials should address whether there is a late, \"second time window\" during which infarct expansion and distortions of LV geometry may be reduced by (1) therapy with thrombolytic agents applied late after infarction, (2) late mechanical reperfusion with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or related methods, and (3) load-reducing agents to decrease remodeling, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or nitroglycerin."
