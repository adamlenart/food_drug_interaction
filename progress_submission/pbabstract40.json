    "0": "A protective role against atherosclerosis can be attributed to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), since they have been shown to reduce mortality in patients at cardiovascular risk. Since plasma levels of adhesion molecules are considered surrogate markers of endothelial cell activation and atherogenesis, we compared the levels of adhesion molecules after treatment with the ACE-I enalapril or the direct angiotensin- receptor antagonist losartan or placebo. In a randomized, controlled trial, 21 hypercholesterolemic volunteers received 50 mg/d losartan or 20 mg/d enalapril or placebo for twelve weeks. Plasma levels of circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1), and E-selectin (cE-SEL) were measured by ELISA. Surface expression of ICAM-1 on circulating leukocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Enalapril and losartan but not placebo induced a small but stable decrease of cICAM-1 and cVCAM-1, while cE-SEL and leukocyte expression of ICAM-1 remained unchanged. The lowering of plasma adhesion molecules may indicate an antiatherogenic effect of angiotensin II blockade in hypercholesterolemia. While such preventive effect will have to be proven in clinical trials, our results do not support a preference for either enalapril or losartan with regard to their possible vasoprotective role.", 
    "1": "Heart failure (HF) is responsible for an immense burden on our healthcare system. The prevalence of this disease continues to increase as a result of an aging population, successful treatment of acute coronary syndrome, and the use of new pharmacotherapies. Although pharmacotherapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers shows improvement in morbidity and mortality, the overall prognosis of these patients remains poor. Cardiac transplant has limited applicability. Conduction disturbances are frequent in patients with advanced heart failure and may cause worsening systolic function and ventricular dyssynchrony. Biventricular pacing to achieve cardiac resynchronization is a recent and promising therapy for HF patients with an intraventricular conduction defect. Randomized clinical trials have substantiated that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) through biventricular pacing offers significant benefit in morbidity and mortality in a select group of HF patients. Because of the high incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with severe HF, the combination biventricular pacing with implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy will provide additional benefit. This article provides an overview of CRT with the intent of describing ventricular dyssynchrony, the benefits of CRT, and the implications for advanced practice nurses.", 
    "2": "Endoglin is a membrane glycoprotein that regulates TGF-beta1 signaling. Previous studies have revealed that endoglin is upregulated in several models of experimental fibrosis, and that endoglin expression can counteract the fibrogenic effects of TGF-beta1. As treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces renal fibrosis by mechanisms that are, in part, not dependent on angiotensin II blockade, we have assessed the hypothesis that this effect could be mediated by endoglin upregulation.", 
    "3": "We have used the 5/6-nephrectomy renal mass reduction (RMR) model of renal fibrosis in rats treated (RMR+T) or not treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril (0.7 mg/kg/day). One, 3 and 5 months after RMR, mean arterial pressure and renal function were measured. In addition, renal fibrosis was evaluated quantitatively and endoglin, TGF-beta1, collagen type I and collagen type IV expression was assessed by Northern blot and immunohistochemistry.", 
    "4": "RMR induced a progressive increase in mean arterial pressure, urinary protein excretion and glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is accompanied by an increased expression of TGF-beta1, endoglin and collagen types I and IV. Trandolapril treatment reduced systemic blood pressure and lessened proteinuria after RMR, as well as expression of TGF-beta1, endoglin and collagens.", 
    "5": "The present study demonstrates an increased TGF-beta1, endoglin, collagen type I and collagen type IV expression in rats with severe hypertension and renal damage. The effect of trandolapril to decrease renal fibrosis seems to be based in a reduced TGF-beta1 expression but not in an increased expression of endoglin.", 
    "6": "To determine the muscular concentration of bradykinin and kallidin during static contraction, microdialysis probes were implanted bilaterally in the trapezius muscles of healthy women. Three hours after probe implantation, 200 microM of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat were added to the perfusion solution in one of the sides for 30 min. Thirty minutes later, the subjects performed a sustained bilateral shoulder abduction at 10% of the maximal voluntary contraction until exhaustion. This protocol was repeated twice, with an interval of at least 17 days. High intersession repeatability was observed in the concentration of bradykinin but not of kallidin. Enalaprilat induced a significant increase in bradykinin levels in the dialysate, without affecting kallidin levels. The sustained contraction induced a significant increase in dialysate levels of both kinin peptides. The contraction also induced a significant increase in pain ratings, as measured by a visual analog scale. During contraction, positive correlations were found between pain ratings and levels of kinin peptides in dialysate, predominantly in the side previously perfused with enalaprilat. Subjects with the higher pain ratings also showed larger increases in kinin peptides in the side previously perfused with enalaprilat. The present results show that both plasma and tissue kinin-kallikrein are activated during muscle contraction, but that their metabolic pathways are differently regulated during rest and contraction, because they showed a different response to ACE inhibition. They also indicate that intramuscular kinin peptides levels, and ACE activity, may contribute to muscle pain.", 
    "7": "Oxidant stress is an important contributor to renal dysfunction and hypertension. We have previously demonstrated that regulation of renal oxygen consumption by nitric oxide (NO) is impaired in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) due to increased superoxide production. We further explored the mechanisms of enhanced oxidant stress in the kidney of SHR. Suppression of cortical oxygen consumption by bradykinin (BK) or enalaprilat (Enal), which act through stimulation of endogenous NO, was impaired in SHR (BK: -14.1 +/- 1.2%; Enal: -15.5 +/- 1.2%) and was restored by addition of apocynin, an inhibitor of assembly of the NAD(P)H oxidase complex (BK: -21.0 +/- 0.6%; Enal: -25.3 +/- 1.4%), suggesting this as the source of enhanced superoxide production. Addition of an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker, losartan, also restored responsiveness to control levels (BK: -22.0 +/- 1.1%; Enal: -23.6 +/- 1.3%), suggesting that ANG II is responsible for enhanced oxidase activity. A similar defect in responsiveness to BK and Enal could be induced in Wistar-Kyoto kidneys by ANG II and was reversed by a superoxide scavenger (tempol), apocynin or losartan. Immunoblotting of cortical samples demonstrated enhanced expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS 1.9x) and NAD(P)H oxidase components (gp91(phox) 1.6x and Rac-1 4.5x). Expression of SOD-1 and -2 were unchanged, but SOD-3 was significantly decreased in SHR (0.5x). Thus NO bioavailability is impaired in SHR owing to an ANG II-mediated increase in superoxide production in association with enhanced expression of NAD(P)H oxidase components, despite increased expression of eNOS. Loss of SOD-3, an important superoxide scavenger, may also contribute to enhanced oxidant stress.", 
    "8": "Several recent studies suggest an important role for the brain renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and binding of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors, which mediate the central effects of ANG II, are increased in heart failure. The present study examined the relationship between brain ACE activity and the autonomic dysregulation characteristic of rats with congestive heart failure. Rats with heart failure (HF) induced by coronary artery ligation and sham-operated control (SHAM) rats were treated with chronic (28 days) third cerebral ventricle [intracerebroventricular (ICV)] or intraperitoneal (IP) infusion of a low dose of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (ENL) or vehicle (VEH). VEH-treated HF rats had increased sodium consumption, reduced urine sodium and urine volume, and increased sympathetic nerve activity with impaired baroreflex regulation. These responses were minimized or prevented by ICV ENL started 24 h after coronary ligation. IP ENL at the low dose used in these studies had no beneficial effects on HF rats. Neither IP nor ICV ENL had any substantial effect on the SHAM rats. The findings confirm a critically important contribution of the brain renin-angiotensin system to the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure.", 
    "9": "In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), an overactive muscle ergoreceptor reflex (chemo-afferents sensitive to the products of muscle work) is thought to play an important role in the origin of dyspnoea.

    "10": "In 19 stable CHF patients and 12 normal controls, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity (peak O2 consumption [peak VO2]) and the ergoreflex contribution to ventilation (post-handgrip regional circulatory occlusion method) were measured. Venous resting and exercise plasma PGE2, PGF1alpha and bradykinin concentrations were assessed. Eleven patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and 10 controls were challenged with ketoprofen infusion (to inhibit PG synthesis and bradykinin activity). Patients vs. controls presented lower exercise tolerance (peak VO2 15.9+/-0.7 vs. 33.0+/-1.3 mL/kg/min), an increased ventilatory response to exercise (VE/VCO2 slope 43+/-2 vs. 27+/-0.9) (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). The overactive ergoreflex of CHF (5.1+/-1.3 vs. 0.1+/-0.3 L/min) was significantly related to the increase in PGF1alpha (adjusted R2=0.34, p<0.005) but not PGE2 (adjusted R2=0.16, p>0.05). The increased PG and bradykinin productions both at rest and during exercise in CHF were attenuated after ketoprofen infusion, associated with ergoreflex reduction (-5.1+/-2.2 L/min, p<0.05 vs. saline).",

Thus, some increment in serum K+, up to and including the development of overt hyperkalemia (typically defined as a serum K+ value in excess of 6.0 mEq/L), is to be expected whenever they are used. Hyperkalemia attributable to ARA relates to several factors including ARA dose, patient predisposition to hyperkalemia, as in the case of renal failure, and dietary intake of K+. The risk of some change in serum K+ with ARA should not be a deterrent to use of drugs in this class but, rather should prompt careful surveillance for the onset of this potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance. The frequency of such scrutiny should be patient-specific and based on the constellation of risk factors for hyperkalemia.", 
    "56": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease is steadily increasing in the United States. The magnitude of this problem is such that virtually all health care providers are being called upon to manage these patients. The interplay between chronic kidney disease and drug therapy is complex in that the kidney is both a target for drug effect as well as a moderator of drug elimination. Renal drug elimination occurs by filtration, secretion, and/or metabolism. For renally-cleared compounds, drug clearance typically falls in tandem with the loss of renal function. This process is noteworthy for drug accumulation when the glomerular filtration rate approaches the 30-cc/min range. The kidney is a target for drug effect in relationship to blood pressure and protein excretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy (usually given along with a diuretic) are the drug classes that have been shown to be effective for reduction in both blood pressure and protein excretion in the chronic kidney disease patient. A number of questions still remain unanswered in the pharmacotherapy of chronic kidney disease, including the optimal dose for these drugs as well as what represents the most favorable achieved blood pressure.", 
    "57": "The prevalence of heart failure is increasing in modern societies. Hypertension is a major contributor to the development of heart failure, whether through the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction or by promoting atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, which eventually leads to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular dysfunction. Effective therapy for hypertension can prevent more than 50% of heart failure events. Most studies done in the last three decades have used b blockers with diuretics as the modality of therapy. These agents have been shown to effectively prevent the development of heart failure. More recent comparative studies have shown that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are also effective in preventing heart failure. Calcium channel blockers, however, seem to be less effective in preventing development of heart failure in patients with hypertension. It needs to be emphasized that the most important variable in preventing heart failure is the appropriate treatment of hypertension.", 
    "58": "The following issues are highlighted: Emphasis is placed on the importance of systolic blood pressure elevations in estimating risk and in determining prognosis. A review of placebo-controlled clinical trials indicates that cardiovascular events are statistically significantly reduced with diuretic- or b blocker-based treatment regimens. The question of whether blood pressure lowering alone or specific medications make the difference in outcome is discussed. Based on the results of numerous trials, it is apparent that blood pressure lowering itself is probably of greater importance in reducing cardiovascular events than the specific medication used. Meta-analyses suggest, however, that the use of an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system is probably more effective in diabetics and in patients with nephropathy than a regimen based on calcium channel blocker therapy. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) reported no overall difference in coronary heart disease outcome among patients treated with a diuretic-based compared to a calcium channel blocker- or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based treatment program. However, patients in the diuretic group experienced fewer episodes of heart failure than in the calcium channel blocker group and fewer episodes of heart failure and strokes than those in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. Results were similar in diabetics and nondiabetics. Possible reasons for this outcome are discussed. The Australian National Blood Pressure 2 study, which was unblinded, reported a marginally significantly better outcome only in male patients receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based regimen compared to those receiving a diuretic-based program. Finally, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is reviewed. Highlights of this report include the new designation of prehypertension, i.e., blood pressures of 120-139 mm Hg/80-89 mm Hg. The JNC 7 suggested that diuretics should be the first-step drug of choice in most patients, but listed numerous specific reasons why other agents should be used in special situations. The report stressed that the majority of patients will require two or more medications to achieve goal blood pressure.", 
    "59": "Most hypertensive patients require more than one drug for adequate blood pressure (BP) control. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends starting treatment with a thiazide diuretic or, when BP is >20/10 mm Hg above goal or in patients with diabetes, using two different antihypertensive agents. Searches of Medline, EMBASE, and BIOSIS databases identified four similarly designed, randomized, factorial studies comparing various doses of angiotensin II receptor blockers with hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy and in combination. The methodology and results of these studies were compared. The primary efficacy end point in these studies was a decrease from baseline in mean diastolic BP after 8 weeks of therapy. All currently available angiotensin I receptor blocker/hydrochlorothiazide combinations evaluated (irbesartan, olmesartan medoxomil, telmisartan, and valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide) produced significant systolic BP and diastolic BP reductions. Olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/25 mg provided the largest mean reduction in absolute and placebo-corrected systolic BP/diastolic BP. For all angiotensin II receptor blocker/hydrochlorothiazide combinations evaluated, > or =63% of patients achieved a diastolic BP response (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg or > or =10-mm Hg reduction). In conclusion, the combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide produces more substantial BP responses than monotherapy with either component.", 
    "60": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved the prognosis of HIV-1-infected patients but is associated with significant side effects such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular complications. Oxidative stress can disrupt endothelial homeostasis by dysregulating the balance between pro- and antiatherogenic factors. We hypothesized that chronic exposure to HAART results in endothelial oxidative stress and activation of mononuclear cell recruitment, an early event in atherosclerosis. We studied the effects of HAART drug combinations, consisting of zidovudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; efavirenz, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; and either of the two protease inhibitors (PIs), indinavir or nelfinavir, on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by monitoring the following parameters: (1) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (2) mono-nuclear cell (Jurkat or U-937) adhesion, and (3) expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). HAART exposure increased ROS formation in HAECs. Exposure to PIs alone and in HAART combinations increased mononuclear cell adhesion to HAECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Mononuclear cell adhesion to HAART-exposed HAECs was significantly enhanced following acute (24-h) exposure to the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL)-1beta and was suppressed by the antioxidants N-ace-tylcysteine and glutathione. Exposure to HAART increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene expression and concomitant exposure to TNF-alpha further increased ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule cell surface protein levels. These studies indicate that chronic HAART exposure increases oxidative stress in endothelial cells and induces mononuclear cell recruitment, which may eventually precipitate the cardiovascular diseases observed in HIV-1+ individuals on antiretroviral therapy.", 
    "61": "The effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin II receptor type I antagonist, were investigated on alterations in myofibrillar ATPase activity as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) content and gene expression in failing hearts following myocardial infarction (MI). Three weeks after ligation of the left coronary artery, rats were treated with or without enalapril (10 mg/kg/day), and/or losartan (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. The infarcted animals exhibited an increase in left ventricle (LV) end diastolic pressure and depressed rates of LV pressure development as well as pressure decay. LV myofibrillar Ca2+ -stimulated ATPase activity was decreased in the infarcted hearts compared with controls, MHC alpha-isoform content was significantly decreased whereas that of MHC beta-isoform was markedly increased. The level of MHC alpha-isoform mRNA was decreased whereas that of MHC beta-isoform was increased in the viable infarcted LV. Treatment of animal with enalapril, losartan, or combination of enalapril and losartan partially prevented the MI induced changes in LV function, myofibrillar Ca2+ -stimulated ATPase activity, MHC protein expression and MHC gene expression. The results suggest that the beneficial effects of the renin-angiotensin system blockade in heart failure are associated with partial prevention of myofibrillar remodeling.", 
    "62": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-hypertensive and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition effects of soyabean protein hydrolysate in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Soyabean protein hydrolysate was prepared by peptic hydrolysis and was added into the feed of SHR (0% for the S0 group, 0.5% for the S1 group, and 1% for the S2 group) for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure of the S1 (164.3 (sem 4.7); 128.0 (sem 5.0) mmHg) and S2 (156.8 (sem 1.6); 120.8 (sem 3.4) mmHg) groups were significantly lower than those of the S0 group (199.4 (sem 5.2); 158.3 (sem 7.0) mmHg) at the end of the study. In the analysis of ACE activity, plasma and heart ACE activities of the S1 and S2 groups were significantly lower than those of the S0 group, and there were no significant differences in aorta, kidney, and lung ACE activities among all SHR. Soyabean protein hydrolysate had no significant effect on plasma lipids, electrolytes, or on left ventricular wall or aorta wall thickness. The results suggest that the long-term administration of soyabean protein hydrolysate might retard the development of hypertension in SHR by its inhibitory effect on ACE in vivo.", 
    "63": "We investigated the blood-pressure-lowering effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and a GABA-enriched fermented milk product (FMG) by low-dose oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive (SHR/Izm) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY/Izm) rats. FMG was a non-fat fermented milk product produced by lactic acid bacteria, and the GABA contained in FMG was made from the protein of the milk during fermentation. A single oral dose of GABA or FMG (5 ml/kg; 0.5 mg GABA/kg) significantly (P<0.05) decreased the blood pressure of SHR/Izm from 4 to 8 h after administration, but did not increase that of WKY/Izm rats. The hypotensive activity of GABA was dose-dependent from 0.05 to 5.00 mg/kg in SHR/Izm. During the chronic administration of experimental diets to SHR/Izm, a significantly slower increase in blood pressure with respect to the control group was observed at 1 or 2 weeks after the start of feeding with the GABA or FMG diet respectively (P<0.05) and this difference was maintained throughout the period of feeding. The time profile of blood-pressure change due to administration of FMG was similar to that of GABA. FMG did not inhibit angiotensin 1-converting enzyme. Furthermore, an FMG peptide-containing fraction from reverse-phase chromatography lacked a hypotensive effect in SHR/Izm rats. The present results suggest that low-dose oral GABA has a hypotensive effect in SHR/Izm and that the hypotensive effect of FMG is due to GABA.", 
    "64": "Hypertension or high blood pressure is a significant health problem worldwide. Bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the cardiovascular system can contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These ACE inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins, especially milk proteins. An ACE inhibitory activity in vitro does not always imply an antihypertensive effect in vivo. Even if it does, it is very difficult to establish a direct relationship between in vitro and in vivo activity. This is mainly due to the bioavailability of the ACE inhibitory peptides after oral administration and the fact that peptides may influence blood pressure by mechanisms other than ACE inhibition. To exert an antihypertensive effect after oral ingestion, ACE inhibitory peptides have to reach the cardiovascular system in an active form. Therefore, they need to remain active during digestion by human proteases and be transported through the intestinal wall into the blood. The bioavailability of some ACE inhibitory peptides has been studied. It is also known that (hydroxy)proline-containing peptides are generally resistant to degradation by digestive enzymes. Peptides can be absorbed intact through the intestine by paracellular and transcellular routes, but the potency of the bioactivity after absorption is inversely correlated to chain length. In addition, some strategies are proposed to increase the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides. Further research into the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods.", 
    "65": "Like Ras, farnesylation of the IP (prostacyclin receptor) is required for its efficient intracellular signalling, and hence the IP represents a potential target for inhibition by FTIs [FTase (farnesyl protein transferase) inhibitors]. Herein, the effect of SCH66336 on the isoprenylation and function of the human and mouse IPs overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and by the IP endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells, was investigated. SCH66336 yielded concentration-dependent decreases in IP-mediated cAMP generation (IC50 0.27-0.62 nM), [Ca2+]i mobilization (IC50 26.6-48.3 nM) and IP internalization, but had no effect on signalling by the non-isoprenylated beta2 adrenergic receptor or b isoform of the TP (prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor). Additionally, SCH66336 impaired IP-mediated crossdesensitization of TPa signalling (IC50 56.1 nM) and reduced farnesylation of the molecular chaperone protein HDJ-2 (IC50 3.1 nM). To establish whether farnesylation of the IP is inhibited and/or whether its 'CaaX motif' might undergo alternative geranylgeranylation in the presence of SCH66336, a series of chimaeric Ha (Harvey)-Ras fusions were generated by replacing its CaaX motif (-CVLS) with that of the IP (-CSLC) or, as controls, of Ki (Kirsten)-Ras 4B (-CVIM) or Rac 1 (-CVLL). Whereas SCH66336 had no effect on Ha-RasCVLL isoprenylation in vitro or in whole cells, it supported alternative geranylgeranylation of Ha-RasCVIM, but completely impaired isoprenylation of both Ha-RasCVLS and Ha-RasCSLC. These data confirm that the -CSLC motif of the IP is a direct target for inhibition by the FTI SCH66336, and in the presence of strong FTase inhibition, the IP does not undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation", 
    "66": "A comparative randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of the activation of proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8)] and the increased production of autoimmune complexes in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included 47 patients with CHD who had a more than 6-month history of Q-forming myocardial infarction. The patients were randomized into 3 groups: 1) 21 patients with NYHA Functional Class (FC) II heart failure (HF); 2) 16 patients with FC III HF; and 3) 10 with FC IV HF. Basic therapy involved angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nitrates, diuretics, beta-adrenoblockers; 27.6% received digoxin, disaggregatory agents. A study protocol involved the estimation of the parameters of EchCG, paired bicycle ergometric tests, 6-min walking test, ECG daily monitoring, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and IgG autoantibodies to cardiolipin. The findings suggest that with the higher expression of autoimmune complexes, the activation of cytokines (primarily TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CHF in patients with postinfarct cardiac dysfunction: the high activation of cytokines and the elevated level of autoimmune complexes are associated with moderate or severe NYHA FC II-IV HF, depressed left ventricular contractility (ejection fraction, 23-38%), low exercise tolerance, and cardiac remodeling.", 
    "67": "Data of numerous clinical trials show that lowering of blood pressure is prerequisite for reducing the rate of renal function loss in chronic renal disease. There is evidence supporting that blood pressure lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect over reduction of blood pressure alone, both in diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases. The main evidence for renoprotective action of RAAS blockade is provided by its consistent antiproteinuric action, which cannot completely be attributed to the reduction in blood pressure. Indeed, proteinuria reduction during therapy is the single most important factor predicting the renal prognosis, independent from the class of drugs used. Yet, still patients progress to end-stage renal disease. In this review, individual differences in therapy response and possibilities to overcome therapy resistance to RAAS blockade are discussed. Experimental data from studies in rats suggest a specific involvement of intrarenal factors, particularly of preexisting renal damage and renal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, in therapy resistance. Identification of such factors in individual renal patients provides mechanisms by which renoprotective strategies fail to overcome therapy resistance. This prompts for a dual approach to improve renoprotection, namely unravelling these specific intrarenal mechanisms on the one hand, and development of better strategies for early detection of renal risk on the other hand.", 
    "68": "Diabetic nephropathy is a disease entity that is becoming more prevalent in the developed world. Its effect on individuals and society is profound, both in terms of cost and on patient health, especially in relation to associated cardiovascular disease. This review is an analysis of the most recent data available on diabetic nephropathy and its clinical applications to patient care. Using Medline search for relevant data from 1983 to the present, it focuses on clinical strategies that are employed to help curtail the progressive nature of this disease. Current strategies, including glycemic control, blood pressure treatment, inhibition of the renin/angiotensin system, nutrition, and hyperlipidemia, are discussed in relation to the relevant clinical data. Current clinical markers and possible future treatments are also discussed in the context of aiming to improve clinical outcomes in patients who are affected.",

    "70": "A 20-year-old female was admitted to our clinic for edema and severe proteinuria present with minimal change disease since the age of 7 years. Polycythemia was found during the last activation of nephrotic syndrome. The patient was placed on glucocorticoid therapy that caused disappearance of edema, proteinuria and polycythemia. Ten months later both hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were within normal range.", 
    "71": "This patient with nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease and polycythemia was successfully treated with glucocorticoid.", 
    "72": "ANG converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2) is a homologue of ACE, which is not blocked by conventional ACE inhibitors. ACE2 converts ANG 1-10 (ANG I) to ANG 1-9, which can be hydrolyzed by ACE to form the biologically active peptide ANG 1-7. ACE2 is expressed in the kidney, but its precise intrarenal localization is unclear, and the role of intrarenal ACE2 in the production of ANG 1-7 is unknown. The present studies determined the relative distribution of ACE2 in the rat kidney and defined its role in the generation of ANG 1-7 in proximal tubule. In microdissected rat nephron segments, semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that ACE2 mRNA was widely expressed, with relatively high levels in proximal straight tubule (PST). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 protein in tubular segments, glomeruli, and endothelial cells. Utilizing mass spectrometry, incubation of isolated PSTs with ANG I (10(-6) M) led to generation of ANG 1-7 (sensitivity of detection > 1 x 10(-9) M), accompanied by the formation of ANG 1-8 (ANG II) and ANG 1-9. The ACE2 inhibitor DX600 completely blocked ANG I-mediated generation of ANG 1-7. Incubation of PSTs with ANG 1-9 also led to generation of ANG 1-7, an effect blocked by the ACE inhibitor captopril or enalaprilat, but not by DX600. Incubation of PSTs with ANG II or luminal perfusion of ANG II did not result in detection of ANG 1-7. The results indicate that ACE2 is widely expressed in rat nephron segments and contributes to the production of ANG 1-7 from ANG I in PST. ANG II may not be a major substrate for ACE2 in isolated PST. The data suggest that ACE2-mediated production of ANG 1-7 represents an important component of the proximal tubular renin-ANG system.", 
    "73": "Few data exist about the incidence of drug induced acute pancreatitis in the general population. Drugs are related to the aetiology of pancreatitis in about 1.4%-2% of cases. Although angiotensin converting enzymes are generally well tolerated, acute pancreatitis has been reported in a few subjects treated with captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril. A 85 year old man with a long standing history of hypertension, who was treated with ramipril 5 mg once daily, presented with acute pancreatitis. Other causes of the disease were ruled out. After cessation of ramipril his condition improved and amylase level decreased. This was his third episode of acute pancreatitis since ramipril was started in 2000. To the authors' knowledge ramipril induced pancreatitis has not previously been reported.", 
    "74": "Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the leading cause of late allograft failure, with only limited treatment options. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) decreases progression in diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease, but the effect on CAN is as yet unclear. Therefore, we have studied retrospectively the effect of RAS blockade on renal survival in patients with biopsy-proven CAN.", 
    "75": "The medical records of 72 patients with biopsy-proven CAN were evaluated with regard to time course of graft function, proteinuria, blood pressure, and antihypertensive and immunosuppressive treatment. Cox's proportional hazards model was used for analysing renal graft survival after the index biopsy.", 
    "76": "On univariate analysis, histological determinants influencing renal survival were the chronic interstitial and chronic tubular score, and clinical parameters were the serum creatinine level at the time of the biopsy, the relative change in serum creatinine level between 12 months post-transplantation and at the time of the biopsy, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the biopsy, and RAS blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. On multivariate analysis, graft outcome was influenced by the relative change in serum creatinine level between 12 months post-transplantation and the time of the index biopsy, the urinary protein excretion, the mean diastolic blood pressure after the index biopsy, and RAS blockade. Renal graft survival after treatment with RAS blockade was 6.3 (0.9-10.9) years as opposed to 1.8 (0.1-6.7) years in untreated patients (P = 0.003).", 
    "77": "RAS blockade increases graft survival in CAN. In view of the limited treatment options for CAN, this finding is of importance and needs confirmation by a prospective randomized trial.", 
    "78": "In experimental and human renal diseases, progression is limited by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether renoprotection was due to their capacity of reducing proinflammatory and profibrotic effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) or limiting proteinuria and its long term toxicity is debated. For dissecting the relative contribution of Ang II and proteinuria to chronic renal damage, the protein-overload proteinuria model was used in genetically modified mice lacking the major isoform of murine AT1 receptor (AT1A). Uninephrectomized AT1A+/+ and -/- mice received a daily injection of BSA or saline for 4 or 11 wk. AT1A-/-BSA mice acquired a renal phenotype of proteinuria and renal glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions, albeit attenuated with respect to AT1A+/+BSA. Administration of the calcium channel blocker lacidipine to reduce BP of AT1A+/+BSA mice to levels of AT1A-/-BSA translated into comparable values of protein excretion rate and glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury in both strains. These results confirm that the toxic effect of protein trafficking on renal disease progression is not necessarily dependent on Ang II to the extent that targeted deletion of AT1A does not prevent disease progression. A role of Ang II via AT1B or AT2 receptors is still a possibility that cannot be ruled out by the present experimental approach. These findings provide a clear rationale for specifically targeting proteinuria in pharmacologic interventions of chronic nephropathies.", 
    "79": "Animal studies suggest that endothelin A (ETA) receptor antagonism and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may be synergistic. This interaction and the role of ETB receptors and endothelial mediators were investigated in terms of systemic and renal effects in humans in two studies. In one study, six subjects received placebo, the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 alone, and BQ-123 in combination with the ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788 after pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril (E) or placebo. In the other, six subjects who were pretreated with E received placebo, BQ-123, and BQ-123 with concomitant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase or cyclo-oxygenase (COX). Both were randomized, double-blind, crossover studies. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by BQ-123, an effect that was doubled during ACE inhibition (mean area under curve +/- SEM; BQ-123, -2.3 +/- 1.8%; BQ-123+E, -5.1 +/- 1.1%; P < 0.05 versus placebo). BQ-123 increased effective renal blood flow (BQ-123, -0.1 +/- 2.4%; BQ-123+E, 10.9 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.01 versus BQ-123), reduced effective renal vascular resistance (BQ-123, -1.2 +/- 3.1%; BQ-123+E, -12.8 +/- 3.0%; P < 0.01 versus placebo and versus BQ-123), and increased urinary sodium excretion markedly (BQ-123, 2.6 +/- 12.8%; BQ-123+E, 25.2 +/- 12.6%; P < 0.05 versus BQ-123, P < 0.01 versus placebo and versus E) only during ACE inhibition. These effects were abolished by both ETB receptor blockade and NO synthase inhibition, whereas COX inhibition had no effect. In conclusion, the combination of ETA receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition is synergistic via an ETB receptor-mediated, NO-dependent, COX-independent mechanism. The reduction of BP and renal vascular resistance and associated substantial natriuresis make this a potentially attractive therapeutic combination in renal disease.",

    "81": "Seventy-six medically treated patients with acute type B aortic dissection were examined between 1990 and 2001. The events associated with aortic dissection included dissection-related death, rupture, visceral ischemia, lower limb ischemia, an increase in the maximum aortic diameter greater than 50 mm, and a mean enlargement rate of greater than 5 mm per year.", 
    "82": "Among the 76 patients 10 (13%) underwent chronic phase surgery and 25 (33%) presented with an event. A statistically significant difference was observed between patients with and without events with regard to atherosclerotic factors, blood flow status in the false lumen, maximum aortic diameter upon admission, mean aortic enlargement rate, and blood pressure control during follow-up. Of these factors a patent false-lumen and a maximum aortic diameter greater than 40 mm upon admission were the most strongly associated factors with regard to the development of events. Patients with a patent false-lumen and a maximum aortic diameter greater than 40 mm upon admission were determined to exhibit significantly higher event rates than other patients.",

    "84": "Mutations in a renal-specific Cl(-) channel, ClC-5, result in low-molecular-weight proteinuria. Herein we studied ClC-5 expression in the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to identify possible causes of their increased urinary excretion of albumin. The amount of ClC-5 protein was significantly reduced in 3-month-old SHR as compared with normotensive Wistar/Kyoto (WKY) rats. The ClC-5 protein level was partially restored by short term administration of perindopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Corresponding to the increase in ClC-5 expression, the albuminuria in SHR improved to the control level. These results implicate the ClC-5 Cl(-) channel reduction in the development of albuminuria in the early stage of essential hypertension.", 
    "85": "Chymase activates not only angiotensin I to angiotensin II but also latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein to transforming growth factor-beta. In dog grafted veins, chymase activity and angiotensin II concentration along with vascular proliferation were significantly increased, while they were significantly suppressed by a chymase inhibitor. After balloon injury in dog arteries, chymase activity was significantly increased in the injured artery, and a chymase inhibitor and an angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist were effective in preventing the vascular proliferation, but an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was ineffective. In fibrotic models, the tissue fibrosis was reduced by chymase inhibitors. In adhesion models, the transforming growth factor-beta concentration and adhesion formation were suppressed by chymase inhibitors. Therefore, chymase inhibitors may be useful for preventing cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis via inhibition of angiotensin II formation and transforming growth factor-beta activation.", 
    "86": "The role of endogenous kinins and their receptors in diabetes mellitus is being confirmed with the recent developments of molecular and genetic animal models. Compelling evidence suggests that the kinin B(2) receptor is organ-protective and partakes to the therapeutic effects of angiotensin 1-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists. Benefits derive primarily from vasodilatory, antihypertensive, antiproliferative, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, antithrombotic and antioxidant properties of kinin B(2) receptor activation. Mechanisms include the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and the inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity involving classical and novel signalling pathways. Kinin B(2) receptor also ameliorates insulin resistance by increasing glucose uptake and supply, and by inducing glucose transporter-4 translocation either directly or through phosphorylation of insulin receptor. The kinin B(1) receptor, which is induced by the cytokine network, growth factors and hyperglycaemia, mediates hyperalgesia, vascular hyperpermeability and leukocytes infiltration in diabetic animals. However, emerging data highlight reno- and cardio-protective effects mediated by kinin B(1) receptor under chronic ACEI therapy in diabetes mellitus. Thus, the Janus-faced of kinin receptors needs to be taken into account in future drug development. For instance, locally acting kinin B(1)/B(2) receptor agonists if used in a safe therapeutic window may represent a more rationale strategy in the prevention and management of diabetic complications. Because kinin B(2) receptor antagonists may further increase insulin resistance, the persisting dogma that restricts the development of kinin receptor analogues to antagonists (that is still relevant to abrogate pain and inflammation) needs to be revisited.", 
    "87": "This paper reports the rationale for the cardiovascular protective effects of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and reviews the overall results of recent randomized clinical trials. ACEI improve the vasoconstrictive/vasodilatory balance by blocking the formation of angiotensin II and preventing the degradation of bradykinin. In vitro, animal and human experimental studies have shown that ACEI have several properties: They promote vasodilation, limit neurohormonal activation and vasoconstriction during ischemia, improve endothelial function by reducing oxidative stress, slow down the development of atherosclerosis; improve fibrinolytic balance, inhibit platelet activation and reverse negative vascular remodelling. Previous trials have shown that ACEI reduced cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or ventricular dysfunction. These findings have recently been extended to trials using lipophilic ACEI with high affinity for tissue ACE i.e. those most likely to have high antiatherosclerotic efficacy. In PROGRESS (n = 6105), a perindopril-based regimen reduced recurrent stroke by 28% and substantially reduced cardiac outcomes among individuals with cerebrovascular disease. In HOPE (n = 9297), ramipril reduced the composite outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident) by 22% in patients with high cardiovascular risk. EUROPA (n = 12 218) showed that perindopril reduced cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest by 20% in coronary artery disease patients whatever their level of risk. The central role of long-acting lipophilic ACEI for cardiovascular protection has been clearly established and they should now be considered as a routine treatment for secondary prevention as aspirin, beta blockers and statins.",

Patients (median age 24 years) had an estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with at least 5 years of follow up (median 143 months). 48 patients received ACEI. We explored potential prognostic factors that affect the time to ESRF using Cox-regression analyses.", 
    "90": "At start, mean (SE) creatinine was 189 (8) mumol/l, mean eGFR 41 (1) ml/min 1.73 m2, mean proteinuria 144 (14) mg/mmol creatinine (1.7 g/24 hrs). Of 78 patients, 36 (46%) developed ESRF, but none of 19 with proteinuria less than 50 mg/mmol and only two of 18 patients with eGFR above 50 ml/min did so.

Angiotensin receptor blockers seem to get higher efficacy for antagonism angiotensin effects. Safety of angiotensin receptor blockers in anemic hypertensive patients should be studied.", 
    "96": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can be prevented by adequate treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers seem particularly effective. ICH also is associated with apolipoprotein E 4 genotype and with low cholesterol, but not statin therapy for high cholesterol. Microbleeds identified on magnetic resonance imaging scans also confer increased risk of ICH. Experimental drug regimens that target metalloproteinases and inflammation reduce damage in animal models of ICH, but none are proven effective in humans. Cerebral edema after ICH has varied mechanisms and significance, and may be another target for therapy. Cerebral blood flow is not substantially reduced in most patients with ICH. Lowering systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg in the first hours after ICH may prevent additional bleeding. Activated factor 7 is a promising new therapy to limit hematoma enlargement and consequently reduce morbidity and mortality after ICH. Dosages of 80 to 160 \u03bcg/kg given within the first 3 to 4 hours after symptom onset, or in patients at risk of additional bleeding such as those with coagulopathy, is logical but is unapproved. The role of activated factor 7 hopefully will be clarified by additional study. Open surgical evacuation of most spontaneous supratentorial hematomas has been shown to be ineffective in reducing mortality or disability except in certain circumstances, such as large or enlarging superficially located clots in patients who are awake. Stereotactic and endoscopic clot aspiration, often using instillation of lytic agents to liquefy the hematoma, is the most active area of surgical intervention research. Such minimally invasive approaches have been shown to safely produce more rapid removal of blood compared with standard treatment. This is particularly true for intraventricular hemorrhages. Future research will focus on the use of stem cells to restore the damaged architecture around the hematoma. The impressive scope and progress of ongoing clinical and basic research show that there is no longer a place for nihilism in the approach to ICH.",

The offspring typically do not become hypertensive until 6 to 8 wk of age, and recent evidence suggests that renal dysfunction may participate in the pathogenesis. The present study was based on the hypothesis that the window for programming extends to the postnatal period in the rat. Adult hypertension was induced by maternal low-protein diet during the second half of gestation. After being weaned at 3 wk, the offspring were exposed to one of the following regimens for the subsequent 3 wk: 1) low-Na diet, 2) standard Na diet, 3) high-Na diet, and 4) standard Na diet with enalapril. The pups were followed for 10 wk after discontinuation of the treatments. The brief exposure to low-Na diet or enalapril totally prevented the development of hypertension and the effect lasted throughout the observation period. The development of hyperreninemia, present in the standard Na group at 16 wk of age, was abolished in the low-Na and enalapril groups. Conversely, 3-wk exposure to high-Na diet increased the severity of the later hypertension and did not prevent the hyperreninemia. The findings suggest that there is a period of susceptibility during which prenatally programmed hypertension can be modulated postnatally, possibly coinciding with a critical stage in renal maturation.",

Albuminuria is a marker for development of nephropathy in type II diabetes and for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of antihypertensive agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system to reduce the risk and slow down the progression of renal disease. A new clinical trial, GUARD (Gauging Albuminuria Reduction With Lotrel in Diabetic Patients With Hypertension), is designed to compare the change in urinary albumin to creatinine ratio after 1 year of initial treatment with either amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl or benazepril HCl/hydrochlorothiazide.

    "126": "When kidney disease of any aetiology results in substantial loss of nephrons, a common clinical syndrome, characterised by hypertension, proteinuria and a progressive decline in renal function, ensues. This observation suggests that common mechanisms may contribute to progressive renal injury and that therapeutic interventions that inhibit these common pathways may afford renal protection. Research to date has identified several mechanisms that may contribute to progressive renal injury including glomerular haemodynamic changes, multiple effects of angiotensin II and detrimental effects of excessive filtration of plasma proteins by injured glomeruli. Clinical trials over the past decade have identified several interventions that are effective in slowing the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists or a combination of the two should be regarded as fundamental to any therapy for slowing the rate of CKD progression. Hypertension should be treated aggressively to achieve a blood pressure target of < 130/80 mm Hg. Reduction of proteinuria to < 0.5 g/day should be regarded as an independent therapeutic goal. Although inconclusive, there is some evidence to support moderate dietary protein restriction to 0.6 g/kg/day in appropriate patients. Hyperlipidaemia may contribute to CKD progression and should be treated to reduce cardiovascular risk and potentially improve renal protection. Smoking cessation should be encouraged and, where necessary, assisted. Among diabetic patients tight glycaemic control should be achieved (glycosylated haemoglobin < 7%). These interventions are simple and relatively inexpensive. If applied to all patients with CKD they will result in substantial slowing of renal function decline in many patients and thereby reduce the number who progress to end-stage renal disease and require renal replacement therapy.",

In this work, we studied two different preparations of peptide Asp-Lys-Ile-His-Pro (DKIHP), which were obtained by two different synthetic procedures (Boc and Fmoc). The peptide synthesized by the Boc method yielded a unique conformer, containing trans-Pro, and significant ACE-inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 113.18 microM). The chromatographic and NMR data of this active conformer are reported. The peptide synthesized by Fmoc chemistry yielded three conformers, two of them containing trans-Pro and a third one containing cis-Pro, and showed a lower activity (IC(50) = 577.92 microM). This was attributed to the presence of conformers with less (or none) activity. We have pointed out the importance of performing structural studies on these type of peptides before testing their ACE-inhibitory activity.",

The combined antioxidant and ACE inhibition properties make it a very useful multifunctional preparation for the control of cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension. No correlation was found between antioxidant and ACE inhibitory activities. However, the peptide Tyr-Ala-Glu-Glu-Arg-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Leu, which was a strong ACE inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.7 microM) also exhibited a high radical scavenging activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity-fluorescein value, 3.8 micromol of Trolox equivalent per micromol of peptide) and delayed the low-density lipoprotein lipid oxidation induced by Cu2+ at a concentration of approximately 0.16 mg/mg of low-density lipoprotein.

UK-357,903 alone caused a fall in mean blood pressure (-12.1 mm Hg) associated with vasodilatation in the mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. The only way in which the effects of enalapril given alone differed significantly from those of the vehicle was in causing mesenteric vasodilatation, which developed over the 4 days of infusion. UK-357,903 given in combination with enalapril caused hypotension (-17.8 mm Hg) and vasodilatation in the renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter vascular beds. There was evidence of a significant interaction between the effects of the two compounds on renal Doppler shift and vascular conductance with the combined action of the two compounds being greater than the sum of their individual effects. However, although there was a trend for the combination to have greater effects than either of the individual agents on blood pressure and mesenteric vascular conductance, there was no statistical evidence of an interaction. The results indicate that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system uncovers additional renal vasodilator effects of UK-357,903, and/or inhibition of PDE5 enhances the renal vasodilator effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.",

Congestive heart failure (CHF), an increasingly frequent cardiovascular disorder affecting millions of people world-wide, has become the most important risk factor of AF in developed countries, as a result of ageing populations. Approximately two thirds of patients with CHF are >65 years of age and likely to have AF as a coexistent complication. Epidemiological surveys and large clinical trials in CHF provide strong evidence that AF is a marker of increased mortality. AF may compromise LV systolic function and worsen CHF through poor rate control, irregularity of ventricular response, and loss of atrial systolic activity. Furthermore, enhanced adrenergic stimulation in the setting of CHF facilitates AV conduction and promotes the progression of cardiomyopathy, and AF may worsen CHF as a consequence of the negative inotropic effects of drugs used to control the heart rate of rhythm, or of the proarrhythmic effects of drugs used to maintain sinus rhythm. This article reviews the putative mechanisms behind atrial remodelling due to long-standing AF, and the role of neuro-hormonal alterations in the atrial electrophysiologic and structural changes which facilitate its perpetuation. It also reviews and discusses various controlled trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT-1 receptor blockade in the perspective of AF treatment and prevention. Finally the role of specific antiarrhythmic drugs, the respective advantages and shortcomings of rate versus rhythm control in patients with AF and CHF, and the important issue of chronic anticoagulation are presented in the light of time-tested therapies, as well as new promising therapeutic approaches.",

    "151": "All patients received open-label perindopril 4 mg once a day for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks the dosage was either maintained (group I) or increased to 8 mg/day (group II) based on the physician's assessment of blood pressure (BP) response. Patients were then followed for another 6 weeks for a total study duration of 12 weeks.", 
    "152": "Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics revealed a higher proportion of women, longer duration of hypertension and higher baseline systolic BP (SBP) among elderly than young (<65 years, n = 7332) hypertensive patients. A clinically relevant BP reduction of similar magnitude was obtained in elderly and young patients with perindopril monotherapy. At week 12, the mean reduction in BP from baseline was 18.4/8.7 mm Hg in the elderly and 17.5/11.3 mm Hg in the young. Elderly patients with hypertension not responding adequately to the 4 mg/day dosage at week 6 had a BP reduction of 6.3/3.6 mm Hg (group II). Up-titration to an 8 mg/day dosage for another 6 weeks gave an additional 8.9/3.5 mm Hg reduction resulting in a total reduction of 15.2/7.1 mm Hg from baseline. A similar magnitude of increase in response to up-titration of perindopril was seen in young patients. BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) on perindopril monotherapy was achieved in 41.4% of elderly and 51.9% of young patients. In both age groups, up-titration to an 8.0 mg/day dosage in group II patients increased BP control by approximately 5-fold at week 12 (28.2% in the elderly and 36.4% in the young). A similar increased response on BP reduction and BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) with up-titration was seen in elderly subgroups of African American and diabetic patients. The 7th Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended target goal of <130/80 mm Hg was achieved with perindopril monotherapy in 15.6% of hypertensive diabetic patients. Perindopril reduced BP effectively and safely in very elderly (> or =75 years) hypertensive patients. Perindopril was well tolerated in elderly patients including high-risk groups. The incidence of cough (7-10%), the most common symptom, was similar in all age groups. The low incidence of postural hypotension (< or =0.2%) observed in the elderly and very elderly further supports the good tolerance and safety profile of the drug. Data analysis from this study suggests that community physicians, in general, are less aggressive in controlling BP in the elderly and more inclined to treat or control diastolic BP than SBP.",

Recent clinical trials have shown ACE inhibitors can affect the development of nephropathy when initiated prior to the onset of microalbuminuria. Our objective is to examine the cost effectiveness of treating adults aged over 20 years with an ACE inhibitor (captopril) immediately following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes versus treating them after the onset of microalbuminuria.", 
    "155": "Using a semi-Markov model, we calculated four main outcome measures: lifetime direct medical costs (discounted), QALYs, cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and number of days of ESRD over a lifetime. Medical costs are in 1999 US dollars.",

This level varies considerably with age and glycaemic level. When the age at onset of diabetes is 20 years and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) level is 9%, the cost-effectiveness ratio is USD 13,814 per QALY. When the age at onset is 25 years and HbA(1c) level is 7%, the cost-effectiveness ratio is USD 39,530 per QALY.", 
    "159": "This model, with its underlying assumptions and data, suggests that early treatment with captopril provides modest benefit at reasonable cost effectiveness, from the US single-payer perspective, in the prevention of ESRD compared with delaying treatment until diagnosis of microalbuminuria. Early treatment with other ACE inhibitors will provide similar cost effectiveness if they have equivalent efficacy, compliance and price per dose. Treatment may be considered among patients at age 20 years with new onset of type 1 diabetes. This conclusion is sensitive to the extent that ACE inhibitors delay onset of microalbuminuria. Other factors such as the patient's age and glycaemic level must be considered when deciding to initiate early treatment.", 
    "160": "In the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial, ramipril (compared with placebo) significantly reduced cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality as well as the incidence of costly cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, revascularisation, stroke, cardiac arrest, hospitalisation due to heart failure and worsening angina pectoris, new-onset diabetes mellitus and microvascular diabetic complications.", 
    "161": "Data from the HOPE study were used in a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the additional cost per life-year gained (LYG) when the ACE inhibitor ramipril was added to the current medication of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The aim was to establish the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ramipril versus placebo from the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) provider in Germany, for both the study population as a whole and for the subgroup of patients with diabetes.", 
    "162": "A modelling approach was used, based on secondary analysis of published data and retrospective application of costs. In the base-case analysis, average case-related expenses of the SHI were applied and LYG were quantified using the average of the difference between the survival rates in the ramipril and placebo groups during the HOPE trial. LYG beyond the trial duration were estimated by the method of declining exponential approximation of life expectancy.", 
    "163": "After a treatment period of 4.5 years, the ICER of ramipril versus placebo was Euros 4074/LYG and Euros 2486/LYG (discounted at 5% per annum and in 1998-2002 values; Euro 1 approximately USD 0.88; first quarter 2002 values) for the HOPE study population as a whole and the subgroup of patients with diabetes, respectively. To test the model's robustness, the influence of the model variables on the results was quantified using a deterministic model, and a best-case/worst-case scenario analysis. The effect of random variables was investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation. The acquisition cost for ramipril had the greatest impact on the ICER of ramipril (2.2-fold greater than the impact of the number of LYG). In 95% of the 10,000 simulation steps, the ICER of ramipril after 4.5 years of treatment was between Euros 1290 and Euros 9005 per LYG for the entire HOPE study population and between Euros 290 and Euros 6115 per LYG in the diabetic subgroup.", 
    "164": "Results of this evaluation suggest that ramipril is likely to be cost effective in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events from the perspective of the SHI (third-party payer) in Germany. The estimated ICER of ramipril compares well with other ICERs of widely accepted treatments used for the management of cardiovascular diseases, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "165": "Clinical practice has been recently applied new approaches to classifying patients with arterial hypertension (AH), which are based on the determination of the summary risk suggesting the prognosis of the disease. This approach is quite efficient due to the fact that it takes into account a combination of the comparable clinical symptoms of AH, which characterize its course. The paper presents data on the values of blood pressure (BP) in AH and on daily BP profiles (DBPP) in 494 patients with different categories of a risk and on their endothelial function. It also gives the results of achievement of target BP levels in patients with AH having different categories of a risk during long-term (36-month) treatment with enapril and perindopril, as well as data on its impact on endothelial vasomotor function. The findings suggest that the higher the risk is, the more severe the hypertensive syndrome is; that the redistribution of DBPP occurs towards prognostically poor types and endothelial dysfunction (EDF) progresses. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results not only to the achievement of target BP levels and to the normalization of DBPP, but also to the amelioration of EDF. Moreover, the co-administration of ACE inhibitors and isosorbide-5-mononitrates causes additional antiischemic effects.",

Candesartan was beneficial in heart failure patients with or without left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "167": "Recently, it has been reported that angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have anticancer activity. In particular, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, significantly inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells along with suppression of the VEGF level. However, the mechanisms of suppression of the VEGF level are still unclear, and there are no previous reports on this subject related to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In some previous studies, angiotensin II, which is produced from angiotensin I by ACE, directly stimulates VEGF expression.",

However, the perindoprilat-treated group showed a significant reduction in mRNA expression of VEGF and inhibited the induction activity of the VEGF promoter in comparison to the control group. Perindoprilat treatment also significantly suppressed angiotensin II production in vitro. In the in vivo studies, perindopril had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth, and reduced blood vessel formation surrounding the tumors.", 
    "170": "Our findings suggest that perindopril has no direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells, but has a potential to inhibit tumor growth due to suppression of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Angiotensin II might have an important role in carcinogenesis, and the antiangiogenic activity of perindopril is at least partly mediated by angiotensin II inhibition.

Clinical input parameters were derived from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study. Cost data were extracted from the literature. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of varying the input parameters on the cost effectiveness of the intervention. In addition, first order Monte Carlo simulation was used to capture patient-to-patient variability, presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.",

    "179": "In order to understand the mechanisms of exercise intolerance and muscle fatigue, which are commonly observed in congestive heart failure, we studied sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-transport in the hind-leg skeletal muscle of rats subjected to myocardial infarction (MI). Sham-operated animals were used for comparison. On one hand, the maximal velocities (Vmax) for both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activities in skeletal muscle of rats at 8 weeks of MI were higher than those of controls. On the other hand, the Vmax values for both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activities were decreased significantly at 16 weeks of MI when compared with controls. These alterations in Ca(2+)-transport activities were not associated with any change in the affinity (1/Ka) of the SR Ca(2+)-pump for Ca2+. Furthermore, the stimulation of SR Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activity by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was not altered at 8 or 16 weeks of MI when compared with the respective control values. Treatment of 3-week infarcted animals with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, imidapril, and enalapril or an angiotensin receptor (AT1R) antagonist, losartan, for a period of 13 weeks not only attenuated changes in left ventricular function but also prevented defects in SR Ca(2+)-pump in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that the skeletal muscle SR Ca(2+)-transport is altered in a biphasic manner in heart failure due to MI. It is suggested that the initial increase in SR Ca(2+)-pump activity in skeletal muscle may be compensatory whereas the depression at late stages of MI may play a role in exercise intolerance and muscle fatigue in congestive heart failure. Furthermore, the improvements in the skeletal muscle SR Ca(2+)-transport by ACE inhibitors may be due to the decreased activity of renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure.",

    "184": "Quadratic indices of the 'molecular pseudograph's atom adjacency matrix' have been generalized to codify chemical structure information for chiral drugs. These 3D-chiral quadratic indices make use of a trigonometric 3D-chirality correction factor. These indices are nonsymmetric and reduced to classical (2D) descriptors when symmetry is not codified. By this reason, it is expected that they will be useful to predict symmetry-dependent properties. 3D-Chirality quadratic indices are real numbers and thus, can be easily calculated in TOMOCOMD-CARDD software. These descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional 2D quadratic indices (Molecules 2003, 8, 687-726. http://www.mdpi.org) and other (chirality insensitive) topological indices to distinguish sigma-stereoisomers. In this paper, we extend our earlier work by applying 3D-chirality quadratic indices to two data sets containing chiral compounds. Consequently, in order to test the potential of this novel approach in drug design we have modelled the angiotesin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of perindoprilate's sigma-stereoisomers combinatorial library. Two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models were obtained. The first one model was performed considering all data set as training series and classifies correctly 88.89% of active compounds and 100.00% of nonactive one for a global good classification of 96.87%. The second one LDA-QSAR model classified correctly 83.33% of the active and 100.00% of the inactive compounds in a training set, result that represent a total of 95.65% accuracy in classification. On the other hand, the model classifies 100.00% of these compounds in the test set. Similar predictive behaviour was observed in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure for both equations. Canonical regression analysis corroborated the statistical quality of these models (R(can) of 0.82 and of 0.76, respectively) and was also used to compute biology activity canonical scores for each compound. Finally, prediction of the biological activities of chiral 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines, which are sigma-receptor antagonists, by linear multiple regression analysis was carried out. Two statistically significant QSAR models were obtained (R2=0.940, s=0.270 and R2=0.977, s=0.175). These models showed high stability to data variation in the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (q2=0.912, scv=0.289 and q2=0.957, scv=0.211). The results of this study compare favourably with those obtained with other chirality descriptors applied to the same data set. The 3D-chiral TOMOCOMD-CARDD approach provides a powerful alternative to 3D-QSAR.",

In the retina, a complete RAS exists, with components residing in the vasculature, neurons and glia. There is increasing interest in a pathogenetic role for angiotensin II in ischaemic retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. In these situations, the retinal RAS becomes activated and stimulates growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which contribute to vascular leakage, pericyte migration, angiogenesis and fibrosis. Blockade of the RAS, with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or antagonists selective for angiotensin type 1 (AT1) and angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptors, attenuates many of the vascular abnormalities that develop in diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Eagerly awaited are the findings of the Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trial (DIRECT), evaluating the effects of AT1 receptor antagonism in patients with different stages of diabetic retinopathy.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by means of the four-component Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, and the patients were grouped according to their estimated GFR.

In the present study, we evaluated variations in total lymphocyte count (TLC) and subset lymphocyte counts (SLCs) with respect to the age of PD patients. We carried out the study in two groups of PD patients. Group I patients (n = 12) were less than 40 years of age (35.5 +/- 5.4 years), and their PD duration was 18.2 +/- 9.4 months. Group II patients (n = 14) were more than 60 years of age (67.2 +/- 5.1 years), and their PD duration was 20.6 +/- 11.0 months. In group I, 9 patients were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); in group II, 10 patients were taking ACEIs. We used flow cytometry to estimate SLCs (determining CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16+56 antigens). In both groups, the mean CD19, CD4, and CD8 counts were lower than the normal ranges. In group II, TLC and CD3 count were also lower than normal. In group I, correlations were seen between age and TLC, CD3, CD19, CD4, and CD8. Correlations were also seen between dialysis duration and TLC, CD3, CD19, and CD4, and between total ACEI dose and CD19 count. In group II, correlations were seen between age and TLC, CD3, and CD8. No correlation was observed between PD duration and TLC or SLCs, but a correlation between total ACEI dose and CD8 count was seen. In patients who were taking enalapril as their only ACEI, a correlation was observed between total enalapril dose and TLC, CD3, and CD8. Our results confirm data that indicate worse immunity and nutrition status in older PD patients and demonstrate decreasing values of TLC and SLCs with aging in younger and older PD patients alike. Administration of ACEIs negatively influences SLCs independently of age, but decreases in TLC and SLCs are significantly related to PD duration only in younger patients.",

However, erythropoietin resistance is sometimes encountered from causes such as functional iron deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, blood loss, or interaction with other drugs. To clarify the interaction between erythropoietin and the renin-angiotensin system, we studied the maintenance dose of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs), angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers. We divided 36 hypertensive patients on CAPD into three groups--an ACEI group (n = 12), an ARB group (n = 12), and a Ca channel blocker group (n = 12)--and then we compared the doses of rHuEPO required to maintain the patients' hematocrit (Hct) above 30%. In the Ca channel blocker group, the weekly dose of erythropoietin had not changed significantly at the end of the study (74 +/- 7 U/kg at the end vs. 76 +/- 8 U/kg at the start). The (oral) ACEI group needed a significantly higher weekly dose of erythropoietin at the end of the study (89 -/+ 9 U/kg at the end vs. 74 -/+ 8 U/kg at the start, p < 0.01). The (oral) ARB group also needed a significantly higher weekly dose of erythropoietin at the end of the study (82 -/+ 10 U/kg at the end vs. 76 +/- 8 U/kg at the start, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the weekly dose of erythropoietin required in the ACEI group was significantly larger than that required in the ARB group. We conclude that treatment with ACEIs and ARBs induces erythropoietin resistance in patients on CAPD. The inhibitory effect of ARBs on erythropoiesis is less than that of ACEIs.", 
    "204": "Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is one of the most serious causes of technique failure in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although the mechanisms responsible for the genesis of PF are not well understood, angiotensin II is known to promote fibrosis and inflammation in various tissues and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to attenuate those effects. We previously showed that ACEIs have beneficial effects on peritoneal alterations induced by hypertonic (3.86% glucose) PD solutions. In the present study, we investigated the local effects of intraperitoneal (IP) enalapril on peritoneal alterations induced by 3.86% glucose PD solution in rats on chronic PD. One week after peritoneal catheter insertion, 23 non uremic male rats were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 11) received 20 mL 3.86% PD solution twice daily, and group B (n = 12) received 20 mL 3.86% PD solution containing 1 mg/L enalapril twice daily. After 4 weeks of such infusions, we measured net ultrafiltration (UF) volume and obtained samples of visceral peritoneum from the liver for thickness measurement. Net UF was significantly higher (6.6 +/- 0.2 mL vs. 5.6 +/- 0.2 mL) and peritoneal thickness was significantly lower (30 +/- 5 microm vs. 52 +/- 0.8 microm) in group B. We conclude that intraperitoneal enalapril (an ACEI) protects the peritoneal membrane from the effects of hypertonic glucose. This protection might be mediated by enalapril's interference with angiotensin though inhibition of cytokine overexpression.", 
    "205": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in controlling blood pressure and have been shown to reduce proteinuria with fewer adverse effects than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In the present prospective study, we evaluated the action of irbesartan, an ARB with a long half life, on proteinuria, peritoneal protein losses, and peritoneal transport in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We enrolled 15 stable patients (11 with diuresis of more than 500 mL/day; 40% women; 40% with diabetes) into the study. Mean age of the patients was 65 +/- 15 years, and mean time on PD was 33 +/- 21 months. The study was performed in two stages. In stage I, patients received no irbesartan. In stage II, patients received 30 days of treatment with irbesartan (145 +/- 72 mg/day). After treatment with irbesartan, and no changes in blood pressure level as compared with baseline, we observed a reduction in proteinuria (r = 0.690, p < 0.05), decreased peritoneal protein losses at 4 hours' and 24 hours' dwell time (r = 0.910 and r = 0.930, p < 0.001), decreased peritoneal Kt/V(r = 0.586, p < 0.05), and increased peritoneal creatinine clearance (r = 0.943, p < 0.001). Levels of serum albumin (r = 0.630, p < 0.05), prealbumin (r = 0.810, p < 0.001), and transferrin (r = 0.551, p < 0.05) increased after treatment with irbesartan. We conclude that treatment with irbesartan in patients with CRF undergoing PD modifies peritoneal transport and reduces peritoneal and urinary protein loss. This effect probably has a positive impact on nutritional parameters. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved.",

Consciousness disturbance (Glasgow coma scale 4) with a decerebrate posture improved 5 days after stroke onset. As the BP was fairly high, antihypertensive agents, including lisinopril, were initiated. Three weeks later, the decerebrate rigidity and high BP remained, and tizanidine was initiated to see whether the decrease in muscle tone could facilitate hypertension control and motor recovery. However, the BP dropped dramatically within 2 hours after the first dose of tizanidine. The tizanidine and all of the antihypertensive medications were withdrawn. Tizanidine was used again after her BP had stabilized, but did not produce similar problems.",

Ten normal subjects were given L-NAME (66 microg/kg per min for 30 minutes) or vehicle in random order on separate days during placebo and after randomized, double-blind treatment with L-arginine, ramipril, or L-arginine plus ramipril. Infusion of L-NAME significantly increased systolic blood pressure (all P<0.05) and decreased heart rate (all P< or =0.02) during all 4 treatment arms. After placebo pretreatment, serum aldosterone was significantly higher during L-NAME infusion than during vehicle (6.6+/-1.7 versus 3.3+/-0.5 ng/dL; P=0.045). Combined treatment with L-arginine plus ramipril abolished this effect. There was no effect of L-NAME on plasma renin activity (PRA; P=0.297) or angiotensin II concentrations (P=0.537). However, there was a significant interactive effect of L-NAME and time on serum potassium (P=0.039). There was a significant linear relationship between PRA and aldosterone concentration after vehicle infusion ([aldosterone]=3.9.PRA+1.9; r2=0.476; P=0.027) and L-NAME infusion ([aldosterone]=7.2.PRA+3.1; r2=0.457; P=0.032), and the intercepts of these lines were different (P=0.029).

During a mean follow-up of 2.7 years, 913 participants with diabetes experienced a primary outcome event, with no significant difference between treatment strategies (14.6%, verapamil SR versus 13.9%; atenolol hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.19). Risk for the primary outcome increased with presence of baseline heart failure, renal impairment, US residency, age, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, or smoking. High systolic and diastolic pressures during follow-up also were associated with increased risk, as were low diastolic pressures. Antihypertensive treatment with a verapamil SR or atenolol strategy resulted in similar rates of cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with diabetes.

Angiotensin II, the main product of ACE, is a pleiotropic hormone, capable of serving as a neurotransmitter, growth factor, angiogenesis factor, vasoconstrictor, pro-thrombotic agent, and cytokine. So it is perhaps not surprising that the ACE D/D genotype is associated with several major psychiatric diseases, most cancers except prostate cancer (where the D/D genotype is actually protective), most cardiovascular diseases, most autoimmune diseases, and even infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV. In a preliminary study, angiotensin II blockade appeared to hasten recovery from West Nile virus encephalitis; it may be equally useful in SARS. The ACE gene underwent duplication at the origin of Chordata, just before the \"Cambrian Explosion\" in the number of species. The ancestral, unduplicated form of ACE is still expressed during the terminal differentiation of human spermatocytes, suggesting a critical role in reproduction. The crystal structure of testicular ACE (tACE) was recently published. Computer modeling suggests that tACE may be activated by both mechanical forces and reducing agents. The duplicated form of ACE (somatic ACE, sACE) is expressed in areas of high fluid flow. sACE may auto-dimerize via a novel protein motif, the \"disulfide zipper.\" The sACE dimer is predicted to have higher catalytic efficiency and redox resistance than tACE.",

Clinically important high-risk subgroups included the elderly, diabetics, those with heart failure and those with ST depression or bundle branch block on the presenting ECG. Elderly patients were less likely to receive evidence-based treatments, including beta blockers, statins and revascularisation. Diabetics received more revascularisation procedures but the overall revascularisation rate was low. Heart failure patients received less evidence-based treatment, with the exception of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Heparin was used less frequently in those with a normal ECG, although rates of revascularisation were not different when compared with those with ECG abnormalities. The conclusions of the study were that groups of patients with particularly high event rates are readily identified by their clinical characteristics, but use of evidence-based treatments and invasive investigations do not appear to be targeted towards those at greatest risk. Risk stratification and the appropriate application of treatments for patients with acute coronary syndromes need to be reviewed in the clinical setting.", 
    "255": "Systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflet (SAM) combined with obstruction at the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract is often observed on echocardiography in elderly hypertensive patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy. We experienced, however, two patients with mild hypertension who had an ejection systolic murmur, SAM, and LV outflow tract obstruction with a pressure gradient of 46 and 45 mmHg, respectively, despite very mild symmetric hypertrophy of LV wall (12 mm) by echocardiography. Treatment with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker improved intraventricular obstruction and LV hypertrophy in both patients. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction should be suspected in hypertensive patients with mild LV hypertrophy, particularly in those with an ejection systolic murmur. Angiotensin II antagonists could be considered as the treatment of choice for such patients.",

In contrast, administration of the mineralocorticoid antagonist (8 mice) for a 2-week period significantly reduced renal fibrosis in the obstructed kidney, compared to mice given the dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle (9). The beneficial effect of spironolactone treatment was not associated with any changes in serum potassium or aldosterone concentration, or urinary concentrations of sodium or potassium.",

Its classification includes preclinical, nonproliferative (mild, moderate, and severe or preproliferative diabetic retinopathy) and proliferative stages (low risk, high risk, and advanced). Diabetic maculopathy (exudative, edematous, or ischemic) may be associated with either nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Prevention requires the tightest possible control of both blood glucose and blood pressure. Laser photocoagulation remains the only procedure recommended for severe nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy and maculopathy. Since it reduces legal blindness by more than 90% in proliferative retinopathy and prevents severe sight loss in diabetic maculopathy, photocoagulation is probably one of the most effective forms of treatment known today. Less destructive approaches are desirable, however, and those currently under phase 3 trial include blockade of angiotensin receptors, the beta-isoform of protein kinase C, and growth hormone secretion by long-acting analogues of somatostatin. Evidence from past randomized controlled studies does not support a role for inhibitors of platelet aggregation, aldose reductase, and advanced glycosylation end products in the prevention/treatment of retinopathy. Future approaches might include the use of thiamine and its analogues in the primary and secondary prevention of early retinopathy and blockers of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor in more advanced stages.",

Clinical features in both types of DM are similar and are characterized by an underlying abnormality of the microcirculation, manifested by both retinopathy and nephropathy. Clinical hallmarks of DN include elevated blood pressure (BP) and elevated urinary protein excretion. Treatment consists of maintaining BP at <130/85 mm Hg in patients without proteinuria and <125/75 mm Hg in patients with microalbuminuria or overt DN. In addition, agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have been found to be effective in reducing the risk of progression to DN, a result independent of their antihypertensive effect.",

The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) studied the effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) irbesartan on the reduction of BP, urinary protein excretion, and progression to DN. The study end points in the IDNT demonstrated that ARB therapy reduced BP, reduced urinary protein excretion, and provided renal protection against progression to DN. The Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial demonstrated that the ARB losartan, when combined with conventional antihypertensive agents, decreased urinary protein excretion by 35%. Losartan both lowered BP and provided renal protection against DN. In a study comparing an ACE inhibitor (trandolapril), an ARB (losartan), and a combination of the 2 agents (trandolapril and losartan), data showed that all 3 arms reduced BP to the same degree. However, a combination of the ARB plus the ACE inhibitor produced both a significant reduction in urinary protein excretion beyond that seen with either agent alone and a significantly greater protection against progression to doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. The reduction in urinary protein excretion and renal progression seen with individual agents were not statistically different from each other.",

Dialysis is a very expensive modality costing more than 50,000 dollars per patient per year. Total medical spending for the 400,000 patients with ESRD cost 22.8 billion dollars in 2001, an almost 3-fold increase over the same 1991-2001 decade.

The CONSENSUS trial in 1987 enrolled 253 patients, while Val-HeFT in 1999 enrolled 5,010 patients; indeed, the Val-HeFT subgroup of patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was bigger than the whole CONSENSUS trial even though the 366 patients were only 7% of the total trial population. More recent and ongoing cardiovascular trials have even greater patient numbers with 14,703 patients enrolled in VALIANT, 15,314 in VALUE, 23,400 in ONTARGET and 33,357 in ALLHAT. Part of the reason is that in modern trials, patients in the control group are already receiving optimal therapy. Therefore, in order to be adequately powered to detect any benefit of new drugs, trials must recruit thousands of patients. This expanding trend cannot continue forever because of time and economic constraints and as a result, trials are shifting their design to include composite and surrogate endpoints. In addition, more predefined substudies are being carried out to analyze possible benefits in specific patient populations such as those with type 2 diabetes or renal impairment. Modern trials are also placing more emphasis on protection as a long-term strategy to control cardiovascular risks. Examples of these points, particularly regarding the size of modern cardiovascular trials to have the power to show protective effects, are illustrated by Val-HeFT, LIFE, ELITE II, VALIANT, VALUE, CHARM and NAVIGATOR.",

The coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infects cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here we show that codon optimization of the SARS-CoV S-protein gene substantially enhanced S-protein expression. We also found that two retroviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and murine leukemia virus, both expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein or S-protein variants, efficiently infected HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2. Infection mediated by an S-protein variant whose cytoplasmic domain had been truncated and altered to include a fragment of the cytoplasmic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein was, in both cases, substantially more efficient than that mediated by wild-type S protein. Using S-protein-pseudotyped SIV, we found that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 made no contribution to S-protein-mediated infection. Finally, we show that a soluble and catalytically inactive form of ACE2 potently blocked infection by S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus and by SARS-CoV. These results permit studies of SARS-CoV entry inhibitors without the use of live virus and suggest a candidate therapy for SARS.",

This anemia is corrected by angiotensin II, demonstrating the involvement of angiotensin II in adult (definitive) erythropoiesis. We investigated the possible role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in primitive erythropoiesis in the yolk sac of the chicken embryo. Enzymatically active ACE was detected in the yolk sac endoderm, concomitantly with the differentiation of blood islands in the adjacent yolk sac mesoderm. The simultaneous presence of all the other components of the RAS (renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin II receptor) in the vicinity of the blood islands suggests that this system is involved in erythropoiesis. This role was confirmed by in vivo blockade of the RAS with fosinoprilate, a specific inhibitor of chicken ACE, which decreased hematocrit by 15%. A similar decrease in hematocrit was observed following treatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist Sar1-Ile8-Angiotensin II, suggesting that this effect was mediated by angiotensin II. Both treatments affected hematocrit by decreasing erythroblast proliferation. Thus, the RAS, and its effector peptide angiotensin II in particular, modulates primitive erythropoiesis.", 
    "290": "Our recent studies suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 functions as an endocrine suppressor of renin biosynthesis. Genetic disruption of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) results in overstimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), leading to high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy. Consistent with the higher heart-to-body weight ratio, the size of left ventricular cardiomyocytes in VDR knockout (KO) mice was markedly increased compared with wild-type (WT) mice. As expected, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA and circulating ANP were also increased in VDRKO mice. Treatment of VDRKO mice with captopril reduced cardiac hypertrophy and normalized ANP expression. To investigate the role of the cardiac RAS in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, the expression of renin, angiotensinogen, and AT-1a receptor in the heart was examined by real-time RT-PCR and immunostaining. In VDRKO mice, the cardiac renin mRNA level was significantly increased, and this increase was further amplified by captopril treatment. Consistently, intense immunostaining was detected in the left ventricle of captopril-treated WT and VDRKO mice by use of an anti-renin antibody. Levels of cardiac angiotensinogen and AT-1a receptor mRNAs were unchanged in the mutant mice. These data suggest that the cardiac hypertrophy seen in VDRKO mice is a consequence of activation of both the systemic and cardiac RAS and support the notion that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) regulates cardiac functions, at least in part, through the RAS.", 
    "291": "Angiotensin (ANG) II can be associated with gene expression regulation. Thus we studied the possible role of ANG II in the regulation of AT(2) mRNA and protein expression. We utilized sham-operated renal ablation rats as well as renal ablation rats pretreated during the first 7 days of the development of renal damage with either the angiotensin-converting inhibitor ramipril, the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, or the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123319. Renal tissue was analyzed for histological changes and expression of AT(2) receptor mRNA (by RT-PCR) and protein (by immunohistochemistry). To explore the physiological role of AT(2) receptor overexpression in the development of renal damage, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, and renal damage were evaluated. A time-dependent increase in the expression of AT(2) receptor mRNA and protein was observed at 7, 15, and 30 days after renal ablation. Because these effects were already evident at day 7, the effects of ramipril, losartan, or PD-123319 were tested at this time. The ramipril group and the PD-123319-pretreated group showed inhibition of AT(2) receptor expression, whereas the losartan-pretreated group showed a further increase in AT(2) receptor expression. Inhibition of the AT(2) receptor during renal ablation was associated with increased renal damage and a further increase in the blood pressure. This suggests that overexpression of AT(2) receptors after renal ablation is modulated by ANG II through its own AT(2) receptor and that functional expression of this effect may represent a counterregulatory mechanism to modulate the renal damage induced by renal ablation.",

Diuretics are currently recommended by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Commission on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension. In addition, they remain an important aspect of congestive heart failure treatment in that they improve the congestive symptomatology, which typifies the more advanced stages of congestive heart failure.

Dr. Suzanne Oparil is a clinical cardiologist who has been involved in the investigation of some of the fundamental mechanisms of vascular disease. Information derived from her studies has been used to develop specific treatments for hypertension. Dr. Oparil was one of those few women who attended medical school at a time when most of the students were males. She graduated at the top of her class at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and trained at Columbia and the Massachusetts General Hospital. She was on the faculty of the University of Chicago until 1977, when she transferred to become Professor of Medicine,Physiology, and Biophysics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she has continued her research. Early in her career, Dr. Oparil observed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was capable of generating a vasoconstrictor hormone, angiotensin II. Her work, along with that of investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital and other institutions, led to the development of ACE inhibitors. Initially, Dr. Oparil's interest was focused on the pulmonary circulation. She identified endothelin as a major mediator of pulmonary hyper-tension and as a potent vasoconstrictor. In recent years, she has been investigating novel pathways by which estrogens protect against vascular injury. Her work has led to important clues about how female sex hormones protect blood vessels. Throughout her career as a basic scientist, Dr. Oparil has also maintained a clinical interest. She has been involved in numerous hypertension clinical trials with different medications. She served as President of the American Heart Association and was the first woman president of the American Federation of Medical Research. Dr. Oparil has always been an outspoken critic of those in medicine who speak to hear themselves heard. She has been a strong advocate of approaches to treatment that may not have been popular. Throughout her career, she has combined scientific judgment with stern clinical discipline. Her contributions to the understanding of hypertension have been significant.", 
    "302": "The goal of treating hypertension has evolved from merely lowering blood pressure to an emphasis on the more important objective of decreasing morbidity and mortality. Recent trials have emphasized, however, that the major benefit in outcome relates to the level of blood pressure achieved. Hypertension associated with other risk factors, such as age, diabetes, nephropathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy, places patients at high risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and cardiovascular death. In numerous studies, reductions in end points were usually achieved with combination therapy. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) reaffirmed the value of diuretics in treating high-risk hypertension and reducing morbidity, but it also confirmed the necessity of combination drug therapy. Agents that block the effects of angiotensin II are an important component of antihypertensive therapy because of their proven ability to lower the incidence of cardiovascular and renal events in high-risk hypertensive patients.",

The oral form of candesartan is candesartan cilexetil; for simplicity, the term \"candesartan\" is used throughout this manuscript. Two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies were performed to determine if addition of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan was more effective in lowering blood pressure than up-titration of lisinopril. Hypertensive patients (N=1,096) who were uncontrolled on lisinopril 20 mg daily were randomized (1:1) to receive either 8 weeks of high-dose lisinopril (40 mg) or the addition of candesartan (16 mg) for 2 weeks followed by 32 mg for 6 weeks. Study 1 (n=538) demonstrated decreases in trough sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressures at Week 8 by 6.2/5.9 mm Hg, respectively, for the lisinopril up-titration treatment group and by 11.6/8.3 mm Hg, respectively, for the lisinopril plus candesartan treatment group (p<0.01 in comparing both blood pressures reductions between the two treatment groups). Corresponding results for Study 2 (n=558) are reductions of 8.7/6.2 mm Hg and 9.5/7.4 mm Hg, respectively, for each of the two treatment groups. For Study 2, comparisons of systolic/diastolic blood pressures between the two treatment groups were not statistically significantly different (p=0.51/p=0.08, respectively). Post hoc pooled analysis (N=1,096) demonstrated a slightly greater blood pressure reduction with lisinopril plus candesartan compared with lisinopril (3.1/1.7 mm Hg). A 95% confidence interval limit for the difference in least squares mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure between the two treatment groups is -4.8 to -1.5 and is -2.8 to -0.7 in mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. The blood pressure control rates (<140/<90 mm Hg) were 42.7% and 36.9%, respectively. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated in all groups. In conclusion, for hypertensive patients not controlled by lisinopril 20 mg once daily, addition of candesartan (32 mg once daily) or doubling the dose of lisinopril provides safe, additional reduction of blood pressure.",

However, as we reported previously, the initial improvement of LVR was short-term because of LV remodeling but could be maintained longer with postoperative use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been used to treat patients with heart failure by natriuretic and vasodilatory actions. Recent reports have suggested that ANP inhibits the rennin-angiotensin system. In this study, the effects of ANP after LVR were evaluated.",

Echocardiography revealed better LV remodeling and function in LVR+A group than in LVR group. Four weeks after LVR, left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and Tau were significantly lower in LVR+A group (LVEDP: 10+/-4 in LVR+A group versus 18+/-6 mm Hg in LVR group, Tau: 13+/-2 versus 17+/-2ms). End-systolic elastance (Ees) was higher in LVR+A group (Ees: 0.34+/-0.2 versus 0.19+/-0.11 mm Hg/microL). The levels of myocardial ACE activity in LVR+A group was significantly lower than in LVR group.

Patients were grouped by diabetic status: previously known diabetes (insulin use or diagnosis of diabetes before MI, n=3400, 23%); newly diagnosed diabetes (use of diabetic therapy or diabetes diagnosed at randomization [median 4.9 d after infarction], but no known diabetes at presentation, n=580, 4%); or no diabetes (n=10,719). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes were younger and had fewer comorbid conditions than did patients with previously known diabetes. At 1 year after enrollment, patients with previously known and newly diagnosed diabetes had similarly increased adjusted risks of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 1.59 and HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.85, respectively) and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.48 and HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.56).",

    "319": "The objective was to study factors related to the changes induced by antihypertensive treatment on oxidative status, antioxidant activities, and reactive oxygen species by-products in whole blood and mononuclear peripheral cells. Eighty-nine hypertensive patients (mean age 46 years, 46 men, average 24-h blood pressure 139/88 mm Hg, body mass index 29) were included. After 3 months of nonrandomized allocation to antihypertensive treatment (20 nonpharmacologic, 36 beta-blockers, 33 angiotensin receptor blocker), oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde were significantly reduced, and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase was significantly increased in both whole blood and peripheral mononuclear cells. The content of damaged base 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in hypertensive subjects was also significantly reduced during the antihypertensive treatment. In a group of 42 subjects, the oxidative stress was further reduced and the antioxidant enzyme activities further increased after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment. The changes were independent of the kind of antihypertensive treatment. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment improved the increased oxidative stress and the decreased antioxidant mechanisms. It is independent of the type of treatment and the beneficial effect of treatment increases over time.", 
    "320": "Reducing blood pressure (BP) to target levels is a major priority in preventing clinical events in hypertension. Typically this requires more than one drug, and recent guidelines on hypertension management therefore recommend starting with combination treatment in many patients. Diuretics have often been part of such therapy, usually paired with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or similar agents; but calcium channel blockers are also highly efficacious in reducing BP when combined with ACE inhibitors. In addition, these drug classes, separately and in combination, appear to have vasculoprotective properties. Because the primary goal of treating hypertension is to enhance survival and reduce cardiovascular outcomes, the Rationale and Design of Avoiding Cardiovascular events through COMbination therapy in Patients LIving with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial is designed as the first blinded and randomized study to prospectively compare the effects on these endpoints of two antihypertensive combinations, benazapril/hydrochlorothiazide (force titrated to 40/12.5 mg) and amlodipine besylate/benazapril (force titrated to 5/40 mg). The doses can be further titrated to 40/25 mg or 10/40 mg, and other classes of drugs can be added as needed for optimal BP control. The primary study endpoint is a composite of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The study will be performed in hypertensive patients (systolic BP > or = 160 mm Hg or currently on antihypertensive therapy) with risk factors for cardiovascular events (prior events, target organ damage, kidney disease, or diabetes). A total of 6300 subjects will be randomized to each group with the expectation that a total of 1642 primary endpoints will occur during a 5-year period, providing 90% power to detect the 15% relative reduction in events (alpha = 0.05) hypothesized to favor the amlodipine besylate/benazapril group. The ACCOMPLISH study will be performed in the United States and Europe. The first patient was randomizedduring 2003, and the trial should conclude in 2008.", 
    "321": "Almost all forms of chronic kidney disease progressing to end-stage kidney failure are characterized by diffuse fibrosis, a final common pathway converging from multiple pathogenetic networks regardless of the initial injury. Four principal interventions including glycaemic and blood pressure control, dietary protein restriction, and angiotensin II blockade have been proven to slow progression of diabetic and/or non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. However, the ultimate solution to halt disease progression in the long term is still pending. Because of the pathogenetic complexity of kidney disease, multidrug intervention with the least side-effects should, without doubt, be the next step to stop kidney disease progression. Animal and cellular studies have demonstrated the rationale for pentoxifylline (i.e. its effects against cell proliferation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix accumulation) in the treatment of chronic kidney disease induced by immune- or non-immune-mediated mechanisms. Limited human studies have proven its efficacy in reducing proteinuria in patients with diabetes receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and in patients with nephrotic syndrome refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, monotherapy with pentoxifylline markedly reduces proteinuria in patients with membranous nephropathy. Further studies are required to examine whether pentoxifylline can improve the renal outcome in patients receiving interventions with proven efficacy.", 
    "322": "Dialysis patients show a high prevalence of cardiovascular complications among which left ventricular hypertrophy is one of the most frequent and is independently predictive of mortality. A recent study indicates that partial regression of left ventricular hypertrophy improves mortality and reduces cardiovascular events in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, suggesting the importance of targeting therapeutic strategies to reduce cardiac hypertrophy and improve the outcome in these patients. The pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in ESRD patients is multifactorial and includes hypertension, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased sympathetic activity, chronic volume overload, chronic anaemia and hyperparathyroidism. In this paper, we review the available experimental and clinical evidence showing the important contribution of the renin-angiotensin system as well as its interaction with the sympathetic nervous system in the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in ESRD patients. Furthermore, we summarize the results of currently available clinical studies that examined the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor antagonism on left ventricular hypertrophy in ESRD patients, and review evidences that support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in the ESRD population.", 
    "323": "Previous studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in diabetes and this may contribute to the subcellular remodelling and heart dysfunction in this disease. Therefore, we examined the effects of RAS blockade by enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin receptor AT1 antagonist, on cardiac function, myofibrillar and myosin ATPase activity as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) isozyme expression in diabetic hearts. Diabetes was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg; i.v.) and these animals were treated with and without enalapril (10 mg/kg/day; oral) or losartan (20 mg/kg/day; oral) for 8 weeks. Enalapril or losartan prevented the depressions in left ventricular rate of pressure development, rate of pressure decay and ventricular weight seen in diabetic animals. Both drugs also attenuated the decrease in myofibrillar Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase and myosin ATPase activity seen in diabetic rats. The diabetes-induced increase in beta-MHC content and gene expression as well as the decrease in alpha-MHC content and mRNA levels were also prevented by enalapril and losartan. These results suggest the occurrence of myofibrillar remodelling in diabetic cardiomyopathy and provide evidence that the beneficial effects of RAS blockade in diabetes may be associated with attenuation of myofibrillar remodelling in the heart.",

We investigated primary care physicians choices of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy for subjects with type II diabetes diagnosed with hypertension. Subjects were registered with 105 UK general practices in the General Practice Research Database and prescribed oral hypoglycaemic drugs for the first time between January 1993 and December 2001. We evaluated prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs in subjects with secondary diagnoses of hypertension in the first year following initiation of oral hypoglycaemic therapy. Data were analysed for 4519 diabetic subjects with diagnosed hypertension. Between 1993 and 2001, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics increased from 20 to 30%; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors from 35 to 45% and angiotensin receptor blockers from 0 to 8%. The proportion of subjects prescribed lipid-lowering therapy increased from 8% in 1993 to 33% in 2001, with the proportion prescribed statins increasing from 1 to 30%. At different general practices, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics ranged from 0 to 52%, beta-blockers from 5 to 60%, ACE inhibitors from 15 to 81%, and statins from 0 to 50%. Variation between practices was not explained by adjusting for age, sex, prevalent coronary heart disease or study year. Trends in drug utilisation were consistent with the evolving evidence base but there were wide variations in drug utilisation between practices. A more consistent approach to drug selection might be associated with improved patient outcomes.", 
    "325": "Based on results of in vitro studies, it has been hypothesized that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) promotes the recruitment and differentiation of pre-adipocytes and that increased formation of small insulin-sensitive adipocytes counteracts ectopic deposition of lipids, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.

Moreover, angiotensin-(1-7) levels increased in parallel with angiotensin I levels and the angiotensin-(1-7)/angiotensin II ratio increased by 7.5-fold in coronary sinus blood. Intravenous administration of ACE inhibitor to subjects with coronary artery disease rapidly decreased angiotensin II levels by 54-58% and increased angiotensin I levels by 2.4- to 2.8-fold, but did not alter angiotensin-(1-7) levels or net angiotensin-(1-7) production across the myocardial vascular bed.", 
    "332": "The failure of angiotensin-(1-9) levels to increase in response to increased angiotensin I levels indicated little role for ACE2 in angiotensin I metabolism. Additionally, the levels of angiotensin-(1-7) were more linked to those of angiotensin I than angiotensin II, consistent with its formation by endopeptidase-mediated metabolism of angiotensin I, rather than by ACE2-mediated metabolism of angiotensin II.", 
    "333": "The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism has received much attention in pharmacogenetic research because observed variations in response to ACE inhibitors might be associated with this polymorphism. Pharmacogenetic testing raises the hope to individualise ACE inhibitor therapy in order to optimise its effectiveness and to reduce adverse effects for genetically different subgroups. However, the extent of its effect modification in patients treated with ACE inhibitors remains inconclusive.

Despite its putative involvement in the processing of bioactive peptides, among them the kinins, little is known about the physiological roles of both human forms of APP. The purpose of the present study is first to engineer and characterize a secreted form of hmAPP (human membrane-bound APP). Our biochemical analysis has shown that the expressed glycosylated protein is fully functional, and exhibits enzymic parameters similar to those described previously for mAPP purified from porcine or bovine lungs or expressed from a porcine clone. This soluble form of hmAPP cross-reacts with a polyclonal antiserum raised against a 469-amino-acid hmAPP fragment produced in Escherichia coli. Secondly, we synthesized three internally quenched fluorescent peptide substrates that exhibit a similar affinity for the enzyme than its natural substrates, the kinins, and a higher affinity compared with the tripeptide Arg-Pro-Pro used until now for the quantification of APP in biological samples. These new substrates represent a helpful analytical tool for rapid and reliable screening of patients susceptible to adverse reactions associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or novel vasopeptidase (mixed angiotensin-converting enzyme/neprilysin) inhibitors.",

Recently, the results from 11 large randomized clinical trials have suggested a difference in the emergence of new diabetes according to cardiovascular medication use. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists yielded a lower incidence of diabetes development than beta-blockers and diuretics. Physicians should consider this possible diabetes consequence when prescribing long-term beta-blockers and diuretics, particularly in patients at high risk of developing diabetes.", 
    "346": "The renin-angiotensin system is the major contributor to development of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and many other cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin II, one of the main effectors of this system, contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and plays an important role in monocyte, platelet, and endothelium interactions. The effects on platelet and endothelial function, either by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, are still not well understood. A double-blind, randomized, prospective trial of either enalapril (10-20 mg daily) or eprosartan (400-800 mg daily) over a 10-week period was conducted in 42 patients (27 males, 15 females). Platelet activation was evaluated by measuring platelet factor 4 (PF-4), beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), the ratio of platelet factor 4 to beta-thromboglobulin, and endothelial function by measuring total plasma nitrate levels, von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels, and blood flow using venous occlusive plethysmography. After a 10-week treatment with enalapril or eprosartan, the sitting blood pressure in both the enalapril group (from 152.2 +/- 18.7 mmHg to 141.9 +/- 23.5 mmHg, P < 0.05) and eprosartan group (from 151 +/- 10.0 mmHg to 142.3 +/- 12.9 mmHg, P < 0.05) was significantly reduced. Significant diastolic blood pressure (DPB) reduction (from 94 +/- 8.7 to 84.5 +/- 9.6 mmHg, P < 0.05) and a greater DBP reduction response were found in the eprosartan group (63% in eprosartan versus 25% in enalapril). Additionally, dose-dependent reductions in the indices of platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction were observed in patients administered high dose treatments of eprosartan and enalapril, and the beneficial effects of these agents were not correlated with the reduction of blood pressure using both agents. Eprosartan is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of mid-to-moderate hypertension, and the DBP response reduction to eprosartin was better than that to enalapril. A high dose of either eprosartan or enalapril significantly decreased the indices of platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients. The benefits of both agents cannot be explained solely by their antihypertensive effects and possibly may be mediated through their unique effect on angiotensin blockade.",

Suppression of arthritis by quinapril was associated with reduced articular expression of TNF-alpha by 68% (P=0.01) in the prophylaxis protocol and 27% (P=0.06) in the therapy protocol. Quinapril therapy also inhibited expression of splenocyte TNF-alpha production following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro stimulation by 59% (P=0.02). In parallel human in vitro experiments, ACE inhibition suppressed LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha by monocytes. In order to confirm that the action of quinapril occurred predominantly through suppression of angiotensin II, parallel experiments with the angiotensin receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil demonstrated that this agent also inhibited disease activity in CIA.",

Atherosclerosis represents a wide variety of pathologic lesions with different clinical impacts. In this review, we address the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of atherosclerosis. We define atherosclerosis as a multifactorial process representing a series of molecular and cellular mechanisms and involving multiple interactions between lipid metabolism, monocyte activation, endothelial cells, cytokines and/or other intracellular metabolic pathways. We also imply that control of atherosclerosis could be achieved through therapeutic interventions at different sites of the inflammatory process. Therapeutic targets could include cytokine pathways, growth factors, transcription factors, defective genes and other intracellular metabolic pathways.", 
    "364": "Angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen consisting of the first 3 or 4 kringle domains, reduces tumor growth by specifically inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Angiostatin is generated in vitro in a 2-step process. First, plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators. Next, plasmin excises the angiostatin fragment from plasminogen, a process requiring molecules that are able to donate a free sulfhydryl group. In this study, we investigated whether stimulation of in vivo angiostatin generation by administration of plasminogen activator and a free sulfhydryl group donor (FSD) has anti-tumor activity. First, we determined the optimal conditions for in vitro angiostatin generation by incubating murine plasma with different concentrations of plasminogen activator and/or the FSD captopril. Angiostatin generation was monitored by western blot analysis. Our results were extrapolated to the in vivo situation by administering the optimal dose of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA, i.v. injection 3 times/week) and captopril (in drinking water) to mice and analyzing the presence of angiostatin in the circulation. Angiostatin was readily detectable in mice receiving both tPA and captopril, but not in mice receiving either one of the agents. Finally, the anti-tumor activity of the tPA/captopril treatment was tested in a human melanoma xenograft model. Administration of tPA alone had only a marginal effect on tumor growth. Captopril alone reduced tumor growth by about 60%, whereas treatment with both captopril and tPA resulted in 83% inhibition of tumor growth.", 
    "365": "Despite major advances in treatment options for heart failure patients, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Frequent readmissions are distressful for patients and are associated with large costs for society. In an attempt to improve care for heart failure patients and thereby reduce morbidity and hospital readmissions, specialised heart failure clinics have emerged over the last 10 years. In particular, clinics relying, at least in part, on nurses specially trained in heart failure have gained popularity. This review of the published literature describes the wide variety of designs and the types of interventions taking place in such heart failure clinics. A total of 18 randomised studies comparing heart failure clinics using nurse intervention with conventional care have been published to date, and the majority of these have shown either a reduction in hospital readmissions or shortening of hospitalisations in the intervention group. These findings are supported by the results of several non-randomised, controlled investigations. Thus, it is concluded that heart failure clinics using nurse intervention should be an integrated part of the care process for patients with heart failure wherever possible. We argue that ongoing attention should be paid to the quality of care delivered by the clinics to ensure that the benefit of this intervention strategy persists. Thus, it would be of importance to continuously record relevant data describing the care process using specific indicators such as ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker use and doses. One possible, practical method to apply such continuous quality assurance may be by means of electronic medical record databases.",

The Cochrane Library was also searched, and reference lists of review articles on the topic, and of all relevant studies identified, were scanned. Search and selection of studies, data-extraction using standardised forms, and assessment of study quality was performed by two reviewers. The end-point was the proportion of persons who underwent hospital re-admission, and pooled relative risks (RR) were used to summarise the effectiveness of DMPs. The meta-analysis included 54 articles, comprising 27 randomised and 27 non-randomised controlled studies. Randomised studies consistently suggested that, in comparison with usual care, DMP reduced the frequency of re-admission for HF or cardiovascular disease by 30% (pooled RR 0.70; confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.62-0.79), all-cause re-admission by 12% (pooled RR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97), and the combined event of re-admission or death by 18% (pooled RR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.94). The results displayed no substantial variation when only DMPs with home visits, out-patient visits to a clinic, or patient follow-up longer than 6 months were included. For DMPs with out-patient clinical visits, however, the reduction in re-admission for HF or cardiovascular disease, and for all causes, did not attain statistical significance. The magnitude of DMP benefits reported by non-randomised studies was more than double that reported by randomised studies. Practically all the non-randomised studies failed to control for confounding factors, such as severity, co-morbidity and drug therapy.",

Their effectiveness is close to that observed in clinical trials evaluating drugs for HF, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers or digoxin.

    "369": "In the present study, we examined electron microscopically and immunohistochemically the effects of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on renal microangiopathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. To investigate changes in glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and tubular basement membrane components, we immunohistochemically localized type IV collagen and laminin. Animals have been divided into three groups of eight adult male rats each. The first group was the non-diabetic control group. The second group consisted of untreated diabetic rats. The third group consisted of diabetic rats that were treated with perindopril for 6 weeks. Blood glucose levels and body weight were measured. Morphometric analysis of kidney tissue was performed using light and electron microscopy to quantify glomerular size and thickness of the GBM. Blood glucose levels in diabetic rats were significantly increased when compared with non-diabetic controls. Blood glucose levels were not affected by perindopril treatment. Untreated diabetic rats showed increased glomerular size, thickening of the GBM and an increase in mesangial matrix as compared with controls. Treatment with perindopril prevented effectively glomerular hypertrophy and thickening of the GBM. Significant increase in type IV collagen and laminin was found in thickened GBM and mesangial matrix in kidneys of untreated diabetic rats. In perindopril-treated diabetic rats, staining of type IV collagen and laminin was less strong when compared with untreated diabetic rats. In conclusion, our data suggest that perindopril treatment is effective in preventing renal lesions possibly by ameliorating the diabetes-induced increase in expression of type IV collagen and laminin.",

To lower blood pressure in patients with normal blood pressure and diabetes, or heart failure, or with any evidence of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary, cerebral and peripheral territories, reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events by 18 to 42%. The diagnosis of hypertension in patients with these conditions is therefore irrelevant. The drugs that have mainly been tested in such conditions are the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but their efficacy probably derives from their blood pressure-lowering effect, instead of a primary antiatherosclerotic effect.", 
    "375": "It has been shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays key roles in the development of fibrosis in numerous organs, including the liver. Other studies have suggested that the RAS also may play roles in diseases of chronic inflammation. However, whether the RAS also can mediate acute inflammation in liver is unclear. The purpose of this study therefore was to determine the effect of the RAS inhibitors captopril and losartan on acute liver damage and inflammation caused by hepatic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Accordingly, male rats were subjected to 1 hour of hepatic ischemia (70%) followed by reperfusion; animals were killed 3, 8, or 24 hours after reperfusion. The effect of captopril or losartan (100 or 5 mg/kg intragastrically, respectively) was compared with that of vehicle (saline). The expression of angiotensinogen in liver increased fivefold 3 hours after reperfusion. Indices of liver damage and inflammation (e.g., alanine aminotransferase levels, pathological features, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression) all were significantly elevated in vehicle-treated animals after hepatic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion also caused an increase in the accumulation of protein adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal, an index of oxidative stress. Captopril or losartan treatment showed profound protective effects under these conditions, significantly blunting the increase in all these parameters caused by ischemia and reperfusion. In conclusion, RAS inhibitors prevent acute liver injury in a model of inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion. These data further suggest that the RAS may play a key role in mediating such responses in the liver and suggest a novel role for this system.",

Studies in humans have confirmed the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of this agent, as well as providing evidence of benefit in congestive heart failure. The side-effect profile indicates that the specificity of eplerenone for the mineralocorticoid receptor is responsible for the lower incidence of sex hormone- related side-effects than have been seen with other mineralocorticoid receptor blockers. Hyperkalemia is most frequently observed with eplerenone among patients with severe impairment of renal function and in diabetics with microalbuminuria, especially in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

In patients with AMI at admission (T0), the number of circulating CD34+ cells was higher (P < .001) than in CTRLs and became comparable with CTRLs within 60 days. Both the number of CD34+ cells coexpressing CD33, CD38, or CD117 and the number of HPCs was higher (P < .02 for all) in patients with AMI at T0 than in CTRLs, as was the number of hematopoietic colonies (P < .03).

The study covered 20 patients (mean age 46.6 +/- 7.3 years). The diagnosis in all the patients was verified by a complex of instrumental studies, including the determination of plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA), and topical diagnostic studies (ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and angiography). The patients were given spironolactone, dihydropyridine calcium blockers, and beta-adrenoblockers, then with the cross-over method, this combination was added by the angiotensin-I receptor blocker (ATRB) losartane or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) lisinopril for 4 weeks. 24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring was used to evaluate the efficiency of therapy. In the combined therapy losartane, 50-100 mg/day, reduced systolic BP (SBP) by 8.4%, diastolic BP (DBP) by 11.1% while lisinopril, 10-20 mg/day lowered SBP and DBP by 7.6 and 9.9%, respectively. Both drugs improved the daily BP profile. When losartane or lisinopril added to the combined treatment, a therapeutic response was achieved in 15 (79%) and 14 (73.7%) patients, respectively. ARB and ACEI exert an antihypertensive effect in patients with IHA and they may be used in the combined treatment of this disease. The use of the above drugs may reduce the dose of spironolactone to the mean therapeutic one. The pathophysiological rationale for the use of ATRB for IHA is that the sensitivity of aldosterone secretion to the stimulating effect of angiotensin II is preserved despite the fact that the PAC is higher and PRA is lower.",

Our aim is to document whether, in the case of patients undergoing chronic treatment with lisinopril, the non-withdrawal of this inhibitor's administration before cardiac surgery and the administering of a last dose on the day of the operation are associated with coronary haemodynamic alterations. A study was made of 18 patients submitted to myocardial revascularization under extracorporeal circulation and distributed in two groups: group A) without ACE inhibitorsplacebo, group B) with ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril). Coronary blood flow (CBF) was determined by inverted thermodilution via Baim's catheter. Coronary and metabolic haemodynamic values were calculated. Lisinopril had no significant influence on the CBF or on the other above-mentioned values. Therefore, it is not necessary to withdraw ACE inhibitors in cardiac surgery interventions.", 
    "389": "In addition to the traditional renin-angiotensin system, a great deal of evidence favors the existence of numerous independent tissue-specific renin-angiotensin systems. We report that mast cells are an additional source of renin and constitute a unique extrarenal renin-angiotensin system. We use renin-specific antibodies to demonstrate that cardiac mast cells contain renin. Extending this observation to the human mast cell line HMC-1, we show that these mast cells also express renin. The HMC-1 renin RT-PCR product is 100% homologous to Homo sapiens renin. HMC-1 cells also contain renin protein, as demonstrated both by immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. Renin released from HMC-1 cells is active; furthermore, HMC-1 cells are able to synthesize renin. It is known that, in the heart, mast cells are found in the interstitium in close proximity to nerves and myocytes, which both express angiotensin II receptors. Inasmuch as myocardial interstitium contains angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and because we were able to detect renin only in mast cells, we postulate that the release of renin from cardiac mast cells is the pivotal event triggering local formation of angiotensin II. Because of the ubiquity of mast cells, our results represent a unique paradigm for understanding local renin-angiotensin systems, not just in the heart, but in all tissues. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting mast cells in conjunction with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in the management of angiotensin II-related dysfunctions.",

    "391": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may have anti-inflammatory actions, an effect that could explain some of their beneficial effects on cardiovascular events in clinical trials. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and provides a convenient model to examine the effects of such agents. Genetic polymorphisms may be important in influencing the expression of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). We randomized men awaiting CABG to treatment with enalapril, losartan, or control for 2 months before surgery. Systemic IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor agonists were measured before and after surgery, and genotypes for the -174 G/C and -572 G/C IL-6 gene polymorphisms were determined. Total release of the IL-1 receptor agonist was decreased 29% by enalapril and 31% by losartan (adjusted p = 0.041). IL-6 was decreased 17% by enalapril and 20% by losartan. Subjects possessing the -174 GG genotype produced 20% more IL-6 (adjusted p = 0.029). In these high producers of IL-6, release of IL-6 was decreased 51% by enalapril (adjusted p = 0.001) and 32% by losartan (adjusted p = 0.068). Release of IL-10 was nonsignificantly decreased 26% by enalapril and 21% by losartan, whereas IL-8 was not detected. In conclusion, enalapril and losartan significantly decreased release of the IL-1 receptor agonist after CABG. Enalapril produced a highly significant decrease of 51% in the release of IL-6 in patients identified as high producers of IL-6 by the -174 G/C polymorphism, whereas losartan has a similar but less marked effect. The production of IL-6 in this setting is influenced by the -174 G/C polymorphism.",

A full understanding of the mode of action could be beneficial for the design of potent enhancers and for the choice of the enhancer to be used in the topical formulation of a special drug. In this study, the structural requirements of penetration enhancers have been investigated using the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) technique. Activities of naturally occurring terpenes, pyrrolidinone and N-acetylprolinate derivatives on the skin penetration of 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac sodium (DFS), hydrocortisone (HC), estradiol and benazepril have been considered. The resulting QSARs indicated that for 5-fluorouracil and diclofenac sodium, less hydrophobic enhancers were the most active. More precisely, molecular descriptors in the corresponding QSARs indicated the possible involvement of intermolecular electron donor-acceptor interactions. This was in contrast to the skin permeation promotion of hydrocortisone, estradiol and benazepril by enhancers, where a linear relationship between enhancement activity and n-octanol/water partition coefficients of enhancers was evident. The possible mechanisms of penetration enhancement as suggested by the QSARs will be discussed.",

However, increasing evidence suggests that nonhemodynamic effects, such as preservation of the podocyte slit diaphragm structure and function, may also mediate the antiproteinuric effects of RAS blockade. In this review, we analyze in detail the evidence for known and novel mechanisms considered to play important roles in mediating the antiproteinuric effect of RAS blockers, with a particular focus on diabetic nephropathy.",

By combining two, different pharmacologic principles and inhibiting both the ACE and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, it seems possible to block both the production and the action of angiotensin II, which would serve as efficient antihypertensive therapy. Exploring the beneficial effects of dual-blockade therapy is a work in rapid progress, in both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy. But evidence is also emerging in cardiovascular medicine, an overview of which is provided in this article.", 
    "395": "Numerous studies document an almost linear association between the level of albuminuria and risk for a cardiovascular event. Recent data also demonstrate a strong association between the presence of microalbuminuria and elevations in C-reactive protein. Therefore, the increased membrane permeability that generates microalbuminuria might be secondary to an inflammatory process. Progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria indicates worsening of vascular disease and presence of kidney disease. Recent pharmacologic interventions have resulted in significant delay and even arrest of progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria as well as kidney disease progression. Therefore, focus should be placed on use of antihypertensive agents that not only lower blood pressure but also lower or normalize albuminuria levels. All recent guideline statements support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Further lowering of albuminuria may be achieved by adding verapamil, diltiazem, or an ARB to an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "396": "Independent of the severity of coronary artery disease, diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing heart failure. This clinical entity has been considered to be a distinct disease process referred to as 'diabetic cardiomyopathy'. Experimental studies suggest that extensive metabolic perturbations may underlie both functional and structural alterations of the diabetic myocardium. Translational studies are, however, limited and only partly explain why diabetic patients are at increased risk of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Although a range of diagnostic methods may help to characterize alterations in cardiac function in general, none are specific for the alterations in diabetes. Treatment paradigms are very much limited to interpretation and translation from the results of interventions in non-diabetic patients with heart failure. This suggests that there is an urgent need to conduct pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic studies specifically in diabetic patients with cardiomyopathy to better understand the factors which initiate and progress diabetic cardiomyopathy and to develop more effective treatments.",

Diabetic patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome benefit from intensive glycemic control in the first 48 hours. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty using drug-eluting stents with concomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be considered early in diabetic patients with single vessel and multivessel disease.

Modern antidepressants produce no substantial cardiotoxic effects. Combination of an antihypertensive drug (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol) with an antidepressant affects favorably clinical course of hypertension, 24-hour blood pressure profile, characteristics of intracardiac hemodynamics, structural and geometric left ventricular parameters, allows to achieve sufficient antihypertensive effect with acceptable tolerability.", 
    "403": "A number of experimental and clinical investigations support the notion that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) compounds attenuate renal fibrosis. Fibrosis can be attenuated by either suppressing matrix formation or facilitating matrix degradation. In this study, drugs of ACEi and ARB classes were tested for their ability to facilitate matrix degradation in the kidney. A murine model system in which cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment for a specified period caused interstitial matrix deposition in the kidney was used. CsA was then discontinued, and experimental procedures were initiated to investigate matrix degradation. Benazepril, an ACEi, facilitated matrix degradation via the bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor on tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, whereas CGP-48933, an ARB, did not. In this murine model of CsA nephropathy under ACE blockade, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression was decreased in tubular epithelial cells, possibly leading to conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activator and subsequent activation of matrix metalloproteinases. These findings were confirmed in this study by measurements of plasmin activity, collagenolytic activity, and matrix metalloproteinase activities in the kidneys. In tubular epithelial cells stimulated in vitro, BK suppressed PAI-1 gene expression. All of these results suggest that ACEi can decrease PAI-1 expression via BK, thereby facilitating matrix degradation via activation of degradative enzymes to reduce interstitial matrix deposition.", 
    "404": "Sample size calculations for survival trials typically include an adjustment to account for the expected rate of noncompliance, or discontinuation from study medication. Existing sample size methods assume that when patients discontinue, they do so independently of their risk of an endpoint; that is, that noncompliance is noninformative. However, this assumption is not always true, as we illustrate using results from a published clinical trial database. In this article, we introduce a modified version of the method proposed by Lakatos (1988, Biometrics 44, 229-241) that can be used to calculate sample size under informative noncompliance. This method is based on the concept of two subpopulations: one with high rates of endpoint and discontinuation and another with low rates. Using this new method, we show that failure to consider the impact of informative noncompliance can lead to a considerably underpowered study.", 
    "405": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be useful in the treatment of essential hypertension while anti-platelet agents improve the overall cardiovascular risk profile in this population. Our aim was to assess the interaction of two different aspirin (ASA) doses--81 and 325 mg/day--with the antihypertensive effect of enalapril as well as their impact upon the urinary sodium excretion (Na(u)). A total of 22 patients between 35 and 65 years of age were included in a prospective double blind trial with a partial cross-over design. We excluded patients with secondary hypertension and recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients were placed on enalapril and a low sodium diet--<6 g of NaCl/day--and, sequentially, on two different doses of aspirin separated by a 10 day wash out period. Blood pressure (BP) was measured at weekly visits. Systolic, diastolic and mean BP levels decreased significantly in enalapril-treated patients (p<0.01) and no difference was detected between the two AAS dosages although a non-statistically significant difference towards better BP control was observed when 81 mg of ASA was used. Na(u) was higher at baseline when compared with the two periods under ASA (p<0.01) and Na(u) was higher with 81 mg than with 325 mg. These results suggest that in essential hypertensive individuals treated with enalapril and two ASA doses, low doses of ASA are associated with better blood pressure control and higher natriuresis.", 
    "406": "Hypertension, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounts for 25-49% of all strokes. Randomized placebo-controlled trials primarily with diuretics and beta-blockers administered in patients with hypertension have demonstrated a 38% reduction in primary stroke. Placebo-controlled trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not been conducted in patients with hypertension. However, in a meta-analysis of four placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease and/or diabetes mellitus, the overall risk of primary stroke was significantly reduced. Results of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation trial, which produced a substantial reduction in stroke with an apparently small reduction in blood pressure, suggest that the benefit of ACE inhibitors may be related to their effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system more than on blood pressure reduction. In active-control comparisons in patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitors have demonstrated reductions in primary stroke risk similar to reductions with diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. The data suggest that for primary prevention of stroke antihypertensive therapy should be individualized in patients. Relatively few data are available concerning the benefit of antihypertensive therapy in the secondary prevention of stroke. In patients who had experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack, therapy with a diuretic or a combination of a diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor could be recommended based on available outcome studies conducted in this patient population. It is premature to conclude that the benefit of ACE inhibitor therapy in primary or secondary prevention of stroke is an effect independent of blood pressure reduction. Hypertension detection, treatment, and control in patients still must be the principal focus of clinicians for both primary and secondary prevention of stroke.",

This effect was observed both in mild-to-moderate and severe AS. ACEI use, however, did not significantly affect hemodynamic progression (P=0.29). Furthermore, ACEIs had no additional effect on AS progression when given in combination with statins (0.11+/-0.42 versus 0.08+/-0.43 m x s(-1) x y(-1) for combination versus statin only; P=0.81).

Its ancillary properties, such as antioxidant activity and cardiovascular (CV) protection, make this drug potentially suitable for the treatment, and possibly prevention, of several CV diseases. There is a large body of evidence that support a complex interaction between ACE inhibitors and CV disease. A review of the preclinical profile of zofenopril clearly suggest that such interaction can be even more complex and could involve some drug-specific properties directly involved in the definition of the overall clinical profile of zofenopril as emerged from randomised clinical trials. In particular, zofenopril combines the feature of an effective ACE inhibitor, with plasma and tissue activity, along with that of an antioxidant compound, and both these characteristics can contribute to its capacity of controlling hypertension and improving the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. The results of The Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long term Evaluation (SMILE) trials have demonstrated that the early administration of zofenopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in the 6-week occurrence of major CV events (death and congestive heart failure) in high-risk patients with anterior non-thrombolysed myocardial infarction, and this effect is enhanced in some higher-risk subgroups of patients, such as those with a history of diabetes or arterial hypertension.",

The experimental procedure consisted of the administration of an infusion prepared with 10 g of dry calyx from H. sabdariffa on 0.51 water (9.6 mg anthocyanins content), daily before breakfast, or captopril 25 mg twice a day, for 4 weeks. The outcome variables were tolerability, therapeutic effectiveness (diastolic reduction > or = 10 mm Hg) and, in the experimental group, urinary electrolytes modification. Ninety subjects were included, 15 withdrew from the study due to non-medical reasons; so, the analysis included 39 and 36 patients from the experimental and control group, respectively. The results showed that H. sabdariffa was able to decrease the systolic blood pressure (BP) from 139.05 to 123.73mm Hg (ANOVA p < 0.03) and the diastolic BP from 90.81 to 79.52mm Hg (ANOVA p < 0.06). At the end of the study, there were no significant differences between the BP detected in both treatment groups (ANOVA p > 0.25). The rates of therapeutic effectiveness were 0.7895 and 0.8438 with H. sabdariffa and captopril, respectively (chi2, p > 0.560), whilst the tolerability was 100% for both treatments.

While many (47.5%) were aware of the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, few (16.2%) knew of the impact of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality. Instead, diuretics were thought to be most important for prolonging survival in congestive heart failure (47.5%).

    "463": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities and anti-hypertensive activities in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of 12 kinds of commercial peptides of food additive grade were measured. Four peptide products derived from milk proteins showed strong anti-hypertensive activities (>-18.0 mm Hg). A sample of WE80BG derived from whey proteins showed the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (-21.2 +/- 16.9 mm Hg) with a medium level of ACE inhibitory activity (53.6%), and it was subjected to hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography. From the low molecular weight fraction, an anti-hypertensive peptide was isolated by using reversed-phase HPLC, and it was found to be a tetrapeptide, alanine-leucine-proline-methionine (Ala-Leu-Pro-Met, ALPM), the origin of which was estimated to be beta-lactoglobulin f 142 to 145. At 8 h after oral administration of ALPM in SHR, systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased (-21.4 +/- 7.8 mm Hg), but the IC50 value (concentration of peptide needed to inhibit 50% of the ACE activity) of ALPM was not so high. We named the Ala-Leu-Pro-Met \"beta-lactosin B.\" This peptide is the second anti-hypertensive peptide found from beta-lactoglobulin. Because WE80BG containing ALPM was also found to show the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (-24.5 +/- 10 mm Hg) at 8 h after oral administration in SHR, WE80BG would be suitable for application to the development of a new food expected to have anti-hypertensive effects.",

Here, we investigated the effects of perindopril on the dopaminergic system in mice after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment, in comparison with a Ca(2+) antagonist, amlodipine. Administration of perindopril showed dose-dependent neuroprotective effects against MPTP-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) depletion. However, administration of amlodipine showed no significant effects on striatal dopamine depletion after MPTP treatment. In our immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), microtubule-associated protein 2a, b (MAP2), dopamine transporter (DAT), parvalbumin (PV), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), the administration of perindopril significantly attenuated MPTP-induced substantia nigra and striatal damage. This drug also blocked the increases in GFAP-positive astrocytes in the striatum and substantia nigra after MPTP treatment. Furthermore, the administration of perindopril showed a protective effect against the intense Cu/Zn-SOD immunoreactivity in the neurons and glial cells in both the striatum and substantia nigra after MPTP treatment. These results indicated that the ACE inhibitor perindopril can protect against MPTP-induced striatal dopamine and DOPAC depletion in mice. The protective effect may be, at least in part, caused by the reduction of free radicals caused by MPTP. The present study also demonstrated that perindopril is effective against MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway. Furthermore, our results provided further evidence that free radical scavengers may be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",

Patients were followed from onset of nephrotic range albuminuria until death or the end of year 2003.

After one-week placebo run-in period, 60 patients were randomized into two groups, each including 30 patients, to receive either fosinopril or amlodipine for three months. Clinical, echocardiographic examinations and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed at baseline, and after 3 months of therapy. The goal blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mmHg. It was accomplished in more than two thirds of cases (F 76.6%, and A 79.9%), with lower drug doses needed in the group treated with F. In 13 patients goal values were not accomplished, therefore the therapy was prolonged for one additional month, with combination of two drugs. In 10 of these patients (76.9%), adequate regulation of blood pressure was achieved. Both fosinopril and amlodipine efficiently control blood pressure by once-a-day administration, both significantly influencing its circadian rhythm and resulting in regression of myocardial hyperthrophy. Adequate control of blood pressure and beneficial effects on circadian rhythm of blood pressure are achieved with lower doses of fosinopril.",

Cardiac investigations were limited: echocardiogram (20%), exercise treadmill test (20%), cardiac angiogram (21%). In-hospital revascularisation rates were low for those patients with a definite presentation with an ACS (STEMI, non-STEMI, UAP, n=721).

    "474": "Hypertension is associated with reduced coronary vasodilatory capacity, possibly caused by structural changes in the coronary resistance vessels. Because vasodilatory treatment may correct abnormal structure better than nonvasodilating treatment, we compared whether long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has a greater effect on coronary reserve and cardiovascular structure than beta-blockade in patients with essential hypertension. Thirty previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind design to treatment for 1 year with either perindopril (4 to 8 mg per day, n=15) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg per day, n=15) and furthermore compared with normotensive controls. Cardiac output and left ventricular mass were measured with echocardiography and resistance artery structure was determined in vitro. Using positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion (MP) was determined at rest and during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia while still on medication. Perindopril reduced left ventricular mass by 14+/-4% (P<0.01), peripheral vascular resistance by 12+/-6% (P<0.01), and media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio of resistance arteries by 16+/-4% (P<0.05), whereas atenolol had no effect. Resting MP was decreased both by perindopril (-11+/-4%, P<0.01) and by atenolol (-25+/-4%, P<0.01) in parallel to the reduction in rate pressure product. Hyperemic MP was unaltered by perindopril (+2+/-6%, P=NS), but reduced by atenolol (-32+/-5%, P<0.01). Compared with atenolol, perindopril treatment resulted in higher coronary reserve (P<0.05). We conclude that compared with beta-blockade, ACE inhibition increases coronary reserve and results in regression of hypertensive resistance artery structure and left ventricular hypertrophy. Vasodilating may thus be superior to nonvasodilating treatment in repairing the hypertensive myocardial microcirculation.",

We enrolled 40 patients with mild or moderate heart failure and EF >/=45%. They were randomly assigned to carvedilol (n = 19) or conventional therapy (n = 21). After 12 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly improved all end points (plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] from 175 (35 to 209) to 106 (52 to 160) pg/ml, mean (95% confidence interval) p <0.01; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.37 (2.13 to 2.61) to 1.56 (1.21 to 1.91), p <0.01; exercise capacity estimated with the Specific Activity Scale from 4.75 (4.50 to 5.00) to 5.68 (5.22 to 6.14) METs, p <0.02), whereas conventional therapy did not (plasma BNP concentration from 150 (114 to 186) to 174 (100 to 248) pg/ml; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.29 (2.08 to 2.50) to 2.11 (1.73 to 2.49); exercise capacity from 4.57 (4.34 to 4.80) to 4.72 (4.41 to 5.03) METs). Univariate regression analyses showed that only the use of carvedilol was correlated with the decrease in plasma BNP concentration (p <0.03). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that an ischemic cause of heart failure (p <0.02), high plasma concentration of BNP (p <0.02), left ventricular dilation (p <0.03), and use of carvedilol (p <0.04) at baseline were predictive of a decrease in plasma concentration of BNP. In conclusion, carvedilol potentially decreased neurohumoral activation, decreased symptoms, and increased exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and preserved EF.", 
    "477": "Using a highly sensitive fluorimetric assay, significant levels of angiotensin I -converting enzyme-like activity (ACELA) were detected in a range of tissues (branchial heart, gill, kidney with associated vasculature and archinephric duct, liver, whole brain and gut) from the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). The highest ACELA occurred in heart and gill (1.8 and 1.5 nmol His-Leu min(-1) mg protein(-1), respectively). The mammalian angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, at 10(-5) M was a potent inhibitor of the ACELA found in all hagfish tissues. Radioimmunoassay showed that immunoreactive angiotensins (251.8+/-11.8 pM) were detectable in hagfish plasma. The validity of the assay for measurement of hagfish angiotensins was indicated by the parallelism of the angiotensin II standard curve against serially diluted hagfish plasma. Measurement of immunoreactive plasma angiotensins and detection of significant levels of ACELA in a wide range of tissues gives indirect evidence for the presence of a renin-angiotensin system in hagfishes, the earliest evolved group of craniates.", 
    "478": "N-alpha-Tosyl l-arginine methyl ester [TAME]-esterase appears to be an important biochemical marker, which displays potent contractile properties on bronchial tissues and aorta in vitro. TAME-esterase induced contractions have been shown to be mediated via a nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway. TAME-esterase has also been described to be a possible new cardiovascular risk factor among smokers. TAME-esterase has been reported to be an enzyme, which is involved during the sequence of events leading to the activation of the kinin-kallikrein system. Use of aprotinin (a kallikrein inhibitor) as well as aspirin and indomethacin (prostaglandin inhibitors) have shown that there is an inter-dependent relationship between the kinin-kallikrein system and the cyclo-oxygenase pathway involved during the sequence of reactions leading to TAME-esterase induced contractions. Our findings also lend support to the concept of calcium antagonism whereby verapamil, and nifedipine, mimicked in reversible fashion the effects of Ca2+ withdrawal on muscle excitability during TAME-esterase induced contractions on rat aorta in vitro. We concluded that the effects of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on TAME-esterase induced contractions could thus be due to the degradation of bradykinin by the enzyme kininase being blocked. This paper proposes an integrated model of possible biochemical-pharmacological pathways, which involve events leading to TAME-esterase induced contractions. We hypothesize that TAME-esterase induced cough through sensitization of airway sensor nerves in hypertensive patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be inhibited by aprotinin.", 
    "479": "Overweight/obesity represent an underestimated risk factor of renal disease. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) tremendously increased within the last decade. The first sign of renal damage in overweight conditions is microalbuminuria or proteinuria, indicating the potential risk of its progression to renal insufficiency and the development of premature cardiovascular events. In the early stage of obesity renal hemodynamics are characterized by a renal hypercirculation and glomerular hyperfiltration, particularly in the presence of hypertension. The hyperfiltration is especially harmful in patients with pre-existing inflammatory and metabolic renal disease, or under the conditions of reduced renal mass. Histopathologically, ORG is characterized by glomerulomegaly with/without signs of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Pathogenetically, numerous factors are involved, e.g. enhanced glomerular capillary pressure, adrenergic nerve overactivity, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, enhanced clotting tendency and sodium retention. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most serious complications of obesity-induced diabetes. In the industrial nations type 2 diabetes is the single most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. After kidney transplantation, overweight/obesity is associated with a less favourable prognosis for the survival of the graft and the patient. Incidence of renal cell carcinomas is enhanced in overweight/obesity. Obesity-related renal disease may be prevented/postponed by an early weight reduction, by dietary intervention combined with physical exercise. In the advanced stages of renal disease benefits of weight reduction are minimal. Concomitant administration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers exerts antiproteinuric effects and thereby aid in retarding the disease progression. Aimed prevention and treatment of obesity represent a challenge for the healthcare system. The concerted action of physicians, patients and the public health authorities is needed.", 
    "480": "A characteristic feature of a majority of chronic renal diseases is their progressive course. The speed of deterioration of renal function depends besides an aetiology of a primary disease on the level of systemic (and glomerular) blood pressure and a degree of proteinuria. Angiotensin II plays an important role in the use of hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic factors of progression. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensin antagonists comparable with other hypertensives used in blood pressure control have more substantial renoprotective effects both in diabetic and nondiabetic kidney diseases. A prerequisite of an effective renal protection is reaching the target blood pressure corresponding with present European and American recommended values < or = 130/80 mm Hg. The least risk of chronic renal disease progression is when systolic blood pressure is 110-120 mm Hg and in proteinuria plain 1 g/24 hod. A practical implementation of renal protection is difficult in patients with renal insufficiency in spite of the used combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin antagonists and other antihypertensives.",

Here, we describe two patients who developed severe proteinuria after renal transplantation, despite effective blood pressure control with an ACE inhibitor. Histological changes were consistent with IgA-nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Both patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin in addition to pre-existing ACE inhibition. This regimen led to a significant and long-lasting reduction of proteinuria. Our data suggest that low-molecular-weight heparin possesses strong renoprotective properties, thus confirming previous data from experimental nephropathies.

However, we also noticed a significant rise in serum creatinine by 49% concomitant with the use of ACEI (the baseline concentration was 99.75 +/- 9.9 um/L, while the level after 10 days was 148.97 +/- 19.8 umol/L, p=0.005).", 
    "505": "It has been reported that the concentrations of both pyrraline and pentosidine, well-characterized advanced glycation end products, are increased in the urine of diabetic patients. To determine factors that influence the urinary excretion of pyrraline or pentosidine, we compared pyrraline or pentosidine concentrations with glycemic-control indexes, urinary albumin excretion, and urinary beta2-microglobulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted in 39 age-matched healthy control subjects and 50 diabetic patients, including 22 patients with normoalbuminuria, 15 with microalbuminuria, and 13 with macroalbuminuria. Both urinary pyrraline and pentosidine were measured in early-morning urine specimens with the use of high-pressure liquid chromatography. The urinary pentosidine concentration was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects (P <.01). In contrast, the urinary pyrraline concentration was significantly lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects (P <.001). Urinary pentosidine concentrations were greater in diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria and microalbuminuria than in those with normoalbuminuria. However, urinary pyrraline concentrations were significantly lower in diabetic patients with advanced nephropathy. Both the hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and the preceding year's mean HbA(1c) were lower in patients with macroalbuminuria than in those with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. Urinary pyrraline, but not pentosidine, showed a significantly positive correlation with the preceding year's mean HbA(1c) (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis disclosed that urinary beta-2-microglobulin was independently correlated with the urinary concentrations of pentosidine and pyrraline (P <.05 for both). We conclude that the urinary concentration of pentosidine is greater in diabetic patients with overt nephropathy, whereas the urinary pyrraline concentration is significantly lower in diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. Because urinary pyrraline is more directly influenced by glycemia than by pentosidine, the difference in glycemic control among diabetic patients with various grades of nephropathy may be responsible for a dissociation between urinary pyrraline and pentosidine concentrations in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "506": "Plasmin is an important factor in the degradation of extracellular matrix. In the study reported here we examined the expression of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (uPAR), as well as the relevance of such expression to the production of type IV collagen, a major component of extracellular matrix, in the renal tissue of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Because angiotensin II is involved in the synthesis of PAI-1 and uPA, we also examined the effect of benazepril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, on the expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and type IV collagen protein. Rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes-some untreated and some treated with 30 mg/L benazepril-and nondiabetic control rats were sacrificed at 4, 12, or 24 weeks after induction of diabetes. We examined the expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs through the use of in situ hybridization and that of type IV collagen by means of immunohistochemical methods. In control rats, we detected weak signals for PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs in glomeruli. Diabetic rats exhibited high levels of expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs and type IV collagen protein, mainly in mesangial cells. These mRNAs were synthesized in various renal cells (epithelial, mesangial, and endothelial cells and Bowman's capsule). Benazepril inhibited increases in all 3 mRNAs, especially in the mesangium; reduced type IV collagen expression; and attenuated mesangial expansion. Our results indicated that altered expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR in diabetic nephropathy was associated with mesangial expansion and that the beneficial effects of ACE-I may be at least associated with such expression.", 
    "507": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis and worsening of heart failure (HF). Blocking this system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with HF and left ventricular dysfunction reduces mortality and morbidity and these drugs are currently recommended as standard therapy. A more recently developed class of drug, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the RAS at the receptor level, and may therefore provide more complete blockade. ARBs, either singly or in combination with ACE inhibitors, are currently being compared to either ACE inhibitor therapy alone or to placebo in randomized trials of patients with or at high risk of developing HF. With respect to large trials published to date directly comparing ARB versus ACE inhibitor therapy, neither the Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study (ELITE II) nor the Optimal Trial in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (OPTIMAAL) found differences in mortality or morbidity between the treatment groups. As regards combination ARB/ACE inhibitor therapy versus ACE inhibitor therapy alone, one completed study, the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT), found no differences in mortality but a decrease in HF-related hospitalizations in the combined therapy group. Four additional long-term trials (VALIANT, CHARM, ONTARGET, and TRANSCEND) should complete the totality of evidence regarding the role of ARBs in the treatment of HF. Since genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolizing enzymes or drug receptors are known to influence responses to drugs, exploration of these effects on treatment responses to ARBs and ACE inhibitors may provide for more targeted treatment of HF.", 
    "508": "In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is potentially cleaved from angiotensin I by chymase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the normal state, ACE regulates angiotensin II formation and plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure, whereas chymase is stored in mast cells and has no angiotensin II-forming activity. Chymase is activated immediately upon its release into the extracellular matrix in vascular tissues after mast cells have been activated by local stimuli such as vessel injury by grafting or a balloon catheter. In dog grafted veins, vascular proliferation, chymase activity, angiotensin II concentration and mRNA levels of fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III were significantly increased after the operation, while they were significantly suppressed by a chymase inhibitor. A clinical trial of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for preventing restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was successful, but that of an ACE inhibitor was not. After balloon injury in dog vessels, chymase activity was signifcantly increased in the injured artery, and a chymase inhibitor and an ARB were effective in preventing the vascular proliferation, but an ACE inhibitor was ineffective. On the other hand, a chymase inhibitor, unlike an ACE inhibitor and an ARB, did not affect blood pressure. These reports indicate that local angiotensin II production by chymase is involved only in the intimal hyperplasia seen in the injured vessels. Therefore, chymase inhibitors may be useful for preventing vascular disoders without affecting blood pressure.", 
    "509": "Before it gets to the development of manifest atherosclerotic lesions, all known risk factors primarily induce functional alterations in the vascular wall, namely in endothelial cells. Being termed endothelial dysfunction or endothelial activation, this condition is characterized by an altered availability of nitric oxide (NO). Under physiological conditions, NO is of unequivocal importance for the regulation of vascular homeostasis. Endothelium-derived NO released abluminally increases soluble guanylat cyclase activity in smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing relaxation and consequently vasodilatation. Intraluminally, NO inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules both on endothielial cells and neutrophils, thus preventing the adherence of cellular elements to the vascular wall. Furthermore, NO has antithrombotic effcts by inhibiting platelet aggregation and directly infuencing the synthesis of different factors involved in the coagulation cascade. Finally, in the long term, NO has been shown to exert antiproliferative properties. NO is generated intracellularly from L-arginine via NO-synthase with the help of several cofactors, including tetrahydobiopterin. Interestingly, it has recently become evident that under certain conditions, when there is a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin, NO-synthase produces reactive oxygen species instead of NO. Reactive oxygen species counteract the effects of NO and also scavenge NO resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO). Peroxynitrite has been shown to have deleterious effects with respect to vascular function. The aim of the current review is to elucidate recent progress regarding the pathophysiological understanding of endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, the significance of this condition for the evaluation and prognosis of patients is discussed. Finally, current therapeutical strategies in the treatment and improvement of endothelial dysfunction are highlighted.", 
    "510": "Elevated peripheral vascular tone has been proposed as one of the detrimental factors causing increased cardiac after load and reduced exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). A number of studies have shown impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in limb resistance and conduit vessels in CHF, suggesting that this is one of the important etiologies of vascular dysfunction. Several clinical trials have shown that pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or aldosterone receptor antagonists, significantly improves prognosis in this disorder. However, the relationship between the clinical utility of this type of drug and its pharmacological effects on the peripheral vasculature has not been extensively assessed in patients with CHF. The present review summarizes recent reports including our own observations on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of this type of drug on vascular endothelial function in the peripheral vasculature in human CHF.", 
    "511": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) is the main effector peptide in the renin-angiotensin system. It is generated by the activation of Angiotensin I through the Angiotensin II Converter Enzyme (ACE II). ANG II has multiple physiologic effects that regulate vascular tone, hormone secretion, tissue growth and neural activity. It has systemic (endocrine) and local (paracrine and autocrine) effects, favoring cell growth and differentiation through four types of receptors from which types 1 and 2 (AT(1) and AT(2)) are the most important. Stimulation of AT(1) leads to the activation of intracellular pathways that finally lead to vasoconstriction, inflammation and proliferation. The AT(2) receptor is mainly expressed in fetal tissue and scantly in the cardiovascular system under different circumstances. Its effects are opposite to those of the AT(1). The stimulation of AT(1) activates second messengers that lead to a rapid production of diacylglycerol and 1-4-5-inositol triphosphate, as well as to the activation of C protein. Several reports indicate that ANG II can induce neovascularization in experimental systems due to the expression of different growth factors such as angiopoietin 2, vascular endothelial factor, and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta and epidermal growth factor. Other mechanisms associated with ANG II induced angiogenesis are nitric oxide synthase and metalloproteinase expression, as well as inflammation induction. Angiogenesis is a fundamental process to tissue repair and development, and it participates in several pathologic processes. In addition, the AT(1) receptor is expressed in many malignant neoplasms and its blockade through ECA II inhibitors and ANG II antagonists has shown antineoplastic activity as well as angiogenesis inhibition in tumoral experimental models. This review discusses the mechanisms by which ANG II participates in neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue angiogenesis and its possible therapeutic implications.", 
    "512": "Various cardiovascular risk factors and disease states similar to those present in type 2 diabetic patients also seem to be present in non-diabetic individuals. This cluster of risk factors has been called syndrome X, also known as metabolic cardiovascular syndrome or insulin resistance syndrome. Vascular wall components changes, including endothelial dysfunction and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation, could be involved in the cardiovascular alterations associated with this state. Fructose fed rats (FFR) provide a model of dietary-induced insulin resistance, which has been used to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms of the metabolic and cardiovascular changes associated to the syndrome X. FFR have hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (altered glucose tolerance test) and hypertriglyceridemia; they also develop moderate hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. This has been confirmed in male rats of different strains, such as Wistar and Sprague-Dawley, chronically fed with a 60% fructose-chow or 10% fructose in the drinking water. At different levels of the cardiovascular system, FFR exhibit changes in the nitric oxide generation system and in primary cultured proliferation of VSMC from conduit and resistance arteries. These abnormalities were normalized by long-term treatment with pharmacological agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-AT(1) receptor antagonists, that also lowered blood pressure to control levels and reversed cardiac hypertrophy. Evidence suggests an important role for the RAS in the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this model of syndrome X. Furthermore, beneficial pharmacological intervention seems to be mediated by AT(2) receptors and kinins.", 
    "513": "In diabetes oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications, and an early step of such damage is considered the development of an endothelial dysfunction. Hyperglycemia directly promotes an endothelial dysfunction inducing process of overproduction of superoxide and consequently peroxynitrite that damages DNA and activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This process, depleting NAD+, slowing glycolysis, ATP formation and electron transport, results in acute endothelial dysfunction in diabetic blood vessels and contributes to the development of diabetic complications. Classic antioxidants, like vitamin E, failed to show beneficial effects on diabetic complications probably due to their only \"symptomatic\" action. It is now evident that, statins, ACE inhibitors, AT-1 blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazolinediones have a strong intracellular antioxidant activity, and it has been suggested that many of their beneficial ancillary effects are due to this property. Statins increase NO bioavailability and decrease superoxide production, probably interfering with NAD(P)H activity and modulating eNOS expression. ACE inhibitors and AT-1 blockers prevent hyperglycemia-derived oxidative stress modulating angiotensin action and production. This effect is of particular interest because hyperglycemia is able to directly modulate cellular angiotensin generation. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and their subsequent intracellular translocation. Thiazolinediones bind and activate the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor of ligand-dependent transcription factors. The inhibition of this receptors lead to inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase and consequently reduction of peroxynitrite generation. This preventive activity against oxidative stress generation can justify a large utilization and association of this compound for preventing complications in diabetic patients, where antioxidant defences have been shown to be defective.", 
    "514": "Since Kerr described programmed cell death (apoptosis) as a process distinct from necrosis, there have been many studies of apoptosis in disease, especially of immunological origin. Because cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells, they have typically been assumed to die exclusively by necrosis. However, during the last decade this view has been challenged by several studies demonstrating that a significant number of cardiac myocytes undergo apoptosis in myocardial infarction, heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and immune rejection after cardiac transplantation, as well as in other conditions of stress. These are potentially relevant observations, because apoptosis--unlike necrosis--can be blocked or reversed at early stages. Specific inhibition of this process may confer a considerable degree of cardioprotection, but requires a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recent progress includes a better understanding of the importance of mitochondria-initiated events in cardiac myocyte apoptosis, of factors inducing apoptosis in heart failure and during hypoxia, and of the dual pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects of hypertrophic stimuli such as beta-adrenoceptor agonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nitric oxide and calcineurin. The investigation of cytoprotective and apoptotic signal transduction pathways has revealed important new insights into the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, extracellular signal regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in cardiac cell fate. Our present review focuses on the intracellular signal transduction pathways of cardiac myocyte apoptosis and the possibility of specific inhibition of the process.", 
    "515": "The peptide hormone angiotensin II is well established to play an endocrine role in the regulation of blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In addition to its hemodynamic function, recent studies have shown that numerous tissues and organs contain their own locally generated angiotensin products (angiotensin II, III, IV and Ang 1-7) and they exhibit their respective activities. Such an intrinsic angiotensin-generating system renders to specific tissue function of our body, frequently via the regulatory mechanism of a paracrine, autocrine or intracrine manner. These tissues and organs include, to name but a few, the brain, bone marrow, adipose, epididymis, carotid body, liver, and pancreas. This local system has been shown to be responsive to various stimuli of physiological and pathophysiological importance. Moreover, the locally generated angiotensin peptides have multiple and novel actions including cell growth, anti-proliferation, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species generation, hormonal secretion, pro-inflammatory, and pro-fibrogenic actions, as well as vasoconstriction and vasodilatation. Notwithstanding the emerging roles of angiotensin II in various tissues and organs, the physiological significance and ultimately the clinical relevance remain largely undefined. Future target for these new functions by making use of specific renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor blockers either in mono-therapy or in combination, could be of clinical importance. The current review is to focus on some of the new functions arising from the locally formed angiotensin II in tissues and organs, with particular attention to its emerging roles in the liver and the pancreas.",

    "520": "Large Arteriovenous Fistulae (AVF) can increase cardiac output. This may result in the development of congestive heart failure, a clinical situation associated with increased activity of Vasoconstrictor neurohormonal systems: the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the Endothelin system and Arginine vasopressin (AVP). At the same time there is compensatory activation of systemic and vasodilating systems: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and Nitric oxide (NO). Previous data from our laboratory and other groups suggest that urinary sodium excretion in this situation is largely determined by the balance between two antagonistic hormonal systems: the vasoconstrictor/sodium-retaining factors such as RAS, endothelin, and SNS, and vasodilatory/natriuretic substances such as ANP and NO. In decompensated patients, enhanced activities of the sodium-retaining systems overwhelm the effects of vasodilatory/natriuretic systems, which lead to a net reduction in sodium and water excretion. For compensation to occur, the effects of natriuretic mechanisms must prevail over those of the opposing systems, resulting in renal sodium/water excretion. This notion is supported by clinical and experimental studies where pharmacological intervention corrected the imbalance present in AVF. Thus, a shift in the balance in favor of natriuresis may be achieved either by increasing the activity of natriuretic factors or reducing the influence of the antinatriuretic systems. Based on that, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II (ATII) blockers may be beneficial in the management of patients with large AVF.", 
    "521": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21 amino acid peptide originally purified from conditioned medium of cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells. It is now known that there are three endothelin genes in the human genome (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 genes). ET-1 and ET-2 are both strong vasoconstrictors, whereas ET-3 is a potentially weaker vasoconstrictor compared to the other two isoforms. Besides being a very potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1 also acts as a mitogen on the vascular smooth muscle and thus it may play a role in the development of vascular diseases. There is evidence that impaired auto-regulation of blood flow is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy. It is known that the ability of the diabetic's circulation to distribute blood is affected, especially during increased blood flow. In most tissues this causes no serious burden, but three tissues are usually susceptible to disturbance. They are the retina, renal cortex, and peripheral nerves. Retinal vascular auto-regulation is defined as the ability of the blood vessels to keep blood flow constant under varying perfusion pressure in order to match it to tissue oxygen and metabolic requirements. The failure of auto-regulation is an important and often early feature of diabetic retinopathy. Since human retina vessels lack extrinsic innervation, retinal vessel calibre and local blood flow are normally regulated by non-nervous mechanisms intrinsic to the retina. There is now a considerable body of evidence suggesting that retinal pericytes are the main regulators of vascular tone in the retinal capillaries because they contain components of contractile proteins similar to vascular smooth muscle cells and because they also possess ET-1 receptors. Furthermore. ET-1 has been shown to cause vasoconstriction of retinal vessels as well as to have mitogenic effects on retinal pericytes. Hence, alterations in the pericyte-ET interaction may have a role causing early hemodynamic and histopathological abnormalities found in diabetic retinopathy. On the contrary, Chakrabarti et al. demonstrate that retinas from the chronic diabetic BB/W rats (6 months) show an increase in ET-1, ET-3, ET(A) receptor and ET(B) receptor mRNA expressions when compared to those from control rats. Similar results are noted by them using immunohistochemical methods. Finally, an increased ocular, and retina tissue levels of ET-1 in diabetic rats have also been reported by Chakravarthy et al., as well as by Takagi et al. All of these findings suggest that endothelins may also be involved in the pathogenesis of more advanced diabetic retinopathy, such as capillary occlusion and subsequent neovascularization. This review summarizes the reported literature on the role of ET-1 in the development of diabetic retinopathy.",

When each of the transfusions was stopped, the blood pressure recovered. In Patient B, hypotension occurred during the transfusion of non-LR ANH whole blood.

    "526": "Post-transplant hypertension remains a significant risk factor for graft loss, but whether or not specific blood pressure (BP) medications affect graft outcome is still unknown. We assessed the interaction between BP control and antihypertensive drugs on graft outcome. We retrospectively examined clinic BP data for 1662 renal transplant (RTx) patients, transplanted between 1994 and 2000 at our centre. The analysis examined all patients who received central alpha-agonists and peripheral alpha-antagonists, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). BP recordings during treatment were categorized for each agent. Thus, a particular BP could be categorized for multiple medications. A total of 1462 patients (pts) (88%) were Caucasian and 800 pts (46%) received cadaveric RTx. There were 10.6+/-6.8 BP measurements for each patient post-RTx. CCBs, alone among the classes of antihypertensive drugs evaluated, reduced the risk for graft loss (RR: 0.736; P=0.035) in the overall analysis. Interestingly, stratifying levels of BP control unmasked a beneficial effect on graft survival of ACEI/ARB therapy in individuals with higher levels of systolic (>152 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (>98 mmHg) treated with ACEI/ARBs compared to individuals treated with CCBs (P<0.01 for each). Thus, stabilizing BP is important post-RTx. CCBs are associated with improved rates of graft survival. Their role in a compromised RTx, however, deserves further study. ACEI/ARBs have clear benefits, improving graft survival in individuals with elevated systolic blood pressure and proteinuria. CCBs are not as efficacious in this setting.", 
    "527": "Systolic blood pressure is a major cardiovascular risk factor which is often associated with arterial stiffness. Markers of arterial stiffness, such as pulse pressure and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, have been proved independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. Recent evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the pathogenesis of systolic hypertension and arterial stiffness. Outcome trials have shown impressive cardiovascular protection by reducing systolic blood pressure (BP) with drug treatment. However, in clinical practice systolic hypertension remains largely uncontrolled, first, because systolic BP goal is more difficult to be reached than diastolic and, second, because physicians are often reluctant to intensify treatment in patients with systolic BP close to 150 mmHg. Recent trials have focused on the effects of antihypertensive drugs not only on blood pressure, but also on pulse pressure and pulse-wave velocity. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and more recently angiotensin receptor blockers, has been shown to provide beneficial effects on arterial stiffness that appear to be independent of their antihypertensive effects. Recent outcome trials have shown significant cardiovascular protection with angiotensin receptor blockers. These drugs have an excellent placebolike profile of adverse effects which is maintained when these drugs are combined with low-dose diuretics. Therefore, an angiotensin receptor blocker-based treatment strategy appears to be an attractive and evidence-based approach for the management of systolic hypertension, the reduction of arterial stiffness and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

However, it has not yet been clarified which type of PG receptors has a major role in inflammatory exudation. To examine in vivo role of PG receptors in inflammatory exudation, we induced pleurisy in PG receptors (IP, EP1, EP2, EP3, or EP4) knockout mice by intrapleural injection of carrageenin. Pleural exudate accumulation in wild-type (WT) mice at 1 to 5 h, but not at 24 h, was significantly attenuated by the pretreatment with indomethacin, indicating that PGs are responsible for exudate formation at the early phase of pleurisy. Pleural exudation at 1 to 5 h in IP, EP2, or EP3 knockout mice, but not in EP1 and EP4 knockout, was significantly reduced compared with in WT mice. In the exudates, 6-keto-PGF1alpha and PGE2 were detected as the major PGs, each with its peak concentration at 3 h. In addition, involvement of bradykinin in the phenomenon was suggested by the fact that captopril, a kininase inhibitor, enhanced the exudate formation and increased the amount of 6-keto-PGF1alpha and PGE2 and that a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist inhibited the exudate formation. In contrast, leukocyte migration into pleural cavity was not influenced by indomethacin-treatment nor by these receptor deficiencies. These results demonstrate participation of EP2 and EP3 along with IP in pleural exudate formation but not in leukocyte migration in carrageenin-induced mouse pleurisy.", 
    "541": "The mechanisms by which alcohol causes pancreatic fibrosis remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II contributes to the development of fibrosis in liver, kidney, and heart injury. Here, the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan) on alcohol-induced pancreatic fibrosis were examined in an intragastric ethanol-feeding model. Male rats were fed a high-fat liquid diet with either ethanol (16-20 g/kg/day) or isocaloric maltose-dextrin (control) for 4 weeks. Subgroups daily received captopril (60 mg/kg/day), losartan (3 mg/kg/day), or no additional agent included in liquid diets. Mean urine alcohol concentrations in all groups fed ethanol were more than 270 mg/dl and not significantly different. Dietary alcohol caused diffuse gland atrophy and interlobular and intralobular fibrosis with mild structural distortion in the pancreas, an effect that was blunted by captopril or losartan treatment. Alcohol also increased the number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA expression in the pancreas. These increases were blunted significantly by captopril or losartan treatment. These data suggest that angiotensin II contributes to the development of chronic alcohol-induced pancreatic fibrosis through its stimulation of transforming growth factor-beta expression.",

The analyte and internal standard were extracted from the plasma samples by solid-phase extraction using Waters HLB Oasis SPE cartridges and chromatographed on a C8 analytical column. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/water (60:40, v/v) + 20 mM acetic acid + 4.3 mM of triethylamine. The method had a chromatographic total run-time of 6.5 min and was linear within the range 2.00-200 ng/ml. Detection was carried out on a Micromass triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The precision (CV%) and accuracy, calculated from limit of quantification (LOQ) samples (n = 8), were 8.9 and 98.9%, respectively. The method herein described was employed in a bioequivalence study of two tablet formulations of Lisinopril 20mg.", 
    "543": "The effects of the combined use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1RA) valsartan on apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL in the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephritic glomerulosclerosis was investigated. Uninephrectomy and the injection of adriamycin induced the rat model of glomerulosclerosis. Benazepril (6 mg/kg), valsantan (20 mg/kg), or benazepril (3 mg/kg) plus valsantan (20 mg/kg) was respectively delivered daily by gavage to the rats in three treatment groups for 12 weeks. Apoptosis was examined by means of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect the expression of Fas and FasL. Software of pathological analysis quantitated the levels of Fas and FasL. The results showed that as compared with those in the control group, the kidneys in the model group had more severe glomerulosclerosis, much more apoptotic cells and higher levels of expression of Fas and FasL. The degree of glomerulosclerosis, the number of apoptotic cells and the levels of expression of Fas and FasL were reduced by benazepril and valsartan. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan had the best therapeutic effect. It was concluded that benazepril and valsartan could suppress the excessive apoptosis of kidney cells by lowering the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL, so as to postpone the process of glomerulosclerosis. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan has better therapeutic effect.",

This article reviews the new and important information regarding the epidemiology, biology, and management of Kaposi sarcoma that was published in the last year.", 
    "545": "Worldwide Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) seropositivity has been found to exceed the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma. Therefore, investigators have justifiably implicated other cofactors (eg, blood-sucking arthropods, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, hemodialysis, and iron) in the development of Kaposi sarcoma. In the transplant setting, Kaposi sarcoma lesions have been shown to originate from the engraftment of donor tumor cells. The detection of HHV8 in Kaposi sarcoma lesions has provided a new diagnostic tool to help differentiate Kaposi sarcoma from its mimics. Kaposi sarcoma lesional cells, now confirmed to be of lymphatic origin, have been shown to express several chemokine receptors, some of which may help explain the predilection for skin. Regression of Kaposi sarcoma has been characterized histologically for the first time. The finding that some tumor cells can remain in an atrophic state even in completely regressed lesions suggests that they have the potential to recur. Protease inhibitor-based and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based HAART regimens have been verified to be similarly effective. Although antiretrovirals have been noted to favorably alter the clinical characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma favorably, they seem not to alter the natural history of this disease. In the HAART era, because CD4 cell count was shown no longer to provide prognostic information about AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, the traditional classification system for staging AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma has been refined. Also, a new staging system for classic Kaposi sarcoma has been proposed.", 
    "546": "Numerous advances have emerged regarding Kaposi sarcoma during the last year, many of which still need to be translated into clinically useful information. The results of new clinical trials involving antivirals purposely directed against HHV8 and antiretrovirals for HIV-uninfected people are anticipated. Finally, although investigators during this period did provide us with additional potential therapeutic targets, more novel approaches such as RNA interference and gene therapy have been also proposed as options in the future management of Kaposi sarcoma.",

Compared with previous trials, the Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance in Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial enrolled patients with more advanced heart failure and high prevalence of intravenous inotropic therapy. This study analyzes, on a post hoc basis, outcomes in patients undergoing inotropic infusions at randomization.", 
    "548": "Of 129 patients randomized, 91 were receiving intravenous inotropic therapy at randomization to LVAD or optimal medical management (OMM). Mean systolic pressure was 100 versus 107 mm Hg in those not receiving inotropes, serum sodium was 134 versus 137 mEq/L, and left ventricular ejection fraction was 17% for both groups. LVADs improved survival throughout follow-up for patients undergoing baseline inotropic infusions (P=0.0014); for the LVAD group versus the OMM group, respectively, 6-month survival was 60% versus 39%, 1-year survival rates were 49% versus 24%, and 2-year survival rates were 28% versus 11%. For 38 patients not undergoing inotropic infusions, 6-month survival was 61% for those with LVADs and 67% for those with OMM, whereas 1-year rates were 57% and 40%, respectively (P=0.55). Quality-of-life scores for survivors improved. Median days out of hospital for patients on inotropic therapy at randomization were 255 with LVAD and 105 with OMM.", 
    "549": "Despite severe compromise, patients undergoing inotropic infusions at randomization derived major LVAD survival benefit with improved quality of life. Patients not undergoing inotropic infusions had higher survival rates both with and without LVAD, but differences did not reach significance. Future studies should prespecify analyses of inotropic and other therapies to determine how disease severity and parallel medical treatment influence the benefits offered by mechanical circulatory support.",

    "551": "In-hospital resuscitation continues to have a low success rate. Biphasic waveform devices have demonstrated characteristics that might improve survival, and outside the hospital, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have shown promise in improving survival of patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest.", 
    "552": "A program including education and replacement of all manual monophasic defibrillators with a combination of manual biphasic defibrillators used in AED mode and AEDs in all outpatient clinics and chronic care units was implemented.", 
    "553": "With program implementation, the percentage survival of all patients with resuscitation events improved 2.6-fold, from 4.9% to 12.8%. Factors independently predicting survival included event location outside an intensive care unit, younger age, an initial rhythm of pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), pre-arrest beta-blocker, and program initiation. The outcome was independent of gender, race, work shift, number of previous resuscitation attempts, body mass index, comorbidity index, presence of diabetes, presence of hypertension, or use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The improvement in mortality was attributable solely to an effect on patients presenting with VT/VF. Patients with these initial rhythms were 14-fold (odds ratio = 0.07 of death, confidence interval = 0.02 to 0.3) more likely to survive to discharge after program initiation. Automated external defibrillators performed similarly to biphasic manual defibrillators in AED mode.",

    "555": "The role played by several vasoactive mediators that are synthesized and released by the pulmonary vascular endothelium in the regulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) remains unclear. As a potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II could be involved. We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by enalaprilat and type 1 angiotensin II receptor blockade by candesartan would inhibit HPV.", 
    "556": "HPV was evaluated in anaesthetized dogs, with an intact pulmonary circulation, by examining the increase in the Ppa-Ppao gradient (mean pulmonary artery pressure minus occluded pulmonary artery pressure) that occurred in response to hypoxia (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.1) at constant pulmonary blood flow. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II immunoreactivity were measured to determine whether activation or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system was present.", 
    "557": "Administration of enalaprilat and candesartan did not affect the Ppa-Ppao gradient at baseline or during hypoxia. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II immunoreactivity increased during hypoxia, and subsequent measurements were consistent with effective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after administration of enalaprilat, and with angiotensin receptor blockade after administration of candesartan.", 
    "558": "These results suggest that, although the renin-angiotensin system was activated in hypoxia, angiotensin II is not normally involved in mediating acute HPV.", 
    "559": "Some combinations of antihypertensive agents were shown to reduce proteinuria in patients with renal failure. However, preventive effects of such combinations on renal structure and function are presently unknown when treatment is administered before the onset of renal abnormalities. We thus investigated the long-term effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril)/diuretic (indapamide) combination (per/ind) in the Zucker rat, a classical model of chronic renal failure associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Two-month-old lean and obese Zucker rats, presenting normal renal structure and function at this young age, received per/ind (0.76 + 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day) or the vehicle of this combination by daily gavage. After 8.5 consecutive months of treatment, those 10.5-month-old rats were used for determination of renal structural and functional parameters which were examined using standard renal clearance experiments and kidney tissue analysis. Per/ind prevented focal and segmental glomerular hyalinosis and tubulo-interstitial damage in obese rats. Treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in several staining markers of glomerular and interstitial fibrosis. The hypertrophy of superficial glomeruli and the mesangial expansion of deep glomeruli observed in control rats were reduced in per/ind-treated obese rats. The severe proteinuria observed in 10.5-month-old control obese rats was prevented by per/ind, while glomerular filtration and renal hemodynamic parameters reached similar values to those obtained in lean animals. These results show that long-term treatment with this ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination protects renal structure and function in the obese Zucker rat, emphasizing the potential efficiency of such therapy in renal failure prevention.", 
    "560": "Most heart failure patients are older adults. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with systolic heart failure. However, the annual mortality rate in patients with systolic heart failure receiving ACE inhibitors is about 12%. Beta-blockers further reduce mortality rate by an additional 35% to 65%. Because of potential adverse effects, the rate of beta-blocker use is likely to be low in older adults with systolic heart failure. In this article, we review the findings of the major beta-blocker trials in systolic heart failure and discuss the potential benefits and adverse effects of beta-blockers, along with various practical aspects of their use in older adults with systolic heart failure. Subgroup analyses of these trials suggest that the survival benefits of beta-blockers observed in the main trials are also observed in persons 65 years of age and older. However, data are limited for heart failure patients 85 years of age and older. About half of the older adults with heart failure do not have systolic heart failure, and currently there is no evidence that beta-blockers also improve survival in these patients. Beta-blockers might play a beneficial role in heart failure patients without systolic heart failure by reducing high blood pressure, high heart rate, or myocardial ischemia, conditions known to impair ventricular relaxation. Adequate knowledge of the commonly used beta-blockers, along with careful patient selection and close monitoring for adverse effects will allow safe initiation and continuation of beta-blocker use for older adults with systolic heart failure. It is likely that lower doses of beta-blockers are as effective as higher doses.",

After 4 weeks high-dose treatment, patients were given either 1 days double-blind active therapy or placebo (that is, missed dose). Following a further 2 weeks active treatment, a cross-over was performed: patients who had previously received 1 days placebo received active therapy and vice versa. At baseline and after the two active or missed doses, 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring was performed. Data from the studies were pooled, as prospectively planned and analyzed using the intent-to-treat population.",

Last 6 h mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by 11.1 mm Hg with telmisartan compared with 9.1 mm Hg with valsartan (P=0.0066). After a missed dose, 24 h mean DBP was reduced by 7.2+/-6.5 mm Hg with telmisartan (n=437) compared with 5.5+/-6.2 mm Hg with valsartan (n=431) (P=0.0004). The reduction in 24 h mean SBP after a missed dose was 10.7 mm Hg with telmisartan and 8.7 mm Hg with valsartan (P=0.0024). Absence of treatment-by-study interaction indicated that pooling of studies was appropriate. All 24 hourly mean reductions in DBP and SBP were greater for telmisartan than valsartan. Both treatments were well tolerated.",

The subsequent histopathological findings allowed the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Although XGP is rare at this age, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with renal mass, either with or without associated urolithiasis, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers. The long-standing mainstay of therapy for diffuse XGP has been nephrectomy. However, we report the successful preservation of renal mass with partial nephrectomy for diffuse XGP.

Clinical trials demonstrate that lowering blood pressure can substantially reduce cardiovascular risk, and current clinical practice guidelines identify lowering blood pressure as a priority in the treatment of people with hypertension and set clear treatment targets. In addition to lifestyle modifications, which should be pursued in all patients, a large number of antihypertensive drugs and combinations of such drugs are part of the modern treatment armamentarium. Following the publication of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), some investigators and clinicians have suggested that thiazide diuretics should be the first drug of choice for the treatment of all hypertensive patients. However, antihypertensive drugs differ greatly in their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic properties and side effects. There are also large variations among hypertensive patients with regards to the pathophysiology of their blood pressure elevation, response to individual antihypertensive drugs, comorbidities and propensity to drug-related side effects. Therefore, a uniform formula for the treatment of hypertension is not likely to achieve optimal results. Rather, treatment strategies based on careful, comprehensive and individualized patient assessments should be pursued.", 
    "596": "A number of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials have clearly established that blood pressure (BP) lowering, based on all antihypertensive drugs studied, lowers the risk of all major BP-related cardiovascular events. However, this does not exclude that some antihypertensive agents are more or less effective in preventing cardiovascular events than to be expected from the extent of BP lowering. Indeed, clinical trials of thiazide diuretics using 'high' doses demonstrated marked prevention of strokes, but little to no prevention of coronary events. Subsequent studies using thiazides at 'lower' doses showed prevention of both strokes and coronary events. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers exert direct vascular effects which may inhibit atherosclerosis and prevent cardiovascular events, in addition to their benefits related to BP lowering. After the publication of the results of Heart Outcome Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, this concept has become widely accepted for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, placebo-controlled trials, such as HOPE and, recently, the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA), are confounded by the difference in BP and its impact on outcome. Indeed, as a mirror image of these trials, the blacks subgroup in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) exhibited a 4 to 5 mmHg higher systolic BP on ACE inhibitor as compared with the diuretic, associated with 19% higher combined cardiovascular disease and 40% higher stroke rate. Recent overviews of randomized clinical trials comparing outcomes with different antihypertensive drug classes concluded that outcome benefits beyond BP lowering remain unproven.",

This criterion includes patients with BP >160/100 mm Hg and diabetics with hypertension. The goal BP for persons with diabetes mellitus is <130/80 mm Hg. A randomized, double-blind trial force titrated initial combination therapy utilizing an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination (losartan/hydrochlorothiazide [LOS/HCTZ]) compared with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), for 8 weeks, and tested the hypothesis that combination therapy is more likely to achieve goal BP vs. monotherapy. At 4 weeks, 30.5% of LOS/HCTZ and 14.4% of ramipril recipients achieved goal diastolic BP (p<0.001). More participants achieved goal systolic BP in the ARB/HCTZ group at 4 weeks (29.8% vs. 14.4%; p<0.001). At 4 weeks, mean diastolic BP had decreased 10.2+/-7.4 mm Hg in the LOS/HCTZ group compared with 6.4+/-6.8 mm Hg in the ramipril group (p<0.001), and systolic BP had fallen 15.4+/-13.1 mm Hg in the ARB/HCTZ compared with 9.2+/-10.2 mm Hg in the ACE-inhibitor group (p<0.001). Significant differences favoring the combination were also noted at 8 weeks. Drug-related adverse experiences were 10.3% for the combination compared with 12.7% for the monotherapy group. Initial combination therapy with an ARB/HCTZ was more effective than ACE-inhibitor monotherapy in achieving BP goals in participants with diabetes with no significant differences in the incidence of adverse experiences. These observations confirm other studies of combination therapies, such as b blocker/diuretic, ACE inhibitor/diuretic, or ACE inhibitor/calcium channel blocker. The use of two medications will achieve goal BP in more patients than monotherapy. This observation is important in treatment of high-risk patients with diabetes.", 
    "610": "In patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) demonstrated the superiority of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in blunting progression of renal disease compared with a b blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. In addition, the study found that a blood pressure treatment strategy that resulted in an achieved blood pressure of 128/78 mm Hg (low blood pressure goal) was no more effective in slowing the progression of renal disease than a strategy that resulted in a blood pressure of 141/85 mm Hg (usual blood pressure goal). AASK, which enrolled only African Americans with mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency, also provided an opportunity to evaluate recruitment methods in minority populations. Eighty-three percent of patients were recruited through screening in clinical practice. To randomize 635 patients, 558,295 charts were reviewed (approximately 879 charts per randomized patient). More than half of the randomized patients (n=635 or 58%) were found by chart review. Sixty percent of women with creatinine levels considered within the normal range had at least mild chronic renal insufficiency. Screening in clinical practice was the most effective strategy to recruit participants with mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension into the clinical trial. This technique may also be an effective approach in trials of other essentially asymptomatic conditions.", 
    "611": "The goal of this study was to determine the dependence of the acute hypertensive response to a novel model of acute psychosocial stress on the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity were measured with telemetry in mice for a 1-h period and averaged 98 +/- 1 mmHg, 505 +/- 3 beats/min, and 5 +/- 1 counts, respectively. Stress was induced by placing a mouse into a cage previously occupied by a different male mouse, and this increased MAP, HR, and activity in the control group by 40 +/- 2 mmHg, 204 +/- 25 beats/min, and 68 +/- 6 counts, respectively. Each variable gradually returned to baseline levels by 90 min after beginning cage switch. Pretreatment with terazosin (10 mg/kg ip) significantly reduced the initial increase in MAP to 12 +/- 6 mmHg, whereas MAP for the last 45 min was superimposable on control values. Atenolol (10 mg/ml drinking water) had no effect to blunt the initial increase in MAP but had a growing effect from 10 min onward, decreasing MAP all the way to baseline by 60 min after starting cage switch. Captopril (2 mg/ml drinking water) treatment caused a very similar response. All three treatments significantly decreased the area under the blood pressure curve, and the blood pressure effect could not be attributed uniformly to effects on HR or activity. These data suggest that our novel model of psychosocial stress causes an initial alpha(1)-receptor-dependent increase in MAP. The later phase of the pressor response is blocked similarly by a beta(1)-receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor, independent of HR, suggesting that the beta(1)-dependent blood pressure effect is due, in large part, to the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "612": "Heart failure is a major public health concern for which treatment options have continued to evolve. While specific therapies such as beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to decrease hospitalizations and improve survival, the benefits of anticoagulation are less clear. Clinical guidelines detailing the appropriate use of anticoagulation for the management of atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke exist, but similar recommendations for their use in isolated cardiac dysfunction are lacking. Epidemiologic studies have documented increased risk of thrombus formation and stroke occurrence in patients with cardiomyopathy that is inversely related to ejection fraction. However, it remains at the clinician's discretion to determine at what degree of left ventricular dysfunction the potential benefits of stroke reduction outweigh the risks of undesirable bleeding with anticoagulation. This paper summarizes the pathophysiology of thrombus formation in heart failure patients; reviews previous studies and current recommendations for anticoagulation; provides a clinical rationale for anticoagulation when conclusive data are lacking; and discusses ongoing clinical trials designed to clarify these issues.", 
    "613": "Two endothelium-derived factors, endothelin (ET), a vasoconstrictor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic factor are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of an angiotensin II type I (AT-1) receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor on the pathogenesis of VEGF and ET-1-mediated kidney disease in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Two days after STZ administration, diabetic rats were treated for 8 weeks with enalapril maleate, an ACE inhibitor, candesartan cilexetil, an AT-1 receptor antagonist, or saline. Urinary albumin and N-acetyl beta-D glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion as well as the VEGF protein content in the kidney were all found to be elevated in diabetic rats. Administration of enalapril maleate or candesartan cilexetil decreased the level of microalbuminuria and NAG excretion in diabetic rats. Administration of enalapril maleate also suppressed the elevated renal VEGF protein content in these animals while candesartan cilexetil treatment had no effect. Serum ET-1 and VEGF levels were unchanged by these treatments. These data support a role for AT-1 receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy, and suggest that the former may work by reducing renal VEGF levels.", 
    "614": "We reported previously a novel mode of action of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II; ACE) inhibitors mediated through the direct activation of bradykinin B(1) receptor, independent of endogenous kinins or ACE (J Biol Chem 277:16847-16852, 2002). We aimed to further clarify the mechanism of activation of B(1) receptor, which leads to prolonged nitric oxide (NO) release. The ACE inhibitor enalaprilat and the peptide ligand desArg(10)-kallidin (in nanomolar concentrations) release NO by activating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in bovine and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in stimulated human endothelial cells. The peptide and the ACE inhibitor ligands activate eNOS by facilitating different signaling pathways. DesArg(10)-kallidin enhances inositol-phosphate generation and elevates [Ca(2+)](i) by first augmenting intracellular release and then the influx of extracellular Ca(2+). In contrast, enalaprilat stimulates only the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) through rare earth-sensitive channels, and its effect is blocked by cholera toxin or protein kinase C inhibitors. In addition, unlike desArg(10)-kallidin, enalaprilat can also release NO independent of Ca(2+) in bovine endothelial cells. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma induce both B(1) receptor and iNOS in human endothelial cells. In contrast to eNOS, B(1) ligands activate iNOS similarly. Both desArg(10)-kallidin and ACE inhibitors enhance arginine uptake and release NO independent of [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. This is the first report on the direct activation of B(1) receptor by ACE inhibitors in human endothelial cells. This interaction leads to prolonged NO release and possibly contributes to the documented benefits of the use of ACE inhibitors.",

    "619": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers could prevent the development of atherosclerosis beyond reducing blood pressure in monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet. However, it has been unclear whether hypotensive effects improve atherosclerosis in primates. We investigated whether antihypertensive agents, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, prevent areas of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet. Seventeen male monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet for 6 months were grouped as follows: a high-cholesterol diet group (n=5), a candesartan-treated group (1 mg/kg per day, n=6) and an amlodipine-treated group (5 mg/kg per day, n=6). Candesartan and amlodipine showed a similar hypotensive effect by decreasing the systolic blood pressure approximately 20 mmHg, while these agents did not affect serum cholesterol levels. The ratio of atherosclerotic area to total area in thoracic aorta was significantly decreased by treatment with candesartan, but the ratio tended to be decreased by treatment with amlodipine. Although the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in plasma was not changed by treatment with candesartan or amlodipine, the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the thoracic aorta was obviously reduced by treatment with candesartan, but not with amlodipine. Therefore, a blockade of angiotensin II action rather than a hypotensive effect may play an important role in preventing the development of atherosclerosis in primates.",

Five-Sixths-nephrectomized rats were assigned to receive TMP (10 mg/kg/day) (TMP group), TMP plus DOX (2 mg/kg/day) (TMP+DOX group), or vehicle (control group) orally for 12 weeks. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary excretion of albumin (UalbV) in the control group progressively increased during the experimental period and were significantly higher than in sham-operated rats. Treatment with either TMP or TMP plus DOX had similar antihypertensive effects in this rat model. Twelve weeks after initiation of treatment, the SBP values in the control, TMP, and TMP+DOX groups were 265+/-8, 157+/-4, and 163+/-3 mmHg, respectively, in comparison with 233+/-4 mmHg in sham-operated rats (p<0.0001 control vs. sham, p<0.001 TMP vs. control, p<0.001 TMP+DOX vs. control). UalbV, serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio were significantly lower in the TMP and TMP+DOX groups than in the control group (UalbV: p<0.05; Scr: p<0.01; [BUN, HW/BW ratio]: p<0.0001; and [UalbV, Scr, BUN, HW/BW ratio]: p<0.0001 vs. control, respectively). The index of glomerular sclerosis (IGS) and relative interstitial volume (RIV) were significantly lower in the TMP+DOX group than in the control group (IGS: p<0.05; RIV: p<0.01). Especially, UalbV, IGS, and RIV were significantly better in the TMP+DOX group than in the TMP group ([IGS, RIV]: p<0.05; UalbV: p<0.01). These results suggest that simultaneous administration of TMP and DOX provides greater renoprotective effects than administration of TMP alone.", 
    "621": "Recent studies have indicated that both endothelin (ET) and angiotensin (Ang) II stimulate oxidative stress, which contributes to the development of hypertension. Here, we examined the effects of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in ET-dependent hypertension. Chronic ET-1 infusion (2.5 pmol/kg/min, i.v., n=7) into rats for 14 days increased systolic blood pressure from 113+/-1 to 141+/-2 mmHg. ET-1-infused rats showed greater plasma renin activity (8.1+/-0.8 Ang I/ml/h), and greater Ang I (122+/-28 fmol/ml) and Ang II levels (94+/-13 fmol/ml) than vehicle (0.9% NaCl)-infused rats (3.1+/-0.6 Ang I/ml/h, 45+/-8 and 47+/-7 fmol/ml, respectively, n=6). Angiotensin converting enzyme and AT1 receptor expression in aortic tissues were similar between the vehicle- and ET-1-infused rats. Vascular superoxide anion (O2-) production and plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels were greater in ET-1-infused rats (27+/-1 counts per minutes [CPM]/mg dry tissue weight and 8.9+/-0.8 micromol/l, respectively) than vehicle-infused rats (16+/-1 CPM/mg and 5.1+/-0.1 micromol/l, respectively). The ET-1-induced hypertension was prevented by simultaneous treatment with a new AT1 receptor antagonist, olmesartan (0.01% in chow, 117+/-5 mmHg, n =7), or hydralazine (15 mg/kg/day in drinking water, 118+/-4 mmHg, n=6). Olmesartan prevented ET-1-induced increases in vascular O2- production (15+/-1 CPM/mg) and plasma TBARS (5.0+/-0.1 micromol/l). Vascular O2- production and plasma TBARS were also decreased by hydralazine (21+/-1 CPM/mg and 7.0+/-0.3 micromol/l, respectively), but these levels were significantly higher than in vehicle-infused rats. These data suggest that ET-dependent hypertension is associated with augmentation of Ang II levels and ROS formation. The combined effects of the elevations in circulating ET-1 and Ang II, as well as the associated ROS production, may contribute to the development of hypertension induced by chronic ET-1 infusion.",

Carvedilol was shown to be well tolerated and effective in elderly heart failure patients in the observational COLA II study. In the FOSIDIAL study of patients with end-stage renal disease, fosinopril showed no benefit over placebo in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in these high-risk patients. The BETACAR study showed that carvedilol and metoprolol produced a similar effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (+13.1% and +12.0%, respectively). Revised mortality data for the CASINO study and a meta-analysis of the effects of cardiac resynchronisation therapy on mortality in the light of the recently published COMPANION study are reported.", 
    "633": "In 1994, we reported a cross-sectional survey of acute heart failure admissions to a city centre hospital serving a multiethnic population and found ethnic differences in aetiological factors and short-term (in-patient) mortality. We analysed long-term mortality data for this original survey cohort after 8 years' follow-up. At 8 years' follow-up, the total mortality was 90.5% amongst Europeans and 87.0% amongst non-Europeans (log rank test, P=0.0705). The non-European patients had significantly better survival at all time points until 6 years, after which the survival curves start to converge. In univariate analysis, age <75.6 years (that is, the median age of the whole cohort), use of beta-blockers, use of ACE inhibitors, and absence of atrial fibrillation were significantly associated with increased survival. In addition, patients who had had an echocardiographic examination had significantly prolonged survival when compared to those who did not. Using a Cox multiple regression analysis, age, renal impairment, atrial fibrillation, absence of echocardiography, absence of beta-blockers or ACE inhibitor use (and not ethnicity) remained significant predictors of mortality at 8 years. While this follow-up study has suggested that survival following admission for acutely decompensated heart failure is not different between different ethnic groups when corrected for age, it is clear from the younger age of heart failure patients from ethnic minority groups and the relatively high prevalence, that the burden of heart failure is greater in these populations. Future observational and therapeutic trials in heart failure should include sufficient numbers of participants from ethnic minority groups to ensure that the results can be applied to the population at risk.", 
    "634": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy does not reliably suppress aldosterone production, and 'aldosterone escape' occurs in up to 40% of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Aldosterone levels correlate with the risk of cardiovascular events. Aldosterone adversely affects the risk of cardiovascular events via mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart, blood vessels and other sites. Notably, aldosterone contributes to endothelial dysfunction and attenuates endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, at least partly by reducing nitric oxide bioavailability. Aldosterone also promotes myocardial fibrosis and cardiac remodelling by enhancing collagen synthesis, resulting in increased myocardial stiffness and increased left ventricular mass. These mechanisms mediated by aldosterone contribute to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Two major prospective trials, including one in which patients routinely received ACE inhibitor and beta blocker therapy, have shown that the use of an aldosterone blocker significantly reduces all-cause mortality, sudden cardiovascular death and hospitalisation in patients with acute or chronic left ventricular dysfunction or CHF. Inhibition of aldosterone's effect on mineralocorticoid receptors should now be considered standard therapy in these patient populations.", 
    "635": "The integration between arterial and ventricular function has been studied by mostly invasive techniques. We considered assessing the influence of various antihypertensive medications on arterial-ventricular coupling (AVC) with the use of a non-invasive echocardiographic method.", 
    "636": "A total of 9037 patients, who had been under treatment for essential arterial hypertension were studied echocardiographically at baseline prior to therapy and after 6 months of antihypertensive monotherapy (diuretics, beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), beta-blockers with ISA, a-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIRA), non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists). The AVC was calculated by echocardiographic measurements based on the equation: AVC=ESV/SV (ESV, end systolic volume; SV, stroke volume).", 
    "637": "ACEI, AIIRA, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists decreased (P<0.0001 for all) while diuretics, alpha-blockers, both beta-blocker groups, and non-dihydropyridines increased significantly the AVC values compared to baseline measurements (P<0.0001 for all, except P=0.02 for alpha-blockers). Changes in AVC were the most highly correlated with changes in EF (r=-0.979, P<0.0001).", 
    "638": "Various antihypertensive drugs have a differential effect on AVC with ACEI, AIIRA, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists having the most favorable effect on this index. AVC provides a meaningful index of cardiovascular performance in hypertension and offers the possibility of wide employment and serial follow-up in large numbers of patients because of its completely non-invasive nature.", 
    "639": "Large clinical trials have provided evidence of prognostically beneficial treatment strategies for patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, the implementation of this evidence into routine clinical practice is suboptimal. We hypothesised that the speciality of the attending physician (cardiologist or not) would affect the use of evidence-based strategies.", 
    "640": "Over a 3-month period (1st September to 30th November 1995), 3684 consecutive potential cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 20 adjacent hospitals in the Yorkshire Region were identified from coronary care registers, clinical coding and biochemistry records of cardiac enzyme assay requests. There were 2153 consecutive cases of AMI identified, of which 1643 patients were alive at discharge. We compared the admission use of aspirin and thrombolysis, and the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins at discharge between cardiologists and other physicians.", 
    "641": "AMI patients under the care of cardiologists are more likely to receive aspirin and thrombolysis on the day of their event and to be prescribed aspirin, beta-blockers and statins on discharge. After correction for contraindications to their use, the above findings were broadly confirmed.", 
    "642": "Cardiologists are more likely than general physicians to use evidence-based treatment strategies recognised to improve AMI patient outcome. It is likely that this will translate into a reduction of mortality or other hard endpoints in patient outcomes.", 
    "643": "Silent ischemia is highly prevalent among patients with ischemic heart disease and is associated with a poor prognosis in moderate/high risk outpatients who either exhibit exercise- or pharmacological-induced myocardial ischemia, or in those patients who demonstrate silent ischemia following an acute coronary syndrome. Pharmacotherapy, including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, calcium channel antagonists and antiplatelet agents, have all demonstrated a reduction in silent ischemia and an improvement in cardiac prognosis. The management of patients with ischemic heart disease is currently based on patients' report of anginal symptoms: documentation of silent ischemia, usually using ambulatory electrocardiography, is not incorporated into the routine management of coronary artery disease. Yet studies comparing ambulatory electrocardiography with exercise testing have shown these tests to be complementary. We review the evidence concerning the prognostic value of ambulatory electrocardiography for monitoring silent ischemia and the prognostic value of attenuating silent ischemia. Mitigation of silent ischemia improves cardiac prognosis and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring before and after treatment of silent ischemia can play a valuable role in the management of coronary artery disease.", 
    "644": "Genetic factors may influence the response to antihypertensive medication. A number of studies have investigated genetic polymorphisms as determinants of cardiovascular response to antihypertensive drug therapy. In most candidate gene studies, no such drug-gene interactions were found. However, there is observational evidence that hypertensive patients with the 460 W allele of the alpha-adducin gene have a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke when treated with diuretics compared with other antihypertensive therapies. With regard to blood pressure response, interactions were found between genetic polymorphisms for endothelial nitric oxide synthase and diuretics, the alpha-adducin gene and diuretics, the alpha-subunit of G protein and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and the ACE gene and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists. Other studies found an interaction between ACE inhibitors and the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism, which resulted in differences in AT(1) receptor mRNA expression, left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness between different genetic variants. Also, drug-gene interactions between calcium channel antagonists and ACE I/D polymorphism regarding arterial stiffness have been reported. Unfortunately, the quality of these studies is quite variable. Given the methodological problems, the results from the candidate gene studies are still inconclusive and further research is necessary.",

    "646": "All consecutively hospitalized patients who were dismissed from Olmsted County, Minnesota, hospitals between 1979 and 1998 with a diagnosis of MI were identified using standardized criteria (biomarkers, cardiac pain, and electrocardiography). The entire community medical record, available via the Rochester Epidemiology Project, was reviewed to ascertain baseline characteristics including comorbidity, presence of ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography, and treatment. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of treatment with age and sex, independent of other baseline characteristics.", 
    "647": "Between 1979 and 1998, 2317 incident MIs (patient mean +/- SD age, 67+/-14 years; 43% women; 57% aged > or = 65 years) occurred in Olmsted County. The use of all evidence-based therapies increased over time, primarily reflecting the introduction of these medications at the time of Index MI. Between 1989 and 1998, age was not independently associated with use of aspirin or ACE inhibitors. Disparities in use persisted for reperfusion therapy and beta-blockers. Reperfusion therapy or revascularization was used less frequently in older persons, particularly in elderly women (P<.001). Use of beta-blockers decreased 16% among persons aged 65 years or older, independent of measurable differences in baseline characteristics and MI severity (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.93).", 
    "648": "The use of all evidence-based therapies for MI increased markedly over time; however, residual gaps in use were noted. Reperfusion therapy or revascularization is used less frequently in women and elderly persons, and beta-blockers are used less frequently in elderly persons. These differences are not explained by measurable differences in baseline characteristics. Women and elderly persons represent an increasing proportion of patients with MIs in the community; therefore, these findings define therapeutic opportunities.",

    "650": "Animal and human studies unequivocally show that sympathetic activation characterizes the hypertensive state and participates in the development, maintenance and progression of elevated blood pressure values. Evidence has also been provided that elevated sympathetic cardiovascular influences are involved in the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular hypertrophy and atherogenesis, as well as in the occurrence of metabolic disarray (i.e. metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance), which frequently accompany the hypertensive state. Antihypertensive drugs with confirmed sympathoinhibitor effects are represented by beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. In the case of the latter two classes of antihypertensive compounds the sympathoinhibitory effects have been shown to be associated with beneficial metabolic and cardiovascular effects, a finding that supports the use of these drugs in complicated hypertension.", 
    "651": "Investigation of the adrenergic effects of antihypertensive drugs has had a significant impact on cardiovascular pharmacology and hypertension treatment. Although remarkable progress has been made on this topic in recent years, future studies aimed at assessing the sympathetic effects of combination drug treatment will be helpful in improving the clinical use of the association of two or more drugs in hypertension treatment.", 
    "652": "Our aim is to review the association between blood pressure and stroke and analyse data from randomized controlled trials involving diverse therapies, especially those regarding the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, an overview of stroke pathogenesis is given and its relationship with treatment action mechanisms reviewed.", 
    "653": "Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide. In addition, many survivors of stroke suffer different degrees of disability. Because of the ageing of the global population, especially in regions of rapid economic growth, stroke will remain the second leading cause of death and in terms of disability it will be among the five most important causes in both developing and developed countries. High blood pressure is the most important risk factor for stroke, either ischemic or haemorrhagic, and established hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor. Data from controlled trials of blood-pressure-lowering treatment have demonstrated that treatment considerably lowers the risk of stroke within a few years of starting treatment. However, there exists controversy about the most efficient treatment regimen for primary and secondary prevention of stroke among the different blood-pressure-lowering treatments.", 
    "654": "Debate rages as to whether the benefits of treating high blood pressure are simply determined by the quality of blood-pressure control, or whether the choice of drug therapy adds or detracts from the expected benefits of blood-pressure reduction. The desirable future interventional comparative studies should consent to determine specific effects of drug classes on cardiovascular risk in the absence of the confounding effect of a relevant blood-pressure reduction that may counteract the potential blood-pressure-independent benefits of specific drug classes.", 
    "655": "To review the influence of antihypertensive therapy on the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to renal perfusion in essential hypertension.", 
    "656": "The contribution of endothelium-derived NO to renal perfusion can be examined in detail by studying isolated glomerular arterioles and by immunohistochemical techniques. Only few functional studies in human arterial hypertension exist analysing the role of NO for renal perfusion and the change in renal NO bioavailability due to arterial hypertension and its modification by antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "657": "NO critically contributes to renal perfusion. There is evidence of reduced but also of unchanged NO bioavailability in the renal vasculature of patients with arterial hypertension both from protein expression and functional studies. In particular, drugs interacting with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists) and third-generation beta blockers are promising candidates to improve renal endothelial function. It is not yet clear whether these specific effects translate into prevention of nephrosclerosis.", 
    "658": "1. Myocardial infarction (MI) poses a significant risk for sudden cardiac death. The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockade in attenuating unfavourable post-MI outcomes indicates an important role for angiotensin (Ang) II signalling in the post-MI remodelling process. 2. AT1 and AT2 receptor expression is known to be altered during the early postinjury period and at the later failure stage in the infarcted heart. The aim of the present investigation was to characterize AngII receptor expression shifts in the intermediate, adaptive phases of post-MI hypertrophic remodelling. 3. The present study investigated relative cardiac AT1 and AT2 receptor expression levels using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GAPDH normalized) in rats at 4 and 20 weeks after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 4. Heart weight and normalized heart weight were significantly higher in the MI group than in the sham group 4 weeks post-MI, with significant hypertrophy of the left ventricle, left atrium and right ventricle in MI rats. At 20 weeks post-MI, left ventricular hypertrophy remained significant, whereas the mass of the other cardiac tissues was not different to that of sham controls. 5. AT2 receptor expression was markedly reduced in both the non-infarct and infarcted areas of the left ventricular wall in the MI group compared with the sham-operated group 4 weeks after surgery. Expression levels were reduced to 8 and 13% of sham values in the viable and scar tissue regions, respectively. By 20 weeks post-MI, there was no evidence of AT2 receptor expression suppression in the left ventricle. No significant relative changes in AT1 receptor mRNA levels were observed at either 4 or 20 weeks post-MI. 6. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, a selective downregulation of left ventricular AT2 receptor expression in the intermediate phase of post-MI ventricular remodelling in the rat. This downregulation may provide an enhanced AT1 receptor-mediated compensatory progrowth signal in the early adaptive post-MI growth phase. A more detailed understanding of the time-course of differential AT1 and AT2 receptor expression regulation post-MI may potentially identify an optimal window for targeted pharmacological intervention in the treatment of MI.",

Eight therapeutic areas involving 10 drug classes were targeted (antihistamines, nasal steroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs, including celecoxib and rofecoxib], antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and statins). The subject medical group was an independent, nonacademic, ambulatory, primary care medical practice of 65 primary care physicians consisting of 50 internists, 14 pediatricians, and 1 family practitioner. Drug costs were measured as net medical group costs per enrolled member per year (PMPY), the product of the average cost per prescription, and the number of prescriptions PMPY.",

Utilization as measured by prescriptions PMPY did not change in the national data comparison over the 2-year observation period and increased by 4.0% in the medical group. The national average cost per prescription claim increased 31.2% in 1999 compared with a decrease of 2.1% in the medical group. The decrease in average drug cost in this medical group was associated with an increase in the use of preferred drugs, including more generic drugs.",

    "665": "We studied 25 patients with acute anterior MI who had undergone coronary reperfusion therapy, and 10 normal control subjects with no cardiac disease. In all patients, LV ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) were determined using left ventriculography at the acute phase and 6 months after onset. The delta EDVI and delta ESVI were calculated as the value of LV volume reduction, suggesting LV reverse remodeling. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", 
    "666": "Serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha at the acute phase were significantly higher in patients with MI than in control subjects (both p < 0.05). The IL-6 levels correlated well negatively with delta EDVI (r = 0.779, p = 0.039), whereas no correlation was found for TNF-alpha. According to multivariate analysis, IL-6 at the acute phase was a significant independent predictor for LV remodeling after reperfused MI (p = 0.007).", 
    "667": "Circulating IL-6 levels correlated closely with LV geometric changes during the remodeling process in patients with reperfused MI. Our study addresses the usefulness of another marker for LV remodeling after MI.", 
    "668": "Several clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) are equally effective in the treatment of chronic heart failure. However, this has not been confirmed for acute cardiac dysfunction. We examined whether ACEI or ARB prevents isoproterenol-induced acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dogs. LV dysfunction induced by a large dose of isoproterenol (1 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), 3-h infusion) was compared in dogs treated with ACEI (temocaprilat) or ARB (olmesartan). Atrial pacing induced a constant heart rate and use of adjustable aortic banding provided a nearly constant afterload. LV systolic function (LV dP/dt, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction) and diastolic function (tau and LV end-diastolic pressure) were significantly deteriorated after isoproterenol infusion. The LV dysfunction was almost totally prevented by ARB but was only partially prevented by ACEI. The partial effect of ACEI was complemented by cotreatment with HOE-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. At baseline, the response to low doses of isoproterenol was significantly attenuated by ACEI but not by ARB, and the ACEI-induced attenuation was totally abolished by cotreatment with HOE-140. The response to isoproterenol was significantly attenuated after 3 h of excess isoproterenol loading, and it was almost completely preserved by ARB but not by ACEI. In conclusion, acute LV dysfunction and beta-adrenergic desensitization induced by excess isoproterenol administration were almost totally prevented by ARB but only partially prevented by ACEI. These differences were attributable at least in part to bradykinin pathways activated by ACEI administration in acute LV dysfunction.", 
    "669": "A new second-order-derivative spectrophotometric method using zero-crossing technique measures quinapril (QUI) and hydrochlorothiazide (HYD) in 2-component mixtures. The procedure does not require prior separation of components from the sample. QUI was determined at a wavelength of 211.6 nm (zero-crossing wavelength point of HYD). Similarly, HYD was measured at 270.8 nm (zero-crossing wavelength point of QUI ). Calibration graphs were constructed over the concentration range of 4.0 to 24.0 microg/mL for QUI and 2.5 to 15.0 microg/mL for HYD. Detection and quantitation limits were 0.85 and 2.5 microg/mL for QUI and 0.12 and 0.4 microg/mL for HYD, respectively. The accuracy (recovery 100.5-102%), precision (relative standard deviation less than 3.5% for QUI and 1.5% for HYD), selectivity, and sensitivity of the elaborated methods were satisfactory. The proposed method was applied successfully for the determination of both drugs in QUI-HYD tablets.", 
    "670": "The discrete and continuous wavelet transforms were applied to the overlapping signal analysis of the ratio data signal for simultaneous quantitative determination of the title subject compounds in samples. The ratio spectra data of the binary mixtures containing benazepril (BE) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) were transferred as data vectors into the wavelet domain. Signal compression, followed by a 1-dimension continuous wavelet transform (CWT), was used to obtain coincident transformed signals for pure BE and HCT and their mixtures. The coincident transformed amplitudes corresponding to both maximum and minimum points allowed construction of calibration graphs for each compound in the binary mixture. The validity of CWT calibrations was tested by analyzing synthetic mixtures of the investigated compounds, and successful results were obtained. All calculations were performed within EXCEL, C++, and MATLAB6.5 softwares. The obtained results indicated that our approach was flexible and applicable for the binary mixture analysis.",

A plateau effect was reached with C16 and L20. Systolic BP on the combination of C16 + L20 was lower than on each monotherapy (C16, 3.8 mmHg [p=0.002]; C32, 6.4 [0.0003]; L20, 2.9 [0.05]; L40, 3.3 [0.003]). The additional fall in BP with the combination appeared to be due to recruitment of non-responders, rather than to an additive effect in most patients. All treatments reduced microalbuminuria to a similar extent. The combination was well tolerated and there was no deterioration in renal function.", 
    "674": "When patients are on a plateau dose of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, addition of the other drug class has a small but significant incremental effect on BP in the overall group. However, some patients respond better to one drug class than to the other and this may explain the results. This study lends no support to the use of these two drugs in combination to treat hypertension.", 
    "675": "Although multiple antihypertensive agents are required to control blood pressure (BP) in chronic renal disease, it remains undetermined whether the combination therapy with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) plus calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) confers more preferable action on renal disease than the ARB monotherapy. In the present study, we compared the effect of the combination therapy with ARB plus calcium antagonists/ACEI on proteinuria with that of the ARB monotherapy in chronic nondiabetic renal disease. At 1 month of the drug treatment, the candesartan monotherapy (n=19) reduced BP from 154+/-3/93+/-2 to 146+/-3/88+/-2 mmHg (P<0.05), and a similar magnitude of BP reductions was observed with the combination therapy with candesartan plus ACEI/amlodipine (from 153+/-2/95+/-2 to 144+/-2/88+/-2 mmHg, P<0.05, n=39). The depressor action of these therapies was sustained throughout the 12-month treatment. In contrast, the reduction in proteinuria was greater with the combination therapy (-52+/-3% at 12 months, n=39) than with the candesartan monotherapy (-25+/-3%, n=19), although the baseline values of proteinuria were nearly the same in the candesartan monotherapy group (1.74+/-0.22 g/day) and the combination therapy group (2.10+/-0.19 g/day, P>0.2). Of note, the proteinuria-sparing effect did not differ between the candesartan+ACEI group and the candesartan+amlodipine group. In conclusion, the present study suggests more beneficial action of the combination therapy with ARB plus ACEI/amlodipine than the ARB monotherapy in nondiabetic renal disease. Since the reduction in BP was achieved to the same level, the distinct proteinuria-sparing action of these therapies is attributed to BP-independent mechanisms, which should vary depending on the agents used.",

Such patients with advanced-stage disease may be candidates for treatment with the novel agent vesnarinone, a mixed phosphodiesterase inhibitor and ion-channel modifier that has modest, dose-dependent, positive inotropic activity, but minimal negative chronotropic activity. Vesnarinone improves ventricular performance most in patients with the worst degree of heart failure. However, before the initiation of vesnarinone therapy, risk-benefit profiles in individual patients should be considered, because in two large-scale studies [i.e. of the high dosage used in the Vesnarinone Study Group Trial (VSGT), and of both dosages used in the Vesnarinone Trial (VEST)] a dose-dependent increase in mortality was identified for vesnarinone 30-120 mg/day. The two studies also found significant vesnarinone-induced, short-term improvements in quality of life (QOL) in patients with refractory end-stage heart failure. Such patients are the most willing to trade-off a slightly increased risk of mortality for improved QOL. It is thus in these patients with refractory end-stage heart failure that vesnarinone may ultimately establish an important treatment role. However, detailed further investigation of the overall place of vesnarinone in heart failure management, with particular reference to the clinical potential of vesnarinone plus beta-blocker combination therapy, for example, is certainly warranted.", 
    "685": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are effective blood pressure lowering agents, giving rise to a prevalent dilation of the afferent arteriole. Manidipine, a long-lasting dihydropyridine CCB, demonstrates its action not only on the afferent arteriole, but also on the efferent one. This suggests theoretically a renoprotective effect in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD).",

Proteinuria remained unchanged in M (from 1.6+/-1.59 to 1.62+/-1.79 g/24h), and decreased significantly in E (from 1.37+/-1.45 g/24h to 1+/-1.55 g/24h). No significant difference was observed in the rate of renal function decline in the two groups.", 
    "688": "Manidipine was safe and effective, obtaining a significant reduction in SBP and DBP from baseline.

It inhibits the contractile responses to angiotensin II in guinea pig aorta, inhibits the pressor responses to angiotensin II in rats and dogs, and exhibits dose-dependent antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, olmesartan medoxomil provides protection against cardiac and renal damage in animal models. AT1 receptor antagonists are more specific inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system compared with ACE inhibitors. They are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists lack the nonangiotensin-related side effects such as cough and angioedema.",

The baseline drug prescription rate CAD patients were the following: beta-blockers 96%, antiplatelets agents 85%, statines 56%, nitrates 36%, calcium blockers 26% and ACE inhibitors 8.7%. The main changes in patients having undergone PCI were: a significant increase in antiplatelets agents (to 97%), ACE inhibitors (to 29%) and statins (to 94%), a significant decrease in nitrates (to 23%). The calcium blockers rate remains unchanged at 26%. Those results are discussed in the field of evidence based medicine and are compared with data from previous drug prescription studies in post myocardial infarction or in secondary prevention.", 
    "695": "The influence of intracellular and extracellular angiotensin II (Ang II) on the L-type calcium current of cardiomyocytes isolated from cardiomyopathic hamsters was investigated. The results indicated that Ang II (10(-8) mmol/L), added to the bath, increased the peak inward calcium current (I(Ca)) density by 37+/-3.4% (P<0.05), an effect that depends on the activation of protein kinase C. Intracellular administration of the same dose of Ang II (10(-8) mmol/L) also elicited an increase of peak I(Ca) density but enhanced the rate of I(Ca) inactivation, an effect not seen with extracellular Ang II. Moreover, in control animals, no change in the rate of I(Ca) inactivation was seen with intracellular Ang II. Thapsigargin (1 micromol/L), a potent inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase, which depletes the SR, decreased the rate of I(Ca) inactivation elicited by intracellular Ang II, although the cytoplasmic calcium concentration was highly buffered with 10 mmol/L EGTA. These findings might indicate that intracellular Ang II releases calcium from the SR and inactivates I(Ca). The effect of intracellular Ang II on peak I(Ca) was not altered by extracellular losartan (10(-7) mmol/L), supporting the notion that the peptide acted intracellularly. Other studies showed that intracellular Ang I administration (10(-8) mmol/L) enhanced the peak I(Ca) density and the rate of I(Ca) inactivation, an effect that was reduced by intracellular enalaprilat (10(-8) mmol/L). Moreover, intracellular enalaprilat by itself reduced the peak I(Ca) density. These observations might indicate that endogenous Ang II is contributing to I(Ca) modulation in the failing heart.",

Factors associated with ACE inhibitor prescription at discharge and the relationship between ACE inhibitor prescription and death within 1 year were assessed with hierarchical logistic models. Secondary analyses assessed therapeutic substitution with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors were prescribed to only 68% of this ideal cohort, and 76% received either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Patient, physician, and hospital factors were weak predictors of prescription, except for serum creatinine (RR for 133 to 221 micromol/L=0.87, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.89; RR for > or =222 micromol/L=0.53, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.57 compared with < or =132 micromol/L). ACE inhibitor prescription was associated with lower crude 1-year mortality (33.0% versus 42.1%, P<0.001), lower risk of death after adjustment (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.90), and lower mortality regardless of patient gender, age, race, or serum creatinine level.",

    "699": "1. Vasopeptidase inhibition (i.e., the simultaneous inhibition of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase) can ameliorate diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether this nephroprotection is mediated by the bradykinin B2 receptor. 2. In all, 43 obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF/Gmi-fa/fa) rats aged 21 weeks were separated into four groups and treated for 26 weeks with either placebo, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (500 microg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c. infusion), the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 (45 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in chow), or AVE7688 plus icatibant. Nephropathy was assessed as albuminuria at age 31 and 39 weeks, and by histopathologic scoring at the end of the treatment period. 3. All animals had established diabetes mellitus (blood glucose >20 mmol l(-1)) and marked albuminuria at baseline. Blood glucose was not influenced by any treatment. Icatibant alone did not influence albuminuria (8.6+/-1.6 vs placebo 9.5+/-1.3 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). AVE7688 reduced albuminuria at week 31 markedly to 1.1+/-0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) and reduced glomerular and tubulo-interstitial kidney damage at week 47. In the AVE7688 plus icatibant group, proteinuria was significantly higher than in the AVE7688 only group (2.0+/-0.6 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), but still reduced compared to placebo. In addition, icatibant partly antagonized the tubulo-interstitial protection mediated by AVE7688. 4. We conclude that vasopeptidase inhibition provides nephroprotection in rats with type II diabetic nephropathy, which is partly mediated by bradykinin B2 receptor activation.", 
    "700": "The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in people aged over 55 years is 10%-25% and increases with age; 70%-80% of affected individuals are asymptomatic; only a minority ever require revascularisation or amputation. Patients with PAD alone have the same relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes as those with coronary or cerebrovascular disease, and are four times more likely to die within 10 years than patients without the disease. The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is a simple, non-invasive bedside tool for diagnosing PAD - an ABPI less than 0.9 is considered diagnostic of PAD. About half of patients with PAD (defined by an abnormal ABPI) have symptomatic coronary or cerebral vascular disease. The ABPI is an independent predictor of coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with PAD require medical management to prevent future coronary and cerebral vascular events. There are currently insufficient data to recommend routine population screening for asymptomatic PAD using the ABPI.",

    "702": "We simulated the effect of a policy change from a maximum of a 100-day supply of prescription medication to one where only a 34-day supply was allowed. All North Carolina prescription claims from Medicaid enrollees who filled a prescription for at least one of six medication categories during fiscal years 1999 and 2000 were included. The six categories were angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, antiulcers, antipsychotics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and sulfonylureas. The dollar value of the medication wasted, the amount of medication wastage diverted after a change to a shorter prescription length, and the total costs incurred by the increases in prescription refills were calculated.", 
    "703": "For each therapeutic category, 255,000-783,000 prescription drug claims were analyzed. No valid drug claims were excluded for any reason. Although 5-14% of total drug wastage, attributed to switches of drug therapy, could be saved by dispensing a 34-day supply, this saving could not make up for a larger increase in dispensing costs, as consumers would fill prescriptions more often. In addition, reducing the amount of drug dispensed each time may be costly to consumers through increased transportation and other expenses.",

    "705": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most commonly encountered primary glomerulonephritis and it usually follows an indolent clinical course. However, hypertensive patients with proteinuria and renal insufficiency at presentation and patients with severe histological involvement are at high risk to develop end stage renal failure. There is no consensus for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy. In general, patients with normal renal function, mild proteinuria (<I g/24 h) and mild histopathological involvement need only observation, whereas patients with heavy proteinuria, impaired renal function and moderate to severe histopathological involvement are candidates for specific treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used in patients with arterial hypertension and/or proteinuria 1-2 g/24 h. Corticosteroids are indicated in patients with heavy proteinuria (>3 g/24 h) and in progressive disease despite treatment with ACE inhibitors. Fish oil might be an alternative to corticosteroids in cases with renal insufficiency and chronic histological lesions. Combinations of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs are saved for patients with IgA nephropathy and a rapidly progressive course.", 
    "706": "M100240 is an acetate thioester of MDL 100,173-a dual angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor-in phase II development. The pharmacokinetics of M100240 and MDL 100,173 were compared in young and elderly subjects. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 young (ages 18-45 years, 10 male, 2 female) and 12 elderly (ages 65-85 years, 7 male, 5 female) healthy subjects in a parallel-group, open-label study. Following an overnight fast, subjects received a single 25-mg oral dose of M100240. Serial plasma concentrations of M100240 and MDL 100,173 were determined using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with noncompartmental methods. Single-dose treatment with M100240 was well tolerated in both groups of subjects, with no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG recordings, or laboratory safety parameters. M100240 was rapidly absorbed and converted to MDL 100,173, with M100240 concentrations no longer detectable at 3 to 4 hours postdose in both groups. The pharmacokinetics of the pharmacologically active MDL 100,173 were similar for both groups. Although maximum concentrations of M100240 were generally higher in elderly versus young subjects (C(max) 0.48 ng/mL vs. 0.17 ng/mL), systemic availability of M100240 was quite low and variable with plasma, and this apparent difference in parent drug exposure is unlikely to have important clinical implications. No age-related differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of MDL 100,173 (C(max) 8.16 vs. 9.62 ng/mL, t(max) 1.25 vs. 1.5 h, AUC((0-last)) 81.6 vs. 72.2 ng x h/mL) were observed between young and elderly subjects, respectively. In conclusion, there are no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of MDL 100,173 between young and elderly subjects.", 
    "707": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, with the exception of the rare occasion of angioedema. These drugs have demonstrated additional cardiovascular protective effects to their blood pressure lowering, and their combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide potentiates their antihypertensive effectiveness. Moexipril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor suitable for once-daily administration, and like some ACE inhibitors, moexipril is a prodrug and needs to be hydrolyzed in the liver into its active carboxylic metabolite, moexiprilat, to become effective. Moexipril alone and in combination with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in lowering blood pressure and be well tolerated and safe given in single daily doses. In this review, the pharmacological profile of this drug and its clinical usefulness are discussed.", 
    "708": "Vegetables and fruits have been shown to be good sources of antioxidants. Benincasa hispida (wax gourd) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat hypertension and inflammation. The aims of this study were to investigate the abilities of antioxidation and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of wax gourd pulp, core, seed, and peel prepared by different extraction methods. The fresh weights required to reach 50% inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation were higher in fresh extracts, compared to other extraction methods. Fresh weights required to reach 50% inhibition were the lowest in seed. The seed had the lowest Cu2+ -induced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation percentage and inhibition level of ACE activity among all parts. The higher antioxidant capacity of the seed may result from the higher total phenolics contents and superoxide dismutase activity. The abilities of antioxidation and ACE activity inhibition may provide protective effects against cardiovascular diseases and cancers.", 
    "709": "Earlier studies have revealed an improvement of cardiac function in animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction (MI) by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since heart failure is also associated with attenuated responses to catecholamines, we examined the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on the \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) signal transduction in the failing heart. Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery, and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with 1 mg/(kg\u00b7day) (orally) imidapril for 4 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and inotropic responses to isoproterenol. Cardiomyocytes and crude membranes were isolated from the non-ischemic viable left ventricle and examined for the intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) [Ca(2+)]i and \u03b2-ARs as well as adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, respectively. Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function and positive inotropic response to isoproterenol as well as isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i in cardiomyocytes; these changes were attenuated by imidapril treatment. Both \u03b21-AR receptor density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity were decreased in the failing heart and these alterations were prevented by imidapril treatment. Alterations in cardiac function, positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol, \u03b21-AR density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity in the failing heart were also attenuated by treatment with another ACE inhibitor, enalapril and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan. The results indicate that imidapril not only attenuates cardiac dysfunction but also prevents changes in \u03b2-AR signal transduction in CHF due to MI. These beneficial effects are similar to those of enalapril or losartan and thus appear to be due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. (Mol Cell Biochem 263: 11-20, 2004).", 
    "710": "Although the presence of anaemia after renal transplantation is well known, specific data on the prevalence and risk factors are scarce. Results from the recent TRansplant European Survey on Anemia Management (TRESAM) survey, conducted in 4263 recipients of a renal transplant from 72 centres in Europe, revealed that 38.6% of patients were anaemic [haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations < or =13 g/dl for male patients and < or =12 g/dl for female patients]. Of these patients, 11.6% had moderate anaemia (Hb concentrations >11 and < or =12 g/dl for male patients and >10 and < or =11 g/dl for female patients), while 8.5% had severe anaemia (Hb concentrations < or =11 g/dl for male patients and < or =10 g/dl for female patients). A strong association existed between Hb concentration and renal graft function. Of the patients with a serum creatinine level >2 mg/dl (which indicates impaired kidney function), 60.1% were anaemic, compared with 29.0% of those with a serum creatinine level < or =2 mg/dl (P<0.01). Other risk factors for anaemia include therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, the use of azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, kidneys from older donors and recent infections. Furthermore, only 18.8% of patients with severe anaemia were treated with erythropoietic therapy. The findings from the TRESAM survey are in agreement with the results from another recently published study that included 128 renal transplant patients from two centres in the USA, who were followed for 5 years after transplantation. It was found that 30% of patients were anaemic at some point after transplantation. The prevalence increased with time after transplantation, with 26% of patients being anaemic 5 years' post-transplant. A multivariate logistic regression model identified three risk factors for post-transplant anaemia: serum total CO(2), blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. There is an unexpectedly high incidence of anaemia in patients with a functioning renal transplant: around one-third of these patients are anaemic. Most of the evidence suggests that impaired erythropoietin production by the renal allograft is the most important pathogenic factor of post-transplant anaemia. Whether this high incidence of anaemia may be an additional cardiovascular risk factor in renal transplant patients remains to be proven. However, there does not appear to be any reason why anaemic renal transplant recipients should not be treated like any other patients with renal anaemia.",

There are several potential causes and possible therapies for microinflammation, and they are discussed in this review with regard to uraemia and acidosis, heart failure and volume overload, oxidative stress and iron therapy, and bioincompatibility, especially regarding dialysis membranes. In addition, issues regarding dialysate contamination and access site infection are examined, followed by a discussion of possible drug therapy for microinflammation with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, statins, aspirin, and antioxidants, such as vitamin E.",

Because screening is costly, some have suggested that health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures might be useful in focusing screening tests on those patients with cases most likely to display positive findings. This study reports on the predictive ability of HRQL measures to detect patients with abnormalities on serial cardiac testing.", 
    "713": "Using 127 patients from the ACE-Inhibitor after Anthracycline (AAA) Trial, this study compared serial measures of the Short Form-36 (SF-36; for ages > 13 years) and Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF87; for ages < or = 13 years) to serial cardiac performance tests including echocardiographic shortening fraction, left ventricular end systolic wall stress (LVESWS), LVESWS-index, and maximal cardiac index (MCI; a measure of cardiac output at peak exercise).",

For each of these measures, the correlation between MCI was statistically significant (P < .006), but each HRQL subscale could explain no more than 7% of the variation in MCI. HRQL measures were not predictive of any other cardiac function measure.",

    "716": "In the kidney, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is expressed in the macula densa/cTALH and medullary interstitial cells. The macula densa is involved in regulating afferent arteriolar tone and renin release by sensing alterations in luminal chloride via changes in the rate of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransport, and administration of non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors will blunt increases in renin release mediated by macula densa sensing of decreases in luminal NaCl. High renin states [salt deficiency, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretic administration or experimental renovascular hypertension] are associated with increased macula densa/cTALH COX-2 expression. Furthermore, there is evidence that angiotensin II and/or aldosterone may inhibit COX-2 expression. In AT1 receptor knockout mice, COX-2 expression is increased similar to increases with ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor blockers. Direct administration of angiotensin II inhibits macula densa COX-2 expression. Previous studies demonstrated that alterations in intraluminal chloride concentration are the signal for macula densa regulation of tubuloglomerular feedback and renin secretion, with high chloride stimulating tubuloglomerular feedback and low chloride stimulating renin release. When cultured cTALH or macula densa cells were incubated in media with selective substitution of chloride ions, COX-2 expression and prostaglandin production were significantly increased. A variety of studies have indicated a role for COX-2 in the macula densa mediation of renin release. In isolated perfused glomerular preparations, renin release induced by macula densa perfusion with a low chloride solution was inhibited by a COX-2 inhibitor but not a COX-1 inhibitor. In vivo studies in rats indicated that increased renin release in response to low-salt diet, ACE inhibitor, loop diuretics or aortic coarctation could be inhibited by administration of COX-2-selective inhibitors. In mice with genetic deletion of COX-2, ACE inhibitors or low-salt diet failed to increase renal renin expression, although renin significantly increased in wild type mice. In contrast, in COX-1 null mice there were no significant differences in either the basal or ACE inhibitor-stimulated level of renal renin activity from plasma or renal tissue compared with wild type mice. In summary, there is increasing evidence that COX-2 expression in the macula densa and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb cells is regulated by angiotensin II and is a modulator of renal renin production. These interactions of COX-2 derived prostaglandins and the renin-angiotensin system may underlie physiological and pathophysiological regulation of renal function.", 
    "717": "Renal vascular resistance is increased in essential hypertension, as in genetic models of hypertension. Here we review the evidence that this is at least in part due to structural changes in the afferent arterioles. Rat studies show that the renal afferent arteriole is structurally narrowed in young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Furthermore, in the second generation of crossbred SHRs/normotensive rats (SHR/WKY F(2)-hybrids), a narrowed afferent arteriole lumen diameter at 7 weeks is a predictor of later development of high blood pressure. The reduced lumen diameter of resistance vessels is accompanied by a decrease in media cross-sectional area in SHR and could therefore be due to inhibited growth. Evidence from a primate model of hypertension has shown a negative correlation between left ventricular hypertrophy and afferent arteriole diameter, but apparently no relation to blood pressure. In SHR, the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is mediated through renal vascular mechanisms, while ACE inhibitors (like AT(1) antagonists) have a more persistent effect on blood pressure after treatment withdrawal compared with other antihypertensive drugs. Taken together, the evidence suggests that structural narrowing of the renal afferent arteriole could be an important link in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension, at least in the SHR.", 
    "718": "In the RAS (renin-angiotensin system), Ang I (angiotensin I) is cleaved by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) to form Ang II (angiotensin II), which has effects on blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis. We have examined the kinetics of angiotensin peptide cleavage by full-length human ACE, the separate N- and C-domains of ACE, the homologue of ACE, ACE2, and NEP (neprilysin). The activity of the enzyme preparations was determined by active-site titrations using competitive tight-binding inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates. Ang I was effectively cleaved by NEP to Ang (1-7) (kcat/K(m) of 6.2x10(5) M(-1) x s(-1)), but was a poor substrate for ACE2 (kcat/K(m) of 3.3x10(4) M(-1) x s(-1)). Ang (1-9) was a better substrate for NEP than ACE (kcat/K(m) of 3.7x10(5) M(-1) x s(-1) compared with kcat/K(m) of 6.8x10(4) M(-1) x s(-1)). Ang II was cleaved efficiently by ACE2 to Ang (1-7) (kcat/K(m) of 2.2x10(6) M(-1) x s(-1)) and was cleaved by NEP (kcat/K(m) of 2.2x10(5) M(-1) x s(-1)) to several degradation products. In contrast with a previous report, Ang (1-7), like Ang I and Ang (1-9), was cleaved with a similar efficiency by both the N- and C-domains of ACE (kcat/K(m) of 3.6x10(5) M(-1) x s(-1) compared with kcat/K(m) of 3.3x10(5) M(-1) x s(-1)). The two active sites of ACE exhibited negative co-operativity when either Ang I or Ang (1-7) was the substrate. In addition, a range of ACE inhibitors failed to inhibit ACE2. These kinetic data highlight that the flux of peptides through the RAS is complex, with the levels of ACE, ACE2 and NEP dictating whether vasoconstriction or vasodilation will predominate.", 
    "719": "ACE inhibitors initially developed as vasodilators are effective by their anti-hormonal action. Antagonists of the receptors of angiotensin II (ARA II) should provide an equivalent or better blockade of the rennin-angiotensin system (absence of tolerance). Clinical trials have shown equivalent haemodynamic effects of the two classes, equal functional tolerance but mortality studies have shown more variable results. None have shown the superiority of ARA II over ACE inhibitors and the demonstration of their equivalence has just been reported with high doses in the post-infarction period. A deleterious effect of ARA II in association with betablockers was reported in two mortality studies but has not been confirmed in the most recent trials. The difficulty is to determine the roles of the association of ARA II-ACE inhibitors, ARA II-antialdosterones or of the association of all three classes of molecules.", 
    "720": "A selective, sensitive and precise HPLC method with fluorimetric detection has been developed for the assay of lisinopril in human plasma and urine. The clean up of the sample was carried out by solid-phase extraction, firstly with C18-cartridge and secondly with a silica-cartridge. After a pre-column derivatization with fluorescamine, the reaction mixture was chromatographed on C18-column with gradient elution, using methanol and 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH=3.2). The fluorescamine-lisinopril derivative was detected fluorimetrically by monitoring the emission at 477 nm, with excitation at 383 nm.

In this report, the performance characteristics of a combined solid-phase extraction isolation and high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analytical procedure for routine determination of the presence and concentration of human-health pharmaceuticals are described. This method was developed and used in a recent national reconnaissance of pharmaceuticals in USA surface waters. The selection of pharmaceuticals evaluated for this method was based on usage estimates, resulting in a method that contains compounds from diverse chemical classes, which presents challenges and compromises when applied as a single routine analysis. The method performed well for the majority of the 22 pharmaceuticals evaluated, with recoveries greater than 60% for 12 pharmaceuticals. The recoveries of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a histamine (H2) receptor antagonist, and antihypoglycemic compound classes were less than 50%, but were retained in the method to provide information describing the potential presence of these compounds in environmental samples and to indicate evidence of possible matrix enhancing effects. Long-term recoveries, evaluated from reagent-water fortifications processed over 2 years, were similar to initial method performance. Method detection limits averaged 0.022 microg/L, sufficient for expected ambient concentrations. Compound-dependent matrix effects on HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, including enhancement and suppression of ionization, were observed as a 20-30% increase in measured concentrations for three compounds and greater than 50% increase for two compounds. Changing internal standard and more frequent ESI source maintenance minimized matrix effects. Application of the method in the national survey demonstrates that several pharmaceuticals are routinely detected at 0.010-0.100 microg/L concentrations.",

Several large-scale, prospective, randomized studies with clinical end points have been performed in adult patients, but studies in children are relatively scarce. In adult patients with chronic renal diseases, ACEI clearly delay the progression of chronic non-diabetic renal diseases, and nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. The benefits of ACEI are most apparent in glomerular diseases with marked proteinuria but extend also to kidney diseases with lower proteinuria. This notion is also supported by several smaller or retrospective trials in children. Therefore, ACEI should be given to children with chronic renal diseases, particularly if high blood pressure and/or proteinuria are present. In adults, large-scale trials have documented that ARB exert similar effects as ACEI but tend to exert fewer undesired side effects. Data on ARB in children with chronic renal disease are still very scarce, but these substances offer an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACEI due to unwarranted side effects. Combination therapy with ARB plus ACEI may be more effective than either drug class alone. However, we will need the results of further long-term prospective clinical studies, as well as a better understanding of the role of the AT(2) receptor, before combination therapy can be widely recommended. A trial of ARB plus ACEI is justified in selected patients if blood pressure and/or proteinuria cannot adequately be lowered by ACEI or ARB alone.",

Adding an aldosterone antagonist to an ACE inhibitor reduces mortality and morbidity in heart failure. Starting 1 day after MI, rats were treated with placebo, eplerenone (100 mg/kg/day), the angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (1 mg/kg/day), or a combination of both for nine weeks. Both monotherapies attenuated the rise in LV end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) and LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) compared with placebo, whereas combined treatment further attenuated LVDd and LVEDV and significantly improved LV function. Increased collagen type I and III gene expressions in the noninfarcted LV myocardium from MI placebo rats was attenuated by candesartan, but almost completely prevented by eplerenone and eplerenone/candesartan. The addition of eplerenone to candesartan prevented the increases in LV gene expression of ANP and BNP more effectively than either monotherapy. The aldosterone blocker eplerenone improved LV remodeling in rats with LV dysfunction after extensive MI. Combination therapy with an candesartan substantially potentiates this effect by a complementary prevention of LV fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and molecular alterations.", 
    "736": "Mast cell-derived chymase seems to be important in the regulation of local angiotensin (A) II formation in cardiovascular tissues. In human heart, chymase accounts for 80% of A II formation. Therefore, the chymase-dependent A II pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of A II-related cardiovascular diseases. For example, cardiac chymase was activated earlier than ACE and this activation lasted longer than that of ACE after myocardial infarction (MI) in hamsters. Treatment with a specific chymase inhibitor treatment, but not an ACE inhibitor, improved post-MI survival as well as cardiac function and the extent of the beneficial effects was similar to that observed for an AT1-receptor antagonist treatment in this model. The survival benefit after MI seems to be related to an antiarrhythmic effect of the chymase inhibitor because chymase inhibition reduces the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during periods of heart ischemia in a dog MI model. Thus, an antiarrhythmic effect of the chymase inhibitor may contribute to a reduction in mortality rate during the acute phase after MI.", 
    "737": "Recurrent stroke is a major public health concern and new treatment strategies are needed. While modulation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has proven effective in reducing recurrent cardiac events, its role in preventing recurrent cerebrovascular events remains unclear. RAAS is both a circulating and tissue based hormonal system that regulates homeostasis and tissue responses to injury in both the CNS and the periphery, via the activity of angiotensin II (Ang II). Vascular and hematologic effects induced by Ang II including endothelial dysfunction, vascular structural changes, inflammation, hemostasis, and fibrinolysis are increasingly linked to the occurrence of cerebrovascular events. Animal models have shown that RAAS modulation may be protective in cerebrovascular disease. The HOPE and LIFE trials support the role of blood pressure independent mechanisms of RAAS modulation for improving outcomes in a broad range of patients with cardiovascular disease but do not specifically address recurrent stroke prevention. PROGRESS, a trial of secondary stroke prevention, demonstrates that blood pressure reduction with a combination strategy including the routine use of ACE inhibitors prevents recurrent stroke. Current evidence suggests that the RAAS plays an important role in the development and progression of cerebrovascular disease. Modulation of the RAAS holds promise for the secondary prevention of stroke, however, ongoing clinical trials will better define the exact role of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II Type 1 receptor blocker therapy in stroke survivors.",

These strategies were compared with control, which consisted of antihypertensive therapy with standard medications (excluding ACE inhibitors, other angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) with comparable blood pressure control, initiated at microalbuminuria. Transition probabilities were taken from the Irbesartan in Reduction of Microalbuminuria-2 study, Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial, and other published sources.

    "742": "Obesity and insulin resistance confer increased risk for accelerated coronary disease and cardiomyopathic phenomena. We have previously shown that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevents coronary perimicrovascular fibrosis in genetically obese mice that develop insulin resistance. This study was performed to elucidate mechanism(s) implicated and to determine the effects of attenuation of angiotensin II (Ang) II. Genetically obese ob/ob mice were given ACE inhibitor (temocapril) or Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (olmesartan) from 10 to 20 weeks. Cardiac expressions of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), a prototypic profibrotic molecule, were determined and extent of perivascular coronary fibrosis was measured. Twenty-week-old obese mice exhibited increased plasma levels of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) compared with the values in lean counterpart. Perivascular coronary fibrosis in arterioles and small arteries was evident in obese mice that also showed increased left ventricular collagen as measured by hydroxyproline assay. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the deposition of perivascular type 1 collagen. Markedly increased PAI-1 and TGF-beta were seen immunohistochemically in coronary vascular wall and confirmed by western blotting. When obese mice were treated with temocapril or olmesartan from 10 to 20 weeks, both were equally effective and prevented increases in perivascular fibrosis, plasma PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1), left ventricular collagen and mural immunoreactivity for PAI-1, TGF-beta and collagen type 1. The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activity was elevated in the left ventricle of obese mice (western) and blocked by temocapril and olmesartan. Ang II-mediated upregulation of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) with collagen deposition may explain the mechanism of perivascular fibrosis in obese mice. ACE inhibition and blockade of AT(1) receptor may prevent coronary perivascular fibrosis and collagen deposition even before development of overt diabetes. JNK activation may be a mediator of obesity-related cardiac dysfunction and a potential therapeutic target.", 
    "743": "Heart failure, which is classically described as a pathologic process characterized by a decline of heart contractility, involves a complex set of alterations like the release of inflammatory cytokines, endothelin, angiotensin II and aldosterone. These abnormalities cause appreciable changes at cellular and molecular levels with consequent impairment of cell coupling, impulse propagation as well as morphologic alterations. In the present review the question whether cellular sequestration elicited by impairment of cell coupling and interstitial fibrosis plays a role on the development of the disease is discussed and the role of the plasma and cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems on the process of cellular sequestration is described. The possible role of an intracellular renin-angiotensin system on intercellular signaling is also discussed. The beneficial role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is related to the improvement of cellular synchronization which seems related to different factors like increment of cell coupling, hyperpolarization of cell membrane and morphologic remodeling including a decrease of interstitial fibrosis and ventricular hypertrophy.",

In patients with hypertension and LVH, both an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist regress LVH. However, it remains controversial whether dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system will regress LVH in these patients using a combination of ACE inhibitor and AT1 antagonist. Thirty-three type II diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease who had just entered into hemodialysis therapy and were diagnosed as having LVH evaluated by echocardiography were selected from three dialysis units staffed by the faculty of Saitama Medical School, Saitama, Japan between 1999 and 2001. The study was carried out for 1 year. All patients were assigned randomly to three groups with equal number: group I, an ACE inhibitor, enalapril 10 mg daily; group II, an AT1 antagonist, losartan 100 mg daily; group III, combination of enalapril 10 mg and losartan 100 mg daily. All antihypertensive drugs were given 30 min after the cessation of dialysis therapy. LVH was evaluated by echocardiography before the start of administration of drugs, at 6 months and 12 months after the start of drug therapy. Systolic blood pressure levels less than 140 mmHg were the target for the three groups. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, applied to those with four echocardiograms, there were progressive decreases over time in left ventricular mass index, posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness. There were no significant differences in regression of LVH as well as blood pressure control between enalapril and losartan groups; however, dual blockade induced an additional 28% reduction in left ventricular mass index compared with any type of monotherapy. Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists benefit the regression of LVH in diabetic patients who start dialysis therapy. Moreover, combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists would provide more beneficial effects on LVH in these patients than monotherapy.", 
    "749": "Direct adsorption of lipids (DALI) is the first low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis technique capable of adsorbing LDL and lipoprotein (a) directly from whole blood. The adsorber consists of negatively charged polyacrylate ligands linked to a Eupergit matrix. Negatively charged ligands give rise to activation of bradykinin, which is rapidly degraded by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are contraindicated in DALI-LDL-apheresis. This is the first paper to describe the efficacy and safety of DALI-LDL-apheresis in patients treated with 50 mg of the angiotensin II-receptor 1 antagonist (ARA) losartan. Two hypercholesterolemic patients were treated for 79 patient months with weekly or biweekly DALI sessions (N = 221 sessions). Approximately 1.4 patient blood volumes were treated per session. Acute reductions of LDL-cholesterol (63%) and lipoprotein (a) (62%) exceeded 60% and laboratory safety parameters remained in the apheresis typical range. Mean bradykinin plasma levels peaked in the efferent line post-adsorber at 1000 mL of treated blood volume; 467 fmol/mL (N = 6 sessions) in the ARA-treated patients and 671 fmol/mL (N = 9 sessions) in a control group of three DALI patients without ARA medication (P = 0.69, n.s.). Clinically, the DALI sessions for the ARA-treated patients were completely uneventful and blood pressure was not significantly different in the two groups. In summary, according to this retrospective pilot study, DALI-LDL-apheresis was shown for the first time to be safe and effective in patients on ARA medication.", 
    "750": "A number of pathological events in humans such as solid tumour growth and metastasis have been found to be associated with angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels front pre-existing vasculature. A novel approach in cancer treatment consists of blocking or delaying the progression of neovascularisation to dysplastic cells in order to stop delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Thus, agents with antiangiogenic activity may be useful to treat cancer with potentially less systemic toxicity than conventional cytotoxic therapeutics. In this study we report the development and validation of a modified quantitative and objective in vivo chick embryo assay with Digital Image Analysis to screen compounds for antiangiogenic activity. The evaluation of vascular responses was optimised to less than one minute per sample in order to make this automatic method suitable for larger experimental series. Significant activity of the known antiangiogenic compounds thalidomide and captopril was determined, which resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of the vessel area compared to the control. The stability and release of thalidomide and captopril within 48 h after application to the extraembryonic vessel system was monitored by HPLC analysis. In conclusion, this multiple target test system will be complementary to existing angiogenesis assays and may be useful to quantify the antiangiogenic activity of compounds.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) influence collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and their tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) activity in AMI patients. Plasma levels of MMP-1, TIMP-1 and MMP-1/TIMP-1 complex were measured in 24 patients (aged 58.4 +/- 13.9 years) with AMI. Thirteen patients received perindopril 4 mg/day (group A) and 11 did not (group B). Plasma samples collected on admission and at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours and on days 3, 4, 5, 7, 15 and 30 thereafter were analyzed by relevant ELISA kits. Ejection fraction (EF) was assessed by ventriculography and end-diastolic diameter (EDD) echo-study on days 6 and 30. Values of collagenolytic enzymes of group A compared with those in group B were on average lower by 34%, 18.3% and 40%, respectively. The difference in values between groups at 0 h, 3 h and 9 h was significant (p < 0.048). ANOVA repeated measurement analysis showed significance within subjects for MMP-1 alone (p < 0.043) and for MMP-1 and ACEI (p < 0.046), while for TIMP-1 and MMP-1/TIMP-1 complex significance was only p < 0.0009. Regarding EDD changes, patients in group A showed minimal or no changes (51.23 +/- 1.8 mm to 51.6 +/- 2.13 mm), their EF was 38.8% and infarct size was medium to large. In contrast, group B showed a trend to increase EDD (41 +/- 0.78 mm to 42.33 +/- 0.59 mm), their EF was 50.5% and infarct size was small to medium. In conclusion, early initiation of ACEI treatment reduces collagenolytic activity. This effect may be considered an alternative mechanism for beneficial effects on postinfarction remodeling.", 
    "756": "The effect of captopril on neurally evoked bradycardia and tachycardia was investigated in pithed rats. Captopril enhanced the vagal nerve stimulation-evoked bradycardia. Angiotensin I reduced the vagal bradycardia, which was reversed by subsequent administration of captopril. Bradykinin did not affect the neurally evoked bradycardia. Captopril and angiotensin I affected neither the exogenous acetylcholine-evoked bradycardia nor the sympathetic nerve stimulation-evoked tachycardia. These results suggest that the interruption of angiotensin II formation by captopril causes less presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release via angiotensin II receptors without affecting cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission.", 
    "757": "Mitochondrial dysfunction subsequent to increased oxidative stress and alterations in energy metabolism is considered to play a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and its progression to failure, although the sequence of events remains to be elucidated. This study aimed at characterizing the impact of hypertrophy development on the activity and expression of mitochondrial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase (mNADP+-ICDH), a metabolic enzyme that controls redox and energy status. We expanded on our previous finding of its inactivation through posttranslational modification by the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in 7-wk-old spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hearts before hypertrophy development (Benderdour et al. J Biol Chem 278: 45154-45159, 2003). In this study, we used 7-, 15-, and 30-wk-old SHR and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with abdominal aortic coarctation. Compared with age-matched control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, SHR hearts showed a significant 25% decrease of mNADP+-ICDH activity, which preceded in time 1) the decline in its protein and mRNA expression levels (between 10% and 35%) and 2) the increase in hypertrophy markers. The chronic and persistent loss of mNADP+-ICDH activity in SHR was associated with enhanced tissue accumulation of HNE-mNADP+-ICDH and total HNE-protein adducts at all ages and contrasted with the profile of changes in the activity of other mitochondrial enzymes involved in antioxidant or energy metabolism. Two-way ANOVA of the data also revealed a significant effect of age on most parameters measured in SHR and WKY hearts. The mNADP+-ICDH activity, protein, and mRNA expression were reduced between 25% and 35% in coarctated SD rats and were normalized by treatment of SHR or coarctated SD rats with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which prevented or attenuated hypertrophy. Altogether, our data show that cardiac mNADP+-ICDH activity and expression are differentially and sequentially affected in hypertrophy development and, to a lesser extent, with aging. Decreased cardiac mNADP+-ICDH activity, which is attributed at least in part to HNE adduct formation, appears to be a relevant early and persistent marker of mitochondrial oxidative stress-related alterations in hypertrophy development. Potentially, this could also contribute to the aetiology of cardiomyopathy.",

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers has been shown to improve many of the complications of hypertension, including left ventricular hypertrophy and renal disease. Results of recent key studies such as Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE), Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT), Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM), and Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) add to the evidence that angiotensin II receptor blockers are well suited for the treatment of hypertension in older patients.

We investigated the effects of L. helveticus fermented milk whey (Lh-whey) and its components, sour milk whey, calcium and IPP and VPP peptides, on bone cells in vitro. An osteoblast assay was performed by determining the amount of deposited calcium as an index of bone formation in cultures of mouse osteoblasts formed from bone marrow-derived osteoblast precursor cells. An osteoclast assay was performed by determining the activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase released into the culture medium in cultures of mouse osteoclasts formed from bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursor cells. The Lh-whey increased bone formation 1.3-1.4 times with the 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-4) and 1 x 10(-3) solutions. The IPP and VPP peptides also demonstrated a significant 5-fold activation of bone formation in in vitro osteoblast cultures, whereas the sour milk whey and calcium had no effect. No significant effects were observed on osteoclasts in vitro with any of the study products. L. helveticus fermented milk whey contains bioactive components that increase osteoblastic bone formation in vitro. The effect may be due to the ACE-inhibitory IPP and VPP peptides, which showed a similar effect to that of the L. helveticus fermented milk whey.", 
    "765": "Chronic heart failure (HF) has become a significant healthcare problem in the US. The number of new cases per year continues to grow steadily due to an ageing population and improved survival from acute coronary syndromes. As a consequence, the management of HF patients is of great importance. Effective management of HF includes stabilising the patient and improving the clinical symptoms associated with HF. Patients with HF have increased sympathetic nervous system activity that contributes to impaired cardiovascular function over time and subsequently results in death. beta-blockers prevent such impairment through inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system neurohormonal pathway. Numerous clinical trials conducted over the past decade have demonstrated that beta-blockers, in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are not only effective but are superior to other medical interventions for the treatment of HF. The standard of care for patients with HF now includes beta-blockers as well as ACE inhibitors.",

    "771": "Chronic allograft nephropathy is a devastating complication of kidney transplantation that is responsible for a significant proportion of graft loss. This complication is characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function, which is not attributable to a specific cause. Many risk factors exist for the development of chronic allograft nephropathy, including donor-, recipient-, and transplant-related factors (eg, use of calcineurin inhibitors and acute rejection episodes), as well as comorbid conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There is no definitive treatment for this complication; management has focused on minimization or withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors in conjunction with addition of sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil. Alterations in the immunosuppressive regimen must be done cautiously, as precipitating acute rejection will cause further damage to the allograft. Optimal control of blood pressure, particularly with the use of agents such as angiotensin II receptor blockers, in conjunction with management of dyslipidemia may be effective concurrent therapies in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy.",

There were 4 phases: a screening phase of 10 days maximum, a 4-week dose-response phase, a placebo withdrawal phase of 2 weeks maximum, and a 52-week open-label safety phase. The primary objective of the dose-response phase was to determine whether low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg), or high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of fosinopril based on established adult dosing affect trough seated systolic blood pressure. During the dose-response phase, all 3 doses were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure. During the placebo withdrawal phase, there was an adjusted mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5.2 mm Hg for the placebo group and 1.5 mm Hg for the fosinopril group, a net withdrawal effect of 3.7 mm Hg (P=0.013). Fosinopril was well tolerated; serious adverse events occurred infrequently and were generally not attributed to fosinopril.

Endothelial specific testing can be performed in coronary as well as peripheral arteries. However, non-coronary tests have a low correlation with the coronary vasomotor response, as assessed by acetylcholine. In large clinical prospective placebo-controlled trials, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and lipid-lowering drugs reduce morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction or myocardial infarction-induced heart failure.

    "814": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of antihypertensive drugs that are single molecules having dual inhibitory action on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The best known drug in this class is omapatrilat, which has been proposed to be more efficacious than ACE inhibitors because of its ability to inhibit NEP and prevent the breakdown of atrial peptides and bradykinin. However, survival of endothelin (ET) may also be enhanced and therefore, NEP inhibitors may have limited efficacy under conditions of low renin and high ET production. The purpose of the current study was to contrast the effects of the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, with omapatrilat in a model of established hypertension where ACE inhibitors are ineffective, the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt-treated rat. Two weeks after starting DOCA-salt treatment, rats were given either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or omapatrilat (30 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured by radiotelemetry in untreated DOCA-salt rats increased from 102 +/- 2 to 181 +/- 12 mm Hg (P<.05) as a result of DOCA-salt treatment for 3 weeks. MAP was unaffected by either enalapril (189 +/- 3 mm Hg) or omapatrilat (184 +/- 8 mm Hg). DOCA-salt treatment significantly increased urinary ET excretion compared to baseline (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.1 pmol/day). Administration of omapatrilat significantly increased urinary ET excretion in DOCA-salt rats (2.9 +/- 0.4 pmol/day) compared to enalapril-treated (1.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/day) or untreated (1.5 +/- 0.1 pmol/day) rats.

Patients usually require several drugs for controlling hypertension, which becomes harder to control as nephropathy progresses. In this review, it is suggested that quantitatively tracking proteinuria to guide therapy and a broad focus on the cardiovascular and renal end points are important for best outcomes in patients. Strategies may vary based on stage of disease, comorbidities, and age. Therapies not directed specifically at hypertension may also significantly aid hypertension management in prevention of progressive nephropathy, comorbidities, and mortality.",

    "827": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of invalidism and death in the industrialized world. Among others, the renin- angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis and outcome of ischemic events, including stroke. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the major effector peptide of the RAS, exerts most of its well-defined physiologic and pathophysiologic actions, including those on the central and peripheral nervous system, through its Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor subtype. This receptor not only contributes to stroke-related pathologic mechanisms (eg, hypertension, atherothrombosis, and cardiac hypertrophy) but also may be involved in postischemic damage to the brain. However, it has also been demonstrated that Ang II, via its AT2 receptor subtype, accelerates neuronal tissue regeneration after injury. In this article, we review the experimental evidence supporting the notion that blockade of brain AT1 receptors can be beneficial with respect to stroke incidence and outcome. We further delineate how AT2 receptors could be involved in neuronal regeneration following brain injury, such as stroke. In doing so, we also attempt to shed some light on the mechanisms by which AT1 receptor blockers, which leave the AT2 receptor unopposed, might exert protective actions in brain ischemia.",

Concerns about possible side effects and reliance on other forms of therapy were common reasons for the suboptimal use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

However, such recommendations are based on relatively short-term trials, whereas treatment for hypertension is often a lifetime process. A meta-analysis of seven studies in 58,010 individuals, showed that the 'new' therapies, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) provoke less new diabetes than the conventional 'old' therapies (diuretics and beta-blockers). ACE inhibitors/ARBs decreased new diabetes by 20% (P < 0.001), whereas CCBs decreased new diabetes by 16% (P < 0.001). The number needed to treat for approximately 4 years by new rather than old conventional therapy to avoid one case of new diabetes is about 60-70. Other factors contributing to increased coronary risk are increased metabolic syndrome, blood lipid changes and hypokalaemia. It is not certain whether it is the new therapy that provides protection against new diabetes or the conventional therapy that precipitates new diabetes. However, when compared with placebo, ACE inhibition by ramipril or by the ARB, candesartan, both decrease the incidence of new diabetes, raising the hypothesis that these agents actually prevent the changes leading to insulin resistance, possibly by lessening the adverse effects of angiotensin II on the endothelium. Conversely, lipid abnormalities with conventional treatment could exert adverse effects on the endothelium. Therefore endothelial changes could help to explain the benefits of 'modern' treatment compared with the defects of conventional therapy.",

In vitro, an immortal BALB/c mouse aortic endothelial 22106 cell line was used to determine the effects of Ac-SDKP on endothelial cell proliferation and migration and tube formation. In vivo, a 9L-gliosarcoma cell spheroid (250-300 microm in diameter) was implanted in the rat cornea and vehicle or Ac-SDKP (800 microg.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) infused via osmotic minipump. Myocardial capillary density was studied in rats with MI given either vehicle or Ac-SDKP. We found that Ac-SDKP 1) stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and migration and tube formation in a dose-dependent manner, 2) enhanced corneal neovascularization, and 3) increased myocardial capillary density. Endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis stimulated by Ac-SDKP could be beneficial in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and MI. Furthermore, because Ac-SDKP is mainly cleaved by ACE, it may partially mediate the cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "850": "1. The regulation by angiotensin II (Ang II) formed locally on nerve-stimulated purinergic and adrenergic components of double-peaked vasoconstrictions in the canine splenic artery and Ang II receptor subtypes involved were investigated. 2. The perfusion of the precursor angiotensin I (Ang I, 0.1-1 nm) did not affect the vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline (NA, 0.03-1 nmol) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP, 0.03-1 micromol). The second component vasoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation was dose dependently potentiated by Ang I (0.1-1 nm). The first peaked constriction was slightly, but insignificantly increased. The potentiating effects of Ang I were abolished by KRH-594 (10 nm), a selective AT(1) receptor antagonist, but not by PD 123319 (1-10 nm), an AT(2) receptor antagonist. KRH-594 (10 nm) or PD 123319 (10 nm) never affected the vasoconstrictions to either NA or ATP. 3. The treatment with KRH-594 (1-10 nm) produced a greater inhibition on the second peaked response than the first one, although both of them were dose dependently inhibited. PD 123319 (1-10 nm) did not affect the vasoconstrictor responses induced by nerve stimulation. 4. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with 10 nm enalaprilat reduced the second peaked response, having no significant inhibition on the first peaked response. A higher dose of enalaprilat (100 nm) produced a greater inhibition of the second peak than the first one. It reduced the second peak by approximately 65%, while the first peak was decreased approximately 35%. After treatment with enalaprilat, Ang I (1 nm) failed to enhance the neuronal vascular response. Enalaprilat at doses used did not affect the vasoconstrictions to either NA or ATP. 5. The present results indicate that endogenously generated Ang II may produce a more marked potentiation of adrenergic transmission than purinergic transmission via activation of prejunctional AT(1) receptors.", 
    "851": "A 71-year-old man with bilateral renovascular disease was admitted to Hamamatsu University hospital because of appetite loss and acute shortness of breath due to acute pulmonary edema (APE) with accelerated hypertension and renal failure. Hypertension and APE were controlled by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and four sessions of hemodialysis with reduction of 1.8 kg bodyweight. Renal function was later stabilized and the patient required no ACEI or hemodialysis. A trial of right renal angioplasty 1 month after admission failed and renal function deteriorated (serum creatinine 7.1 mg/dL) with accelerated hypertension, gain of bodyweight and APE. Even after four sessions of hemodialysis with adequate reduction of bodyweight, APE was not controlled, but it rapidly improved after administration of an ACEI, without major bodyweight change. As no apparent cardiac dysfunction was evident, APE might have been caused by a direct action of angiotensin II on hyperpermeability in pulmonary capillaries. Blocking of angiotensin II should be considered in such patients even after introduction of hemodialysis.", 
    "852": "The study was designed to determine to what extent moderate elevation of renal perfusion pressure (RPP) via the mechanism of 'pressure natriuresis' contributes to the natriuresis induced by acute i.v. saline loading. Nine Beagle dogs maintained on ample sodium intake (5.5 mmol (kg body mass)(-1) day(-1)) were chronically equipped with an aortic occluder to servocontrol RPP, a bladder catheter to measure renal function, and catheters for measurement of RPP and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). A swivel system allowed free movement in the kennel during experiments. Isotonic saline loading (500 ml in 100 min) was studied as follows: with and without servocontrol of RPP, and these two protocols repeated in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI, Enalapril, 2 mg (kg body mass)(-1)). Saline loading increased MABP by about 12 mmHg and sodium excretion from about 28 micromol min(-1) up to about 350 micromol min(-1). Without ACEI, servocontrol of RPP at 10% below control 24 h MABP slightly delayed the onset of the saline-induced natriuresis, but did not reduce peak sodium excretion or cumulative sodium excretion. The slight delay most probably resulted from pressure-controlled renin release because, with ACEI, servocontrol of RPP did not delay or reduce the saline-induced natriuresis. In conclusion, pressure natriuresis does not contribute to the natriuresis following acute saline loading.",

A linear correlation was found between MAP at baseline and the change of MAP during treatment (r= 0.51; P < 0.0001). The antihypertensive response was independent of changes in concomitant antihypertensive medication or underlying renal disease. BP was reduced with equal efficacy during day- and nighttime. Urinary protein excretion was reduced by 50% on average, with similar relative efficacy in patients with hypo/dysplastic nephropathies and glomerulopathies. The magnitude of proteinuria reduction depended on baseline proteinuria (r= 0.32, P < 0.0001), and was correlated with the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug (r= 0.22, P < 0.001). The incidence of rapid rises in serum creatinine and progression to end-stage CRF during treatment did not differ from the pretreatment observation period.

    "858": "Although initially adaptive, the changes that accompany hypertension, namely, cell growth, endothelial dysfunction, and extracellular matrix deposition, eventually can become maladaptive and lead to end-organ disease such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, and renal failure. A functional imbalance between angiotensin II (Ang II) and nitric oxide (NO) plays an important pathogenetic role in hypertensive end-organ injury. NO, an endogenous vasodilator, inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle and mesangial cell growth, and natriuretic agent, is synthesized in the endothelium by a constitutive NO synthase. NO antagonizes the effects of Ang II on vascular tone, cell growth, and renal sodium excretion, and also down-regulates the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptors. On the other hand, Ang II decreases NO bioavailability by promoting oxidative stress. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertensive end-organ damage may aid in identifying markers of cardiovascular susceptibility to injury and in developing therapeutic interventions. We propose that those antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure and concomitantly restore the homeostatic balance of vasoactive agents such as Ang II and NO within the vessel wall would be more effective in preventing or arresting end-organ disease.",

    "863": "Both germinal (gACE) and somatic (sACE) isozymes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are type I ectoproteins whose enzymatically active ectodomains are cleaved and shed by a membrane-bound protease. Here, we report a role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating this process. Strong enhancements of ACE cleavage secretion was observed upon enhancing protein Tyr phosphorylation by treating gACE- or sACE-expressing cells with pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein Tyr phosphatases. Secreted gACE, cell-bound mature gACE and its precursors were all Tyr-phosphorylated, as was the endoplasmic reticulum protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, that co-immunoprecipitated with ACE. The enhancement of cleavage secretion by pervanadate did not require the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE, and it was not accomplished by enhancing the rate of intracellular processing of the protein. The observed enhancement of cleavage secretion of ACE in pervanadate-treated cells was specifically blocked by an inhibitor of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase but not by inhibitors of many other Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases, including a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C that, however, could block the enhancement of cleavage secretion elicited by phorbol ester. These results indicate that ACE Tyr phosphorylation, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhances the rate of its cleavage secretion at the plasma membrane using a regulatory pathway that may involve p38 MAP kinase.",

Drug therapy for hypertension in hemodialysis (HD) patients includes all classes of antihypertensive drugs, with the sole exception of diuretics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may decrease morbidity and mortality by reducing the mean arterial pressure (MAP), aortic pulse wave velocity, and aortic systolic pressure augmentation, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and probably reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) and oxidant stress. Potential risk factors include hyperkalemia, anaphylactoid reaction with AN69 membranes (particularly ACE inhibitors), and aggravation of renal anemia. beta-blockers decrease not only mortality, blood pressure (BP), and ventricular arrhythmias, but also improve left ventricular function in ESRD patients. Nonselective beta-blockers can cause an increase in serum potassium (particularly during fasting or exercise). Lisinopril and atenolol have a predominant renal excretion and therefore a prolonged half life in ESRD patients. Thus thrice-weekly supervised administration of these drugs after HD can enhance BP control. The use of calcium channel blockers is also associated with lower total and cardiovascular-specific mortality in HD patients. Minoxidil is a very potent vasodilator that is generally reserved for dialysis patients with severe hypertension. Hypertensive dialysis patients who are noncompliant with their medications may benefit from transdermal clonidine therapy once a week. The majority of dialysis patients need a combination of several antihypertensive drugs for adequate BP control.", 
    "877": "The therapeutic use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, at a large scale, in arterial hypertension has showed that these molecules can exert beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and may reduce the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. One hypothesis explaining these effects of ACE inhibitors may relate to their capacity to interfere with bradykinin (BK) metabolism and action. BK may participate in the regulation of substrate utilization by several tissues by improving blood flow and substrate delivery to the tissues and also by promoting translocation of glucose transporters. Moreover, BK has been shown to increase phosphorylation of insulin receptor and its cell substrates. BK also appears to improve the release of insulin. Furthermore, insulin may activate the kallikrein-kinin system, which consequently may increase its metabolic effects. However, in experimental diabetes mellitus, BK can participate to the inflammatory reaction leading to Langerhans islets destruction. In diabetes, whereas tissue kallikrein mRNA levels were reduced in several organs, an overexpression of kinin receptors, an increase in plasma levels of kininogens and kallikrein and an activation of the kinin system have all been reported. Lastly, kinins may be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Reduction of kinin metabolism by ACE inhibitors might be involved in the beneficial effects exerted by these compounds in diabetic kidney functions.",

The baseline and postcaptopril Tc-99m MAG 3 images and curves from 10 patients clinically suspected of having RVH were retrospectively selected to have a wide sample of images and curves. The data and a multiple-choice questionnaire were presented as a PowerPoint file, which was sent electronically to Belgian nuclear medicine physicians; they had to answer if the images and curves were or were not suggestive of the diagnosis of RVH or if it was impossible to answer. There was near-complete interobserver agreement for normal baseline and postcaptopril data, for unilateral postcaptopril delayed transit and/or impaired uptake. Agreement was not as good for bilateral and symmetrical changes, for mild changes, or in cases of impaired function.

Clinical end points included all-cause mortality, with cardiovascular end point defined as first hospitalization because of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, revascularization procedures, or cerebrovascular accident as well as renal end point defined as dialysis, doubling of baseline plasma creatinine, or plasma creatinine > or =500 micromol/L. The use of ACE inhibitor was 26.3% in normoalbuminuric (NA), 70.1% in microalbuminuric (MI), and 82.6% in macroalbuminuric (MA) groups. Albuminuria was a major predictor for all-cause mortality with 4-fold difference between NA and MA patients. The 7-year cumulative mortality rate was 7.1%, 10.8%, and 21.7% in the NA, MI, and MA groups, respectively. The use of ACE inhibition was associated with significant reduction of mortality (hazard ratio 0.41 and 95% confidence interval, 0.29, 0.58) in the entire group and was most evident in high-risk patients who had cardiorenal complications or retinopathy at baseline for all albuminuric groups (NA 0.76 [0.31,1.87]; MI 0.32 [0.16, 0.65]; and MA 0.20 [0.13, 0.33]).

These differences remained after adjustment for potentially confounding prognostic factors.", 
    "885": "A considerable proportion of patients with an ACS has diabetes and is at increased risk for adverse outcomes compared with patients without diabetes. There are certain proven therapeutic strategies that remain underused in the diabetic population. A more widespread awareness of this increased risk and a more diligent use of proven cardiac treatment approaches are indicated for patients with diabetes who develop an ACS.", 
    "886": "The cDNA of a cystein peptidase inhibitor was isolated from sugarcane and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein, named canecystatin, has previously been shown to exert antifungal activity on the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. Herein, the inhibitory specificity of canecystatin was further characterized. It inhibits the cysteine peptidases from plant source papain (Ki =3.3nM) and baupain (Ki=2.1x10(-8)M), but no inhibitory effect was observed on ficin or bromelain. Canecystatin also inhibits lysosomal cysteine peptidases such as human cathepsin B (Ki=125nM), cathepsin K (Ki=0.76nM), cathepsin L (Ki=0.6nM), and cathepsin V (Ki=1.0nM), but not the aspartyl peptidase cathepsin D. The activity of serine peptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic, and neutrophil elastases, and human plasma kallikrein is not affected by the inhibitor, nor is the activity of the metallopeptidases angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. This is the first report of inhibitory activity of a sugarcane cystatin on cysteine peptidases.", 
    "887": "Bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) from Bothrops jararaca venom were described in the middle of 1960s and were the first natural inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme displaying strong anti-hypertensive effects in human subjects. The BPPs can be recognized by their typical pyroglutamyl proline-rich oligopeptide sequences presenting invariably a proline residue at the C-terminus. In the present study, we identified 18 BPPs, most of them already described for the B. jararaca venom. We isolated and sequenced new peptides ranging from 5 to 14 amino acid residues exhibiting similar amino acid sequence features. The applied methodology consisted of a strait two-step liquid chromatography, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Besides the amino acid sequence homology, the corresponding synthetic peptides were able to potentiate bradykinin on the isolated guinea-pig ileum.", 
    "888": "It has been shown that a statin (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitor) enhances a suppressive effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blocker (ARB) on injury-induced transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression in kidneys. We have shown that TGF-beta plays a crucial role in the development of liver fibrosis. In this study, we tested whether a combinatory use of a statin (pitavastatin) and an ARB (candesartan) may further inhibit liver fibrogenesis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated rats. Candesartan (8 mg/kg/day) significantly suppressed injury-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in livers, and attenuated fibrogenesis, as evaluated by masson-trichrome staining and hydroxyproline content in livers. Pitavastatin (2 mg/kg/day) alone did not affect liver fibrogenesis. However, it enhanced significantly the suppressive effects of candesartan on TGF-beta 1 expression and fibrogenesis. Although we do not know the underlying molecular mechanisms at this moment, these results suggest that a combinatory use of a statin and an ARB may confer beneficial effects on human liver fibrogenesis.",

    "890": "Normotensive (strain: Wistar Kyoto) and genetically hypertensive (strain: spontaneously hypertensive) rats were rendered diabetic by intravenous injections of streptozotocin. Half of the diabetic animals received cilazapril with their daily food. At 20 weeks of diabetes, endothelial cells, pericytes and extracellular matrix were assessed by ultrastructural morphometry. Each experimental group consisted of seven animals.", 
    "891": "Cilazapril normalised systolic arterial pressure in diabetic hypertensive rats (137+/-2 mm Hg compared with 188+/-16 mm Hg in non-medicated diabetic hypertensive rats, p<0.001). The number of endothelial intercellular junctions was reduced in untreated diabetic hypertensive rats (0.15+/-0.05, p<0.02, vs 0.47+/-0.20 in non-diabetic normotensive rats). In diabetic hypertensive animals treated with cilazapril, this loss was attenuated (0.32+/-0.16, p<0.05). The significant thickening of the basement membrane observed in the diabetic normotensive (132.8+/-19.4 nm) and diabetic hypertensive (150.3+/-20.2 nm) groups was decreased by cilazapril in the diabetic hypertensive group (116.7+/-11.0 nm, p<0.01), but was unaffected in the normotensive (131.9+/-17.3 nm) group. No protective effect of the drug was observed in either group on pericytes.", 
    "892": "Long-term administration of an effective antihypertensive therapy normalises endothelial alterations and basement membrane thickness in diabetic hypertensive conditions, and thus may account for the well-known improvement of the blood-retinal barrier observed during antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "893": "The insulin-resistant, hyperinsulinemic, normoglycemic, and obese JCR:LA-cp rat was used to study the effects of ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) and AVE7688 (a dual inhibitor of ACE and neutral endopeptidases) on insulin sensitivity and vascular function. Both compounds reduced the surge of plasma insulin in a meal tolerance test by approximately 50%. Ramipril had no effect on acetylcholine-induced relaxation but increased the sensitivity to sodium nitroprus-side at low concentrations. AVE7688 significantly reduced the EC50 for acetylcholine to relax phenylephrine-contracted aortic rings. None of the compounds affected the baseline coronary flow and reactive hyperemia. Coronary flow response to bradykinin in AVE7688- and ramipril-treated rat hearts showed a significantly lower EC50 than in control rats. Maximum flow rate was not different between groups. In summary, both ramipril and AVE7688 had significant hypoinsulinemic and insulin-sensitizing effects. Whereas ramipril had limited vascular effects, AVE7688 had more marked beneficial vascular effects, probably of endothelial origin and possibly related to lowered insulin levels.", 
    "894": "Type II diabetes is often associated with high blood pressure, elevated sympathetic activity, and high plasma insulin levels. Hypoglycemic agents may negatively interfere with blood pressure control, sympathetic activity, and plasma insulin level; therefore the choice of treatment in type II diabetes may be crucial. We aimed to compare the effects of two hypoglycemic drugs on blood glucose, blood pressure, sympathetic activity, and insulin levels in type II diabetic and hypertensive patients.", 
    "895": "Forty-eight (24M, 24F) type II diabetic, hypertensive, and hyperlipidemic subjects were enrolled and treated for 4 weeks with an ACE inhibitor (Cilazapril) and a statin (Simvastatin). They were then randomized into two groups to receive a thiazolidinedione (Rosiglitazone; ROS) or a sulfonylurea (Glibenclamide; GLB) for 8 weeks. Blood biochemistry, blood pressure, plasma insulin, endothelial function, and sympathetic skin activity were measured before and after treatment.", 
    "896": "A significant drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6.1 +/- 4.1 mm Hg and 4.2 +/- 1.9 mm Hg respectively; a reduction in plasma insulin concentration by 4.3 +/- 1.9 mU/L and a decline in skin sympathetic activity were observed in the group receiving ROS. The GLB group showed an increase in systolic blood pressure by 3.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, no change in diastolic blood pressure, significant elevation in plasma insulin concentration by 2.3 +/- 1.4 mu/L, and augmentation of sympathetic activity. No significant changes in endothelial function were observed in either group.", 
    "897": "Rosiglitazone improved both plasma glucose and blood pressure levels, probably by attenuation of hyperinsulinemia and sympathetic activity, while Glibenclamide worsened blood pressure control possibly by elevation of insulin levels and activation of the sympathetic system.", 
    "898": "Glycine infusion in normal rats causes an increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although the renal response to glycine infusion is well characterized, the mechanism initiating this vasodilation is unknown. We recently observed functionally active N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the kidney, located primarily in tubular structures. The mechanisms regulating activity of the NMDA receptor within the kidney are also unknown, as is its normal day-to-day functional role. Therefore, we hypothesize that dietary protein may impact the functional response to glycine infusion in both untreated rats and rats pretreated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and, furthermore, that renal NMDA receptors may be involved in the glycine response. Surprisingly, 2 wk of low-protein diet (8% protein vs. 21% protein in control diet) totally inhibited the glycine-induced vasodilation and GFR response. Associated with the absence of renal vasodilation, a significant reduction in proximal tubular reabsorption was observed during glycine infusion in low-protein-diet rats. In contrast to the disease models previously studied in our laboratory, administration of ACE inhibitors did not restore the glycine response in rats treated with low-protein diet. Western blots of normal- and low-protein-diet kidneys demonstrate that the newly described renal NMDA receptor is downregulated in rats fed a low-protein diet. Low-protein feeding results in loss of glycine-induced vasodilation and GFR responses associated with decreased renal NMDA receptor expression. Kidney NMDA receptor expression is conditioned by protein intake, and this receptor may play an important role in the kidney vasodilatory response to glycine infusion and protein feeding in rats.", 
    "899": "Potentially important new findings have recently been reported concerning the so-called metabolic syndrome in relation to the renin-angiotensin system, ie, that treatment with inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) not only decreases blood pressure levels but prevents the development of diabetes mellitus. The new findings described in this article highlight the potential role of the ACE system in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, thus contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In addition to the well known selective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in reducing microalbuminuria in diabetic patients, the potential ability of these drugs to reduce the risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome would support their use as first line agents not only in diabetic patients but also in selected groups of hypertensive patients, who are particularly at risk of developing metabolic complications. This information supports the Joint Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension by the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology, which highlight the crucial role of ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor blockers in preventing the development of diabetes in hypertensive patients.", 
    "900": "Two cases of sialadenitis following treatment with captopril are described. In case 1, an upper chest and facial erythema and dryness of the mouth accompanied the swelling of the salivary glands. In case 2, a conjunctival erythema accompanied the sialadenitis. None of the patients had previously used captopril, and, in both cases, the swelling occurred within the first hour after the drug intake; the patients had a complete recovery within a few hours after captopril was withdrawn. It is possible that the reported effect was caused by a type-B idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction.", 
    "901": "An international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a recently recognized syndrome caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, began in November 2002 and ended in July 2003. Since then, a large body of research on the syndrome has been published; the most updated developments are summarized here.", 
    "902": "Recent findings suggest that animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses may have been transmitted to humans without detection for years before the recent outbreak, and that such transmission may be continuing today. The 2002-2003 outbreak probably originated from similar animal-to-human transmission, but selection and purification of the animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like virus appears to have occurred, creating the more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Recent studies have documented that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is primarily transmitted via contact and/or respiratory droplets and that the combination of standard, contact, and droplet precautions is generally effective for its control. It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is typically relatively inefficiently transmitted, with the notable exception of transmission during superspreading events. Insights into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome have been made: one study suggests that human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*4601 is a possible risk factor for more severe disease, while another identifies angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Promising treatments have been identified, including interferons, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody, and fusion inhibitors. In addition, many promising vaccines are currently in development.",

Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from day 13 and days 21-23 of the reproductive cycle and transcript levels were compared by hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U95A arrays.", 
    "906": "Of approximately 12,000 genes profiled, we identified 108 genes that were significantly regulated during the shift from a proliferative to an adequate secretory endometrium. Of these genes, 39 were up-regulated at days 21-23 versus day 13, and 69 were down-regulated. Genes up-regulated in P-dominant tissue included: secretoglobin (uteroglobin), histone 2A, polo-like kinase (PLK), spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase 2 (SAT2), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and metallothionein 1G (MT1G), all of which have been previously documented as elevated in the Rhesus monkey or human endometrium during the secretory phase. Genes down-regulated included: transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI or BIGH3), matrix metalloproteinase 11 (stromelysin 3), proenkephalin (PENK), cysteine/glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2), collagen type VII alpha 1 (COL7A1), secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 12 (CXCL12) and biglycan (BGN). In addition, many novel/unknown genes were also identified. Validation of array data was performed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR of two selected up-regulated genes using temporal (cycle day specific) endometrial cDNA populations. This approach confirmed up-regulation of WAP four-disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) and SLPI during the expected window of receptivity.",

As decompensated heart failure becomes an increasingly common problem in emergency departments in the developed world, optimization of emergency drug therapy for these critically ill patients is essential. The evidence base for 'routine therapy' in the ED is considered. The review also briefly considers emerging pharmacological therapies that may have an impact on future management of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.", 
    "909": "A pharmacophore represents the 3D arrangement of chemical features that are shared by molecules exhibiting activity at a protein receptor. Pharmacophores are routinely used in 3D database searching for identifying potential lead compounds. The lack of shape constraints causes the query to identify compounds that could not fit into the active site. In the absence of structural information, a receptor surface model (RSM) can be used to represent the active site. The RSM consists of a surface that envelops a set of known actives after these have been aligned using their common features. When used for database searching, a RSM is overconstraining as it restricts access to regions that could be occupied by ligands, such as the solvent-protein interface or unexplored pockets. We describe a protocol for developing pruned RSMs using information gleaned from 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. We examined the performance of queries that consist of pharmacophores used alone or with pruned or unpruned RSMs by performing searches on six databases containing known actives distributed among inactives. The pruned RSMs yield an average selectivity 1.8 times greater than that for pharmacophore queries, compared to 1.6 times for unpruned RSMs. However, the pruned RSMs retrieve on average 73% of the actives identified using the pharmacophores, compared to 40% for the unpruned RSMs. As such, pruned RSMs represent a useful compromise between the high sensitivity of pharmacophores and the high selectivity of unpruned RSMs.", 
    "910": "The aim of this study was to assess how general physicians (GP) think that heart failure (HF) should be managed and how they implement their knowledge. It was conducted in Buenos Aires City and suburban area, with the collaboration of 5 cardiologists, and 29 GP who were selected randomly, and were asked to keep a log of all patients they saw with HF. The methodology was similar to that employed in an international initiative named \"Improvement\" already performed in Europe. Data were obtained of 220 note patients. GP knowledge and perceptions about the management of HF were assessed initially with a \"perception survey\", and later on how a representative sample of patients was managed, with an \"actual practice survey\". The electrocardiogram and the chest radiograph were recorded in most patients (approximately equal to 90%), but the echocardiogram only in 67% of cases. Forty percent of the patients had history of myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, but exercise test was not considered as a potential diagnostic test and was recorded only in 16% of the patient records. Likewise coronary angiogram was performed in 7% of patients. Only 23% of the patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction test result documented in their charts. In practice, 43% of GP patients were receiving an ACE inhibitor and one third betablockers. Only 9% received these drugs in combination. At the last interview, 50% had hypertension (blood pressure > or = 140/90) and 15% had not recorded this data in patients notes. This study identified, in a random sample of GP of Buenos Aires City and suburbs, that management of HF was less than optimal.", 
    "911": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are widely prescribed for hypertension and heart failure. These drugs are commonly associated with cough, and are less commonly associated with angioedema, which may be potentially life threatening. This review describes data that extend our understanding of the mechanisms of these reactions, and provides guidance about clinical management.", 
    "912": "For patients who develop angioedema from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, recent data are reassuring that the majority of such patients can tolerate angiotensin-II receptor blockers. These data support earlier conclusions that most patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough can tolerate angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Limited case reports suggest that in acute angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients refractory to standard treatment may benefit from the infusion of fresh frozen plasma.", 
    "913": "Although data are incomplete, it appears that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors cause cough and angioedema through a cascade of effects that begins with the accumulation of kinins, and then involves arachidonic acid metabolism and nitric oxide generation. Most patients who develop either cough or angioedema from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can tolerate angiotensin-II receptor blocking agents.",

    "916": "Patients who had taken an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or lipid-lowering agent for at least 3 consecutive months were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Morisky scale. Nonadherence was defined as taking < 80% of chronic cardiovascular medications based on prescription refill data over the previous 14 months.", 
    "917": "Forty-nine of 377 (13%) patients were categorized as nonadherent; however, only 12 (3%) patients had Morisky scores suggesting a high likelihood of nonadherence (3 or 4). While the Morisky score was a significant independent predictor of nonadherence by multivariate analysis, there was no threshold score or individual question that yielded concurrent high sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPVs) for identifying nonadherent patients. The internal consistency of the questions was low (alpha 0.32), as were item-to-total score correlations, suggesting that the individual questions were not measuring the same attribute.", 
    "918": "Using the Morisky scale to identify patients who have been nonadherent with chronic cardiovascular medications may be reasonable in some settings; however, the threshold score would have to be chosen based on a trade-off between sensitivity and PPV. These results were likely influenced by the low rate of nonadherence in this cohort. Rewording the questions, increasing the number of questions, and the use of graded response options may improve consistency.", 
    "919": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a critical role in the circulating or endocrine renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as well as the local regulation that exists in tissues such as the myocardium and skeletal muscle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of testis ACE (tACE) in complex with the first successfully designed ACE inhibitor captopril and enalaprilat, the Phe-Ala-Pro analogue. We have compared these structures with the recently reported structure of a tACE-lisinopril complex [Natesh et al. (2003) Nature 421, 551-554]. The analyses reveal that all three inhibitors make direct interactions with the catalytic Zn(2+) ion at the active site of the enzyme: the thiol group of captopril and the carboxylate group of enalaprilat and lisinopril. Subtle differences are also observed at other regions of the binding pocket. These are compared with N-domain models and discussed with reference to published biochemical data. The chloride coordination geometries of the three structures are discussed and compared with other ACE analogues. It is anticipated that the molecular details provided by these structures will be used to improve the binding and/or the design of new, more potent domain-specific inhibitors of ACE that could serve as new generation antihypertensive drugs.",

However, in the higher concentrations (from 100 nM to 10 microM), angiotensin II showed an inhibitory effect via AT(2) receptors. Captopril (1 microM) inhibited the biosynthesis of angiotensin II in the internal anal sphincter, antagonized the contractile effects of angiotensin I, and, importantly, caused a decrease in the basal tone. Amastatin inhibited the effects of angiotensin II while augmenting those of angiotensin III. In contrast, angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin IV had only minor effects in the internal anal sphincter. Angiotensin I, II, and III; angiotensin-converting enzyme; aminopeptidase A and aminopeptidase n; at(1); and at(2) receptors were shown to be present in the internal anal sphincter.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction occurs early in the insulin-resistant state and is predictive of future cardiovascular events. Similarly, insulin resistance has been associated with the metabolic syndrome, which also increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Approaches that improve endothelial dysfunction, such as treatment with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands, have been shown to prevent both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

    "941": "The mean reduction in sitting BP from baseline (on benazepril) to endpoint (after 8 weeks of treatment) was 17/14 mm Hg with amlodipine/benazepril and 5/7 mm Hg with benazepril (P <.0001). The percentage of patients who met the diastolic BP response criteria (<90 mm Hg at endpoint or > or =10 mm Hg decrease from baseline) was 80% in the amlodipine/benazepril group and 45% in the benazepril group (P <.0001). The incidence of adverse events was infrequent and comparable for both treatment groups.", 
    "942": "High-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy (5 mg/40 mg and 10 mg/40 mg) is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment option for hypertensive patients who do not respond adequately to benazepril alone.", 
    "943": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are thought to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients, mainly by decreasing angiotensin II (Ang II) formation. Chymase, a human mast cell protease, has recently been proposed to play a role in blood pressure regulation because of its Ang II-forming activity. Here we show that the predominant chymase mRNA species in the mouse aorta are those for types 4 and 5 isoforms, and that both are efficient Ang II-forming enzymes. Evaluation of ACE-dependent and ACE-independent Ang II-forming pathways in mast cell-deficient (Kit(w)/Kit(w-v)) mice and their mast cell-sufficient littermate (MC(+/+)) controls revealed that, in contrast to the latter, Kit(w)/Kit(w-v) mice fail to express chymase mRNAs in the vasculature and have almost no ACE-independent Ang II-forming activity in either isolated blood vessels or homogenates. Moreover, in MC(+/+) but not in Kit(w)/Kit(w-v) mice, a contribution of ACE-independent Ang II generation to blood pressure regulation was evident by a 1.6-fold greater maximal reduction in mean arterial pressure with acute ACE inhibition plus AT(1) receptor blockade than with ACE inhibition alone. Thus, mast cells are the source of the vascular ACE-independent pathway, and the antihypertensive benefit of combining ACE inhibitor therapy with AT(1) receptor antagonist therapy is most likely due to negation of chymase-catalyzed Ang II generation.", 
    "944": "To investigate the long-term effect, safety and tolerability of benazepril in general hypertensive patients.", 
    "945": "We conducted a three-year community-based postmarketing surveillance on benazepril among 1831 essential hypertensive patients (age range from 35 to 88 years) in Shanghai.", 
    "946": "74.3% of patients persisted in medication taking and were with optimal compliance in a 3-year-follow-up program. Among those taking medication as prescribed after 3 years, 75.7% of them attained systolic blood pressure (SBP) target level of 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), 87.4% attained diastolic blood pressure (DBP) target level of 90 mm Hg, and 71.5% attained total target level of 140/90 mm Hg. The reductions were approaching 15 mm Hg for SBP, 10 mm Hg for DBP, and 5 mm Hg for pulse pressure (PP) during the 3 year period. No serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were detected during the 3 years follow-up. Cough was the most common ADR. The cumulative incidence of benazepril related cough was 23.6% in women, significant higher than in men (18.8%).", 
    "947": "Benazepril was safe and tolerable when applied in hypertensive patients.", 
    "948": "To introduce the application of mixed linear model in the analysis of secular trend of blood pressure under antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "949": "A community-based postmarketing surveillance of benazepril was conducted in 1831 essential hypertensive patients (age range from 35 to 88 years) in Shanghai. Data of blood pressure was analyzed every 3 months with mixed linear model to describe the secular trend of blood pressure and changes of age-specific and gender-specific.", 
    "950": "The changing trends of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found to fit the curvilinear models. A piecewise model was fit for pulse pressure (PP), i.e., curvilinear model in the first 9 months and linear model after 9 months of taking medication. Both blood pressure and its velocity gradually slowed down. There were significant variation for the curve parameters of intercept, slope, and acceleration. Blood pressure in patients with higher initial levels was persistently declining in the 3-year-treatment. However blood pressures of patients with relatively low initial levels remained low when dropped down to some degree. Elderly patients showed high SBP but low DBP, so as with higher PP. The velocity and sizes of blood pressure reductions increased with the initial level of blood pressure.", 
    "951": "Mixed linear model is flexible and robust when applied to the analysis of longitudinal data but with missing values and can also make the maximum use of available information.", 
    "952": "Searching for markers triggering the vascular complications in diabetes mellitus, type 1, is a topical issue of modern endocrinology. The study focuses on the parameters of the kallikrein-kinin, rennin-angiotensin systems and on proteolysis inhibitors involved in hemodynamics regulation. It was established that, at earlier diabetes stages, which are characterized by polyuria, the activity of blood-plasma kallikrein is increasing, while, at the disease later stages and in the process of nephropathy progression, there is an increasing activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme accompanied by an essential suppression of the alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor.", 
    "953": "Perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a well-recognized antihypertensive drug. Its ability to protect against cardiovascular events in hypertension has also been demonstrated. It decreases the stiffness of the larger arteries; questions remain as to the mechanisms involved and whether it is blood pressure (BP) control-dependent.", 
    "954": "To correlate the BP response to ACE inhibition therapy with changes in arterial stiffness as evaluated by pulse wave velocity (PWV), and to correlate these changes in arterial stiffness with alterations in indicators of vascular collagen metabolism serum levels of metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1).", 
    "955": "A total of 162 patients aged 18 to 70 years with stage 1 and 2 essential hypertension (diastolic BP 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg) were enrolled to receive six months (M6) of therapy with the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. Patients were either treatment-na\u00efve or had not received any antihypertensive treatment for at least six months before the study.", 
    "956": "Mean BP was significantly reduced after two months (M2) of therapy (P=0.00001) and remained stable thereafter. In addition to the significant mean changes in PWV observed at M2 (P=0.00001), further reductions in PWV were noted at M6 (P=0.007). The change in PWV between baseline (M0) and M2 was significantly correlated to all BP parameters at M0 (correlation coefficient at M2 was 0.189 or greater). However, no correlation was seen regarding BP parameters at M2 and further M2 to M6 changes in PWV, suggesting a decrease of arterial stiffness independent of BP reduction. The expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-1 was highly variable and demonstrated no correlation with BP or PWV.", 
    "957": "Reductions in BP and PWV appear to be correlated during the first two months of perindopril therapy. After six months, PWV continues to decrease independently of any further reduction in BP, suggesting the occurrence of a pressure-independent pharmacological remodelling of the arterial wall. A long-term, double-blind, randomized trial could be required to confirm that the observed increase in vascular distensibility induced by perindopril is related to a mechanism of action other than a reduction in BP."
