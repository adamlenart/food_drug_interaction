    "0": "Gender-specific differences in the incidence of cardiovascular disease have long been known, and estrogens have been considered to be responsible for this dissimilarity. Recently, the steep increase in cardiovascular risk in the no longer fertile woman has become evident. The postmenopausal metabolic syndrome is very frequent, with obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, which convey increased sodium reabsorption, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle growth. The clinical corollary of these overall changes is hypertension. Gender differences in components of the renin-angiotensin system have been shown to exist, and may play a central role in blood pressure control. In normotensive populations, plasma renin activity is significantly higher in men than in women, and is higher in postmenopausal versus premenopausal women. Two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ramipril and moexipril, have undergone trials aimed specifically at older people with cardiovascular risk and with postmenopausal hypertension, and could be the first therapeutic choice. However, a comprehensive treatment should include nonpharmacologic measures with strong emphasis on weight normalization and regular physical activity, prevention of osteoporosis, as well as decisions on the use of estrogen replacement therapy and treatment of the menopausal metabolic syndrome. Finally, education of both patients and physicians on the nature and prognosis of untreated hypertension is crucial.", 
    "1": "Cardiovascular risk factors are identified as physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral, and include hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and hyperglycemia. These factors constitute the \"cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome\" and damage the vascular endothelium by increasing concentrations of reactive molecular species, ultimately increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Multiple risk factors, particularly hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, often coexist in the same individual. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been demonstrated to upregulate the AT(1) receptor, leading to increases in blood pressure. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia with medications, such as the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins that decrease AT(1) receptor expression and activation, reduce not only cholesterol but blood pressure as well. Treatment of hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may also reduce cholesterol. Recognition and identification of multiple risk factors and appropriate treatment in a manner that minimizes excessive oxidative stress is critical to the maintenance of normal endothelial cell function and cardiovascular risk reduction.", 
    "2": "Reduction of elevated blood pressure clearly protects against target organ damage, but the different targets do not necessarily benefit to the same degree. There is considerable debate over whether or not there is a drug-specific benefit above and beyond that conferred by blood pressure reduction alone. We performed a Medline search to identify recent randomized clinical trials including 300 or more patients who were followed for at least 2 years. We critically reviewed these papers to find like trials for comparisons. There was too much dissimilarity to perform a meaningful meta-analysis. We found that the literature does not support a definitive conclusion either in favor of or against an overall drug-specific protective effect. However, by grouping like trials, it is possible to support an additional protective effect by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on reducing the rate of decline in renal function and in reducing proteinuria.",

    "5": "In the Cardiovascular Health Study, 5888 adults 65 years and older were recruited from 4 US centers. At baseline, participants underwent an extensive examination that included the measurement of BP, use of medications, and other risk factors. Participants were followed up with annual visits that assessed BP and medication use from baseline in 1989-1990 through the examination in 1998-1999. The primary outcome measures were control of BP to levels lower than than 140/90 mm Hg and the prevalence of use of various classes of antihypertensive medications.", 
    "6": "The awareness, treatment, and control of high BP improved during the 1990s. The proportions aware and treated were higher among blacks than whites, though control prevalences were similar. For both groups combined, the control of high BP to lower than 140/90 mm Hg increased from 37% at baseline to 49% in 1999. The 51% whose BP was not controlled generally had isolated mild to moderate elevations in systolic BP. Among treated persons, the improvement in control was achieved in part by a mean increase of 0.2 antihypertensive medications per person over the course of 9 years. Improved control was also achieved by increasing the proportion of the entire Cardiovascular Health Study population that was treated for hypertension, from 34.5% in 1990 to 51.1% in 1999. Time trends in antihypertensive drug use were pronounced. Among those without coronary disease, the use of low-dose diuretics and beta-blockers decreased, while the use of newer agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-blockers increased.", 
    "7": "While control of high BP improved in the 1990s, about half the participants with hypertension had uncontrolled BP, primarily mild to moderate elevations in systolic BP. Low-dose diuretics and beta-blockers--the preferred agents since 1993 according to the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure--remained underused. More widespread use of these agents will be an important intervention to prevent the devastating complications of hypertension, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.", 
    "8": "Long-term hypertension has been implicated as one of the greatest risk factors for the cause of stroke, but yet it is a very controllable one. The risks of stroke increase with age and, as the population of the United States grows older, the number of people who will experience a stroke will greatly increase. In the past, various antihypertensive therapies have proved to lower blood pressure with a resulting decrease in stroke. Stroke can be devastating in terms of quality of life and cost of care; therefore, prevention of stroke should become a priority for all health care professionals. As newer antihypertensive classes of drugs are being studied in high-risk cardiovascular populations, health care professionals need to educate themselves and their patients regarding new treatment options, where these options belong within treatment guidelines for hypertension, and their relevance in preventing the incidence of stroke. This review briefly summarizes the significance of controlling hypertension to reduce the risk of stroke by reviewing some of the clinical trials that support pharmacologic intervention.", 
    "9": "This study examined adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy among 171 heart failure clinic patients. Adherence was monitored over a 3-month period with an electronic event monitor housed in a medication bottle cap, which recorded the date and time the cap was opened and closed. The average percentage of days that the prescribed number of doses (regimen adherence) was taken over the observation period was 84%. Seventy-one percent of patients showed 85%-100% adherence with their daily regimen; 19% exhibited less than 70% adherence. The overall high rates of adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy observed among heart failure clinic patients is consistent with research that shows improved outcomes for patients managed in heart failure clinics. Electronic medication monitoring can be useful in identifying a substantial fraction of patients who are poorly adherent so that interventions to improve adherence can be targeted toward them. Additional research is needed to develop and test adherence-enhancing interventions.",

Obstructive coronary artery disease was documented by coronary angiography in 154 of 177 patients (87%). Coronary revascularization was performed in 96 of 177 patients (54%). Five of 177 patients (3%) died during hospitalization. Compared to use before hospitalization, at hospital discharge the use of aspirin increased from 43% to 84% (p<0.001), the use of clopidogrel increased from 21% to 54% (p<0.001), the use of beta blockers increased from 38% to 76% (p<0.001), the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased from 42% to 70% (p<0.001), the use of long-acting nitrates increased from 15% to 31% (p<0.001), and the use of calcium channel blockers decreased from 28% to 23% (p=NS).

The effects of valsartan were tested by ANCOVA, controlling for baseline values and concomitant ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers. BNP and NE concentrations were similar at baseline in the 2 groups and were decreased by valsartan starting at 4 months and up to 24 months. BNP increased over time in the placebo group. At the end point, least-squares mean (+/-SEM) BNP increased from baseline by 23+/-5 pg/mL in the placebo group (n=1979) but decreased by 21+/-5 pg/mL (n=1940) in the valsartan group (P<0.0001). NE increased by 41+/-6 pg/mL (n=1979) and 12+/-6 pg/mL (n=1941) for placebo and valsartan, respectively (P=0.0003).

Valsartan caused sustained reduction in BNP and attenuated the increase in NE over the course of the study. These neurohormone effects of valsartan are consistent with the clinical benefits reported in Val-HeFT.",

    "15": "Patients with DCM (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%) participated in this case-control study. Nine patients underwent immunoadsorption with protein A (low affinity to IgG-3), and 9 patients were treated with anti-IgG, which removes all IgG subclasses. Immunoadsorption was performed in 4 courses at 1-month intervals until month 3. In the 2 groups, immunoadsorption induced comparable reduction of total IgG (>80%). IgG-3 was effectively eliminated only by anti-IgG adsorption (eg, during the first immunoadsorption course; protein A, -37+/-4%; anti-IgG, -89+/-3%; P<0.001 versus protein A). The beta1-receptor autoantibody was effectively reduced only by anti-IgG (P<0.01 versus protein A). Hemodynamics did not change in the protein A group. In the anti-IgG group during the first immunoadsorption course, cardiac index increased from 2.3+/-0.1 to 3.0+/-0.1 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (P<0.01 versus protein A). After 3 months, before the last immunoadsorption course, cardiac index was 2.2+/-0.1 L x min(-1) x m(-2) in the protein A group and 3.0+/-0.2 L x min(-1) x m(-2) in the anti-IgG group (P<0.01 versus protein A). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased only in the anti-IgG group (P<0.05 versus protein A).",

    "17": "Hypertension is a risk factor for stroke and may also contribute to the development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD). Cognitive complications of hypertension and the influence of anti-hypertensive treatment were underestimated until recently. In this paper, trials investigating the effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on cognitive function were evaluated. Analysis of these studies revealed that until approximately 1990-1995 investigations have assessed primarily if anti-hypertensive treatment impaired cognitive function. Only more recent studies have investigated positive effects on cognition of anti-hypertensive medication. Drugs more extensively evaluated were diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sartanes and Ca(2+) channel blockers. Available studies have confirmed that elevated diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure and isolated systolic hypertension play an important role in the development of cognitive impairment. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided evidence that reduction of hypertension safely and effectively decreases morbidity and mortality rates and cognitive complications of hypertension. Ca(2+) channel blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective and probably better than diuretics and beta-blockers on cognitive domains of hypertension. More extensive investigations could contribute to establishing optimal choice and drug dosage for the treatment of cognitive complications of hypertension.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine alpha(S2)-casein (alpha(S2)-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 microM. Peptides alpha(S2)-CN (f174-181) and alpha(S2)-CN (f174-179) had IC50 values of 4 microM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity.", 
    "19": "The concept of drug class effect is profoundly rooted in clinical practice. The use of drugs seen as similar in their clinical effects--and therefore interchangeable--is very frequent: two examples of this are the use of beta-blockers in arterial hypertension and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure. The definition of drug class effect is based on three concepts: a similar chemical structure (for example, the dihydropyridine ring of some calcium channel blockers), a similar mechanism of action (beta-blockers block adrenoreceptors), or similar pharmacological effects (antihypertensives, antianginals, etc.). In this article, we will describe the type of evidence that a cardiologist can use in order to select a specific drug (from within a class). It constitutes a clinical approach, different from the one that might be used by a third party payer (more interested in cost-effectiveness issues) or the pharmaceutical industry (more interested in promoting sales). As usual, the recommendations are based on the strength of scientific evidence.", 
    "20": "The analysis of the literature data on quality of life (QL) in arterial hypertension (AH) demonstrates that ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists improve QL while such data on diuretics effect are contradictable. The comparison of pharmacological and surgical treatment effects on QL in patients with coronary heart disease shows that functionally and emotionally CHD patients benefit more from coronary artery bypass surgery. In early chronic cardiac failure QL falls because of the necessity to take treatment, lower everyday activity, work limitations. Later, QL deterioration depends on severity of cardiac activity decompensation is independent of central hemodynamics, myocardial contractility and psychological status of the patient. Adequate use of QL assessment may raise efficacy of treatment of circulatory diseases.",

Purification of these compounds was conducted with the application of various chromatographic methods. The structures of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of MS and NMR data analysis. Compounds 1-4 inhibited the angiotensin I converting enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds 1-4 showed the 50% inhibitory concentration values of 596, 483, 534, and 460 micro M, respectively. The presence of these active components may be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive action of traditional crude drug Cuscuta Semen.",

Nevertheless so far, there is no published controlled study of long-term antithrombotic therapy in patients with CHF.

A total of 417 consecutive patients surviving at hospital discharge were included in the database. The average follow-up period was 5 years.

Oral anticoagulants, aspirin, lipid lowering drugs and beta-blockers use were associated with better survival. There was no interaction between aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor use on survival.", 
    "25": "Antithrombotic therapy was associated with a better long-term survival in our study population of severe CHF.

Compared with the reference values for healthy adults, the mean E:I ratios and the median 30:15 ratios standing were all essentially normal. The median 30:15 ratios tilt and the mean Valsalva ratios were all significantly below the reference value (P for all cases <0.050). Comparing three groups, there were no significant differences for mean E:I ratio (P=0.111), 30:15 tilt (P=0.619) and 30:15 standing (P=0.167), whereas there were significant differences for the mean Valsalva ratios (P=0.001).

    "35": "Losartan decreased the serum uric acid concentration (from 5.9 +/- 0.9 to 5.2 +/- 1.0 mg/dl) and increased its fractional clearance, which reached a maximum after 2 hours, while enalapril did not. Losartan also induced an increase in the plasma concentration of hypoxanthine, peaking in the fourth hour, and a decrease in its urinary clearance, while the plasma xanthine concentration and its urinary clearance were unchanged. The extent of uric acid excretion was much greater than that of the oxypurines.",

    "42": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of endogenous thrombolysis, thereby promoting thrombosis. PAI-1 is also a primary contributor to the development and recurrence of acute myocardial infarction. The renin angiotensin system, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and estrogen all influence the fibrinolytic system and PAI-1 in particular. Available data strongly suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hormone replacement therapy with estrogen beneficially reduce PAI-1 production. Metformin, an agent commonly used for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), appears to favorably decrease PAI-1 production in NIDDM patients but not nondiabetic patients. Among the cholesterol-lowering statins, clinical literature evaluating pravastatin provides the most compelling data to support this agent's favorable effect on PAI-1. Other available statins either have not displayed an effect on PAI-1 or do not have clear data to conclusively define their effects on the fibrinolytic system.",

Treatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of HF by approximately 50%, even among very elderly patients. Diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear more effective than calcium channel blockers and doxazosin. Hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce the incidence of HF by approximately 20% among patients with hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease. ACE inhibitors reduce HF incidence by 37% among patients with reduced systolic function and by 23% among patients with coronary artery disease and normal systolic function. Observational studies have shown lower HF incidence among people with diabetes with better glycemic control. Unfortunately, all of these effective therapies appear to be underused, and control of hypertension is particularly poor.",

    "48": "Recent results from 4,300 patients enrolled in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) confirmed that BNP is the strongest predictor of outcome in heart failure, when compared to other neurohormones and clinical markers. The current use of BNP in the screening and diagnosis of heart failure and its possible future roles are presented.", 
    "49": "In recent years, there has been an impressive accumulation of data supporting an important role of BNP as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of heart failure. Development of rapid, accurate and affordable diagnostic methods will allow the routine monitoring of BNP in a wide spectrum of settings, from general practice to controlled clinical trials.", 
    "50": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) renography is the only imaging examination that tests directly for the presence of renovascular hypertension (RVH); other imaging examinations test for the presence of renal artery stenosis (RAS). The goals of ACEI renography are two-fold: 1) to detect those patients with hypertension who have renal artery stenosis as the cause of their hypertension and who would benefit from revascularization, and 2) to determine which hypertensive patients do not have renovascular hypertension and obviate the expense and risk of angiography and, potentially, revascularization. This review summarizes general components of renal scintigraphy (pretest voiding, hydration, patient position, relative uptake, time to peak height of the renogram curve, 20 min/max ratio, postvoid images, quality control) as well as those components specific to ACEI renography (choice of radiopharmaceutical, choice of ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, parenchymal mean transit time, monitoring of blood pressure, 1 versus 2 day protocols and omission of the baseline study). ACEI renography is highly accurate in patients with suspected RVH who have normal or near normal renal function. In this patient population, the sensitivity and specificity of ACEI renography for renovascular hypertension exceed 90%; angiography as an initial approach is not cost effective. Data from 10 studies evaluating cure or improvement in blood pressure in 291 patients undergoing revascularization showed the mean positive predictive value of ACEI renography to be 92%. When azotemic patients present with suspected RVH, as many as 50% of patients may have an intermediate probability ACEI renogram and the sensitivity of detecting RVH falls to approximately 80% even when intermediate and high probability tests are combined.", 
    "51": "The renal community is faced with an ever increasing number of patients reaching end-stage renal failure. Clinical studies have provided clear evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and probably also AT1 receptor antagonists, at least in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, slow disease progression to end-stage renal failure. This protective effect of drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are in part independent of reduction in systemic blood pressure, but involve normalization of glomerular hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration, restoration of altered glomerular barrier function, and reduction of stimulated tubular fluid reabsorption. Angiotensin II (ANG II) has emerged in the last decade as a multifunctional cytokine exhibiting many non-hemodynamic properties such as acting as a growth factor and profibrogenic cytokine, and even having proinflammatory properties. This review tries to bridge the classical hemodynamic actions of ANG II in the kidney with the more recently characterized effects of this vasopeptide. Finally, clinical implications are suggested based on data from clinical studies. A thorough understanding of the RAS is important to recognize the potential of nephroprotective strategies through inhibition of its components.", 
    "52": "It is well established that renin-angiotensin system blockers exert NO/prostacyclin-dependent antithrombotic effects. Because some beneficial effects of these drugs are mediated by angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), in the present study we examined if their antithrombotic action could be mediated by Ang-(1-7). Intravenous infusion of Ang-(1-7) (1, 10, or 100 pmol/kg per minute for 2 hours) into rats developing venous thrombosis caused 50% to 70% reduction of the thrombus weight. This effect was dose-dependently reversed by cotreatment with A-779 (selective Ang-[1-7] receptor antagonist) or EXP 3174 (angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist) but not by PD 123,319 (angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonist). Similarly, the antithrombotic effects of captopril (ACE inhibitor) and losartan (angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker) were attenuated by A-779 in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of Ang-(1-7) was completely abolished by concomitant administration of NO synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) and prostacyclin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin), as has been shown previously for captopril and losartan. Thus, the antithrombotic effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers involves Ang-(1-7)-evoked release of NO and prostacyclin.", 
    "53": "Obesity is the prime risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Recent clinical trials have shown that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, either by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme or blocking the angiotensin type 1 receptor, may substantially lower the risk for type 2 diabetes. The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Based on our recent observation that angiotensin II markedly inhibits adipogenic differentiation of human adipocytes via the angiotensin type I receptor and that expression of angiotensin II-forming enzymes in adipose tissue is inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity, we propose the hypothesis that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system prevents diabetes by promoting the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. Increased formation of adipocytes would counteract the ectopic deposition of lipids in other tissues (muscle, liver, pancreas), thereby improving insulin sensitivity and preventing the development of type 2 diabetes.",

Each group consisted of 10 rats. Five rats, randomly selected from each group, were killed at the 8th and 16th week after treatment. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis, collagen volume fraction (CVF), perivascular collagen area (PVCA) and Ang II concentrations of plasma and myocardium were examined.", 
    "56": "Compared with the controls at the 8th and 16th week, systolic blood pressures were similarly decreased in both treatment groups. Left ventricular weight and left ventricular mass indexes were significantly lower in both treatment groups. However, the latter parameter at the 16th week was reduced to a less extent in the fosinopril group than that in the losartan group. Compared with the controls, cardiomycyte apoptotic index was significantly reduced at the 8th week only in the fosinopril group, and at the 16th week in both treatment groups. The index of the fosinopril group was lower than that of the losartan group at the latter endpoint examined. Compared with the controls, the left ventricular collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area at the 8th and 16th weeks were significantly reduced in the SHRs treated with either fosinopril or losartan. However, the collagen volume fraction at the latter endpoint in the fosinopril group was lower than that in the losartan group. Compared with the controls at endpoints, plasma and myocardium Ang II levels were significantly increased in the losartan group. However, plasma Ang II concentrations were not altered, and myocardium Ang II concentrations at the 8th and 16th weeks were significantly reduced in the fosinopril group.", 
    "57": "Both losartan and fosinopril could effectively inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis and reverse heart hypertrophy. Fosinopril may be more effective in these cardioprotective effects, suggesting that the effects of both drugs are related to the inhibition of myocardium renin-angiotension-aldsterone system.",

Value of oxygen pressure in arterial blood (PaO(2)) increased to (70.48 +/- 9.54) mm Hg from (35.08 +/- 4.59) mm Hg. In the mean time, ratio of wet to dry lung weight was returned to nearly normal. So, it indicated that high-dose of oleic acid could only induce mild lung injury, and the development of ARDS was obviously inhibited by ACEI.",

This evidence is based on recent studies showing that losartan and irbesartan can prevent the development of overt diabetic nephropathy in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients as well as slow the velocity of progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with overt type 2 diabetic nephropathy. These studies do not deny the possibility that ACEi are equally effective, but studies of an adequate magnitude are lacking. These findings on ARB administration do not preclude the importance of strict control of blood pressure and proteinuria and/or albuminuria to avoid or retard renal damage in type 2 diabetic patients.", 
    "70": "Over recent years, a target blood pressure of 125/75 mm Hg has been sought in order to reduce the rate of chronic renal disease (CKD) progression and cardiovascular mortality. Some antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers also may be capable of reducing CKD progression because they halt some of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in renal damage. The possibility that combination treatments with ACE inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers may confer additive or even synergistic renoprotective effects other than blood pressure control is not only fascinating, but also particularly important because multidrug antihypertensive regimens are required to obtain adequate blood pressure in the majority of patients with CKD. This combination may provide better blood pressure control, appears to be better tolerated with fewer side effects than either drug alone, and may exert a greater renoprotective effect in patients at risk for renal failure than either an ACE inhibitors or a calcium channel blocker. However, the current available data are too few to confirm this hypothesis. Cardiovascular disease accounts for more than 50% of the deaths of hemodialysis patients. Thus, care must be taken to prevent and treat the cardiovascular risk factors optimally from the early phase of CKD, and for this reason effective antihypertensive therapy is the most important treatment, not only in order to delay CKD progression, but also to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. In this perspective combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers can give further advantages.", 
    "71": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or with angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers has been shown to reduce proteinuria and to slow down the progression of renal disease in diabetic and non-diabetic primary proteinuric nephropathies.

No other relevant adverse event was recorded. The blood pressure goal (<125/75 mm Hg) was achieved by week 4 in all treatment groups (P<0.005 when compared to baseline), and afterwards the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained below these values until the end of the trial with no statistically significant differences between groups.

    "75": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that proteins filtered by the glomerulus induce a proliferation of proximal tubular cells accompanied by an increased synthesis of many vasoactive and proinflammatory substances. The appearance of interstitial cellular infiltrates, a well-known finding in proteinuric diseases, precedes progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Activation of the transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a pivotal role in the renal damage induced by proteinuria. In this scenario, any therapeutic intervention that reduces proteinuria should be beneficial for the kidney. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA)] have repeatedly shown striking antiproteinuric and renoprotective properties, both in experimental and clinical studies. Studies in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetic nephropathy as well as in non-diabetic nephropathies have confirmed that the renoprotection obtained with ACEI/ARA is closely related with their antiproteinuric effect and is largely independent of blood pressure changes. However, resistance to the antiproteinuric effect of ACEI/ARA is a common clinical observation. Several therapeutic measures (that is, adequate blood pressure control, early introduction of ACEI/ARA, dietary protein restriction, low salt diets, weight loss in overweight patients, addition of a diuretic, increasing ACEI/ARA dose titrated against proteinuria levels, combined therapy ACEI plus ARA, addition of drugs with antiproteinuric effect such as non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers or NSAIDs) may increase the proteinuria reduction induced by ACEI and ARA.",

However, the role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the prevention of proteinuria and GS remains controversial and in most cases only dihidropyridine-CCBs are studied. Few studies have reported whether the time at which drug administration is initiated plays a role in the reduction of proteinuria and GS.",

Biochemical and histological analysis were performed to compare the efficacy of a non-dihydropyridine-CCB diltiazem [DZM; 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day], an ACEI quinapril (10 mg/kg BW/day), or both in diminishing proteinuria and GS, and to determine their role in effective prevention and treatment.", 
    "78": "Only quinapril was able to diminish proteinuria. As far as histological lesions, both treatments were effective, although only quinapril prevented GS. The combination of quinapril plus DZM did not demonstrate any beneficial effects. Surprisingly, quinapril ameliorated the damage of podocytes whereas DZM did not, thus leading to doubt concerning the efficiency of DZM in long-term studies. Nonetheless, the combination of quinapril plus DZM demonstrated a greater reduction in podocyte damage than treatment with DZM alone, which shows an interesting association in the prevention of longer-term glomerular damage. Few differences were found between prevention and treatment.",

    "80": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) regulates a number of genes associated with progression of renal disease. The regulation of gene expression by Ang II occurs through specific receptors that are linked to changes in the activity of transcription factors within the nucleus of target cells. In particular, members of the nuclear factor-kappaB family of transcription factors are activated, which in turn fuels at least two autocrine reinforcing loops that amplify Ang II and tumor necrosis factor-alpha formation. Angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists (AIIAs) differ both pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Several ACE inhibitors (such as captopril, enalapril and lisinopril) are dialyzable, whereas all of the AIIAs studied are not. Dose titration may be necessary when administering ACE inhibitors to patients with renal failure (ESRD), but is rarely a consideration when AIIAs are used.", 
    "81": "Emerging evidence suggests that angiotensin II (Ang II) is not only a vasoactive peptide, but also a true cytokine that regulates cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis. Many studies have demonstrated that this peptide plays an active role in the progression of renal injury. Some of Ang II-induced effects are mediated by the production of a large array of growth factors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Ang II could regulate the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the kidney and its correlation with the Ang II-induced renal damage.", 
    "82": "The model of Ang II-induced renal damage was done by systemic Ang II infusion into normal rats (50 ng/kg/min; subcutaneous osmotic minipumps). In addition, the implication of Ang II was investigated in a model of immune complex nephritis in rats treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril. The mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and/or Northern blot, and protein levels by Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry.", 
    "83": "Rats infused with Ang II for 3 days caused elevated renal expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; gene and protein levels). TNF-alpha positive cells were observed in glomeruli (mainly in endothelial cells), tubules and vessels. In rats with immune complex nephritis, the renal overexpression of TNF-alpha was diminished by the ACE inhibitor quinapril. Systemic infusion of Ang II also increased renal synthesis of cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6) and chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1) that were associated with elevated tissue levels of activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the presence of inflammatory cell infiltration.",

Ang II also up-regulates other proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, MCP-1 and NF-kappaB, coincidentally associated to the presence of glomerular and interstitial inflammatory cells in the kidney. All these data further strengthen the idea that Ang II plays an active role in the inflammatory response in renal diseases.", 
    "85": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), fenoldopam, and saline in preventing radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) in high-risk patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures. We prospectively enrolled 123 patients who were scheduled for cardiovascular procedures and had a baseline creatinine > 1.6 mg/dl or creatinine clearance of < 60 ml/min. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either saline (0.45% normal saline at 1 cc/kg) for 12 hr before and 12 hr after the procedure, or fenoldopam (0.1 microg/kg/min) plus saline for 4 hr prior and 4 hr after the procedure, or NAC orally (600 mg) plus saline every 12 hr for 24 hr prior and 24 hr after the procedure. All the patients received low-osmolality nonionic contrast. RCIN was defined as an increase in creatinine level > 0.5 mg/dl after 48 hr. The incidence of RCIN was 17.7% in the NAC group, 15.3% in the saline group, and 15.7% in the fenoldopam group (P = 0.919). Of the 20 patients who developed RCIN, 2 required dialysis. Serum creatinine decreased after 48 hr (vs. baseline) in 38% patients in the NAC group, 18% in the fenoldopam group, and 15% in the saline group. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, NAC or fenoldopam offered no additional benefit over hydration with saline in preventing RCIN.", 
    "86": "Combination of nonhypotensive doses of valsartan and enalapril markedly improved survival (+87%) compared with untreated animals (37%) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with endothelial dysfunction. However, the combination had no effect on kidney function, and proteinuria persisted over the 12 weeks of the study. It was hypothesized that the greater survival was due to improvement in endothelial function or coronary vasculature despite blockade of nitric oxide synthase and high blood pressure. Therefore, endothelial function was evaluated in isolated aortic ring and maximal coronary blood flow was studied in isolated perfused SHR hearts (20-24 weeks) treated with -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (50 mg/l) for 4 weeks. The animals received vehicle, valsartan 5 mg/kg/d, enalapril 1 mg/kg/d, valsartan 50 mg/kg/d, or the combination valsartan 5 mg/kg/d with enalapril 1 mg/kg/d in drinking water. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as control. Blood pressure was measured by telemetry. Histopathology was performed on heart, kidney (hematoxylin-eosin), and aorta (Masson trichrome). L-NAME elevated blood pressure by 50 mm Hg after vehicle (199 +/- 5 mm Hg). Valsartan 50 mg/kg/d completely abolished this increase (150 +/- 4 mm Hg) whereas the valsartan-enalapril combination synergistically decreased blood pressure (-37 mm Hg at 162 +/- 7 mm Hg) compared with monotherapy (valsartan 5 mg/kg/d -10 mm Hg; enalapril 1 mg/kg/d -15 mm Hg). All treatments improved the histopathology, most markedly in those receiving the valsartan-enalapril combination. The severity mean grades for lesions were 2.1, 1.9, 1.7, 1.1, and 0.9 in vehicle-treated SHRs, enalapril 1 mg/kg/d, valsartan 5 mg/kg/d, valsartan 5 or 50 mg/kg/d, and the valsartan-enalapril combination, respectively, compared with 0.02 in WKY rats. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly greater in treated SHRs than after vehicle (-40% at 0.1 mmol acetylcholine) but the combination induced the maximal relaxation (-85%). The ratio of maximal tension induced by serotonin in rings with and without endothelium was 1.4 and 1.3 in vehicle and valsartan 5 mg/kg/d-treated rats whereas it did not differ from 1 in WKY rats and all other treated groups. The cardiac hypertrophy (+27%) was prevented by valsartan 50 mg/kg/d and the valsartan-enalapril combination. Coronary reserve was significantly increased by valsartan 50 mg/kg/d (+85% at 7.8 +/- 0.7 ml/min/g) and the valsartan-enalapril combination (+42% at 6.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min/g) compared with 4.2 +/- 0.5 (vehicle). This was not different of 8.8 +/- 0.5 (WKYs). Despite the maintenance of a high blood pressure, low-dose valsartan-enalapril significantly improved endothelial function and histopathology and increased coronary reserve in SHRs chronically receiving L-NAME.",

Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms were carried out at screening (recruiting scan), randomization (baseline scan) and after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. Baseline and treatment echocardiograms were read at two central labs without knowledge of the scan time sequence. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (196 patients), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were significantly and equally reduced by the two treatments. Candesartan and enalapril reduced LVMI to the same extent, i.e. by 15.0 and 13.1 g/m2 (-10.9 and -8.4%; P<0.001 for both). The proportion of patients achieving normalization of LVMI was non-significantly higher with candesartan (36.3 versus 28.6%). Similar results were obtained in per-protocol (PP) analyses. Cough incidence was lower with candesartan ( P<0.03).",

    "91": "Recent randomized trials of antihypertensive therapy providing information about cardiovascular and renal risk in diabetes, blood pressure goals and best suitable drugs were reviewed.", 
    "92": "Evidence that association of type-2 diabetes with hypertension markedly increases cardiovascular and renal risk is incontrovertible: even blood pressure values in the high-normal range represent a more relevant risk than in non-diabetics. More versus less intensive blood pressure lowering or active versus placebo treatment can significantly prevent cardiovascular and renal events, with a particularly consistent reduction of proteinuria and microalbuminuria. Although several of the trials showing significant reduction of cardiovascular or renal risk achieved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 75 and 82 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mmHg was never achieved in trials showing cardiovascular benefits and SBP 130 mmHg was only achieved in two trials in normotensive subjects showing proteinuria reduction. The recommendation given by all major guidelines to lower SBP 130 mmHg appears to be difficult to comply with. Evidence of the superiority or inferiority of different drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics and beta-blockers) is rather vague, especially for cardiovascular protection. As to angiotensin-receptor antagonists, losartan has shown significant cardiovascular protection over a beta-blocker, and irbesartan, although not showing cardiovascular benefits over a calcium antagonist, was significantly better in retarding renal dysfunction and failure.", 
    "93": "In most trials on hypertensive diabetics, the large majority of patients were on two, three and even four-drug therapy. Therefore, it appears reasonable that all effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agents can be used in association to achieve DBP 80 mmHg and, whenever possible, SBP 130 or 135 mmHg, with the regular inclusion of an angiotensin-receptor antagonist for its proven renoprotective action. Hopefully, better guidance will be provided by further trials.",

Additional factors such as chronic infection and stone formation will then render the kidney more vulnerable to progressive loss of renal mass and subsequent chronic renal failure. As in other patients with renal insufficiency, the control of hypertension, preferably with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and adequate nutrition are mainstays of nephrological care. The modality of dialysis in these patients is complicated by ventriculoperitoneal shunts or urinary stomata in peritoneal dialysis, or difficult vascular access in haemodialysis. Renal transplantation is now considered the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease in all age groups. Although more prone to complications, recent data on patients with meningomyelocele or severely abnormal lower urinary tracts demonstrate excellent patient and graft outcomes.",

Various enzyme inhibitors and a lower pH buffer were applied to discover the major enzyme(s) involved in each process. Metabolic pathways showing degradative processes were proposed for both analogs. The major cleavage site occurs at the W(1)-M(2) for CCK4. At least three metabolic pathways occur independently for CCK8 and appear at peptides bonds between G(4)-W(5), M(6)-D(7), and D(7)-F(NH(2))(8). Many different enzymes of aminopeptidase, endopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, metalloenzyme, and others were involved in each process. Identification of more specific yet safe enzyme inhibitors and co-administration of various these inhibitors may lead to further enhancement in intestinal peptide absorption when administered orally.", 
    "98": "Cardiovascular complications are frequently encountered in the HIV-infected population. Cardiac care providers should implement appropriate preventive, screening, and therapeutic strategies to maximize survival and quality of life in this increasingly treatable, chronic disease. All HIV-infected individuals should undergo periodic cardiac evaluation, including echocardiography, in order to identify subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can result from, or be exacerbated by, a variety of treatable infectious, endocrine, nutritional, and immunologic disorders. Aggressive diagnosis and treatment of these conditions may lead to improvement or even normalization of myocardial function. Endomyocardial biopsy should be considered to direct etiology-specific therapy. Standard measures for the prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure are recommended for HIV-infected patients. Afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be indicated for patients with elevated afterload and preclinical LV dysfunction diagnosed by echocardiogram. However, judicious drug selection and titration are necessary in this cohort of patients with frequent autonomic dysfunction, at risk for a number of potentially lethal drug interactions. Carnitine, selenium, and multivitamin supplementation should be considered, especially in those with wasting or diarrhea syndromes. Monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions have been demonstrated to preserve LV parameters in HIV-infected children; ventricular recovery has been documented in some children with recalcitrant HIV-related cardiomyopathy following IVIG infusion. We support the use of immunomodulatory therapy in the pediatric population, and look forward to further study into the efficacy and broader application of this approach. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be associated with dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. This should be treated with dietary and possibly with pharmacologic interventions. Drug interactions need to be considered when instituting pharmacologic therapies. Pericardial effusions are often seen in patients with advanced HIV infection. Asymptomatic effusions are most often nonspecific in nature, related to the proinflammatory milieu found in advanced AIDS. Nonspecific effusions are a marker of advanced disease and do not require exhaustive etiologic evaluation. In contrast, large or symptomatic effusions are often associated with infection or malignancy, and warrant thorough investigation and etiology-specific treatment.",

Physicians should include myocarditis in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have new symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmia, or chest pain syndromes of unclear cause, and should strongly consider performing endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) to establish the diagnosis. It may be necessary to perform multiple or serial biopsies to increase sensitivity. Patients with myocarditis and symptomatic heart failure, chest pain, or arrhythmias need hospitalization for evaluation and treatment. Patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction should be treated with conventional heart failure therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics, and beta-blockers. Patients with arrhythmias or syncope may require electrophysiologic evaluation. In addition to conventional therapy, physicians should consider a course of immunosuppressive therapy in selected patients. The clinical course, response to therapy, and left ventricular function need close monitoring. Patients with myocarditis and rapidly progressive heart failure or cardiogenic shock should be referred early to an advanced heart failure center for implantation of a ventricular assist device and consideration for cardiac transplantation.",

Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is more prevalent in our country than insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Nephropathy can be classified in IDDM patients in 5 stages which have been elaborated here. The major intervention to prevent or reduce the rate of progress in diabetic nephropathy is control of blood sugar, control of blood pressure, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, restricting dietary protein intake, treatment with inhibitors of the formation of advanced glycosylation end products, treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors and treatment of dyslipidaemia. Once the patient of diabetic nephropathy reaches the end stage renal disease, renal replacement therapy is needed. The different modalities of renal replacement therapy are: Haemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation and kidney and pancreas transplantation. Renal replacement therapy in diabetics has to be individualised from patient to patient. Kidney transplantation is at present the option of choice.", 
    "101": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), endothelin (ET) converting enzyme (ECE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) are all zinc-metallopeptidases expressed in almost all the organs, such as heart, vessels and kidneys. While ACE and ECE are respectively involved in the transformation of angiotensin I and Big-ET into angiotensin II and ET-1 respectively, which possess vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties, NEP is involved in the degradation of atrial natriuric factor (ANF), which possesses vasorelaxant, diuretic/natriuretic and antihypertrophic properties. These three systems are activated in heart failure and modulate the progression of heart failure. This article will discuss preliminary date concerning simultaneous inhibition of ACE, ECE and/or NEP and their therapeutic potential interest in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "102": "The results of a retrospective study of patients over 70 years of age admitted to the cardiology department of Meaux Hospital for cardiac failure in 1997 are reported. The cases of 143 patients were analysed with respect to two age groups: 70-79 years, and over 80 years of age. The principal aetiology of cardiac failure in all ages was ischaemic heart disease. Hypertensive heart disease was observed in younger patients and valvular heart disease in the more elderly. No significant gender differences were observed in those affected by this pathology or by left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction between the younger and older patients, men having more systolic dysfunction than women. The main causal factor of decompensation in all ages was supraventricular arrhythmias. From the therapeutic point of view, the prescription of ACE inhibitors was relatively common but at low doses. Re-hospitalisation for cardiac failure was common and observed mainly in patients with low ejection fractions. The average hospital stay was 12.58 days. The hospital mortality was high: 15%. Two year survival was 41% with no difference between patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Pluridisciplinary management should reduce the number of re-hospitalisation, improve the quality of life and, perhaps, improve survival.", 
    "103": "In hypertension, consideration of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) is now well recognized from epidemiological and therapeutical points of view, after numerous years of interest in only diastolic blood pressure. SBP, and also PP, are tightly linked to mechanical properties of large arteries. It is now possible to investigate precisely, with very good repeatability, these mechanic properties. The REASON study is an international multicenter randomised, controlled, parallel-groups study in essential hypertensives. The very low dose perindopril/indapamide combination (Per/Ind: 2 mg/0.625 mg) was compared with atenolol (50 mg) for a 12-month active treatment period in terms of blood pressure reduction efficiency and change in large artery hemodynamics to attempt to relate changes in pressure and changes in arterial mechanics. 471 patients suffering from hypertension were included, 406 benefitted from the treatment for one year (per-protocol analysis) and 96 benefitted from arterial investigations (pulse wave velocity and aortic wave reflection with applanation tonometry). Changes in brachial and central SBP and PP were higher with Per/ind than with atenolol. The reduction in pulse wave velocity was similar with both drugs, but aortic wave reflections were more reduced with Per/Ind than with atenolol. The very low dose perindopril/indapamide decreases SBP and PP to a larger extent than does a betablocker after a 12-month treatment. Changes in arterial mechanics, non invasively measured, were the same (pulse wave velocity) or in favour of Per/Ind vs atenolol (higher reduction in aortic wave reflection, with higher reductions in central systolic and pulse pressures).", 
    "104": "The roles of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure are well established. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ss-adrenergic-receptor antagonists have been shown to slow down and, in many cases, reverse the process of cardiac remodeling, thus leading to improved cardiac function and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. Standard treatment for heart failure consists of a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin-receptor blocker if the ACE inhibitor is not well tolerated), a ss-blocker, and low-dose digoxin (if needed). Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated reductions in morbidity and mortality with this combination of medications. However, the majority of patients included in these clinical trials had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III heart failure. Because few patients with NYHA class IV heart failure have been evaluated in clinical trials, the treatment approach in this patient population is less well defined. The purpose of this article is to review the results of clinical trials with ss-blockers that included patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "105": "When a medical treatment influences a variety of outcomes, describing the global effect of treatment can be difficult. Traditional approaches specify how treatment affects each separate outcome. This can be done with separate models for each outcome, or by using a combined multivariate model. Describing the overall effect of a treatment thus requires combining these separate effects in some fashion and can be difficult to explain. In this paper, I specify a regression model for use with multiple outcomes where the outcome histories for each pair of patients are ranked. Pairs of patients with different lengths of follow-up are evaluated solely over the common follow-up interval. The logit of the probability that the outcome for patient i is better than that of patient j is assumed to depend on a linear function of the difference of the covariate vectors (for example, treatment indicators) for persons i and j. Thus covariates directly affect the entire clinical history, rather than directly affecting specific outcomes that comprise the history. The idea is that ranking outcomes is more relevant and interpretable than statistically combining separate effects. An estimating equations approach for estimation is described and an example of a clinical trial involving patients with heart failure is provided.",

Nutritional requirements for the production of ACE inhibitory substance from F. velutipes were studied. Sucrose, ammonium acetate, and glutamic acid were chosen for the maximum production of ACE inhibitory substance.

The effect of captopril on phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced reactive oxygen species generation in vitro was concentration-dependent. Quinaprilat and captopril significantly inhibited the NAD(P)H oxidase activity.

This system, present in the majority of animal species, is constituted by several elements which behave as effectors able to increase their levels in response to the reduction of the intravascular volume and to the decrease of the renal perfusion. In turn, RAAS is regulated by a number of mechanisms. In our review a historical view precedes the description of the major functions of RAAS, i.e. the regulation of arterial pressure and the control of the hydroelectrolytic homeostasis. The evolution of the achievements about the angiotensin I converting enzyme is reviewed and the currently investigated relationship between RAAS and hemostatic system is assessed. The historical perspective of this review is useful to follow the key passages leading from clinical research to evidence-based therapeutic applications, in particular to the development of ACE-inhibitors. The evaluation of the rationale of ACE-inhibitors therapy in the treatment of arterial hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy, and a discussion of the angiotensin receptor blockers, close the review.", 
    "119": "The term vasopeptidase means any peptidase able to generate or to inactivate a vasoactive peptide. This term got a more definitive meaning when a new class of drugs, the vasopeptidase inhibitors, was introduced. These drugs are especially represented by the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). ACE is now primarily considered a kininase rather than an angiotensinase and ACE-inhibitors have been used successfully in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and heart failure. Preliminary results suggest that the use of NEP inhibitors could also contribute to improve prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Vasopeptidase inhibitors simultaneously inhibiting both NEP and ACE have shown to be more effective than currently available ACE inhibitors. (Omapatrilat is at present the most clinically advanced in these drugs). However, many side-effects of vasopeptidase inhibitors have been reported, but the most dangerous is angioedema which is potentially life threatening. Since this complication is mediated by bradykinin, and both inhibition of ACE and NEP can produce bradykinin increasing, it has been suggested that the incidence of angioedema due to vasopeptidase inhibitors could be higher compared with that related to ACE-inhibitors. The FDA raised concern about this adverse effect, and the manufacturer decided to withdraw the application temporarily. In order to identify patients at risk of angioedema we have recently shown that low plasma levels of aminopeptidase P, another enzyme which cabolises bradykinin, could indicate a predisposition for development of angioedema in some patients treated with vasoinhibitor drugs.", 
    "120": "Over the last two decades the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) has increased with aging of the population and in spite of the decline in age-adjusted mortality rates due to coronary heart disease. Its management has seen substantial progress, embodied in the introduction of ACE inhibitors, initially as part of triple therapy in which they complemented diuretics and digoxin, and latterly as first-line therapy. The current consensus on treatment of CHF has been based on the multiple clinical studies performed with ACE inhibitors in which these agents have been shown to prevent a new cardiovascular accident and/or progression to more severe CHF in an increasingly wide range of patients with symptomatic CHF or post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction </= 40% in some trials or </= 35% in others). Not only have the results shown a marked decrease in all-cause (and especially cardiovascular) mortality, but also a great number of cost-effectiveness analyses have shown the advantages of ACE inhibitors in terms of resource allocation: they are either cost saving or convincingly cost effective compared with standard treatment with digoxin and diuretics. Other drugs require similar cost and clinical analyses before they can earn their place in an add-on strategy. To date, cost savings have been documented only for beta-blockers; implantable devices are still undergoing assessment. Two trends are now competing: one is to downplay add-on strategies and to recommend first-line therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers at effective doses, supplemented by a raft of non-pharmaceutical measures (specialist nurses, patient education, dietary advice, exercise) in a multidisciplinary approach to CHF; the second is, on the contrary, to prescribe up to five drugs for patients with advanced CHF. The evidence that this decreases hospital admission rates and patient cost is more than anecdotal, but conclusive proof of cost effectiveness is still lacking and the approach presupposes dedicated structures. This review argues that despite technical limitations, a combined approach of CHF therapy based on clinical trials and cost-effectiveness analyses is essential. However, improvements can be made. The absence of sufficient comparative data still makes it difficult to choose between drugs within the same class; institutional purchasers need to conduct such analyses to identify the drugs best suited to their patients' profiles and budgetary constraints.", 
    "121": "Estimation of lymphocyte subset counts (SLCs) is a useful tool in diagnosing nutrition and immune changes in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can influence SLCs. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between rHuEPO and ACEI doses and SLCs in the course of CAPD. In the group of studied patients (n = 55), 34 patients were taking rHuEPO and 38 patients were taking ACEIs. In 35 patients, enalapril was the ACEI used. Seven patients were taking rHuEPO, but not ACEIs; 11 patients were taking ACEIs, but not rHuEPO; 27 patients were taking rHuEPO and ACEIs both; and 10 patients were receiving neither rHuEPO nor ACEIs. Flow cytometry was used to estimate CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16 + 56 antigens. In the study group, a correlation was seen between dialysis duration and rHuEPO dose (r = 0.395). No correlation was seen between CAPD duration and ACEI dose, but it was seen for total rHuEPO and ACEI doses (r = 0.327). A negative correlation was also seen between dialysis duration and CD19 cell count (r = -0.313). In patients taking only ACEIs (n = 11), a negative correlation was seen between total ACEI doses and CD16 + 56 cell count (r = -0.710). In patients who were not receiving rHuEPO or ACEIs, negative correlations were seen between dialysis duration and total lymphocyte count (r = -0.727), CD3 cell count (r = -0.706), CD4 cell count (r = -0.636), and CD8 cell count (r = -0.764). In conclusion, rHuEPO and ACEIs can influence the total lymphocyte count or lymphocyte subset counts--the natural changes being disturbed with prolongation of CAPD treatment. The possibility of this influence should be taken into account when evaluating lymphocyte counts as indices of nutrition and immune status.", 
    "122": "Effective antihypertensive therapy has made a major contribution to the reductions in the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease that have been achieved since the 1960s. However, blood-pressure control with conventional drugs has not succeeded in reducing cardiovascular disease risks to levels seen in normotensive persons. Drugs that inhibit or antagonize components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are addressing this deficiency by targeting both blood pressure and related structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels, thus preventing target-organ damage and related cardiovascular events.", 
    "123": "The effect of ACE inhibition on the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and oxidative stress was explored. Streptozocin-induced diabetic animals were randomized to no treatment, the ACE inhibitor ramipril (3 mg/l), or the AGE formation inhibitor aminoguanidine (1 g/l) and followed for 12 weeks. Control groups were followed concurrently. Renal AGE accumulation, as determined by immunohistochemistry and both serum and renal fluorescence, were increased in diabetic animals. This was attenuated by both ramipril and aminoguanidine to a similar degree. Nitrotyrosine, a marker of protein oxidation, also followed a similar pattern. The receptor for AGEs, gene expression of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox, and nuclear transcription factor-kappaB were all increased by diabetes but remained unaffected by either treatment regimen. Two other AGE receptors, AGE R2 and AGE R3, remained unchanged for the duration of the study. The present study has identified a relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and the accumulation of AGEs in experimental diabetic nephropathy that may be linked through oxidative stress", 
    "124": "Angiotensin II not only is a vasoconstrictor, but it also affects cell growth and apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and coagulation. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, either with inhibitors of the generation of angiotensin (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or with blockers of angiotensin receptors, reduces blood pressure and inhibits other pathophysiological actions. These other effects provide benefits in coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and stroke beyond blood pressure reduction. These benefits were first demonstrated with ACE inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action of angiotensin receptor blockers, which block angiotensin II stimulation at the angiotensin type 1 receptor but not at the type 2 receptor, may have advantages, particularly for endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, as well as cardiac and renal protection. Recent multicenter trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease beyond blood pressure reduction. Several studies with different angiotensin receptor blockers, including comparisons with ACE inhibitors, are under way, and should provide further guidance for their clinical use.", 
    "125": "A deletion variant of the alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2B)-AR) has been associated with an increased risk of acute cardiac events in middle-aged men. Our aim was to determine the possible associations between the alpha(2B)-AR gene deletion variant and indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis in the brachial and carotid arteries. A total of 148 middle-aged men participating in an epidemiological twin study on risk factors for subclinical coronary heart disease were genotyped using PCR. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, carotid artery compliance and carotid intima-media thickness were measured using high-resolution ultrasound. FMD was 6.2+/-5.0% in subjects with the I/I (insertion/insertion) genotype, 5.5+/-4.1% in the I/D (insertion/deletion) group and 4.1+/-3.8% in the D/D (deletion/deletion) group ( P =0.03 for trend). In multivariate regression analysis controlling for age, presence of hypertension, smoking, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a), the association between the alpha(2B)-AR genotype and FMD remained significant ( P =0.04 for trend). The alpha(2B)-AR genotype was not associated with intima-media thickness or carotid artery compliance. These findings indicate that subjects homozygous for the deletion allele of alpha(2B)-AR appear to have an increased risk of impaired endothelial function, which may provide an explanation for the previously observed increased risk of myocardial infarction in male subjects with this genotype. It is not known whether the association of the alpha(2B)-AR polymorphism with endothelial function is direct, or is mediated via altered sympathetic activation.", 
    "126": "Important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of hypertension in patients at risk for renal disease and those with overt renal disease are taking place. Thus, new data suggest that hyperfiltration may be an important antecedent to the development of kidney disease in hypertensive African-Americans. Also new studies provide evidence for differential responses of endothelial function and sympathetic nerve traffic to ACE inhibitors versus dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in hypertensives with and without overt renal disease. Important new studies also show that in proteinuric subjects ACE inhibitor treatment is superior to non-ACE treatment at reducing proteinuria and the risk of developing ESRD in non-diabetics with renal disease. In hemodialysis patients, both systolic hypertension and hypotension predict increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. And, identification of factors important in persisting hypertension in patients on hemodialysis provide new insights into improving BP control in this population. The purpose of this review is to highlight the key elements and clinical relevance of these recent studies.",

    "128": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to improve clinical myocardial ischemia in patients with syndrome X (angina pectoris, positive treadmill exercise test, normal coronary angiograms, and no evidence of coronary spasm). This study was conducted to investigate the effects of long-term ACE inhibitors on endothelial nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and coronary microvascular function in patients with syndrome X. After a 2-week washout period, 20 patients with syndrome X were randomized to receive either enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, 5 mg twice daily (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) in a double-blind design for 8 weeks. Another 6 age- and gender-matched subjects with negative treadmill exercise tests were also studied as controls. Compared with control subjects, patients with syndrome X had significantly reduced coronary flow reserve, reduced plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite (NOx), and a reduced plasma L-arginine to asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio (an index of systemic NO metabolism), as well as reduced endothelial function. These patients also had increased plasma levels of ADMA, which is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase and of von Willebrand factor, a marker of endothelial injury. Baseline characteristics including exercise performance and coronary flow reserve were similar between enalapril and placebo groups. After an 8-week treatment period, exercise duration (p = 0.001) and coronary flow reserve (p = 0.001) significantly improved with enalapril but not with placebo. Enalapril treatment, but not placebo, reduced plasma von Willebrand factor (p = 0.03) and ADMA levels (p = 0.01) and increased NOx levels (p = 0.01) and the ratio of L-arginine to ADMA (p <0.01). In patients with syndrome X, the plasma NOx level was positively and ADMA level inversely correlated with coronary flow reserve before and after the treatment. In conclusion, long-term ACE inhibitor treatment with enalapril improved coronary microvascular function as well as myocardial ischemia in patients with syndrome X. This may be related to the improvement of endothelial NO bioavailability with the reduction of plasma ADMA levels.", 
    "129": "Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, with antihypertensive medication is common practice for many patients with arthritis. This study evaluated the effects of celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day on blood pressure (BP) and edema in a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study in patients > or =65 years of age with osteoarthritis who were treated with fixed antihypertensive regimens. One thousand ninety-two patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased systolic BP (change >20 mm Hg plus absolute value > or =140 mm Hg) at any time point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p <0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p <0.05). Thus, in patients with controlled hypertension on a fixed antihypertensive regimen, careful monitoring of BP is warranted after the initiation of celecoxib or rofecoxib therapy.", 
    "130": "Abundant data from studies of patients with proteinuric nephropathy confirm that angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE) inhibitors slow the progression of kidney disease more effectively than many other medications. Three studies, RENAAL, IDNT, and IRM2 provide additional evidence with regard to this issues. In IDNT, two doses of irbesartan were administered to patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who had normal glomerular filtration rate. The diminution of proteinuria indicates protection from ongoing kidney damage that would probably translate into the preservation of the glomerular filtration rate in the longer term. In RENAAL and IRM2 patients who had higher grade proteinuria and established renal insufficiency were enrolled. In patients whose disease was at this more advanced phase, losartan or irbesartan led to lower levels of proteinuria, lower rates of decline in the glomerular filtration rate, and later onset of end-stage renal disease than the control medications, amlodipine and a mixture of drugs. Moreover, these beneficial effects are independent of the reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "131": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction as well as high risk patients for coronary artery disease has been shown to receive benefits from angiotensin-converting enzymes. Since angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB) provides more complete blockade of the RAA system, treatment with ARB may bring more fruitful results.

    "132": "Angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB) is expected to be a substitute of ACE inhibitor for ACE inhibitor(ACEi) incompetent patient or an additive drug for the treatment of severe heart failure. Two large mega-trials(ELITE II & Val-HEFT) have been reported so far and one large trial(CHARM) is ongoing. In ELITE II study, there was no additional beneficial effects of ARB compared to ACEi(captopril). On the other hand, additive ARB may be beneficial for most of patients with heart failure, according to the Val-Heft trial. However, some adverse effects of ARB by the combinatory use with ACEi and beta-blocker should be taken into careful consideration. Ongoing CHARM trial may answer if ARB is ultimately useful for the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "133": "Due to therapy resistant hypertension, combination antihypertensive therapy is indispensable for retarding the progression of chronic renal diseases. The majority of pilot studies investigating the renoprotective effect of ACE-I plus ARB revealed a better anti-proteinuric effect of this combination than either of the monotherapies for patients with either diabetic or non-diabetic renal diseases. In contrast, the effect of combination therapy with ACE-I/ARB plus CCB in protecting the kidney from hypertension appeared to be still a matter of controversy. Although the combined therapy with ACE-I plus ARB is superior to that with CCB plus ARB to achieve a greater reduction in urinary protein excretion than either of the monotherapies, one must be aware of the potential hazards associated with the former combined therapy such as worsening of renal anemia and hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Whether add-on ARB to ACE-I or CCB causes antiproteinuric effects or long-term renoprotection requires larger and longer prospective, randomized controlled trials in the future.", 
    "134": "This 1.5-year prospective study compared the effects of angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan(n = 21), and ACE inhibitor(ACEI, n = 23) on proteinuria and renal function in patients with moderate renal impairment due to chronic glomerulonephritis. Blood pressure reductions were comparable between both groups. Proteinuria was significantly reduced from 2.1 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SE) to 0.6 +/- 0.2 g/day(p < 0.001) with candesartan, and the reduction was significantly larger than with ACEI(p < 0.01). Serum creatinine did not increase with candesartan or ACEI, suggesting the renoprotective effect. Serum potassium increased significantly with both drugs from 6 months. Plasma aldosterone concentrations(PAC) showed a stronger suppression with candesartan(150 pg/ml before treatment and 51 at 1.5 years) than with ACEI(104 pg/ml at 1.5 years). Plasma renin activity with candesartan(1.0 ng/ml/hr before treatment) decreased from 3.9 ng/ml/hr at 6 months to 1.3 at 1.5 years, whereas PRA remained elevated with ACEI. We speculate that the stronger reduction of PAC contributed to suppression of growth of mesangial matrix and the interstitial fibrosis in the candesartan group.", 
    "135": "Several recent randomized trials and clinical studies demonstrated that as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARB) exerted renoprotective effect on diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy. This renoprotective effect appears to be independent of the reduction of blood pressure, and be derived mainly from the suppression of renal renin-angiotensin system. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding this renoprotective effect of ARB; e.g. hemodynamic effect in the intraglomerular pressure, reduction of proteinuria, decrease of collagen formation. Further investigation is required to clarify the precise mechanism.",

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist may be able to reverse fibrosis of left ventricle in ESRD patients.

In this study, 30 chronically hemodialyzed patients with hypertension were randomly allocated to receive antihypertensive therapy with either angiotensin II type 1 receptor(AT1-R) antagonist losartan(n = 10), angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitor enalapril(n = 10) or calcium antagonist amlodipine(n = 10). IBS of posterior wall of left ventricule were measured by IBS before and after 6 months treatment. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ in three subgroups. Although losartan(34.2 +/- 1.8 to 30.2 +/- 2.4 dB: p = 0.0094) treatment demonstrated significant reduce of IBS values, enalapril(30.3 +/- 1.5 to 31.7 +/- 1.4 dB: p = 0.3268) and amlodipine (31.6 +/- 1.6 to 33.1 +/- 1.9 dB: p = 0.4632) did not changed it significantly before and after 6 months treatment. All three groups reduced left ventricular mass index(Losartan 154.5 +/- 9.9 to 114.6 +/- 5.8 g/m2: p = 0.0002) (enalapril 155.6 +/- 14.3 to 135.3 +/- 10.4 g/m2: p = 0.0275) (amlodipine 156.6 +/- 7.3 to 137.2 +/- 4.1 g/m2: p = 0.0589). Three groups manifested a similar significant decrease in the mean blood pressure. Plasma angiotensin II concentration was markedly increased by 5.0-fold relative to the control levels before treatment in Losartan treatment, in contrast unchanged in enalapril and only 2.0-fold increased in amlodipine treatment. This study indicates that losartan reduce of fibrosis of left ventricule and this effect may be via an anti-AT1-R effect.",

To inhibit RA system is supposed to be induced cardiovascular protective effect. ACEIs and ARBs are used as first choice of drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Clinical evidence shows that ACEIs have protective effects on heart, kidney and brain. Several large clinical trials suggest that ARBs have also protective effects on heart and diabetic nephropathy.

However, the long-term efficacy of these treatment is limited by vascular restenosis, which occurs after these procedures. Although ACE inhibitor cilazapril prevented the neointimal hyperplasia of rat carotid artery after balloon injury, it did not lead to prevention of restenosis after PTCA in human studies (MERCATOR and MARCATOR). Angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan, inhibited the neointimal formation after balloon injury in both rat and dog. Val-PREST trial showed that valsartan reduced the in-stent restenosis rate after stent implantation. The inhibition of renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin II receptor blocker may help to prevent restenosis after angioplasty.",

EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation to acetylcholine in mesenteric arteries were improved similarly in both candesartan- and enalapril-treated aged rats, but not in rats treated with the traditional combination of hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide.

Since 1992, the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) deletion/deletion (D/D) genotype has been linked to several cardiovascular diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. Earlier, the ACE D/D genotype had been associated with excess tissue ACE activity. We have observed an association of the ACE D/D genotype with a large number of common diseases, including chronic renal failure due to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or hypertension, hypertensive peripheral vascular disease, and emphysema [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]. ACE inhibitors have been in clinical use since 1977 and have a well-known safety record. Armed with the knowledge that ACE overactivity was associated with their disease, we gave what was intended to be a tissue ACE-inhibitory dose of a hydrophobic ACE inhibitor to 800 Caucasian and African-American male patients with hypertension and 200 Caucasian and African-American male patients with chronic renal failure, over a period of 3 years. We here report their outcomes, which include those of two patients with end-stage hypertensive peripheral vascular disease and one patient with end-stage emphysema (COPD). As a group, the outcomes are superior to what is available in the literature.

Water was available for drinking in some tests, and both water and 0.3 M NaCl were available in others. The series included three episodes of extracellular fluid depletion (i.e., furosemide + 20 h of sodium restriction), two tests involving intracellular fluid depletion (i.e., hypertonic saline: 1 or 2 M NaCl at 2 ml/kg body wt sc), one test involving overnight food and fluid restriction, and testing with captopril adulteration of the drinking water (0.1 mg/ml) for several days. Old rats were significantly heavier than young rats throughout testing. Old rats drank less water and 0.3 M NaCl after sodium deprivation than young rats, in terms of absolute and body weight-adjusted intakes. Old rats drank only half as much water as young rats in response to subcutaneous hypertonic NaCl when intakes were adjusted for body weight. Old rats drank less 0.3 M NaCl than young rats after overnight food and fluid restriction when intakes were adjusted for body weight. In response to captopril adulteration of the drinking water, young rats significantly increased daily ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl when it was available as an alternative to water and significantly increased daily water intakes when only water was available, in terms of absolute and body weight-adjusted intakes. Old rats had no response to captopril treatment. These results add important new information to previous reports that aging rats have diminished thirst and near-absent salt appetite responses to regulatory challenges.", 
    "201": "Several experimental data report both mitogenic and antimitogenic effects of bradykinin (BK). To conciliate these apparent opposite effects, we hypothesized that, depending on cell context activation, BK could reduce the mitogenic effect of growth factors. Therefore, in the present study we assessed the existence of possible negative cross talk between BK and potential pathogenic growth factors in freshly isolated rat glomeruli (IG). Next, we determined whether this cross talk could be pharmacologically recruited during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the diabetic rat. In IG from normal rats, BK, via activation of the B(2) kinin receptor (B(2)R), causes a transient stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas it inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by IGF-1, PDGF-BB, VEGF, or basic FGF. The reduction of growth factor-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation is abolished by an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase. In glomeruli from diabetic rats, hyperglycemia increased the phosphorylation level of ERK-1/2 as well as oxidative stress. The reversal of these events by ACE inhibition is mediated via B(2)R activation. These observations are consistent with a potential therapeutic role of BK and B(2)R during glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "202": "Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder of metabolism due to mutations in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A, a lysosomal enzyme. The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of incompletely metabolised glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide, in plasma and lysosomes within various tissues. Inability to prevent the progression of glycosphingolipid deposition causes significant morbidity, associated with significant impact on quality of life and diminished lifespan from early onset strokes, heart attack and progressive renal failure. The disease manifests primarily in hemizygous males; however, there is increasing recognition that heterozygous (carrier) females may also develop disease-related complications. Indeed, most heterozygotes present with cardiac, renal or neurological symptoms, although with later-onset and to a lesser extent than is observed in hemizygotes. Until recently, medical management was symptomatic, consisting of partial pain relief with analgesic drugs (carbamazepin, gabapentin), kidney and vascular protection with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and folic acid, whereas renal transplantation or dialysis is available for patients experiencing end stage renal failure. The ability to produce high doses of alpha-galactosidase A has opened the way to preclinical studies, and enzyme replacement therapy has recently been validated as a therapeutic agent in clinical trials. Long-term safety and efficacy of replacement therapy are currently being investigated. Increasing knowledge of the natural history of Fabry disease and greater experience with enzyme therapy should enable optimal patient care. The complexity and relative rarity of Fabry disease necessitates a multi-disciplinary team approach that may be facilitated by a disease registry.", 
    "203": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are common diseases in the United States. Patients with diabetes have a much higher rate of hypertension than would be expected in the general population. Regardless of the antihypertensive agent used, a reduction in blood pressure helps to prevent diabetic complications. Barring contraindications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are considered first-line therapy in patients with diabetes and hypertension because of their well-established renal protective effects. Calcium channel blockers, low-dose diuretics, beta blockers, and alpha blockers have also been studied in this group. Most diabetic patients with hypertension require combination therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure goals.", 
    "204": "Accumulating evidence suggests that angiotensin II (ANG II) plays an important role in the complex affair of renal organogenesis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is up-regulated during renal development and in the perinatal period. On the other hand, inhibition of the RAS, for example by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may produce specific renal abnormalities including abnormal renal vessels, failure to develop a renal pelvis and tubular atrophy associated with expansion of the interstitium. AT2 receptors are expressed abundantly during fetal development and are down-regulated markedly after birth, whereas the abundance of AT1 receptors increases as maturation proceeds. Mice with targeted deletions of genes for angiotensinogen or ACE revealed severe renal abnormalities. In contrast, AT1A, AT1B and AT2 receptor knockout animals exhibited milder abnormalities of the kidney. These findings suggest that AT1 and AT2 receptors are both involved in the development of the nephron, and that ANG II provides signals through both receptors. ANG II exerts in vitro growth-stimulatory effects on tubular cells. Moreover, ANG II induces synthesis of collagen type IV in tubular cells, a necessary prerequisite for successful basement membrane formation. These effects are mediated through AT1 receptors. Thus, it is feasible that blockade of the RAS during kidney organogenesis leads to a decrease in the growth factor ANG II that may be pivotal for tubular growth and differentiation. On the other hand, ANG II's growth-stimulatory effects through AT1 receptors may be counterbalanced by AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis and growth inhibition. Therefore, alterations in AT2 receptor signalling may alter the delicate balance between growth stimulation and inhibition, leading to alterations in tubular formation.", 
    "205": "Studies in animal models have shown a convincing role for hypertension in the progression of renal disease. However, in clinical studies, the relationship between hypertension and progression is difficult to demonstrate owing to confounding factors such as age, gender, race, difficulty in identifying blood pressure (BP) parameters that correlate with progression, abnormal circadian BP pattern, and many non-haemodynamic factors of progression. A recent meta-analysis of several studies has shown that pharmacological agents that reduce both BP and proteinuria (U(P)), particularly angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, significantly slow the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease. In these studies, lower achieved BP in patients both with and without U(P) was associated with slower decline in renal function. ACE inhibitors are effective BP-lowering agents and are associated with improved preservation of renal function compared with antihypertensive regimens without ACE inhibitors. The protective effect of ACE inhibition is additional to the effect of reducing BP and U(P).", 
    "206": "Renal anaemia starts earlier in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) than was previously thought and is often inadequately monitored and treated. Current treatment guidelines recommend giving recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) as soon as haemoglobin (Hb) concentration falls below 11 g/dl and alternative causes of anaemia have been ruled out. Recent studies show that, in practice, few patients receive rHuEPO in the pre-dialysis period and Hb concentrations are often <9 g/dl at the start of haemodialysis. This is at odds with best practice since renal anaemia is a major risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy. Many factors other than provision of rHuEPO therapy can affect the occurrence and severity of renal anaemia. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of resistance to rHuEPO and appropriate use of iron supplementation in patients with CKD is still being debated. The acute-phase immune response has a more significant role in renal anaemia and rHuEPO resistance than previously believed, as demonstrated by the need for higher rHuEPO doses in patients with raised levels of C-reactive protein. Women often need higher doses of rHuEPO than men, which may be related to differences in androgen levels between the sexes. Low erythropoietin concentrations are a major factor in diabetic nephropathy. Correction of anaemia with rHuEPO may slow progression of CKD by reducing oxidative stress. These and other factors need to be considered for the optimal treatment of patients with anaemia of CKD.", 
    "207": "Soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is derived from the membrane-bound form by proteolytic cleavage of its C-terminal domain. Because intracellular events might be involved in the regulation of the cleavage process, we determined whether the cytoplasmic tail of ACE is phosphorylated and whether this process regulates secretion. Immunoprecipitation of ACE (180 kDa) from (32)P-labeled endothelial cells revealed that ACE is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was not observed in endothelial cells overexpressing a mutant form of ACE (ACEDeltaS, all five cytoplasmic serine residues replaced by alanine). CK2 coprecipitated with ACE from endothelial cells, and CK2 phosphorylated both ACE and a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail. Mutation of serine(1270) within the CK2 consensus sequence almost abolished ACE phosphorylation. In ACE-overexpressing endothelial cells, ACE was mostly localized to the plasma membrane. However, no ACE was detected in the plasma membrane of ACEDeltaS-overexpressing cells, although a precursor ACE (170 kDa) was prominent in the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell supernatant contained substantial amounts of the soluble protein (175 kDa). A correlation between ACE-phosphorylation and secretion was confirmed in endothelial cells treated with the CK2-inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, which time-dependently decreased the phosphorylation of ACE and increased its shedding. These results indicate that the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ACE regulates its retention in the plasma membrane and may determine plasma ACE levels.",

The rank of order of specific peptidolytic activity of the mucosal homogenates was jejunum > ileum > caecum> duodenum = colon, with a 3 to 4 fold difference between the least and the most active segment in both frozen and fresh samples. The formation of peptides LHRH (1-3), LHRH (1-4) and LHRH (1-5) suggest endopepetidase-24.18, endopeptidase-24.15 and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) might be responsible for the peptide degradation in mucosal homogenates. The inhibition of LHRH degradation by mucosal homogenates was evaluated in four regions (jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon) of possum intestine. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 5 mM), sodium deoxycholate (SDA, 10 mM) and bacitracin (3.5 or 9 mM) inhibited the degradation of LHRH in mucosal homogenates from small intestine and hindgut. However, the serine protease inhibitor, soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (SBTI), did not prevent degradation of LHRH. It is concluded that combining peptides with inhibitors may enhance oral delivery of bioactive peptides or proteins to possums.",

Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy significantly reduced the risk of the major clinical outcomes by 22% (p<0.0001), with clear reductions in risk both among those receiving aspirin at baseline (odds ratio 0.80, [99% CI 0.73-0.88]) and those who were not (0.71 [99% CI 0.62-0.81], interaction p=0.07).",

    "217": "Vitellogenic ovaries of the gray fleshfly Neobellieria bullata contain a variety of unidentified substances that interact, either as a substrate or as an inhibitor, with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We here report the isolation and characterization of the first ACE interactive compound hereof. This 1312.7 Da peptide with the sequence NKLKPSQWISL, is substrate to both insect and human ACE. It is a novel peptide that shows high sequence similarity to a sequence at the N-terminal part of dipteran yolk polypeptides (YPs). We propose to call it N. bullata ovary-derived ACE interactive factor or Neb-ODAIF. Both insect and human ACE hydrolyze Neb-ODAIF by sequentially cleaving off two C-terminal dipeptides. K(m) values of Neb-ODAIF and Neb-ODAIF(1-9) (NKLKPSQWI) for human somatic ACE (sACE) are 17 and 81 microM, respectively. Additionally, Neb-ODAIF(1-7) (NKLKPSQ) also interacts with sACE (K(m/i)=90 microM). These affinity-constants are in range with those of the physiological ACE substrates and suggest the importance of Neb-ODAIF and its cleavage products in the elucidation of the physiological role of insect ACE. Alternatively, they can serve as lead compounds in the development of new drugs against ACE-related diseases in humans.", 
    "218": "Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States, accounting for about 50% of all new cases. Although we previously established the renoprotective benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with coexisting hypertension and type 1 diabetes, evidence of the renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes is less clear. We conducted the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) irbesartan slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect. In this randomized, controlled trial, we found that irbesartan was associated with a 20% reduction in the risk for the primary composite end point (doubling of the baseline serum creatinine concentration, development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause) compared with placebo (P =.02) and a 23% reduction compared with amlodipine therapy (P =.006). These results were not explained by differences in the BP that was achieved. In a separate study, losartan was shown to reduce the risk for progression of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy has also been demonstrated to slow the progression to overt nephropathy when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetic renal disease (ie, in patients with microalbuminuria). Based on these studies, ARBs are clearly effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of their BP-lowering effect. Preclinical studies with the newest ARB, olmesartan medoxomil, suggest that this agent may provide renoprotective benefits as well.", 
    "219": "Endothelial dysfunction and remodeling of the vessel wall of large and small arteries is associated with hypertension and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These changes alter vascular function and mechanics, aggravate high blood pressure (BP), and may accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis. Activation of oxidative stress by angiotensin II is a key component of this process. Angiotensin II stimulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase in endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and the adventitia of blood vessels to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to endothelial dysfunction, growth, and inflammation. Upregulation of endothelin-1, adhesion molecules, nuclear factor-kappaB, and other inflammatory mediators, as well as increased breakdown of nitric oxide and uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase, contribute to the progression of vascular disease and atherogenesis. Clinical studies in which treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) was used demonstrated correction of some of the changes in large and small arteries in hypertensive subjects, whereas identical BP lowering with beta-blockers had no effect on endothelial function. In experimental models of atherosclerosis, ARBs, including losartan potassium, valsartan, and olmesartan medoxomil, have demonstrated the ability to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. This was in part associated with decreased expression of inflammatory mediators and improved endothelial function. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ACE inhibitors or ARBs appears to blunt both the development and progression of vascular disease in both small and large vessels in experimental models and in humans beyond the effect of these agents on BP. This may help to explain the positive results of recently completed trials such as Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) and Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE).", 
    "220": "The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of <140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. As with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but do so through a more specific mechanism. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers, by contrast, inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability. Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective of the ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-h BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate and felodipine and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than did three other leading ARBs-losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil may be a useful addition to our management of hypertension.",

Randomized double-blind studies have demonstrated survival benefits of these drugs in heart failure patients. Nevertheless, in spite of these advances, heart failure continues to be a syndrome of poor outcomes.1-4 There is also evidence that a significant portion of heart failure patients does not receive this evidence-based therapy that reduces morbidity and mortality.5-7 Various disease-management programs have been proposed and tested to improve the quality of heart failure care. Most of these programs are specialized multidisciplinary heart failure clinics lead by cardiologists or heart failure specialists and conducted by nurses or nurse practitioners. Similar to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment clinics, these clinics also use many other services, including pharmacists, dietitians, physical therapists, and social workers. Some of these programs also have an affiliated home health service. Several observation studies, using mostly pre- and postcomparison designs, have demonstrated the effectiveness of these programs in the process of care, resource use, healthcare costs, and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure.8 Risk of hospitalization was reduced by 50% to 85% in six of the studies.8 Subsequently, several randomized trials were conducted to determine the effectiveness of these programs. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of these programs on mortality and hospitalization rates of heart failure patients.",

    "235": "In many types of cardiovascular pathophysiology such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, diabetes, cigarette smoking, or hypertension (with its sequelae stroke and heart failure) the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is altered. Both up- and downregulation of eNOS have been observed, depending on the underlying disease. When eNOS is upregulated, the upregulation is often futile and goes along with a reduction in bioactive NO. This is due to an increased production of superoxide generated by NAD(P)H oxidase and by an uncoupled eNOS. A number of drugs with favorable effects on cardiovascular disease upregulate eNOS expression. The resulting increase in vascular NO production may contribute to their beneficial effects. These compounds include statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and some antioxidants. Other drugs such as glucocorticoids, whose administration is associated with cardiovascular side effects, downregulate eNOS expression. Stills others such as the immunosuppressants cyclosporine A and FK506/tacrolimus or erythropoietin have inconsistent effects on eNOS. Thus regulation of eNOS expression and activity contributes to the overall action of several classes of drugs, and the development of compounds that specifically upregulate this protective enzyme appears as a desirable target for drug development.", 
    "236": "Heart failure is predominantly a disease of the older person with half of all patients with the condition aged >75 years. Diuretics are the first-line symptomatic treatment for heart failure. beta-blockers should be initiated on an outpatient basis once the patient is stable, euvolaemic (by means of a diuretic) and established on an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Large trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol in patients with heart failure, most of whom were also receiving ACE inhibitors. However, the mean age of patients in these trials was generally 60 to 65 years, with very few patients aged >75 years being recruited. It is, thus, not immediately clear how to apply these trial results to older patients with heart failure. Subgroup analyses from these large beta-blocker heart failure trials suggest that older patients gain similar benefit from beta-blocker treatment to younger patients. The trials, however, give no guidance as to whether older patients should receive the same target dosage or titration regimen as younger patients. It is suggested that a less aggressive titration regimen may be more appropriate for older patients while still attempting to achieve the trial target dosages. Titration can be safely achieved on an outpatient basis. In particular, a period of observation in the clinic after initiation of treatment does not appear to be necessary. The survival benefit resulting from the use of a beta-blocker in patients with heart failure is modest (months rather than years). It is, thus important not to neglect the effects of treatment on quality of life. A proportion of patients experience adverse effects with a beta-blocker. For such patients a balance needs to be made between the adverse effects on quality of life and the likely extension of life from the use of a beta-blocker. For patients who can tolerate a beta-blocker, the available evidence suggests that it can improve quality of life. The evidence currently available does not support the use of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in addition to an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. For patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker, the use of an ARB may confer some advantage.", 
    "237": "Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Full assessment of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients is required to identify all risk factors and apply appropriate secondary preventative strategies. Antiplatelet therapies are effective in the secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke and can be justified despite adverse effects such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), aspirin plus dipyridamole, ticlopidine and clopidogrel are all of value but their adverse effect profiles vary significantly. Combinations of antiplatelet agents may offer additional benefit but not all combinations have been studied in stroke patients. Anticoagulation with agents such as warfarin is effective with coexisting atrial fibrillation and other conditions predisposing to cardioembolic stroke. Antihypertensive agents have been extensively studied in the primary prevention of stroke; however, relatively few trials of antihypertensive agents in the secondary prevention of stroke are available. The incidence of adverse effects of antihypertensive agents is relatively low and the benefit-risk profile would tend to favour their use in the secondary prevention of stroke. Recent studies of ACE inhibitors have identified an important role for these agents in the secondary prevention of stroke even in those who are normotensive and in those who have had a haemorrhagic stroke. The incidence of serious adverse effects with ACE inhibitors appears relatively low. Lipid-lowering agents may have a role to play in certain groups of patients with stroke. The incidence of adverse effects is relatively low with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for stroke and evidence is available that smoking cessation does reduce the individual's risk of stroke. Pharmacological agents are available to help smoking cessation. In patients with diabetes mellitus, intensive regimens with insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents have so far not definitively been shown to reduce the incidence of macrovascular complications such as stroke. Tight glycaemic control has been shown to improve microvascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy and hence this is reason enough to advocate the use of these agents. Future developments in the treatment of diabetes may help. Secondary prevention of stroke has improved greatly over the past decade and hopefully will continue to improve. The use of pharmacological agents available currently and in the future will be clarified and refined as further clinical trials report.", 
    "238": "It remains to be clarified how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced function (ie, increased NO related action or the inhibition of angiotensin II AT1 receptor dependent action) affects apoptosis of smooth muscle cells in the neointima following arterial injury. Saline (control), enalapril, L-arginine, combined enalapril and L-arginine, or losartan was administered for 14 days to Sprague-Dawley rats after balloon carotid injury and the ratio of intima to media areas (I/M), inducible NO synthase (iNOS) concentrations and %TUNEL were measured. I/M decreased similarly in the enalapril, L-arginine and losartan groups, and the combination of enalapril and L-arginine resulted in the largest I/M decrease. TUNEL positivity was increased compared with controls in the following order: losartan, L-arginine, enalapril and combination of enalapril and L-arginine. The intensity of immunostaining for iNOS was increased approximately 1.9-fold compared with the control in the combined enarapril and L-arginine group as well as in the enalapril group. These data suggest that the apoptosis in the neointima is different for L-arginine, losartan and enalapril under similar conditions and was higher under treatment with enalapril, not only via the action of NO or blocking of the AT1, but also by upregulation of iNOS.", 
    "239": "The present study examined the effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on the long-term prognosis in 119 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Conventional therapy was used in 29 patients and 90 patients were treated with ACEIs: 50 were taking captopril and 40 were taking enalapril; 24 were taking > or = 75 mg captopril or > or = 20 mg enalapril daily (high-dose group) and 66 patients received smaller doses (low-dose group). No significant differences between groups were detected with respect to demographics and clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). During follow-up, 65 patients survived and 54 patients died: 34 patients were in group 1 and 20 patients were in the placebo group. Patients treated with ACEIs had a significantly better survival during the first to third year, but the difference was not significant between the high- and low-dose groups. Comparison of the cumulative probability of death in the enalapril and captopril groups showed a trend of significant reduction of mortality by 13% in the enalapril group (p<0.10). These data indicate that ACEIs have a beneficial effect on prolonging the short- and long-term survival in DCM patients, so it is strongly recommended that all patients with DCM should be treated with ACEIs unless contraindicated. In this study, lower doses of ACEI seemed prognostically equivalent to higher doses, and enalapril appeared to be preferable to captopril in the treatment of severe CHF. Additional prospective large studies are necessary to verify the relationship observed here between the optimal dosage as well as the duration of action of different ACEIs and their outcomes.", 
    "240": "Recent trends in the treatment of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients and the factors accounting for the improvement in outcome are presented. A total of 6,602 post-MI patients (5,320 males, 1,282 females; 58.9 +/- 10.4 years of age) enrolled between 1986 and 1999 were followed up for an average of 12.6 +/- 16.3 months. The incidence of cardiac events, which included fatal and nonfatal recurrent MIs, sudden death and death by congestive heart failure, was highest (44.9 events/1,000 person year) in 1986-1987, but decreased steadily to 22.5 events/1,000 person year by 1997-1999 (Trend p<0.0001). This trend accompanied the increased use of coronary thrombolysis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, increased prescription of antiplatelet agents (51.5%-83.4%), lipid-lowering agents (29.8%-52.6%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5.3%-->41.0%), and reduced prescription of calcium antagonists (68.5%-41.0%) and nitrates (60.7%-->45.7%). These changes in treatment have led to a decreased incidence of angina pectoris, wall motion abnormalities and abnormal Q waves on electrocardiograms. The decline in the incidence of cardiac events among post-MI patients in the 14 years between 1986 and 1999 reflects implementation of new therapeutic modalities proven to be effective in clinical trials and in daily practice.",

In 1997 (n = 1339), there was a fairly equal distribution between the use of beta-blockers (22.6%), diuretics (23.9%), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (22.9%), and calcium channel blockers (18.3%). In 2000 (n = 964), beta-blockers (27.2%), diuretics (25.0%), and ACE inhibitors (26.5%) were used more often than calcium channel blockers (10.9%), but the differences were not statistically significant. There was no difference between men and women in any treatment group, and only diuretic use increased with age, but even this difference was not significant. In 1997, ACE inhibitors (30.1%) were prescribed more frequently than beta-blockers (24.7%), diuretics (7.8%), or calcium channel blockers (24.1%) to patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and congestive heart failure (n = 166), although the differences were not significant. In 2000, this group of patients (n = 297) received more diuretics (56.6%) than beta-blockers (16.2%) or ACE inhibitors (21.5%); calcium channel blockers were no longer used. The differences were not significant. In 1997, ACE inhibitors (51.2%) were prescribed more frequently than beta-blockers (10.0%), diuretics (32.1%), or calcium channel blockers (4.0%) to patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and diabetes (n = 299). In 2000, this group of patients (n = 295) again received more ACE inhibitors (66.1%) than beta-blockers (13.9%) or diuretics (14.9%); calcium channel blockers were no longer used. Again, these differences did not reach statistical significance.", 
    "245": "Although the use of calcium channel blockers as initial monotherapy for hypertension appears to have declined among Medicaid recipients in Maine since 1997, ACE inhibitors are still frequently prescribed for this purpose, especially among patients who have hypertension and congestive heart failure. These changes in drug utilization appear to reflect influence by the published JNC guidelines. However, there was still a large range of initial therapy across all drug classes not justified by published guidelines or outcome studies.", 
    "246": "The inclusion complex formation of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CyD), beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CyD), and 2-hydroxylpropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CyD) with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in aqueous solution was studied by (1)H- and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, including ROESY and GROESY techniques, by kinetic methods and by molecular dynamic calculations. The oxidative degradation of captopril was markedly suppressed in alpha-CyD solutions, whereas beta-CyD and HP-beta-CyD had negligible stabilizing effects. These NMR and kinetic results suggested that alpha-CyD includes preferably the propyl thioalcohol moiety of captopril, depositing the proline moiety outside the cavity. On the other hand, beta-CyD includes a whole molecule of captopril in the cavity, locating the carboxylic acid within the cavity and the terminal thiol moiety outside the cavity. These inclusion structures were supported by molecular dynamic studies.", 
    "247": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentrations are increased in patients with diabetes mellitus, particularly those with diabetic retinopathy, or essential hypertension. We hypothesized that ET-1 might participate in the development and progression of diabetic microangiopathy. In this study, the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril maleate, on diabetic angiopathy were examined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (STZ-DM) rats by monitoring variations in renal function and ET-1 concentrations in blood and organ tissues. Significant increases in kidney weight and in concentrations of urinary albumin, N-acetyl-fl-d-glucosamidase (NAG) and serum ET-1 were observed in the STZ-DM rats as compared with the non-diabetic rats, and the concentration of ET-1 in the kidneys tended to be increased. Microscopic and electron microscopic analyses showed increased mesangial cell proliferation, matrix expansion and enlarged mesangial area in the kidney of the diabetic rats. After administration of the ACE inhibitor, increased concentrations of urinary albumin and NAG in the STZ-DM rats were reduced to the control values with a slight improvement in the electron microscopic changes. These data suggest that ET-1 may be involved in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy and may explain, in part, why diabetes is liable to complicate hypertension. ACE inhibitor may help to restore diabetic nephropathy in the STZ-induced diabetic rats.", 
    "248": "Vasodilatory edema, a common adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy with vasodilators, is related to several mechanisms, including arteriolar dilatation (causing an increase in intracapillary pressure), stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and fluid volume retention. Vasodilatory edema is dose-dependent and most common with direct arteriolar dilators such as minoxidil or hydralazine, and in decreasing order of frequency with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, a-blockers, antiadrenergic drugs, and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Not all dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are created equal with regard to vasodilatory edema. At an equal antihypertensive efficacy, lercanidipine and lacidipine are associated with less vasodilatory edema than amlodipine and nifedipine. The addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist significantly reduces vasodilatory edema. In contrast, the addition of a diuretic has little effect on vasodilatory edema. Thus, low-dose combination therapy (of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB) may be preferred over high-dose monotherapy.", 
    "249": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor for morbidity and mortality. It is caused by arterial hypertension, although various hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic factors contribute to its development. Especially, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in the pathophysiology of LVH. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension study demonstrated that in mild essential hypertension, nonpharmacologic treatment is an effective tool for treating LVH. There are at least three major meta-analyses with several thousand patients examining the ability of antihypertensive drugs on the reversal of LVH. The results of these meta-analyses are very consistent. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers achieve significantly better results than b-blockers. The most recently published Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study confirmed the superiority of angiotensin receptor blockers against b-blockers in a large-scale prospective trial. It also proves for the first time that regression of LVH is associated with better cardiovascular outcome.", 
    "250": "Recently, both researchers and clinicians have focused their attention to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Their efforts resulted in discovery of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors proved to be effective antihypertensive drugs. However, their excellent antihypertensive efficacy has been limited by frequent occurrence of adverse effects, among which cough occupies a prominent place. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists could completely block RAS, having significantly less adverse effects than ACE inhibitors. Clinical studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II receptor antagonists are equally effective in the treatment of hypertension as diuretics, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors. Also the studies showed angiotensin II receptor antagonists to have an additional advantage, i.e. the frequency of their adverse effects matches that of placebo. All today available angiotensin II receptor antagonists--losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan--equally lower both systolic and diastolic pressure. This new class of drugs can be used as monotherapy or can be combined with other antihypertensive drugs, especially with diuretics. Trials now underway will demonstrate whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

Combined therapy with prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, warfarin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor resulted in clinical improvement over the following year, and remission was maintained. At the age of 13 years, the patient developed Crohn disease and IgA nephropathy recurred. Significant increases in serum IgA were associated with progression of Crohn disease. An elemental diet combined with oral prednisolone resulted in clinical improvement of Crohn disease and in remission of nephropathy and normalization of serum IgA concentration. The clinical course of the two diseases was linked, suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism involving an IgA immune response to mucosal challenge in the intestine.", 
    "256": "The present work aimed to assess, in Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats, whether an early and prolonged inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could result in a blood pressure (BP) lowering and nephroprotection that persist after its withdrawal. Male LH rats received orally from 3 to 12 wk of age either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril at the doses of 0.4 and 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) or an AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan at the dose of 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1). BP, histological changes in the kidney, and urinary protein excretion were examined during and 10 wk after cessation of the treatments. Both perindopril and losartan decreased BP, prevented renal lesions, and limited urinary protein excretion. After cessation of the treatment, BP returned to the level of never-treated LH rats in rats having received 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of perindopril while it remained slightly lower in those treated with 0.4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of perindopril or with losartan. This lack of marked persistent antihypertensive effect contrasted with a durable decrease in urinary protein excretion and improvement of the renal histological lesions. In conclusion, it is possible to separate the BP-lowering effects of RAS blockade from those on glomerulosclerosis and urinary protein excretion.",

    "262": "The hypertrophic response to overload plays an important role in the progressive deterioration of the failing heart--the \"Cardiomyopathy of Overload\"--and so contributes to the poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. Although increased myocyte size reduces the load on individual sarcomeres, hypertrophy also has maladaptive features. The latter include molecular changes that weaken and impair relaxation in the overloaded heart, and accelerate cardiac myocyte death. Different types of overload lead to concentric and eccentric hypertrophy; as the latter tends to progress (\"remodeling\"), dilatation is associated with an especially poor prognosis. Concentric hypertrophy is due largely to cardiac myocyte thickening, while eccentric hypertrophy is caused by cell elongation. These differences, along with evidence that concentric hypertrophy is initiated by increased diastolic stretch while eccentric hypertrophy results from increased systolic stress, indicate that these growth responses are mediated by different signal transudation pathways. The beneficial effects of neurohumoral blockers in patients with heart failure are due partly to their ability to inhibit maladaptive features of overload-induced proliferative signaling. The molecular complexity of the hypertrophic response now being uncovered offers opportunities for the development of new therapy to inhibit remodeling and cell death in the failing heart.",

The PERFECT study is designed as a parallel group randomised placebo controlled trial to determine the effect of Perindopril (8 mg) on brachial artery endothelial function in patients with stable coronary artery disease without clinical heart failure. In the PERFECT study, B-mode ultrasonography of the brachial artery is used as a model for changes in the coronary arteries. Endothelial function in response to ischaemia (reactive hyperaemia) and to vasoconstriction (cold pressor test) is assessed. The ischemia test is used a model to assess the effects of ACE inhibition on nitric oxide/bradykinine mediated vasodilatatory response to ischaemia, whereas the cold pressor test is applied to assess the effect of ACE inhibition on the neurohormonal response. The recruitment for the PERFECT study started in May 1998 en was completed in June 1999. 345 patients were recruited in 20 European centers. The Vascular Imaging Center Utrecht, an ultrasound core laboratory, is performing the endothelial function measurements. The primary study outcomes are (1) percentage change in flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery between the 36 month measurement and the baseline measurement and (2) percentage change in neurohormonal mediated vasoconstriction of the brachial artery between the 36 month measurement and the baseline measurement.

    "287": "Lisinopril decreased the clinic BP and ABP, the latter from 134/85 to 126/82 mm Hg at 6 months (P =.01 v placebo) and 121/79 mm Hg after 2 years (P =.03 v placebo). Fewer patients in the lisinopril group required added amlodipine to control the BP (P =.01). Data on left ventricular (LV) mass are difficult to interpret because by coincidence in this small study, the lisinopril group had lower initial values than placebo. However, in the lisinopril group mean LV mass decreased by 10% (P =.02) and mass index by 13% (P =.01), whereas placebo LV mass and index did not change. The LV end-diastolic diameter increased only in the placebo group (P =.008). There were no significant changes in any of the other secondary outcomes, including the cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance.", 
    "288": "Thus, in these post-transplant patients, stricter BP control to normal levels by the addition of lisinopril to existing therapy, reduced BP and modestly decreased LV mass without altering cardiac hemodynamic function.", 
    "289": "The prevalence of primary aldosteronism (PA) was assessed in a specialized hypertension center. Baseline and postcaptopril (50 mg orally) aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio (A/R) as a screening tool were preliminarily tested in a sample including 22 patients with histories of PA and 53 patients with low-renin essential hypertension (EH). Sensitivity and specificity of A/R > or =35 were 95.4% and 28.3% at baseline, compared with 100% and 67.9% after captopril. Using postcaptopril A/R > or =35 and confirmation by acute saline loading, a PA prevalence of 6.3% was found among 1046 consecutive hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Of those 66 PA patients, 16 (24.2%) had a unilateral adenoma, whereas 50 (75.8%) had idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. At presentation, 45.4% of the PA and 16.3% of EH patients were treated with two or more antihypertensive drugs (chi(2) = 33.117, P <.0001). However, among untreated patients (n = 553), the prevalence of mild-to-moderate hypertension (ie, <180/110 mm Hg) was not different between patients with PA and those with EH (70.6% v 76.7%, chi(2) = 0.086, P =.770). Serum potassium > or =3.6 mEq/L was found in 60.6% of PA patients. In conclusion, we observed the following: 1) postcaptopril compared with baseline A/R is a better screening tool for PA; 2) PA is relatively frequent among hypertensive individuals; 3) PA is not necessarily associated with severe hypertension; and 4) hypokalemia is an insensitive screening criterion for PA.", 
    "290": "Hypertension and coronary artery disease are intimately connected. The migration of circulating monocytes into the subendothelial occurs through the expression of some adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. The nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a redox-sensitive element, plays a key role in adhesion molecule gene induction. In this study we have compared the effects of two different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, one possessing an active sulfhydryl group (zofenopril) and one lacking this group (enalapril) on the cellular redox state (monitored by measuring intracellular reactive oxygen species and thiol status), expression of adhesion molecules, and activation of NF-kappaB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Zofenoprilat, the active form of zofenopril, significantly and dose dependently reduced the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide formation induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) (P <.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (P <.001). Enalaprilat, the active form of enalapril, was ineffective. Zofenoprilat but not enalaprilat also decreased the consumption of the intracellular GSH induced by ox-LDL (P <.01) and TNF-alpha (P <.01). Although zofenoprilat significantly and dose dependently reduced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin induced by ox-LDL (P <.01) and TNF-alpha (P <.01) on HUVECs, enalaprilat did not. Ox-LDL and TNF-alpha increased the activation of NF-kappaB and the preincubation of HUVECs with zofenoprilat, but not with enalaprilat, dose dependently reduced its activation (P <.001). The conclusion is that the sulfhydryl (SH)-containing ACE inhibitors may be useful in inhibiting foam cell formation and thus slow the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "291": "Numerous studies have emphasized the important role of altered Ca(2+) channel function in hypertension. We previously showed that Ca(2+) currents measured in myocytes isolated from both Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) small mesenteric arteries closely correlated with systolic blood pressure (BP) during normal development. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor normalizes Ca(2+) channel function in SHR myocytes along with BP. Ramipril (3.5 mg/kg/day) was added to the drinking water of 12-week-old male WKY and SHR for 8 weeks. Segments of small mesenteric arteries were used for isometric contraction studies, and for isolation of myocytes for measurement of Ca(2+) and K(+) currents (I(Ca) and I(K)) by patch clamp methods. Ramipril treatment decreased systolic pressure in WKY and SHR, decreased heart weight and heart weight-to-body weight ratio in SHR, and decreased body weight in WKY. Maximum contractile responses to Bay k 8644 in SMA from ramipril-treated SHR were smaller compared to untreated SHR (10% +/- 2% v 55% +/- 7% of the response to 120 mmol/L KCl). The smaller responses in WKY were not affected by ramipril treatment (11% +/- 4% v 8% +/- 3%). Contractile responses to 10 mmol/L tetraethylammonium (TEA) were not different in untreated versus ramipril-treated SHR (65% +/- 6% v 82% +/- 8%) but were increased in treated WKY (4% +/- 1% v 35% +/- 9%). Ramipril treatment decreased peak I(Ca) and equalized the voltage-dependence of I(Ca) activation between SHR and WKY. The I(K) measured from holding potentials of -60 and -20 mV were significantly smaller in treated SHR and WKY compared to their untreated counterparts, as was the component of I(K) measured in the presence of 100 nmol/L iberiotoxin. These results show that ramipril treatment decreases arterial pressure and Ca(2+) channel function in SHR as expected but unexpectedly also decreases I(K) in both WKY and SHR. These results suggest that angiotensin may have a BP independent effect on ion channel function in arterial smooth muscle.", 
    "292": "Evidence links the insulin resistance syndrome with endothelial dysfunction. Previously, we have described a decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in both aortic endothelium and cardiac tissue, and an increased proliferation of aortic primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (pC-VSMCs), obtained from fructose-fed rats (FFR), an experimental model of syndrome X. Because the participation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this model is still unclear, the present study examined the effect of chronic administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (E) on pC-VSMCs proliferation and eNOS activity in a conduit artery (aorta) and in resistance vessels (mesenteric vascular bed) from fructose-fed rats. Male Wistar rats were used: Control, FFR, Control + E, and FFR + E (n = 8 in each group). After 8 weeks, tissue samples were obtained and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) proliferative effect was examined in pC-SMCs of aortic and mesenteric arteries by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The eNOS activity was estimated in endothelial lining from both origins by conversion of [(3)H]arginine into [(3)H]citrulline. The FFR aortic and mesenteric pC-VSMCs showed a significantly increased 10% FCS-induced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation compared to controls. The FFR aortic and mesenteric endothelium eNOS activity was significantly decreased. Chronic treatment with E abolished the increased proliferation and restored eNOS activity. These data confirm that changes in VSMCs proliferation and endothelial dysfunction at different levels of the vascular system are involved in syndrome X, and that the inhibition of angiotensin II production can revert those changes, suggesting an important role for RAS and possibly kinins, in the physiopathologic mechanism of this model of syndrome X.",

Data from 3374 patients who started dialysis in 1996 with valid follow-up times were available for analysis, censored at the time of renal transplantation and followed until March 2000. Cox regression analysis was used to model factors associated with time to first hospitalization for ACS (ICD9 code 410.x or 411.x) adjusted for comorbidities, demographic factors, baseline laboratory values, blood pressures and cholesterol levels, type of vascular access, dialysis adequacy, and cardioprotective medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beta blockers, and aspirin). Follow-up was 2.19 +/- 1.14 years.", 
    "295": "The incidence of ACS was 29/1000 person-years. Factors associated with ACS were older age, the extreme high and low ranges of serum cholesterol level, history of coronary heart disease (CHD), male gender, and diabetes. No cardioprotective medications including statins had a significant association with ACS in this study. However, medications known to reduce mortality after ACS were used in less than 50% of patients with known CHD at the start of the study, and statins were used in less than 10% of patients with CHD.",

Prognostic discrimination was maximized by considering pre- and post-systolic and diastolic blood pressure values simultaneously, in a pattern suggesting that wide pulse pressures were associated with mortality (P < 0.0001). Comorbidity adjustment markedly affected associations, with low pre-dialysis diastolic (P < 0.05), low post-dialysis dialysis diastolic pressure (P < 0.05), high post-dialysis dialysis systolic pressure (P < 0.05), and high interdialytic weight gains (P = 0.005) associated with mortality. Each class of antihypertensive drug, except angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, was associated with lower mortality in unadjusted models, an effect most pronounced for beta-blockers (hazards ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79, P < 0.0001). Comorbidity adjustment eliminated survival associations for each antihypertensive class except beta-blockers.", 
    "300": "Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure values have independent associations with mortality, in a way that implicates wide pulse pressures. Much of the adverse prognosis of wide pulse pressures probably reflects older age and cardiovascular comorbidity. Large interdialytic weight gains are associated with shorter survival when comorbidity is taken into account. Beta-blocker use shows a robust association with survival, and may be protective.", 
    "301": "Diabetes has become the most common single cause of end-stage renal disease in many countries. The coexistence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension dramatically increases the risk of developing target organ complications including renal disease. There are good arguments that ESRD in the patient with diabetes is largely preventable with the interventions currently available. For type 2 diabetes the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group Trial clearly documented that the frequency of microangiopathic sequelae can be diminished by glycaemic control and even more impressively by intensified antihypertensive treatment. An analysis of recent randomized long-term clinical trials that evaluated the rate of decline in renal function demonstrated that the lower the blood pressure within the range of normotensive values, the greater the preservation of renal function. Since the 1994 Working Group Report on Hypertension and Diabetes suggested a goal blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg should be achieved in patients with diabetes and/or renal insufficiency; lower blood pressure levels, i.e. less than 125/75 mmHg are recommended for patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d and renal insufficiency regardless of etiology. Antihypertensive regimens should include an ACE inhibitor or an AT1-receptor blocker in order to provide maximum renal benefits in diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases. Such low blood pressure are virtually impossible to achieve with monotherapy. In most cases the combination of two and more antihypertensive drugs is necessary. The purpose of this report is to update the previous recommendations with a focus on level of blood pressure control, proteinuria reduction and retarding the progression of renal disease.",

They exhibit different pharmaceutical profiles (intestinal antisecretatory action for the (R) enantiomer, i.e. dexecadotril, and cardiovascular activity for the (S) enantiomer, i.e. ecadotril). Fasidotril is a related compound which has special interest as an equipotent dual inhibitor of NEP and ACE (EC 3.4.15.1). This behavior confers on fasidotril powerful pharmaceutical properties in the cardiovascular field. This review deals with various synthetic approaches, either published or patented, for access to the enantiomerically pure or highly enriched forms of these drugs. Thus, different methods have been studied, which are taken from different methodologies of resolution procedures and asymmetric synthesis, namely : i- Synthesis from a chiron from the chiral pool ii- Chemical resolution of racemic precursors iii- Enzymatic resolution and desymmetrization of meso starting materials iv- Asymmetric synthesis, including enantioselective catalytic hydrogenation, alkaloid catalyzed asymmetric Michael additions, and diastereoselective alkylation of a chiral derivative.

Blood pressure orthostatic changes were measured prospectively in a standardized fashion up to 10 minutes, or until symptoms occurred, in all consecutive patients with syncope as a chief complaint presenting in the emergency department (ED) of a primary and tertiary care hospital. Patients unable to stand-up were excluded. Hypotension was considered to be the cause of syncope when there was: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) >or= 20 mm Hg with simultaneous symptoms; (2) a decrease in SBP between 10 and 20 mm Hg, but a SBP <or= 90 mm Hg with or without symptoms; and (3) a nonsignificant decrease in SBP in the ED, but a prehospital value <or= 80 mm Hg was documented that prompted fluid therapy before standardized measurements. Among 788 patients with syncope seen in the ED during a 20-month period, 650 were included in the study, and 579 (89%) had standardized measurements of SBP. According to diagnostic criteria, orthostatic hypotension was considered to be the cause of syncope in 156 of them (24%). Fifty-eight patients (37%) had drug-induced hypotension, 33 (21%) hypovolemia, 19 (12%) postprandial hypotension, and 46 (29%) idiopathic hypotension. Asymptomatic SBP changes >or= 20 mm Hg were found in 10% of patients with syncope attributed to other causes. Compared with patients with vasovagal disorder, those with orthostatic hypotension were older; had more comorbid conditions including hypertension, organic heart disease, and abnormal electrocardiogram; were taking more hypotensive medications; and required more frequently hospitalization (P <.01). We concluded that standardized blood pressure measurement in the ED enabled to strongly implicate orthostatic hypotension as a cause of syncope in 24% of patients with this symptom. Drug-related hypotension was the most frequent cause for this disorder.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to benefit patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction irrespective of symptoms. Despite ACE inhibitor use, left ventricular dysfunction continues to progress in most patients. In addition, ACE inhibitors are substantially underused in patients who would benefit, in large part due to physician concern over potential adverse effects. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been proposed as either potential substitutes for ACE inhibitors or as additive therapy for heart failure patients. The authors will review the importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the progression of heart failure, as well as the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and ARBs counteract this effect. The clinical evidence to date supporting the use of ARBs in heart failure also will be reviewed. Based on current trials, ARBs are suitable substitutes for ACE inhibitors in patients who have true ACE inhibitor intolerance, but ACE inhibitors should still be considered first-line therapy in the treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure. ARBs are a reasonable additive therapy in patients on maximal ACE inhibitor therapy who remain symptomatic, especially in patients unable to tolerate beta blockade.",

Angioedema can be life threatening but more times than not its occurrence can be managed with conservative treatment measures including discontinuation of the medication and/or administration of an antihistamine. Occasionally, epinephrine and/or steroid therapy may be warranted. In a patient having experienced ACE inhibitor-related angioedema, angiotensin receptor blockers should be used cautiously if at all. If angiotensin receptor blocker therapy is being considered in a patient with prior ACE inhibitor-related angioedema there should be some justification for the use. Such justification might include the presence of heart failure or proteinuric nephropathic states among other considerations.",

The present article illustrates how pharmacoepidemiology can facilitate evaluation of the clinical potential of different drugs used to treat hypertension. 2. The evidence base for the drug treatment of hypertension is very strong. Large-scale outcome trials, largely based on diuretics, indicate that stroke events are prevented to the extent expected from blood pressure reduction, but there appears to be a shortfall in the prevention of coronary heart disease events. 3. On theoretical grounds, newer agents may be expected to have benefits in coronary heart disease prevention beyond blood pressure reduction. Recent trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers suggest no advantage over conventional drugs, but shortcomings in these studies mean that each is uninformative. 4. Observational studies based on pharmacoepidemiological principles offer an alternative approach to evaluating outcomes in treated hypertensives. 5. Evidence from the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic database suggest that there are outcome differences between antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment is associated with a mortality advantage, whereas calcium channel blocker therapy is associated with a poorer prognosis. Preliminary findings from a primary care database support these observations. 6. Long-term follow up of a well-documented high-risk clinical population may allow detection of outcome differences not apparent in relatively short-term clinical trials. 7. Appropriate interpretation of observational data necessitates an understanding of the strengths and limitations of observational data.

The patient was diagnosed as having middle aortic syndrome. This case was atypical because most cases of this disease are seen in children and young adults. After administration of diuretics and ACE-I, the heart failure and hypertension were both improved.

    "348": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are potent new antihypertensive agents. The dual inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase may result in synergistic humoral effects with unique hemodynamic actions. We investigated the hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of vasopeptidase inhibition in conscious dogs made hypertensive by bilateral renal wrapping and subsequently instrumented for long-term assessment of left ventricular pressure and volume (n=8). Intravenous vasopeptidase inhibition (omapatrilat, 30 micromol/kg over 10 minutes) reduced peak left ventricular pressure (171+/-6 versus 130+/-6 mm Hg immediately after infusion, P<0.01) through arterial vasodilation (arterial elastance, 9.8+/-0.8 to 5.8+/-1.6 mm Hg/mL, P<0.01) and preload reduction (left ventricular end-diastolic volume, 51.1+/-6.8 to 46.0+/-6.9 mL, P<0.01). At 60 minutes, preload decreased further (40.5+/-5.9 mL, P<0.01 versus baseline). Vasopeptidase inhibition increased plasma levels of adrenomedullin (41.2+/-9.6 versus 72.3+/-15 pg/mL, P<0.01), whereas levels of the natriuretic peptides and cGMP were unchanged. Similar hemodynamic and humoral effects were observed with long-term therapy. Neither an equimolar dose of an ACE inhibitor (fosinopril) nor exogenous adrenomedullin had as potent of a hypotensive effect, and neither reduced preload. In summary, the potent short-term and long-term hypotensive effects of vasopeptidase inhibition were prominently mediated by preload reduction, an effect not reproduced by ACE inhibition nor adrenomedullin augmentation and not associated with enhanced natriuretic peptide levels. Combined arterial vasodilation and preload reduction may confer additional potency as well as unique cardioprotective effects. Synergistic effects on humoral and probably endothelial vasodilatory factors appear to be important in mediating the unique hemodynamic profile of vasopeptidase inhibition in this form of experimental hypertension.", 
    "349": "The antihypertrophic action of angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the heart is attributed in part to potentiation of bradykinin. Bradykinin prevents hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes by releasing nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells, which increases cardiomyocyte guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP). It is unknown whether cyclic GMP is essential for the action of bradykinin, or whether findings in isolated cardiomyocytes apply in whole hearts, in the presence of other cell types and mechanical/dynamic activity. We now examine the contribution of cyclic GMP to the antihypertrophic action of bradykinin in cardiomyocytes and perfused hearts. In adult rat isolated cardiomyocytes cocultured with bovine aortic endothelial cells, the inhibitory action of bradykinin (10 micromol/L) against Ang II (1 micromol/L)-induced [3H]phenylalanine incorporation was abolished by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor [1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (10 micromol/L). In Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, Ang II (10 nmol/L)-induced increases in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression were prevented by bradykinin (100 nmol/L), the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (3 micromol/L), and the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (100 nmol/L). The acute antihypertrophic action of bradykinin was accompanied by increased left ventricular cyclic GMP, and the ramiprilat effect was attenuated by HOE 140 (1 micromol/L, a B2-kinin receptor antagonist) or [1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (100 nmol/L). In conclusion, bradykinin exerts a direct inhibitory action against the acute hypertrophic response to Ang II in rat isolated hearts, and elevation of cardiomyocyte cyclic GMP may be an important antihypertrophic mechanism used by bradykinin and ramiprilat in the heart.",

Polarized confluent human Fallopian tube epithelial cell cultures were used under short-circuit conditions to study the actions of angiotensin II on electrogenic ion transport. The results demonstrate that angiotensin II increases baseline short-circuit current, implying a net transport of negatively charged ions from a basal to apical direction. This effect was inhibited by the selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan. The effects of angiotensin II on short-circuit current were rapid in onset, brief in duration, and although less than those achieved with ATP, similar in amplitude to those described for other epithelia with angiotensin II. These findings reflect a significant retention of function for these cells in monolayer culture. Immunohistochemistry using the antibody 6313/G2, which is directed against a specific sequence in the extracellular domain of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, confirmed that the receptor was retained in cultured cells. The results indicate that angiotensin II plays a role in regulating the composition of Fallopian tube secretions.", 
    "357": "Sulfhydryl group donors, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), may enhance the antihypertensive effect of some drugs through a nitric oxide (NO) mechanism. It has been observed that the hypotensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is, at least partially, mediated by NO. We performed a within patient crossover study with the aim to investigate the potential effect of NAC on the ACEI antihypertensive action, via an NO-dependent mechanism. We studied 18 smoker (> 10 years of habit and > 10 cigarettes daily) hypertensive patients (15 males and three females, aged 69 +/- 5 years) on ACEI therapy (11 captopril and seven enalapril). Patients were randomly allocated to two treatment arms. In one arm, the patients (n = 10) initially received the addition of NAC (600 mg t.i.d.) to the ACEI regimen. In the other group (n = 8), the patients remained only on ACEI. After 21 days, the therapeutic patterns were crossed. The first group received only ACEI, and the second group received ACEI and NAC and completed other 21-day treatment period. We evaluate the effect of NAC on each patient by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), performed at the end of each therapeutic regimen. A significant decrease in systolic and diastolic 24-h blood pressure (24 hBP) and daytime BP (dtBP) was achieved with the combination of ACEI and NAC (ACEI + NAC) when compared to the period with only ACEI: 24 hBP = 146.1 +/- 4.2 vs 137 +/- 3.1 (p < 0.05) and 89.2 +/- 2.8 vs 83.5 +/- 3.7mmHg (p = 0.01). DtBP: 149.7 +/- 5.6 vs 141 +/- 3.7 and 92.1 +/- 4 vs 86 +/- 3.2 (both, p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in night-time BP (ntBP). The NAC effect was not statistically different for the two ACEIs. In conclusion, the addition of NAC to an ACEI potentiates its antihypertensive effect during 24hBP and dtBP in smoker hypertensives. This effect may be mediated by an NO-dependent mechanism, probably through the protective effect of NAC on NO oxidation.",

Cilazapril was administered in a single daily dose of 2.5-5 mg for 24 weeks. Four measurements of arterial pressure, echocardiography, estimation of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose tolerance tests were made before the treatment and on its weeks 4, 12 and 24.

Follow-up was 6 weeks. The assessment was made by the data of clinical and biochemical blood tests, ophthalmological examination, registration of ECG and echo-CG. Arterial pressure was measured weekly by a doctor and daily (in the morning and evening) by patients themselves. A complete antihypertensive effect (AP < 150/90 mm Hg) in monotherapy with invoril was achieved in 18 (60%) patients, in therapy with diovan in 26 (86.7%) patients.

We implemented a rational design approach to identify potent and selective ACE2 inhibitors. To this end, picomolar inhibitors of ACE2 were designed and synthesized.", 
    "382": "Seven kinds of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates of wakame (Undaria pinnatifida) by Protease S \"Amano\" (from Bacillus stearothermophilus) by using three-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase column. These peptides were identified by amino acid composition analysis, sequence analysis, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as Val-Tyr (IC(50) = 35.2 microM), Ile-Tyr (6.1 microM), Ala-Trp (18.8 microM), Phe-Tyr (42.3 microM), Val-Trp (3.3 microM), Ile-Trp (1.5 microM), and Leu-Trp (23.6 microM). These peptides have resistance against gastrointestinal proteases in vitro. Each peptide was determined to have an antihypertensive effect after a single oral administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Among them, the blood pressure significantly decreased by Val-Tyr, Ile-Tyr, Phe-Tyr, and Ile-Trp in a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight (BW). The present study showed that antihypertensive effect in the hydrolysates of wakame by Protease S \"Amano\" was attributed to these peptides.",

This purified dioscorin was shown by spectrophotometric methods to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in a dose-dependent manner (12.5-750 microg, respectively, 20.83-62.5% inhibitions) using N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]-Phe-Gly-Gly (FAPGG) as substrates. The 50% inhibition (IC(50)) of ACE activity was 6.404 microM dioscorin (250 microg corresponding to 7.81 nmol) compared to that of 0.00781 microM (0.0095 nmol) for captopril. The commercial bovine serum albumin and casein (bovine milk) showed less ACE inhibitory activity. The use of qualitative TLC also showed dioscorin as ACE inhibitors. Dioscorin showed mixed noncompetitive inhibitions against ACE; when 31.25 microg of dioscorin (0.8 microM) was added, the apparent inhibition constant (K(i)) was 2.738 microM. Pepsin was used for dioscorin hydrolysis at 37 degrees C for different times. It was found that the ACE inhibitory activity was increased from 51.32% to about 75% during 32 h hydrolysis. The smaller peptides were increased with increasing pepsin hydrolytic times. Dioscorin and its hydrolysates might be a potential for hypertension control when people consume yam tuber.", 
    "384": "In this study, we investigated whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the progression of cerebral infarct lesions after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. After placebo or trandolapril was administered orally for 7 days, we infarcted in the territory of the right MCA by extracranial vascular occlusion and studied the effect of trandolapril on brain ACE activity and infarct size 7 days after MCA occlusion. In placebo-treated rats, brain ACE activity in the infarct side was increased by a significant 1.34-fold compared with that in the non-infarct side 7 days after MCA occlusion. Brain ACE activities in the infarct sides were suppressed to 39.8% by trandolapril treatment. The ratios of unilateral infarcts to the total coronal sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 48.1 +/- 3.3% and 37.4 +/- 2.3%, respectively, and the difference between these values was significant. These results demonstrate that inhibition of the increased brain ACE activity in infarct lesions can reduce the infarction area after MCA occlusion.", 
    "385": "Pulse pressure, especially in central arteries, is an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with increased elastic artery stiffness (or elastance). The central arterial pressure wave is composed of a forward traveling wave generated by left ventricular ejection and a later arriving reflected wave from the periphery. Increased stiffness of elastic arteries is the primary cause of increased pulse pressure in subjects with degeneration and hyperplasia of the arterial wall. As stiffness increases, transmission velocity of both forward and reflected waves increase, which causes the reflected wave to arrive earlier in the central aorta and augments pressure in late systole [ie, augmentation index = (augmented pressure/pulse pressure) increases]. These changes in wave reflection properties are associated with vascular disease and aging and cause an increase in left ventricular afterload, myocardial mass, and oxygen consumption. Vasoactive drugs have little direct effect on large elastic arteries but can markedly change wave reflection amplitude and augmentation index by altering stiffness of the muscular arteries and modifying transmission velocity of the reflected wave from the periphery to the heart. This change in amplitude and timing of the reflected wave causes a generalized change in central arterial systolic and pulse pressure that is not detected by cuff pressure measurements in the brachial artery.",

Most of the interventions that have demonstrated benefit address cardiac risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The results of the HOPE study have recently expanded the indications for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the prevention of heart failure. Once heart failure occurs, a variety of interventions can prevent recurrent episodes of congestion. Biventricular pacing, left ventricular assist devices, and disease-specific management clinics join more standard medical therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, digoxin, and spironolactone in improving outcomes for patients with this disorder.",

Factors that must be considered for the treatment of hypertension in patients, particularly with type 2 diabetes. Professor J.M. Mallion stressed the contribution of thiazide and thiazide-like diruetics as indapamid, especially the 1.5 mg SR formulation. Professor F. Forette and Doctor O. Hanon recalled that the HYVET study is expected to confirm the beneficial effect of this same treatment on morbidity and mortality in very elderly patients. Professor O. Dubourg recalled the beneficial effect of indapamid SR on LVH demonstrated in the LIVE study. Likewise, Professor M.

    "389": "It was demonstrated that indapamide SR is the only diuretic providing a significant reduction (35%) in the microalbuminuria observed in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. At the endpoint, comparison with the group of patients treated with enalapril, showed no significant difference in fractionated albumin clearance or in the percentage of patients with normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria or gross proteinuria. Safety and tolerance were comparable for the two treatments.", 
    "390": "CARDIOVASCULAR RISK OF LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY: Because of the rhythmic, mechanical and ischemic risk related to it, the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is considered to be a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease which should be screened for and treated early. In patients with type 2 diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy is mainly due to high blood pressure, but also to reduced elasticity of the large vessels, defective vasomotricity and dysfunction of the arterial endothelium. Obesity, elevated blood viscosity, hyperinsulinism and/or autonomous cardiac neuropathy can also have a favoring effect. THE LIVE STUDY: Is the first multicentric European study comparing the efficacy of a thiazide-like diuretic, slow-release indapamid, with a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril 20 mg, on the reduction of the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in hypertensive subjects with LVH. The study involved a randomized centralized reading of the echocardiograms as well as a randomized and blinded reading at the end of the study. DEMONSTRATED SUPERIORITY OF INDAPAMID SR: The LIVE study clearly demonstrated the superiority of indapamid SR over enalapril 20 mg in reducing the LVMI in hypertensive subjects with LVH while the blood pressure lowering effect was comparable for the two treatments.",

Consequently, drugs that increase myocardial perfusion and decrease oxygen consumption of the remodeled myocardium are of particular interest to cardiac surgeons.

This study tests the hypothesis whether acute ACE inhibition during cardioplegic arrest improves outcome in failing rat hearts.",

Hearts were harvested and studied on a red cell-perfused working heart: 60 minutes of ischemia, protected by cold blood cardioplegia (CP) every 20 minutes, and 45 minutes of reperfusion. Rats were randomly assigned to 2 groups, 1 group receiving the ACE-I quinaprilat with CP (QuinaMI, n=11), and 1 group receiving CP only (MI, n=8). Hemodynamic recovery, high-energy phosphates (HEP), and morphometry were analyzed. Groups showed similar degrees of myocardial infarction (44+/-5 versus 39+/-4% of LVmass), LVEDP (5.0+/-1 versus 4+/-1 mm Hg) and no differences in baseline values such as external heart work (EHW) and coronary flow (CF). At the end of reperfusion, EHW and CF were significantly higher in QuinaMI than MI (P<0.05 and 0.01), LVEDP had returned to baseline in QuinaMI (P<0.01). HEP were significantly higher preserved in QuinaMI than MI (P<0.05).",

LV function was evaluated by echocardiography and catheterization. Oxidative stress in the myocardium was estimated by immunohistochemistry for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. One week after LVR, LV end-diastolic area was smaller and fractional area change was better in the 2 LVR groups. Four weeks after LVR, LV end-diastolic area, and fractional area change deteriorated in group R but not so much in group RA; E-max was higher in group RA (0.79+/-0.20 mm Hg/mL) than in groups A (0.25+/-0.03 mm Hg/mL; P<0.01) and group R (0.27+/-0.03 mm Hg/mL; P<0.01).

    "397": "Aggressive treatment of atherosclerotic risk factors can substantially reduce stroke risk in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Data from several recent large clinical trials provide convincing evidence of benefit for a number of specific therapies directed at this population. The authors recommend treatment with ramipril alone or perindopril plus indapamide regardless of blood pressure, provided there is no contraindication. For patients already taking a different angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, the authors do not routinely switch agents. The authors recommend use of simvastatin 40 mg per day in patients with a total cholesterol level of 135 mg/dL or greater, provided no contraindication exists. The authors also recommend consideration of gemfibrozil in patients with isolated low high- density lipoprotein levels. In patients with diabetes mellitus, tight glycemic control has not been shown to reduce macrovascular complications such as stroke, but does reduce microvascular complications. However, diabetics should receive especially aggressive treatment of other vascular risk factors. There is no role for post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy in prevention of stroke. Weight loss for overweight patients, regular exercise, and a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, cereals, and fish, as well as low in fat and cholesterol, should be a standard recommendation for this group of patients. Treatment with folic acid, B(6), and B(12) for patients with elevated homocysteine appears rational, though this is unproven. However, there is no benefit to vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene supplementation. Smokers should stop. For every 43 smokers who quit, one stroke is prevented. Moderate consumption of alcohol (one to two drinks a day) may be beneficial, but heavy alcohol use (more than five drinks a day) increases stroke risk.",

As endogenous formation of angiotensin and bradykinin is increased in ischemia, we investigated the effects of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat and the AT -receptor antagonist candesartan on cardiac norepinephrine release in isolated perfused rat hearts, under nonischemic and stop-flow conditions. Exocytotic release of endogenous norepinephrine was induced by electrical field stimulation and measured by HPLC. Paired stimulations were applied in each heart to obtain an intraindividual comparison of the effect of the pharmacological agent on norepinephrine release with the release under baseline conditions. The ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat (0.1-10 nM) and the AT -receptor antagonist candesartan (1-100 nM) were studied during normal flow or in the fourth minute of stop-flow. Under nonischemic conditions, the ACE-inhibitor slightly reduced norepinephrine release at the highest concentration, while the AT -receptor antagonist did not influence norepinephrine release in normoxia. Conversely, both substances significantly increased norepinephrine release during ischemia. Augmentation of norepinephrine release in ischemia by ramiprilat and candesartan was blocked by the bradykinin B -receptor antagonist HOE 140 and, in case of candesartan, by the AT -receptor antagonist PD 123319. The ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat and AT -receptor antagonist candesartan enhance cardiac norepinephrine release selectively in ischemia by stimulating presynaptic bradykinin B -receptors.

The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on markers of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in kidney transplant patients with posttransplant hypertension. Monocyte p22, a NADH/NADPH system subunit, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and endothelial NOS gene expression were measured in 16 patients. Angiotensin II is a potent stimulator of oxidative stress and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may blunt this effect. Therefore, the same parameters were measured before and after 2 months of treatment with ramipril (5 mg/d). At baseline, in cyclosporine-and tacrolimus-treated patients, p22 and TGF-beta mRNA were similarly increased in comparison with normotensive healthy controls (0.90 +/- 0.05 d.u. and 0.83 +/- 0.05 in cyclosporine, 0.89 +/- 0.07 and 0.84 +/- 0.05 in tacrolimus; 0.53 +/- 0.07 and 0.75 +/- 0.03 in controls, respectively; p < 0.001).

Rats were treated with placebo, with the ET receptor antagonist LU 135252 (30 mg/kg/d), with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg/d), or with a combination of LU 135252 and trandolapril. Infarct size was similar among the groups. In the placebo group, the concentration-response curve of the endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly shifted to the right and the maximum relaxation was attenuated (R 53 +/- 3%) compared with the sham placebo group (R 72 +/- 3%). Treatment with LU 135252 as well as trandolapril significantly improved acetylcholine-induced maximum relaxation (LU 135252 66 +/- 4%, trandolapril 67 +/- 4%, p < 0.05 versus CHF placebo). In addition to R (LU 135252/trandolapril 70 +/- 4%), combination therapy also improved the pathologic rightward shift (p < 0.05). Increased O production in CHF was significantly reduced in all treatment groups. The increased relaxation elicited by exogenous superoxide dismutase in CHF was reduced to normal values by monotherapy and further attenuated by combination treatment. Although monotherapy with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril and the ET receptor antagonist LU 135252 improved endothelial dysfunction in experimental CHF, combination therapy was more effective.",

Eight-week-old spontaneously hypertensive male rats were subjected to five-sixths nephrectomy. At the age of 10 weeks, the rats were randomly allocated to groups that received two doses of CS-866 (CS-L, 3 mg/kg/day; CS-H, 10 mg/kg/day), temocapril (TEM, 10 mg/kg/day), CS-866 (3 mg/kg/day) plus temocapril (10 mg/kg/day), or a vehicle alone (untreated control group). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary protein excretion (UprotV) were measured every 2 weeks. When the rats were 18 weeks old, biochemical measurement and histologic examination were performed. All the drug treatments significantly reduced SBP, UprotV, glomerular sclerosis index (GSI), relative interstitial volume (RIV), and heart weight. The hypotensive effects were on the order of combination therapy > CS-H = TEM > CS-L. Correlational analysis was based on the values for SBP and UprotV derived from the average of values obtained when the rats were 12 to 18 weeks of age. UprotV, GSI, and RIV were found to be highly correlated with SBP among the individual rats pooled from all the groups, and the correlation was maintained among the group means. A similar correlation was found between heart weight and SBP. The results suggest that the organ protective effects of temocapril, CS-866, and combination therapy are closely related to the magnitude of their antihypertensive effects.", 
    "427": "We estimated glomerular cell number in 50 normotensive type 1 diabetic patients with raised albumin excretion rate (AER) and investigated any change after 3 years in a subgroup of 16 placebo-treated patients. Biopsies from 10 normal kidney donors were used as controls. Mesangial and endothelial cell number was increased in the 50 diabetic patients at the start of the study compared with control subjects. There was no difference in podocyte number. Glomerular volume was increased in diabetic patients, but surface area of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) underlying the podocytes did not differ between groups. AER correlated positively with mesangial cell number in microalbuminuric patients (r = 0.44, P = 0.012) and negatively with podocyte number in proteinuric patients (r = -0.48, P = 0.040). In the 16 placebo-treated patients, glomerular volume increased after 3 years owing to matrix accumulation and increased GBM surface area. Although overall cell number did not differ significantly from baseline, the decrease in podocyte number during follow-up correlated with AER at follow-up (r = -0.72, P = 0.002). In conclusion, cross-sectional analysis of podocyte number in type 1 diabetic patients with raised AER but normal blood pressure shows no significant reduction compared with nondiabetic control subjects. Longitudinal data provide evidence for an association between podocyte loss and AER, but whether cellular changes are a response to, a cause of, or concomitant with the progression of nephropathy remains uncertain.", 
    "428": "Analysing specific non-fatal events in isolation may lead to spurious conclusions about efficacy unless the events considered are combined with all-cause mortality. The use of combined endpoints has therefore become widespread, at least in cardiovascular disease trials. Combining all-cause mortality with selected non-fatal events is useful because event-free survival, an important criterion in therapy evaluation, is addressed in this manner. In many clinical trials, symptoms, signs or paraclinical measures (for example, blood pressure, exercise duration, quality of life scores) are used as endpoints. If the patient died before the endpoint was measured, or it was otherwise not possible to perform follow-up assessments as planned, the effect of treatment on these endpoints may be distorted if the patients concerned are ignored in the analysis. Examples are given of how distortion can be avoided by including all patients randomized in an analysis that uses a ranked combined endpoint based both on clinical events and on paraclinical measures. A distinction is made between a pseudo intention-to-treat analysis that disregards study medication status at the time of endpoint assessment but is confined to patients with data, and a true intention-to-treat analysis that takes into account all patients randomized based on a ranked combined endpoint.", 
    "429": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, an international randomized trial, was designed to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril and vitamin E in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The study did not detect any cardiovascular benefit or harm using vitamin E. Results for the vitamin E arm are not discussed here. Of 9541 patients, 3577 with diabetes received either ramipril (10 mg) or placebo. Among these patients, ramipril use was associated with a significant 25% reduction in risk for the composite endpoint of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or cardiovascular death after a median follow-up period of 4.5 years. This benefit was independent of any blood pressure-lowering effect. The Microalbuminuria, Cardiovascular, and Renal Outcomes in HOPE (MICRO-HOPE) substudy in this patient population showed that ramipril treatment was associated with a decreased risk of development of overt nephropathy. Use of a composite measure of microvascular complications also suggested a protective effect of ramipril treatment. An interesting finding in the HOPE study is that ramipril treatment was associated with a significant 34% reduction in new diagnoses of diabetes. The possibility that ACE inhibitor treatment with ramipril may prevent new diabetes in non-diabetic patients at high risk of the disease is to be examined prospectively in the Diabetes Reduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone (DREAM) trial.", 
    "430": "In addition to the absolute magnitude of left ventricular (LV) mass (LVM), the geometric pattern of the left ventricle might help explain the different tendency toward LV hypertrophy (LVH) regression seen under effective therapy in chronic hemodialysis patients.", 
    "431": "Forty-five hemodialyzed uremic subjects, 17 patients with concentric LVH and 28 patients with eccentric LVH, were followed up with yearly echocardiography over 3 years while on monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Predialysis blood pressure (BP) and percentage of interdialytic weight gain recorded during the month the echocardiographic study was performed were retrieved and averaged. Any adverse cardiovascular events occurring during the 3-year follow-up period also were recorded.", 
    "432": "Significant regression of LVH (P = 0.0028) was observed in the group as a whole during the 3 years on ACE-inhibitor therapy, mainly accounted for by a reduction in pulse pressure (PP; r = 0.45; P = 0.0017). After subgrouping patients according to LV geometry, an LVM reduction was observed only in the 17 patients with concentric LVH (P = 0.0003), whereas no difference was detected in subjects with eccentric LVH despite the same degree of BP reduction and hemoglobin level and Kt/V increases in both groups. Moreover, a greater incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in patients with eccentric LVH than in those with concentric LVH during the 3-year follow-up period.", 
    "433": "The most important finding of this study is that eccentric LVH seems to be less responsive to ACE-inhibitor treatment and is associated with a greater incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared with concentric LVH. Furthermore, the decrease in PP appears to be the main predictor of LVH regression in chronic hemodialysis patients on ACE-inhibitor therapy.", 
    "434": "The bioequivalence study of 5-mg enalapril tablets, Enaril (Biolab, Thailand) compared to Renitec (Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA) was conducted in 14 healthy Thai male volunteers following a single dose, two-period, crossover design. Each subject received 4 tablets of 5-mg enalapril tablets of both formulations with a 1-week washout period. Plasma samples collected over a 24-hour period after administration were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by using non-compartmental analysis. Regarding bioequivalence testing, the 90 per cent confidence intervals of Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) ratios (Enaril/Renitec) of enalapril were 86.3-126.1 per cent and 93.0-118.5 per cent and those of enalaprilat were 86.4-124.1 per cent and 90.3-116.8 per cent. Based on the European bioequivalence guideline, the 90 per cent confidence interval of Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) ratios of both parent and metabolite forms were within acceptable ranges of 70-143 per cent and 80-125 per cent, respectively. It was concluded that Enaril 5 mg tablet was bioequivalent to Renitec 5 mg tablet.", 
    "435": "This study was aimed at the estimation of influence of enalapril and captopril on emotional processes in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive subjects evaluated before introducing drug treatment and normotensive persons comprised the control groups. All groups were examined with the psychological methods (BDI, HSC, Raven's Matric test). In BDI, there were no significant differences between the groups in the total score and particular factors as well. In HSC, there were significant differences in the total ratings between untreated hypertensive subjects and the normotensive group (p < 0.05). The depression/anxiety profile was the main contributing factor being itself significantly different (p < 0.05) in those groups. Enalapril and captopril reversed the negative behavioural changes caused by hypertension only moderately with no statistical significance. There were no alterations in intellectual abilities tested by the Raven's Matric test in any group examined. In conclusion, significant negative emotional effects of high blood pressure are only partly reversed by the antihypertensive doses of enalapril and captopril.", 
    "436": "The long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril on retinal and choroidal circulation in rats with spontaneous diabetes type 2 were assessed by corrosion casts, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy. One group of 20 male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats was treated with 10 mg/kg/day of cilazapril from 4 to 64 weeks of age, and 20 other OLETF rats received no treatment. A third group, 20 male Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, served as age-matched controls. At regular intervals, the rats were weighed, and their blood glucose was measured. Before the experiment, their systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol level were determined. At 64 weeks of age, the OLETF rats weighed significantly less than the cilazapril-treated OLETF and the LETO rats (p < 0.0001). At the same age, 100% of the untreated OLETF rats had bilateral cataracts, while the lens was clear and no fundus abnormality was detected in the cilazapril-treated OLETF rats and the LETO rats. Cilazapril lowered systolic blood pressure to a nearly normal level, significantly prevented the increase in blood sugar and inhibited the increase in serum cholesterol in the OLETF rats throughout the treatment. In the 64-week-old OLETF rats without treatment, corrosion cast and SEM revealed diabetic retinal and choroidal vascular changes: tortuosity of the vessels, variations in caliber, narrowing of arteries, arterio-arteriolar anastomoses and hairpin loop formation in precapillary arterioles, sparse collecting venules in the choroid and marked capillary changes such as caliber irregularity, narrowing, tortuosity, loop formation and decreased capillaries, outpouching and microaneurysms. In the cilazapril-treated OLETF rats, these changes were markedly decreased to the level seen in the LETO rats, in which the retinal and choroidal blood vessels had a definite and fairly constant pattern and the capillaries were more regularly and densely arranged and had a remarkably uniform caliber. Our results show that the long-term administration of cilazapril before or from the initial onset significantly prevented the increase in blood sugar and inhibited the increases in serum cholesterol in OLETF rats throughout the treatment, lowered systolic arterial pressure to a nearly normal level and prevented diabetic ocular complications. The effects of cilazapril on the diabetic retinal and choroidal vasculature are described for the first time. SEM of corrosion casts is a valuable and easy technique for showing precisely and three-dimensionally the effects of some drugs on the vasculature.",

The IC50 values of each tripeptide. namely Leu-Gly-Pro, Gly- Leu-Pro, Gly-Pro-Leu, Pro-Leu-Gly, Leu-Pro-Gly, and Pro-Gly-Leu. were 0.72, 1.62, 2.65, 4.74, 5.73, and 13.93 microM, respectively. The ACE inhibitory activity of these tripeptides was higher than that of dipeptides, such as Gly- Pro and Pro-Leu with IC50 values of 252.6 and 337.3 microM, respectively. Among the tripeptides, Leu-Gly-Pro and Gly- Leu-Pro had higher inhibitory activity than Gly-Pro-Leu that was isolated from the Alaskan pollack skin gelatin hydrolysate. Among the different types of tripeptides that were examined, the highest ACE inhibitory activity was observed for Leu-Gly-Pro. It had the leucine residue at the N-terminal and proline residue at the C-terminal.",

However, it is controversial whether the long-term vascular effects of l-NAME are mediated primarily by inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis. We addressed this point in mice that are deficient in the endothelial NO synthase gene (eNOS-KO mice).", 
    "443": "Wild-type and eNOS-KO mice received l-NAME in drinking water for 8 weeks. In wild-type mice, long-term treatment with l-NAME caused significant medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis in coronary microvessels but not in large coronary arteries. Importantly, in eNOS-KO mice, treatment with l-NAME also caused an extent of medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis in coronary microvessels that was comparable to that in wild-type mice and that was not prevented by supplementation of L-arginine. Vascular NO and cGMP levels were not significantly reduced by l-NAME treatment, and no expression of inducible or neuronal NO synthase was noted in microvessels of eNOS-KO mice, suggesting an involvement of NO-independent mechanisms. Treatment with l-NAME caused an upregulation of vascular ACE and an increase in cardiac lucigenin chemiluminescence that were comparable in both strains and that were abolished by simultaneous treatment with temocapril (ACE inhibitor) or CS866 (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist) along with the suppression of vascular lesion formation.", 
    "444": "These results provide the first direct evidence that the long-term vascular effects of l-NAME are not mediated by simple inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis. Direct upregulation of local ACE and increased oxidative stress appear to be involved in the long-term vascular effects of l-NAME in vivo.", 
    "445": "Evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors can be advantageous for prevention and halting progression of both micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. ACE inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; however, ACE inhibitor therapy often needs to be supplemented with calcium channel antagonists, beta-blockers or diuretics to achieve good blood pressure control. ACE inhibitors are also indicated in non-hypertensive patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who have micro- or macroalbuminuria. The effect of ACE inhibitors in halting the development and progression of retinopathy and, potentially, neuropathy needs further proof in large-scale studies. More recently, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are emerging as drugs with the potential to be successfully included in the management of diabetic complications, especially when ACE inhibitors are not suitable because of adverse effects.",

The LIFE demonstrated clear superiority of losartan-based therapy over atenolol-based therapy for the treatment of hypertension. It was published the same week in the Lancet and received major press coverage all over the world. The OVERTURE (Omapatrilat Versus Enalapril Randomized Trial of Utility in Reducing Events) study in contrast received a subdued reception, very little publicity and is yet to be published. 5770 NYHA class II-IV heart failure patients (LVEF<or=30%, recent heart failure hospital admission) were randomised and uptitrated to either 10 mg BD of Enalapril or 40 mg once a day Omapatrilat. The primary end-point of all cause mortality or heart failure related hospitalisation did not differ significantly: 914/2884 for Enalapril and 914/2886 for Omapatrilat (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.86-1.03, P=0.187). Mortality was also similar: 509 for Enalapril and 477 for Omapatrilat (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.83-1.07, P=0.339). Omapatrilat was as good as Enalapril but not better. The worrying trend was however, that angioedema was more common with Omapatrilat; 24 (0.8%) versus 14 cases (0.5%). The OCTAVE (Omapatrilat Cardiovascular Treatment Assessment Versus Enalapril) study was also presented at this time. 25,267 hypertensives were randomised to Omapatrilat or enalapril and a difference of approximately 3 mmHg in favour of Omapatrilat was seen. Significantly more cases of angioedema were seen with Omapatrilat, 274 (2.17%) compared to 86 (0.68%) with enalapril. Overall death rates were similar, 0.18% for enalapril and 0.15% for Omapatrilat. All adverse events were similar, 51.0% for Omapatrilat and 50.4% for enalapril. The rates of angioedema were much higher in blacks, 5.54% for Ompatrilat and 1.62% for enalapril and for smokers, 3.93% for Omapatrilat and 0.81% for enalapril. We were left with a drug that was, for heart failure, not superior to an ACE inhibitor already off patent, and, as an anti-hypertensive, with an angioedema rate more than double that of an ACE inhibitor in a large head to head comparison. The medical community will be watching to make sure these data are published in full in the medical literature in a timely fashion, in the order of end-points specified in the protocol and with appropriate emphasis on the logical points of presentation.",

In the last decade, several clinical trials have shown that RAS inhibitors also offer significant renoprotection in both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy. However, patients with advanced renal insufficiency did not take part in these trials because of the risk of acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperkalemia, and, for the same reason, most physicians do not offer these drugs to patients with impaired renal function. Recently, a post-hoc analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study which included patients with severe renal insufficiency, showed that RAS inhibition slows glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline over time and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a safe way in patients quite close to ESRD (basal GFR, 10 to 30 ml/min/1.73m2). These beneficial effects have also been shown in the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the All Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical proteinuria, and renal insufficiency, where RAS inhibition therapy significantly reduced the risk of ESRD once doubling of baseline serum creatinine levels had been achieved as compared to non-RAS anti-hypertensive treatment.

Despite some limitations, because it is of an open-label design with a small number of patients, our study found significant differences in clinical and objective parameters in heart failure patients switched from enalapril to perindopril. The prognostic significance of these findings remains to be investigated.",

    "472": "Adult rats received lisinopril, captopril, enalaprilat, or saline solution, intraperitoneally, for 5 days before 70% partial hepatectomy, and daily after surgery. They received also losartan and bradykinin. Rats were sacrificed at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 120 hours after hepatectomy. Liver regeneration was evaluated in terms of the restoration of liver weight in proportion to body weight, liver DNA content and immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen.", 
    "473": "The proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index was higher in the lisinopril-treated group than in the control group at all time points after hepatectomy, except 120 hours. The remnant liver dry weight was higher in lisinopril-treated rats than in control rats at early time points after surgery. The liver DNA content was higher in three angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated groups than in the control group at 36 hours after hepatectomy. The bradykinin-induced regenerative response was similar to the lisinopril-induced response, and losartan induced a lower hepatocyte labeling index in comparison to the control group at 36 hours after hepatectomy.",

    "475": "The implication of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and of diabetic and uremic complications has stimulated a search for AGE inhibitors. This study evaluates the AGE inhibitory potential of several well-tolerated hypotensive drugs. Olmesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AIIR) antagonist, as well as temocaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, unlike nifedipine, a calcium blocker, inhibit in vitro the formation of two AGE, pentosidine and N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML), during incubation of nonuremic diabetic, nondiabetic uremic, or diabetic uremic plasma or of BSA fortified with arabinose. This effect is shared by all tested AIIR antagonists and ACE inhibitors. On an equimolar basis, they are more efficient than aminoguanidine or pyridoxamine. Unlike the latter two compounds, they do not trap reactive carbonyl precursors for AGE, but impact on the production of reactive carbonyl precursors for AGE by chelating transition metals and inhibiting various oxidative steps, including carbon-centered and hydroxyl radicals, at both the pre- and post-Amadori steps. Their effect is paralleled by a lowered production of reactive carbonyl precursors. Finally, they do not bind pyridoxal, unlike aminoguanidine. Altogether, this study demonstrates for the first time that widely used hypotensive agents, AIIR antagonists and ACE inhibitors, significantly attenuate AGE production. This study provides a new framework for the assessment of families of AGE-lowering compounds according to their mechanisms of action.", 
    "476": "The in vivo inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) were monitored simultaneously by sequentially measuring the urinary excretion of N-Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro and of the atrial natriuretic factor to compare the magnitude and the duration of action of a vasopeptidase inhibitor, omapatrilat, and an ACE inhibitor, fosinopril. Single oral doses of 40 or 80 mg of omapatrilat or 20 mg of fosinopril were administered to 24 normotensive, sodium-depleted or -replete volunteers in a placebo-controlled crossover study. ACE inhibition persisted longer after treatment with omapatrilat than with fosinopril, and there was no major difference between the effects of 40 and 80 mg of omapatrilat. The duration of NEP inhibition by omapatrilat was shorter than that of ACE inhibition. Although omapatrilat effectively inhibited NEP, it had a mild and transient natriuretic effect and did not increase natriuresis more than fosinopril. Omapatrilat induced a decrease in BP and an increase in plasma renin more rapidly and more effectively than fosinopril. The BP and renin effects of omapatrilat persisted despite high sodium intake, which neutralized the effects of fosinopril. The simultaneous inhibition of ACE and NEP may be more effective in reducing BP than the inhibition of ACE alone and less dependent on sodium balance.", 
    "477": "On the basis of recent evidence that the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene promoter contains functional binding sites for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and that COX-2 is expressed in a regulated fashion in the kidney, this study aimed to assess the effect of immunosuppressants on COX-2 expression in the kidney. Therefore, Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with cyclosporine A (CsA; 15 mg/kg per day) or tacrolimus (5 mg/kg per day) for 7 d each. Both drugs markedly lowered COX-2 expression while COX-1 expression remained unaltered. Furthermore, CsA blunted the increase of renocortical COX-2 expression in response to low salt intake or a combination of low-salt diet with the ACE inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg per day), which strongly stimulates renocortical COX-2 expression. At the same time, calcineurin inhibitors moderately enhanced basal as well as stimulated renin secretion and renin gene expression. These findings suggest that inhibition of calcineurin could be a crucial determinant for the regulated expression of COX-2 in the kidney. Inhibition of COX-2 expression may therefore at least in part account for the well-known adverse effects of immunosuppressants in the kidney. Moreover, our data suggest that the stimulation of the renin system by low salt and by ACE inhibitors is not essentially mediated by COX-2 activity.", 
    "478": "The activation of the different neurohumoral system plays an important role in the different mechanisms of the development and progression of arterial hypertension and chronic heart failure. The renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system is one of the key players in this process. With the use of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, less attention has been paid to aldosterone. Aldosterone has been only considered as a humoral factor playing a role in salt and water homeostasis and as a consequence controlling arterial blood pressure. There is now evidence of vascular synthesis of aldosterone besides the secretion at the adrenal cortex as well that aldosterone is involved in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in arterial hypertension, decreased arterial elasticity of the large arteries in chronic heart failure and is inversely correlated with venous capacitance in chronic heart failure. Moreover aldosterone plays a role in the disturbances of the vascular matrix, endothelial dysfunction as well as baroreflex dysfunction. This work has contributed indirectly in the unraveling of the mechanisms which could be partly explained the results of the RALES-trial. The new research project will be focused on the study of the cross-talk between the autonomic nervous system and aldosterone in normotension, arterial hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "479": "The effects of quercetin on substance P-induced plasma protein extravasation (PE) in the rat dura mater, cerebellum, olfactory bulb and cortex and also its modulation by endopeptidases, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) were studied. PE was assessed by photometric measurement of extravasated Evans blue. Substance P (SP) and NEP or ACE inhibitors increased the PE in dura mater. Pretreatment with captopril or phosphoramidon potentiated PE induced by SP in the dura mater and cerebellum, respectively. Quercetin increased the PE in the dura mater, cerebellum and cortex. Further results suggested that the PE induced by SP in the dura mater was enhanced by pretreatment with quercetin, similar to that observed with selective peptidase inhibitors. Quercetin-stimulated extravasation in all tissues was abolished by NK-1 receptor blockade. These results suggest that quercetin increases PE in the dura mater and CNS tissues by inhibiting NEP and/or ACE, showing that the effect induced in the dura mater, cerebellum and cortex occurs through endogenous SP accumulation.", 
    "480": "This study was designed to determine whether inhibition of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) reduces infarct size and enhances protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning (PC) by elevation of the tissue bradykinin (BK) level in the heart in situ. In experiments to determine a dose of thiorphan (Thio) that inhibits NEP activity in the rabbit, infusion of Thio at a rate of 15 micro g/kg per min was found to be NEP-selective, since it increased the extent and duration of hypotension after BK injection (50 ng/kg and 100 ng/kg, i.v.) but did not inhibit pressor response to angiotensin I (100 ng/kg and 500 ng/kg, i.v.). Infusion of Thio at a rate of 25 micro g/kg per min blunted pressor response to angiotensin I by 30%, suggesting this dose partially inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. In the second series of experiments, myocardial infarction was induced by 30-min coronary occlusion and 3-h reperfusion in rabbits. In untreated controls, infarct size as a percentage of area at risk (%IS/AR) was 50.1+/-4.1%, and infusion of Thio at 15 micro g/kg per min and 25 micro g/kg per min failed to limit infarct size (54.3+/-4.0% and 50.1+/-2.8%, respectively). However, these doses of Thio significantly reduced %IS/AR when combined with PC with 2-min ischemia to 25.7+/-3.3% and 19.7+/-3.1%, respectively, although this submaximal PC protocol alone did not achieve significant cardioprotection (%IS/AR=35.6+/-4.0%). This effect of Thio on PC was abolished by pretreatment with icatibant (2 micro g/kg), a BK B(2) receptor blocker. The results of the present study suggest that NEP inhibition does not increase anti-infarct tolerance of the myocardium but significantly enhances cardioprotection of PC via a B(2) receptor-mediated mechanism.", 
    "481": "The incidence of cardiovascular diseases among diabetic patients is so high that diabetes mellitus is currently defined as a cardiovascular disease equivalent. Furthermore, diabetic patients who develop acute coronary syndromes have a poorer short-term and long-term prognosis, so primary and secondary preventive measures are critically important in this population subgroup. There is substantial evidence that pharmacological therapy for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention is more effective in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. This article reviews the evidence of the efficacy of pharmacological prevention therapies in diabetic patients in favor of an aggressive pharmacological preventive strategy. Every diabetic patient without known cardiovascular disease should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. High-risk patients should also receive low-dose aspirin.Compared with non-diabetics, diabetic patients who develop acute coronary events benefit more from the addition of intensive antithrombotic therapy to aspirin treatment. Diabetic patients presenting with non-ST segment elevation syndromes have better outcomes when treated with clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and diabetics presenting with ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block have a greater survival benefit when given thrombolytic therapy compared with non-diabetic patients.Unless formal contraindications are present, diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease, particularly those with previous myocardial infarction, should always be treated with aspirin, betablockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins, regardless of lipid levels, left ventricular systolic function or the presence of congestive heart failure.", 
    "482": "Leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase is a bifunctional zinc enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of LTB4, a potent chemoattractant and immune modulating lipid mediator. Here, we report a high-resolution crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with captopril, a classical inhibitor of the zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme. Captopril makes few interactions with the protein, but its free thiol group is bound to the zinc, apparently accounting for most of its inhibitory action on LTA4 hydrolase. In addition, we have determined the structures of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with two selective tight-binding inhibitors, a thioamine and a hydroxamic acid. Their common benzyloxyphenyl tail, designed to mimic the carbon backbone of LTA4, binds into a narrow hydrophobic cavity in the protein. The free hydroxyl group of the hydroxamic acid makes a suboptimal, monodentate complex with the zinc, and strategies for improved inhibitor design can be deduced from the structure. Taken together, the three crystal structures provide the molecular basis for the divergent pharmacological profiles of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors. Moreover, they help define the binding pocket for the fatty acid-derived epoxide LTA4 as well as the subsites for a tripeptide substrate, which in turn have important implications for the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyses.", 
    "483": "There are rare cases in which inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme can cause an angioneurotic edema of the upper aerodigestive tract. The pathomechanism of this side effect depends on an interaction of the drug with hormones regulating vascular permeability, such as the kallikrein kinin system and the prostaglandin system. Angioedema is characterized by subcutaneous or submucosal swellings, which usually affect the lips, soft palate, tongue and larynx. Pathomechanisms, differential diagnosis and treatment of ACE-inhibitor-induced edema of the upper aerodigestive tract are described in three case reports.", 
    "484": "Angioedema (AE) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of therapy with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the main bradykinin (BK)- inactivating metallopeptidase in humans. The pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor (ACEi)- associated AE (AE+) is presently unknown, although there is increasing evidence of a kinin role. We analyzed the metabolism of endogenous BK (B(2) receptor agonist) and its active metabolite, des-Arg(9)-BK (B(1) receptor agonist), in the presence of an ACEi during in vitro contact activation of plasma from hypertensive patients (n = 39) who presented AE+. Kinetic parameters were compared with those measured in a control group (AE-) of hypertensive patients (n = 39) who never manifested any acute or chronic side effects while treated with an ACEi. The different kinetic parameters were analyzed using a mathematical model (y = k t(alpha) e(-beta t)) previously applied to a normal, healthy population. The slope of BK degradation, but not its formation from high-molecular-weight kininogen, was lower in AE+ patients when compared with the AE- controls. des-Arg(9)-BK accumulation during the kinetic measurements was significantly higher in AE+ plasma. This accumulation of the B(1) agonist in AE+ patients paralleled its half-life of degradation. In conclusion, our results show, for the first time, that an abnormality of endogenous des-Arg(9)-BK degradation exists in the plasma of patients with ACEi-associated AE, suggesting that its pathogenetic mechanism lies in the catabolic site of kinin metabolism.", 
    "485": "Arterial compliance is determined by structural factors, such as collagen and elastin, and functional factors, such as vasoactive neurohormones. To determine whether angiotensin II contributes to decreased arterial compliance in patients with heart failure, this study tested the hypothesis that administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improves arterial compliance. Arterial compliance and stiffness were determined by measuring carotid artery diameter, using high-resolution duplex ultrasonography, and blood pressure in 23 patients with heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Measurements were made before and after intravenous administration of enalaprilat (1 mg) or vehicle. Arterial compliance was inversely related to both baseline plasma angiotensin II (r = -0.52; P = 0.015) and angiotensin-converting enzyme concentrations (r = -0.45; P = 0.041). During isobaric conditions, enalaprilat increased carotid artery compliance from 3.0 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.4 x 10(-10) N(-1). m(4) (P = 0.001) and decreased the carotid artery stiffness index from 17.5 +/- 1.8 to 10.1 +/- 0.6 units (P = 0.001), whereas the vehicle had no effect. Thus angiotensin II is associated with reduced carotid arterial compliance in patients with congestive heart failure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves arterial elastic properties. This favorable effect on the pulsatile component of afterload may contribute to the improvement in left ventricular performance that occurs in patients with heart failure treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "486": "We analyzed spinal metabolic pathway of nociceptin/orphanin FQ related to pain-transmission or modulation in the both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Nociceptin was degraded by spinal synaptic membranes. Major metabolites of nociceptin were free phenylalanine, nociceptin (1-13) and nociceptin (14-17). Both the degradation of nociceptin and the accumulation of the major cleavage metabolites, nociceptin (1-13) and nociceptin (14-17), were strongly inhibited by a metal chelator and also by specific inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11, thiorphan and phosphoramidon. Furthermore, purified endopeptidase-24.11 hydrolyzed nociceptin at the cleavage site (Lys(13)-Leu(14) bond) identical to that by spinal synaptic membranes. Recently, we have found that nociceptin, injected intrathecally at small doses (fmol order) elicits a behavioral response consisting of scratching, biting and licking in mice. In the present study, we have examined the effect of peptidase inhibitors on the behavioral response elicited by intrathecal injection of nociceptin in mice. Phosphoramidon simultaneously injected with nociceptin additively enhanced nociceptin-induced behavioral response, whereas the nociceptin-induced behavioral response was unaffected by either bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor or captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, the nociceptin effect was potentiated by combined injection of phosphoramidon and bestatin, indicating that inhibition of aminopeptidase may also contribute to inducing the behavioral response to nociceptin. These data suggest that endopeptidase-24.11 plays a major role in initial stage of nociceptin metabolism at the spinal cord level in mice.", 
    "487": "Omapatrilat, a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP).

    "489": "Omapatrilat induced a sustained lowering of systolic blood pressure (-68 mm Hg) without changes in cardiac rate. The mild positive water balance produced by omapatrilat did not cause natriuresis or kaliuresis, although it was associated with a significant decrease in urine osmolality. Blood pressure normalization was accompanied by increases in plasma Ang I (2969%), Ang II (57%), and Ang-(1-7) (163%) levels, paralleling pronounced increases in urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1-7) but not Ang II. Detection of Ang-(1-7) immunostaining in the kidneys of five other SHR exposed either to vehicle (N = 3) or omapatrilat (N = 2) ascertained the source of the Ang-(1-7) found in the urine. Intense Ang-(1-7) staining, more pronounced in omapatrilat-treated SHR, was found in renal proximal tubules throughout the outer and inner regions of the renal cortex and the thick ascending loop of Henle, whereas no Ang-(1-7)-positive immunostaining was found in glomeruli and distal tubules.", 
    "490": "Omapatrilat antihypertensive effects caused significant activation of the renin-angiotensin system associated with increases in urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1-7). Combined studies of Ang-(1-7) metabolism in urine and immunohistochemical studies in the kidney revealed the existence of an intrarenal source, which may account for the pronounced increase in the excretion rate of the vasodilator heptapeptide. These findings provide further evidence for a contribution of Ang-(1-7) to the regulation of renal function and blood pressure.",

Besides a metabolic component, insulin resistance has also an haemodynamic component, especially in relation with an endothelial dysfunction. Some studies suggested that inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme can improve insulin sensitivity. Interestingly enough, three clinical trials recently reported concordant results showing that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system significantly reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in patients at high risk of vascular complications, essentially with hypertension: the CAPPP trial with captopril (-14%, p = 0.39), the HOPE study with ramipril (-34%, p < 0.001) and the LIFE study with losartan (-25%, p < 0.001).

Indomethacin, NS-398 (a cyclooxygenase [COX]-2 inhibitor), and SQ-29548 (a thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist) acutely restored EDRs in aged rats, suggesting an involvement of COX-2-derived vasoconstricting eicosanoids. Tiron, a superoxide scavenger, also partially improved EDRs, suggesting an involvement of superoxide. EDRs were significantly ameliorated in aged rats after long-term treatment with temocapril or CS-866 but not after treatment with cerivastatin or hydralazine. Indomethacin induced no further improvement of EDRs after treatment with temocapril or CS-866.

    "509": "Elderly patients with heart failure are at risk of postprandial hypotension (PPH), orthostatic hypotension (OH), and concomitant cerebral oxygenation changes because of altered cardiovascular balance and the use of cardiovascular medications, such as furosemide and captopril. In 24 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to III, in stable condition, and receiving cardiovascular medication [aged 70 to 83 years]), blood pressure (BP) was measured by Finapres, and cortical concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy during standing and after a 292-kcal carbohydrate meal. Tests were performed before and during therapy with furosemide 40 mg once daily (n = 11) or captopril 6.25 and 12.5 mg twice daily (n = 13) in a double-blind randomized trial. Before treatment, 13 of 24 patients had PPH, and 2 of 24 patients had OH. The first dose of furosemide significantly decreased postprandial systolic BP (p <0.05) and postprandial frontal cortical oxygenation (p <0.05), whereas the first dose of captopril did not. Furosemide and captopril did not significantly affect postprandial or orthostatic BP or cortical oxygenation after 2 weeks of treatment. Thus, PPH is a common phenomenon in elderly patients with heart failure, whereas OH is not. The first dose of furosemide 40 mg decreased postprandial systolic BP and frontal cortical oxygenation, in contrast with the first dose of captopril 6.25 mg and 2-week treatment with furosemide 40 mg once daily or captopril 12.5 mg twice daily. These findings indicate that initiating furosemide treatment worsens PPH, and furosemide is less safe in elderly patients with heart failure.",

During this protocol for up to 24 h after the intake, patient/subject blood pressure (BP) was measured for a 15 min period at designated times (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h) with the individual supine. Based on the VY determination, the maximal increment of plasma VY level was observed over the second hour postprandially (12 mg-dose; 2041+/-148 fmol/ml-plasma). In addition, the plasma VY level increased with the VY dosage. However, no marked BP change was observed with the increase of plasma VY level, suggesting that VY did not exert an acute hypotensive effect. The area under the curve at 12 mg-dose was estimated to be 8644+/-420 fmol x h/ml-plasma, comparable to that in normotensive subjects. This finding suggests that absorption of VY would not be influenced by a complaint of hypertension.",

ACE-inhibitors have become the mainstay of heart failure therapy. In addition, beta blocker evolved to be effective in improving survival in this disease. Recently, the COPERNICUS study established the efficacy of carvedilol in severe heart failure and extended the benefits of this drug first observed in patients with mild and moderate symptoms to those with advanced disease. In this study, carvedilol resulted in a significant reduction of all-cause mortality and combined mortality and hospitalization, the frequency of hospitalizations, the risk of repeated hospitalizations, the number of days in hospital, the average duration of each admission and the utilization of treatments and procedures for heart failure. Carvedilol was well tolerated, improved the sense of well-being, was associated with a lower risk of a serious adverse event, particularly one related to the progression of heart failure and fewer patients requiring withdrawal of treatment for an adverse event. These favourable results were equally seen in all subgroups. Carvedilol treatment was even cost-effective in severe disease. Therefore, this new therapeutic option should be available to all patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure.",

Despite this evidence, the use of beta blockers in the post-MI setting is far from uniform and now lags considerably behind the routine use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in this clinical setting. Given the major advances in the management of myocardial infarction and its sequelae that have occurred in the last two decades (including the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA], thrombolysis, aspirin, ACEIs, and statins), there was clearly a need to revisit the issue of beta blocker therapy in patients with beta blockers in the setting of post-MI heart failure. For all these reasons, the CAPRICORN trial of carvedilol in post-MI left ventricular dysfunction was an important and eagerly awaited trial, which could show that carvedilol treatment post-MI on top of the so-called modern post-MI therapy reduces mortality. Further studies have to show whether this results can be repeated with other beta blockers.",

The present report describes a case of acute renal graft dysfunction following the addition of an ARB to existing ACE inhibition. This unmasked an unknown iliac artery stenosis. The case indicates a possible important role of Ang II generated by non-ACE pathways in this situation.", 
    "518": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of drugs that have dual inhibitory effects on two key enzymes involved in the metabolism of vasoactive peptides. Essentially, they inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), thereby blocking the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II); at the same time they prevent the breakdown of natriuretic peptides by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase. The combination of reduction of Ang II on a background of increased natriuretic peptide activity has several potential advantages for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disease and in particular, hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Several vasopeptidase inhibitors, such as sampatrilat, fasidotril, gemopatrilat and omapatrilat (Vanlev, the most clinically developed vasopeptidase inhibitor to date) are under intensive clinical investigation. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated effective antihypertensive activity in hypertension, independent of age, renin and salt status or ethnic origin, and have also highlighted the potential for vasopeptidase inhibition as a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of CHF. Moreover, ongoing research suggests that this new class of drugs may be an important approach, not only for the treatment of hypertension and of conditions associated with overt volume overload but also for ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "519": "Effective reduction in blood pressure (BP) improves survival and morbidity in hypertensive patients. Combination therapy with multiple antihypertensive agents is frequently required in clinical practice and therapeutic trials to achieve target BP. Patients at elevated cardiovascular risk achieve the greatest benefit from equivalent reduction in BP and also require more stringent BP control. In patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus or renal disease, BP control is of primary importance and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) should be the initial therapeutic intervention. Choice of combination therapy has been insufficiently studied in major clinical cardiovascular endpoint trials. Diuretic therapy remains the logical addition to RAS blockade. Despite previous debate, the available evidence suggests long-acting calcium-channel blockers are also a safe and very effective addition to improve BP control further. The choice of antihypertensive combination therapy should not override the fundamental necessity of lowering BP to target levels.", 
    "520": "The rationale for using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in combination with thiazide diuretic therapy has centred formerly around antihypertensive synergy and counter-balancing adverse metabolic effects, particularly on potassium homeostasis. However, two recent landmark clinical trials that included high-risk hypertensive patients have now provided an evidence base for this form of combination therapy by demonstrating the efficacy of perindopril/indapamide and losartan/ hydrochlorothiazide in reducing vascular morbidity and mortality, a proportion of the benefit being unaccounted for by blood pressure reduction alone. Several unresolved issues remain concerning class effects versus specific drug effects, optimal dosing, potential differences in efficacy between ACE-I and ARBs, whether elderly mild hypertensives benefit from this form of combination therapy, and the possibility that the optimal regimen may be a triple combination of ACE-I, ARB and thiazide diuretic. These issues will be resolved by ongoing and future major endpoint trials in hypertension.", 
    "521": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for the management of hypertension. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and, more recently, ARBs have an established track record of success in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), proteinuric renal disease and most recently the hypertensive patient with a high cardiac-risk profile. The individual success of each of these drug classes has fuelled speculation that given together the overall effect of both would exceed that of either given alone. This premise, although biologically plausible, has yet to be proven in a convincing enough fashion to support the routine use of these two drug classes in combination. Additional clarifying studies are needed to establish whether specific patient subsets exist that might benefit from such combination therapy.", 
    "522": "We evaluated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on pathways for monocyte production of interleukin (IL)-1beta in vitro. Human monocytes were treated with captopril and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or lipopolysaccharide. Captopril caused a dose-dependent reduction of TNF-alpha induced IL-1beta. LPS-induced IL-1beta generation was not reduced by the ACE inhibitor. Pro-IL-1beta concentrations followed the same pattern as that for mature IL-1beta when monocytes were preincubated with captopril. Also, IL-1beta mRNA concentrations were reduced by captopril pretreatment in parallel with IL-1beta. We sought to determine whether captopril affected the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB complex in monocytic cells. We found that the translocation of the p-65 component of NF-kappaB to the nucleus was inhibited by captopril. Thus captopril reduced TNF-alpha-induced IL-1beta and IL-1betamRNA synthesis in monocytes, in vitro, probably through interference with NF-kappaB activation of the IL-1beta gene. These results support the hypothesis that captopril has immunomodulating properties.", 
    "523": "Acute hypertension inhibits proximal tubule (PT) fluid reabsorption. The resultant increase in end proximal flow rate provides the error signal to mediate tubuloglomerular feedback autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and suppresses renal renin secretion. To test whether the suppression of the renin-angiotensin system during acute hypertension affects the magnitude of the inhibition of PT fluid and sodium reabsorption, plasma ANG II levels were clamped by infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (12 microg/min) and ANG II after pretreatment with the bradykinin B(2) receptor blocker HOE-140 (100 microg/kg bolus). Because ACE also degrades bradykinin, HOE-140 was included to block effect of accumulating vasodilatory bradykinins during captopril infusion. HOE-140 increased the sensitivity of arterial blood pressure to ANG II: after captopril infusion without HOE-140, 20 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) ANG II had no pressor effect, whereas with HOE-140, 20 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) ANG II increased blood pressure from 104 +/- 4 to 140 +/- 6 mmHg. ANG II infused at 2 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) had no pressor effect after captopril and HOE-140 infusion (\"ANG II clamp\"). When blood pressure was acutely increased 50-60 mmHg by arterial constriction without ANG II clamp, urine output and endogenous lithium clearance increased 4.0- and 6.7-fold, respectively. With ANG II clamp, the effects of acute hypertension were reduced 50%: urine output and endogenous lithium clearance increased two- and threefold, respectively. We conclude that HOE-140, an inhibitor of the B(2) receptor, potentiates the sensitivity of arterial pressure to ANG II and that clamping systemic ANG II levels during acute hypertension blunts the magnitude of the pressure diuretic response.", 
    "524": "Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients is possible. Left ventricular hypertrophy represents the major risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality. Therefore, their regression is mandatory. Since the causes of uremia-associated left ventricular hypertrophy are multifactorial, various therapeutic options can be considered: optimal control of arterial hypertension and volume status, optimal correction of metabolic acidosis, best possible correction of hypoalbuminemia and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, modern pharmacotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure (use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers) and total correction of renal anemia. Following the proposed therapeutic strategies we could, by using echocardiography, distinguish in 100 hemodialysis patients the following 3 groups (on the average after 1.5 years): 36 patients with initially normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI (g/m2), F < 110; M < 130) maintained normal (group 1); in 31 patients with moderately increased LVMI full regression resulted (group 2); 33 patients with severely increased LVMI (group 3) had to be further divided into 2 sub-groups: 22 patients with significant improvement of LVMI, 11 patients with no, regression. For the first time we were able to show that it is possible to maintain initially normal LVMI during long-term treatment and to achieve complete regression and significant improvement of LVMI in our patients. However, since LVMI requires a long time to develop, a similarly long time must be estimated for its regression. However, 11 patients remained therapeutically resistant. In this group, severe heart diseases were often combined and highly prevalent, including ischemic heart and valve diseases and end-stage dilatative cardiomyopathy. These patients had to be transferred to cardiac surgery. Anemia is considered to be one of the most important factors for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, total correction of renal anemia has to be strongly recommended in addition to other measures of our therapeutic strategy to maintain full or significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "525": "In all industrial nations the number of patients with heart hailure is increasing. Pharmacological treatment with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization in these patients. Inspite of these therapies, morbidity and mortality remains problematic. Possibly phenomena like the genetic induced Angiotensin-II-escape are responsible for the individual response in patients. Regarding their different pharmacological effects the new group of Angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1) blockers seem to be promising for the treatment of heart failure. In trials like ELITE 1, ELITE 2 and Val-HeFT it could be demonstrated that AT1-blockers and ACE-inhibitors have a comparable effect in improving survival of heart failure patients. In the Val-HeFT study the combination of an ACE-inhibitor and an AT1-blocker reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life of heart failure patients compared with single treatment using an ACE-inhibitor or AT1-blocker. Mortality showed no significant difference. Before a final assessment of the combination treatment with ACE-inhibitors and AT1- blockers in heart failure patients we need more studies like the present CHARM-study.", 
    "526": "The high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) among hemodialysis patients may be a consequence of inadequate diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension (AH). AH is not adaquately controlled in hemodialysis patients probably due to an underestimation of the effective BP load due to the unreliability of clinical BP readings in this population. Furthermore, BP reduction induced by dialysis ultrafiltration is not an acceptable criterion for discontinuing antihypertensive therapy, particularly when LVH coexists. Indeed, the few available interventional studies have demonstrated that strict BP control, together with anemia correction and dialysis adequacy improvement, can induce significant regression of the LVH of hemodialysis patients. Moreover, the decrease of SBP, particularly as a result of ACE-inhibitor therapy, is the most important predictor of LVH regression. Finally the use of ABPM and of echocardiography are recommended for correctly detecting an underlying AH and for tailoring and monitoring the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in dialysis patients with LVH.", 
    "527": "Chronic pharmacotherapy of congestive heart failure deals with its special pathophysiology and acts on different sites of the cardiorenal axis. The standard-therapy consists of diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers and can be supplemented by cardiac glycosides, if heart failure worsens. Cardiac glycosides are also administered if tachycardic arrhythmias occur. Aldosterone-antagonists are combined with standard therapy in NYHA III - IV to counteract cardiac remodelling. AT1-antagonists are indicated when ACE-inhibitors are contraindicated or cannot be administered because of side-effects. Combination with ACE-inhibitors and AT1-antagonists may be of benefit for the patient since morbidity and hospitalization decrease.", 
    "528": "Nephropathy has long been recognized as a potential complication of cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD). There have been few large-scale studies or clinical reports on renal impairment in patients with CCHD; similarly, very few studies have examined the drug treatment of nephropathy in CCHD. We examined the clinical characteristics and effectiveness of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), in patients with CCHD complicated with significant proteinuria.", 
    "529": "The clinical records of 37 patients with CCHD were evaluated; all were older than 10 years of age (median 19, range from 10 to 27) and had regular check-ups, including urinalysis. The treatment criteria for enalapril administration included significant proteinuria (urinary excretion > 1.0 g/24 h), stable cardiac condition and blood pressure within the normal range.", 
    "530": "Eleven patients (29.7%) had persistent proteinuria, 6 patients met the enalapril treatment criteria and 5 patients were treated for more than 12 months. Enalapril apparently reduced the urinary protein excretion in 4 of the 5 patients (80%). No consistent improvement of renal function, as evidenced in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) or filtration fraction (FF) was found in these patients, but neither were any significant adverse effects noted.", 
    "531": "The incidence of nephropathy among patients with CCHD was about 30%, which was consistent with previous studies. It is worth considering the use of ACE-I when nephropathy accompanies CCHD.", 
    "532": "A number of factors are linked to the outcome of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). However, it has been difficult to compare results of studies since patient populations have varied greatly. There were 3 aims in the study reported here, namely to compare factors associated with renal outcome in IgAN patients with different levels of renal function on diagnosis; to determine factors which were independently associated with progression of renal disease in initially mild IgAN; and to create a model for the estimation of the risk of progression in individual IgAN patients with normal renal function on diagnosis.", 
    "533": "Two hundred and fifty-nine IgAN patients who had been followed on average for 9.1 (SD 4.5) after diagnosis were divided into 2 groups on the basis of renal function on diagnosis. In group 1 (98 patients), Ccr (creatinine clearance, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) was < 85 ml/min, in group 2 (161 patients) > or = 85 ml/min. Univariate analyses were used to find significant differences between progressors and non-progressors in both groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors independently associated with progression in group 2.", 
    "534": "Several factors were found to be associated with outcome in both groups, such as hypertension, level of Ccr, serum cholesterol, proteinuria, and also histopathological changes. Factors associated with progression in patients with initially decreased renal function (group 1), were predictable, such as male sex, absence of episodes of macroscopic hematuria, serum urate level and degree of tubular atrophy. Surprisingly, in patients with initially normal renal function (group 2), numbers of urinary erythrocytes were associated with outcome. The factors independently associated with progression in this group were number of urinary erythrocytes, existence of hypertension and in histopathology arteriolosclerosis and the level of glomerular score. A model for estimating risk of progression on the basis of various combinations of factors found to be independently associated with outcome is presented.", 
    "535": "We concluded that association between variable and outcome in IgAN depends partly on renal function at the time of assessment of the factor. Since there are factors which are independently associated with the outcome of early and apparently mild disease, early diagnosis of IgAN is desirable: outcome in mild IgAN can be predicted reliably on the basis of factors found to be independently associated with outcome.", 
    "536": "Quercetin and resveratrol are weak inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. The long term incubation of the cells for 4 days with quercetin, resveratrol and a combination of both substances in concentrations lower than necessary for inhibition of NEP and ACE activity induced the cellular enzyme activity of NEP and ACE associated with an inhibition of cellular proliferation. The long term treatment of neuroblastoma cells with quercetin and resveratrol enhanced the differentiation state of the cells. Taking into account the significance of NEP and ACE for the degradation of amyloid beta peptides, the effect of quercetin and resveratrol as constituents of red wine for a neuroprotective activity is discussed.",

The presence of an inhibitor of the enzyme was proved. Further test results as anti-ds-DNA, anti-Sm, C 3, ESR, CRP were normal. C 4 was slightly decreased. Cerebral MRI, cerebral SPECT and Duplex sonography of the extracranial arteries didn't show any pathologic findings. The performed MRI of the heart revealed signs of myocardial damage.", 
    "539": "As cause of the recent symptoms a thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was diagnosed. This obviously was due to an auto-antibody against the vWF-cleaving protease. After intensive immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone and cyclosporin the clinical and laboratory findings normalised. An acute therapy with fresh frozen plasma and plasmapheresis was not necessary, as the symptoms were moderate. Because of the transient cerebral deficits for a short time we administered a low dose of aspirin. The MRI signs of myocardial affection didn't change after 3 months of immunosuppressive treatment so that we started an ACE inhibitor treatment.",

    "543": "At 302 multinational sites, 5,010 patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification II to IV heart failure taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or beta-blocker (BB) were randomized into valsartan and placebo groups and followed for a mean of 22.4 months. Serial echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LVIDd) and ejection fraction (EF) were recorded. Total study reproducibility calculated to 90% power at 5% significance defined detectable differences of 0.09 cm for LVIDd and 0.86% for EF.", 
    "544": "Baseline LVIDd and EF for valsartan and placebo groups were similar: 3.6 +/- 0.5 versus 3.7 +/- 0.5 (cm/m(2)) and 26.6 +/- 7.3 versus 26.9 +/- 7.0 (%). Mean group changes from baseline over time were compared. Significant decrease in LVIDd and increase in EF began by four months, reached plateau by one year, and persisted to two years in valsartan compared with placebo patients, irrespective of age, gender, race, etiology, NYHA classification, and co-treatment therapy. Changes at 18 months were -0.12 +/- 0.4 versus -0.05 +/- 0.4 (cm/m(2)), p < 0.00001 for LVIDd, and +4.5 +/- 8.9 versus +3.2 +/- 8.6 (%), p < 0.00001 for EF. The exception occurred in patients taking both ACEI and BB as co-treatment, in whom the decrease in LVIDd and increase in EF were no different between valsartan and placebo groups.",

    "546": "The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy to bradykinin-induced tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in patients with heart failure (HF) secondary to ischemic heart disease.", 
    "547": "Bradykinin is a potent endothelial cell stimulant that causes vasodilatation and t-PA release. In large-scale clinical trials, ACE inhibitor therapy prevents ischemic events.", 
    "548": "Nine patients with symptomatic HF were evaluated on two occasions: during and following seven-day withdrawal of long-term ACE inhibitor therapy. Forearm blood flow was measured using bilateral venous occlusion plethysmography. Intrabrachial bradykinin (30 to 300 pmol/min), substance P (2 to 8 pmol/min), and sodium nitroprusside (1 to 4 pmol/min) were infused, and venous blood samples were withdrawn from both forearms for estimation of fibrinolytic variables.", 
    "549": "On both study days, bradykinin and substance P caused dose-dependent vasodilatation and release of t-PA from the infused forearm (p < 0.05 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Long-term ACE inhibitor therapy caused an increase in forearm vasodilatation (p < 0.05 by ANOVA) and t-PA release (p < 0.001 by ANOVA) during bradykinin, but not substance P, infusion. Maximal local plasma t-PA activity concentrations approached 100 IU/ml, and maximal forearm protein release was approximately 4.5 microg/min.",

Local plasma t-PA activity concentrations approached those seen during systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. This may contribute to the primary mechanism of the anti-ischemic effects associated with long-term ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "551": "Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is frequent in renal transplant recipients and may be related to a large variety of glomerular lesions. In some of these cases, the transplant biopsy showed no significant glomerular changes and the NS was reversible, but the primary renal disease was not minimal change disease (MCD), suggesting that MCD may develop de novo in renal transplant setting. Knowledge of this entity, however, is limited. Among 67 cases of post-transplant NS encountered in a 12-yr period, five were found to be associated with de novo MCD. A critical review of the literature revealed nine additional cases of de novo MCD. The data from these 14 cases show that patients with de novo MCD had a large variety of primary renal diseases but MCD or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was not among them. Eight of the 14 transplanted kidneys (60%) were from living related donors, suggesting this as a risk factor. Nephrotic range proteinuria (3-76 g/d) developed immediately or shortly after transplantation (within 4 months for all reported cases, except for one at 24 months). The serum creatinine when NS was first diagnosed was normal or mildly elevated, but acute renal failure occurred in three patients. On biopsy, the glomeruli were normal or, more frequently, displayed mild, focal segmental mesangial sclerosis, hypercellularity, deposition of IgM/C3, or accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells in some glomerular capillaries. The tubulointerstitial compartment was normal in cases with normal renal function; displayed mild acute and/or chronic rejection that correlated with a mildly elevated serum creatinine; or showed acute changes including acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, or acute cyclosporin A toxicity, which accounted for both acute renal failure at presentation and its subsequent reversibility. Under various treatments, including increased steroids, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers, sustained remission of NS was achieved in 13 cases, within a year (0.5-12 months) in 10 and later (24, 34 and 98 months, respectively) in three. In the remaining case, the patient died of septic shock 2 months after transplantation. After remission of the NS, the grafts functioned well without or with minimal proteinuria for several years. De novo MCD has characteristic clinical and pathologic features. It represents an important but hitherto underemphasized cause of post-transplant NS, which is potentially reversible and does not adversely affect the renal transplants.", 
    "552": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, in hypertensive patients, so the present study was designed to examine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is also involved in the mechanism of ADMA elevation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). A crossover study was performed to determine if ACE inhibition with perindopril (4 mg/day) for 4 weeks decreases serum ADMA concentration and plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) level (a marker of endothelial injury) in 11 patients with NIDDM. None of the patients was treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs, and none had major diabetic complications. Before the protocol began, serum ADMA and plasma vWF were significantly higher in the 11 NIDDM patients, when compared with 8 control subjects without diabetes. Perindopril did not affect blood pressure or glucose metabolism, but did significantly decrease serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These results suggest that endothelial injury associated with ADMA elevation may be present even in patients with non-complicated NIDDM, and that increased activity of ACE may be involved in such endothelial dysfunction.",

    "554": "We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 420 patients from 25 primary care practices in upstate New York who had received a diagnosis of heart failure. Chart documentation confirmed the diagnosis (n = 395). We excluded patients with noncardiogenic volume overload or correctable valvular disease (n = 338). Performance profiles measured use of diagnostic tests, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement, patient education, and prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. For treatment recommendations, patients were classified according to LVEF status.", 
    "555": "Only 82% of the patients studied had an LVEF test result documented in their charts. Of these, 49% had an LVEF < or = 40%. ACE inhibitor use was greater among patients with low LVEF (91%) than among those with a normal LVEF (62%). Among patients with systolic heart failure taking ACE inhibitors, 87% were at target doses. Adherence measures were low for laboratory evaluation and patient-education criteria.", 
    "556": "Heart failure with normal LVEF was as prevalent as systolic heart failure in these primary care practices. Performance profiles for the physicians' prescriptions of ACE inhibitors exceeded those published in the literature. Patients who did not have a documented measure of LVEF, however, received lower quality of care as measured by this disease-specific guideline. This underscores the importance of measuring LVEF.", 
    "557": "Exposure of blood to tissue factor (TF) sets off the coagulation cascade. TF is a transmembrane protein that serves as an essential cofactor for activated coagulation factor VII (FVIIa). TF may be exposed locally by vascular injury (such as balloon angioplasty) or by spontaneous rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Expression of TF may also be induced on monocytes and endothelial cells in conditions like sepsis and cancer, causing a more generalised activation of clotting. TF may thus play a central role in thrombosis in a number of settings, and attention has turned to blocking TF as a means to prevent thrombosis. Inhibiting the inducible expression of TF by monocytes can be achieved by 'deactivating' cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, -10 and -13, or by certain prostanoids; by drugs that modify signal transduction, such as pentoxifylline, retinoic acid or vitamin D(3), or by antisense oligonucleotides. Such approaches are for the most part at a preclinical stage. The function of TF can be blocked by antibodies that prevent the binding of FVIIa to TF; by active site-inhibited FVIIa, which competes with native FVIIa for binding; by antibodies or small molecules that block the function of the TF/FVIIa complex; and by molecules, such as TF pathway inhibitor or nematode anticoagulant peptide C2, which inhibit the active site of FVIIa in the TF/FVIIa complex after first binding to activated factor X. The latter two agents have entered Phase II clinical trials. Perhaps most intriguing is the use of anti-TF agents locally, which holds the promise of stopping thrombosis at a specific site of injury without the bleeding risk associated with systemic anticoagulation.",

Here we present data regarding adverse events that were reported in the second pilot J-PEM study where losartan was compared with ACE inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists.", 
    "559": "We conducted a cohort study with a concurrent control. METHODS/PATIENT GROUP: Study subjects prescribed losartan, an ACE inhibitor or a calcium channel antagonist were identified from prescriptions in hospital or community pharmacies. Events and other information were collected from doctors and pharmacists by mailed questionnaires. Events were coded and analysed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Crude event rates were calculated and compared between patients treated with losartan and those receiving control drugs. When the difference was statistically significant, the event was further examined in several ways, including follow-up studies and by comparison with the data of the UK PEM study on losartan.", 
    "560": "Pharmacists were sent 4344 questionnaires and returned 3591 (83%), while doctors were sent 3517 questionnaires and returned 1380 (39%). In the doctors' data, the adverse event rate for losartan treatment was greater than that for ACE inhibitors and/or calcium channel antagonists for the following seven events: headache, palpitations, anaemia, insomnia, feeling abnormal, increased blood pressure and asthma. Most of these are known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of losartan except for two events: increased blood pressure and asthma. In pharmacists' data, the event rate for losartan was significantly greater than that for control drugs for the following ten events: hot flushes, abnormal hepatic function, oedema, peripheral swelling, decreased blood pressure, increased blood pressure, rhinitis, contact dermatitis, dry skin and heat rash. The first five events were known ADRs of losartan but the other five were not. When the two sets of data were combined, the rate of an additional event, increased blood creatinine phosphokinase, which is a known ADR of losartan, was significantly greater than that for the control drugs. The six events that were not documented as ADRs for losartan were not judged to be ADRs based on the results of follow-up studies and comparison with the UK PEM study on losartan. The crude rate of cough with losartan treatment was similar to that with calcium channel antagonists, but was significantly less than that with ACE inhibitors.",

    "562": "Dyslipidaemia and hypertension contribute to an excess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes. A number of landmark primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that lipid-lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), reduce CHD risk in the non-diabetic population. However, many questions remain unanswered about the use of these therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes. To address the most important of these questions, several major trials are under way that will provide more data on the benefits of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy in type 2 diabetes. These include studies of atorvastatin, an established member of the statin class, with over 22 million patient-years' experience and an excellent safety profile. Similarly, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) will determine the efficacy of the CCB, amlodipine, in patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes and hypertension.", 
    "563": "During the past few years, several major intervention trials have been conducted in an attempt to determine the efficacy of specific antihypertensive agents in retarding progression of diabetic nephropathy. These studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of renin-angiotensin system blockade in attenuating progressive renal disease. The preferred initial therapy is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or an angiotensin type I (AT1) receptor antagonist based on the recent 'landmark' proof-of-concept trials--the Irbesartan Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL). However, these clinical trials also demonstrate that aggressive blood pressure targets are needed in patients with diabetes and hypertension. This frequently requires multiple-drug therapy with several different classes of antihypertensive agents. Data from several clinical trials, including RENAAL, suggest that calcium antagonists may be added to ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist therapy as needed to achieve target blood pressure. Calcium antagonists could, therefore, constitute an important component of the antihypertensive regimen in the management of patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "564": "Patients with type 2 diabetes are especially vulnerable to both large and small vessel injury from elevated arterial blood pressure. The frequent combination of hypertension and diabetes is, therefore, associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease. The beneficial therapeutic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and other antihypertensive drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes have been well established in placebo-controlled trials, and there appears to be no evidence of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. In addition, a number of major clinical trials have supported a policy of aggressive blood pressure lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, for example, tight control of blood pressure was demonstrated to produce clinically important reductions in the risk of complications related to type 2 diabetes compared with less tight control. In most hypertensive patients, however, a reduction to a recommended level <130/85 mm Hg is unlikely to be achieved by monotherapy. Consequently, the combination of ACE inhibitors with other first-line drugs, such as CCBs, diuretics and beta-blockers, is recommended for the therapeutic management of hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "565": "Between 120 and 140 million people suffer from diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) worldwide, and this number may well double by the year 2025. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae: coronary, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. Concurrently, the most common cause of death in persons with diabetes is myocardial infarction. The pathogenesis, progression, and epidemiology of atherosclerotic disease are distinct in patients with diabetes. Atherosclerosis can develop much earlier in life, and at an accelerated rate, compared with non-diabetic individuals. One of the factors responsible for increased atherosclerosis is related to the atherogenic lipid profile in diabetes. The pathobiological processes that are responsible for transforming dormant atherosclerotic plaques into active rupture-prone plaques may be enhanced in diabetes as well. It follows that a major challenge in the treatment of patients with diabetes is to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease. The third National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) report recently recommended that the management of dyslipidaemia in patients with diabetes should be as aggressive as in those with established coronary heart disease (CHD). The NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines recommend statins for patients at elevated risk for CHD.", 
    "566": "Most large clinical trials report that the frequency of angioedema caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is 0.1-0.2%. The most common theory for this rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction cites ACE inhibitor-mediated accumulation of bradykinin as the culprit. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) do not exert their effects on ACE, they are not expected to cause bradykinin accumulation and therefore angioedema. Recently, several cases of angioedema related to the administration of ARBs have been documented in the literature. The existence of ARB-induced angioedema suggests that additional or alternate mechanisms not involving bradykinin are present in drug-induced angioedema. While taking candesartan for hypertension, a 53-year-old woman with known ACE inhibitor intolerance developed angioedema. During her hospitalization, candesartan was stopped and immunosuppressive therapy was administered. Within 24 hours, the angioedema had resolved completely and the patient was discharged. In light of the recent literature on ARB-induced angioedema, ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients who begin ARB therapy should receive appropriate counseling and be monitored closely for this adverse reaction.", 
    "567": "Angioedema and cough are known side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme is a potent inhibitor of kinase II, which facilitates the breakdown of bradykinin. An increase in bradykinin levels results in continued prostaglandin E2 synthesis, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and increased interstitial fluid. In contrast, the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase bradykinin levels. Angioedema as a complication of ACE inhibitor therapy is not widely recognized; this complication is even less recognized with second-line ARBs. We report angioedema associated with losartan (an ARB) in a patient who had experienced angioedema secondary to enalapril (an ACE inhibitor). Almost half of patients with ARB-associated angioedema also had developed angioedema while receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. Clinicians should exercise caution when using ARBs in patients with a history of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors.",

During 1998, 10,815 Medicare beneficiaries in Kentucky were diagnosed as having HF; 14,777 beneficiaries were hospitalized for the condition, and 696 Medicare beneficiaries died with HF as the primary diagnosis. Proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve functional status, quality of life, and survival among HF patients. Health Care Excel, Incorporated (HCE), the Medicare Quality Improvement Organization for Kentucky, collaborated with a select group of Kentucky hospitals to conduct an HF quality improvement project. The improved pharmacotherapy by these hospitals is presented and discussed.

    "569": "Chronic renal allograft rejection is often associated with the presence of fibrin thrombi in the microcirculation. Our purpose was to evaluate the influence of chronic rejection on fibrinolytic regulators in plasma of renal allograft recipients. We evaluated the concentration and activities of tPA, uPA and PAI-I in plasma from kidney allograft recipients. We studied 64 patients who underwent kidney transplantation from cadaveric allograft donors. At the time of the study 38 patients had stable graft function for at least 6 months proceeding the study, and 26 recipients had biopsy-proven chronic rejection of the kidney transplant. Control group included 30 healthy blood donors. In kidney transplant recipients we found significantly higher plasma tPA activity (median: 0.99 IU/ml; range: 0-3.8 IU/ml) in comparison to healthy controls (median: 0.15 IU/ml; range: 0-2.8 IU/ml) (p = 0.002) as well as significantly lower plasma PAI-I activity (median: 7.06 U/ml; range: 0-33.2 U/ml) in comparison to healthy controls (median: 21.8 U/ml; range: 0-36.7 U/ml), (p = 0.0001). Among transplant recipients, PAI-I plasma activity in recipients with chronic graft rejection (median: 10.16 U/ml; range: 0-33.2 U/ml) was significantly higher than in patients with stable graft function (median: 4.83 U/ml; range: 0-22.9 U/ml), (p = 0.01). In transplant recipients with stable graft function and poorly controlled hypertension we found significantly higher PAI-I plasma activity in comparison to recipients with normal blood pressure (p = 0.006). In kidney transplant recipients there was a positive correlation between the dose of prednisone and PAI-I activity in plasma (p = 0.01) and an association between BMI value and plasma PAI-I activity (p = 0.008), as well as an association between BMI value and plasma tPA-Ant concentration (p = 0.006). Among transplant recipients, patients treated with ACE inhibitors had significantly lower uPA plasma activity than the rest of the group (p = 0.003). In recipients with stable graft function we found a correlation between CsA concentration and tPA activity (p = 0.04), as well as an association between the dose of CsA and uPA-Ant concentration in plasma (p = 0.049). In patients with chronic graft rejection we found a negative correlation between the dose of prednisone and uPA-Ant plasma level (p = 0.004). Renal allograft recipients have higher tPA and lower PAI-I activities in plasma in comparison to healthy individuals. Chronic allograft rejection, is as well as poorly controlled hypertension, seem to be associated with an increase PAI-I plasma activity. In kidney graft recipients there is a relation between the value of BMI and the activity and concentration of tPA-Ant as well as the value of BMI and the PAI-I activity in plasma. Poorly controlled hypertension is associated with an increase in PAI-I plasma activity. The results of our study suggest a stimulatory effect of CsA on tPA and PAI-I plasma activities as well as on uPA-Ant concentration, while prednisone in turn seems to enhance PAI-I activity in plasma and decrease uPA expression. In renal allograft recipients ACE inhibitors seem to reduce uPA plasma activity.",

    "583": "To explore the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on apoptosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats(SHR), and normotensive control rats (WKY) at different ages were used. Ramipril (1 mg.kg-1.d-1) was administered orally to male SHR from 3 or 5 weeks to 10 weeks of age. Male and age-matched untreated SHR and WKY were used as controls. Experiments determined. Apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of SHR was quantified by a maximal labeling (Lmax) method and the characteristic features of apoptosis were identified by electron microscopy (EM), in situ labeling of DNA strand breaks with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP end labeling (TUNEL) and autoradiographic analysis of DNA fragments. The results of the quantitative method showed an age-dependent increase in apoptosis in the cardiac tissues of SHR. A significant increase in DNA breaks occurred as early as age 4 weeks and continued to increase up to a plateau at age 16 weeks in the cardiac tissue of SHR, whereas there was no significant change in apoptosis in WKY up to 64 weeks. Moreover, after the treatment of SHR with ramipril, an inhibitor of ACE, the DNA fragmentation, like BP and HW/BW, was reduced significantly (70.7%) as compared with that of untreated SHR(P < 0.01); and similar to that of the WKY (P > 0.1), the DNA ladder disappeared, which was very obvious in the untreated SHR. These studies demonstrate that ramipril can prevent the development of hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy and can inhibit the increase in the apoptosis of SHR cardiac myocytes, suggesting that apoptosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of genetic hypertension.", 
    "584": "Losartan, an AT1 angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor non-peptide antagonist, induces an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) when injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) into rats. The present study investigated possible effector mechanisms of the increase in MAP induced by icv losartan in unanesthetized rats. Male Holtzman rats (280-300 g, N = 6/group) with a cannula implanted into the anterior ventral third ventricle received an icv injection of losartan (90 micro g/2 micro l) that induced a typical peak pressor response within 5 min. In one group of animals, this response to icv losartan was completely reduced from 18 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 2 mmHg by intravenous (iv) injection of losartan (2.5-10 mg/kg), and in another group, it was partially reduced from 18 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 2 mmHg by iv prazosin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), an alpha1-adrenergic antagonist (P<0.05). Captopril (10 mg/kg), a converting enzyme inhibitor, injected iv in a third group inhibited the pressor response to icv losartan from 24 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 2 mmHg (P<0.05). Propranolol (10 mg/kg), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, injected iv in a fourth group did not alter the pressor response to icv losartan. Plasma renin activity and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were not altered by icv losartan in other animals. The results suggest that the pressor effect of icv losartan depends on angiotensinergic and alpha1-adrenoceptor activation, but not on increased circulating ANG II.", 
    "585": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of converting enzyme inhibition by captopril on ECG parameters in aged rats. Four-month-old male rats received captopril dissolved in tap water (0.5 mg/l) or tap water for 2 or 20 months. At the end of treatment, under anesthesia, RR and PR interval, P wave and QRS duration, QT and corrected QT interval were measured in all animals. On the following day, chronic ECG (lead II) recordings were performed to quantify supraventricular (SVPB) or ventricular premature beats (VPB). After sacrifice, the hearts were removed and weighed. RR interval was similar in young and untreated aged rats, but significantly larger in aged rats treated with captopril. P wave and QRS length did not differ among groups. PR interval was significantly larger in old than in young rats and was not affected by captopril. Corrected QT interval was larger in aged than in young rats (117 +/- 4 vs 64 +/- 6 ms, P<0.05) and was reduced by captopril (71 +/- 6 ms, P<0.05). VPB were absent in young rats and highly frequent in untreated old animals (8.4 +/- 3.0/30 min). Captopril significantly reduced VPB in old rats (0.3 +/- 0.1/30 min, P<0.05). The cardiac hypertrophy found in untreated aged rats was prevented by captopril (3.44 +/- 0.14 vs 3.07 +/- 0.10 mg/g, P<0.05).

    "586": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is responsible for fibrosis of the dermis and other organs as well as vascular abnormalities. While the pathogenesis of SSc is continually being better understood, there is still no single therapeutic agent that has been shown to increase survival in a prospective randomized trial. Traditional medications such as colchicine and D-penicillamine are disappointing in clinical practice, and the latter one failed to clearly show benefit when tested in a prospective placebo controlled trial comparing conventional high dose versus low dose. Conversely, new disease modifying agents are emerging such as cyclophosphamide (CYC) in interstitial pulmonary disease and stem cell autograft after high dose CYC therapy in patients who develop visceral involvement in the three first years of evolution of the disease. Organ specific therapy may show dramatic benefit, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in renal crisis and epoprostenol in primary pulmonary hypertension. We will try to review disease modifying agents available in SSc and emphasize new therapeutic agents that are currently being evaluated, including vasodilators, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosing agents and immunosuppressive molecules.",

Group 2 (long-term) animals received a daily dose of cilazapril for 7 days. 2K-1C animals receiving water served as clipped controls, and sham-operated animals were normal controls. Western blot analysis was used to estimate the protein levels and ELISA for PGE(2) and TXB(2).",

In group 1 clipped kidneys, NHE-3 and alpha-actin proteins were increased, and crude microsomes and PNP activity were decreased. In group 2 clipped kidneys, both NHE-1 and 3 isoforms were induced, whereas PNP activity was decreased. Cilazapril did not reverse the changes in the clipped kidneys in both groups, but reduced the crude microsomes. Group 2 unclipped kidneys showed hypertrophy, which remained unaffected by cilazapril treatment. Induced levels of BP, PGE(2) and TXB(2) in both groups were reduced significantly except for the 24-hour post-cilazapril treatment.",

    "592": "The inhibition of angiotensin II through angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has become the foundation of medical treatment of progressive chronic renal disease. Although these drugs provide a significant improvement over earlier treatments, they only slow the progression of renal disease, implying the need for additional drugs that could be combined with antiangiotensin treatment. Potentially valuable novel drug targets include downstream mediators of angiotensin II such as transforming growth factor-b, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and endothelin-1. In addition, recent evidence points to aldosterone as a major player in progressive renal disease, indicating that multiple points of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might have to be targeted. This paper reviews the experimental and clinical evidence indicating that targeting these cytokines and hormones could provide additional benefits to antiangiotensin treatment in chronic renal disease.", 
    "593": "Several treatment guidelines have made strong recommendations to physicians that treatment of nephropathy and hypertension should be based on the use of a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor if tolerated. The recently published clinical trials, based on angiotensin II receptor blockers' effects on diabetic nephropathy and essential hypertension, have also shown significant endpoint reduction. Perhaps the time has come to broaden the recommendations to include the use of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system altering drug. But what if the treatment goal cannot be reached, and incessant proteinuria and high blood pressure levels persist despite high dosage treatment of either drug? How should this be handled? The dual blockade principle can possibly provide the solution by obtaining the broadest and most efficient blockade of circulating angiotensin II by using the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker. But large clinical trials are yet to come, and at present large endpoint trials have not been published. This article provides an overview of how far we have come with dual blockade treatment in hypertension and nephropathy.", 
    "594": "A cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy of 25% to 40% has been documented after duration of diabetes of at least 25 years in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause (25%-44%) of end-stage renal failure in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Until the early 1980s, no renoprotective treatment was available for use in diabetic nephropathy. Death occurred on average 5 to 7 years after the onset of persistent proteinuria. The two main treatment strategies for prevention of diabetic nephropathy are improved glycemic control and blood pressure lowering, particularly using drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Megatrials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of both the above-mentioned treatment modalities. Secondary prevention, that is, treatment modalities applied to diabetic patients at high risk for developing diabetic nephropathy (eg, those with microalbuminuria) has been documented, applying angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockade. The renoprotective effects of these drugs are independent of their beneficial reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "595": "Obesity is a major public health issue, and hypertension is one of the most common associated comorbidities. Current guidelines for optimal blood pressure levels in obese patients or for the treatment of obesity-hypertension do not provide specific recommendations that go beyond the rather general recommendation to lose weight. Based on the strong ties between obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, and the similarity of complications that occur in obesity-related hypertension and in hypertension associated with type 2 diabetes, it seems appropriate to explore the optimal blood pressure levels for obese hypertensive patients. Recently published studies underline the importance of weight reduction to reach this goal. Several lines of reasoning support the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers as the appropriate first-line therapy in obese patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, a-blockers, or low-dose diuretics may be added when necessary. Clearly, further studies are needed to define target blood pressure levels in obese patients and to clarify the value of established and newer drugs, like angiotensin receptor blockers, for the treatment of obese hypertensive patients. The role of antiobesity drugs in the management of the obese hypertensive patient also remains to be defined.", 
    "596": "Thiazide diuretics, b-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are all superior to placebo for the primary prevention of coronary events in patients with hypertension. Recent studies have shown that ACE inhibitors are better than other antihypertensive agents in lowering overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially stroke. Blood pressure should be aggressively lowered (to < 140/90 mm Hg), especially in diabetic patients (to < 130/80 mm Hg), but care should be exercised in lowering the diastolic blood pressure below 65 mm Hg in patients with significant occlusive coronary artery disease. Hypertension in patients with stable angina should be treated with a b-blocker (alternatively a calcium channel blocker) together with an ACE inhibitor. Patients with hypertension and acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction) should be treated with a b-blocker, and with an ACE inhibitor if there is left ventricular dysfunction. A thiazide diuretic and/or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker could be added for blood pressure control. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided if there is significant left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "597": "Two thirds of patients with hypertension require more than one drug to achieve goal blood pressure. Rational antihypertensive drug combinations are based on their ability to produce additive blood pressure reduction and reduce the incidence of dose-dependent side effects. Some combinations exhibit side-effect neutralization in which side effects associated with one drug are neutralized by a second agent. Fixed-dose combinations improve adherence by reducing the number of pills and simplifying the treatment regimen. Because volume overload is common, low-dose diuretics are often included in drug combinations. Combinations of diuretics with potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and b-blockers are useful in treating large segments of the hypertensive population. Combinations of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are also effective and reduce the incidence of calcium blocker-related edema. Combinations of agents affecting the renin-angiotensin system by different mechanisms are currently the subject of active investigation.",

Ventricular dysfunction and the syndrome of heart failure can also be a concomitant pathology in up to 50% of patients with AF. However this association is more than just due to shared risk factors, research from animal and human studies suggest a causal relationship between AF and heart failure. There are numerous reports of tachycardia-induced heart failure where uncontrolled ventricular rate in AF results in heart failure, which is reversible with cardioversion to sinus rhythm or ventricular rate control. However the relationship extends beyond tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Optimal treatment of AF may delay progressive ventricular dysfunction and the onset of heart failure whilst improved management of heart failure can prevent AF or improve ventricular rate control. Prevention and treatment of atrial arrhythmias, and in particular atrial fibrillation, is therefore an important aspect of the management of patients with heart failure. This review describes the incidence and possible predictors of AF and other atrial arrhythmias in patients with heart failure and discusses the feasibility of primary prevention. The evidence for the management of atrial fibrillation in heart failure is systematically reviewed and the strategies of rate versus rhythm control discussed in light of the prevailing evidence.",

We postulated that activation of the bradykinin-nitric oxide (NO) system by an ACE inhibitor enhances glucose uptake in peripheral tissues by means of an increase in translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), resulting in improvement of insulin resistance. Administration of an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, significantly decreased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in type 2 diabetic mouse KK-Ay. Mice treated with temocapril showed a smaller plasma glucose increase after glucose load. We demonstrated that temocapril treatment significantly enhanced 2-[3H]-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake in skeletal muscle but not in white adipose tissue. Administration of a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe140, or an NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, attenuated the enhanced glucose uptake by temocapril. Moreover, we observed that translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was significantly enhanced by temocapril treatment without influencing insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation. In L6 skeletal muscle cells, 2-DG uptake was increased by temocaprilat, and Hoe140 inhibited this effect of temocaprilat but not that of insulin. These results suggest that temocapril would improve insulin resistance and glucose intolerance through increasing glucose uptake, especially in skeletal muscle at least in part through enhancement of the bradykinin-NO system and consequently GLUT4 translocation.", 
    "610": "This double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the acute and sustained hormonal, renal hemodynamic, and tubular effects of concomitant ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition by omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, in men. Thirty-two normotensive subjects were randomized to receive a placebo, omapatrilat (40 or 80 mg), or the fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide (FOS/HCTZ; 20 and 12.5 mg, respectively) fixed combination for 1 week. Blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, urinary electrolytes and atrial natriuretic peptide excretion, and several components of the renin-angiotensin system were measured for 6 hours on days 1 and 7 of drug administration. When compared with the placebo and the FOS/HCTZ combination, omapatrilat induced a significant decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels (P<0.001 versus placebo; P<0.05 versus FOS/HCTZ) and an increase in urinary atrial natriuretic peptide excretion (P<0.01). These hormonal effects were associated with a significant fall in blood pressure (P<0.01) and a marked renal vasodilatation, but with no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate. The FOS/HCTZ markedly increased urinary sodium excretion (P<0.001). The acute natriuretic response to FOS/HCTZ was significantly greater than that observed with omapatrilat (P<0.01). Over 1 week, however, the cumulative sodium excretion induced by both doses of omapatrilat (P<0.01 versus placebo) was at least as great as that induced by the dose of FOS/HCTZ (P=NS versus FOS/HCTZ). In conclusion, the results of the present study in normal subjects demonstrate that omapatrilat has favorable renal hemodynamic effects. Omapatrilat combines potent ACE inhibition with a sustained natriuresis, which explains its well-documented potent antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "611": "Uncoupling proteins, inner mitochondrial membrane proton transporters, are important for regulating myocardial energy efficiency. We investigated the effects of the ACE inhibitor perindopril on cardiac performance, myocardial energy efficiency, and uncoupling protein expression in an aortic regurgitation rat model. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats, in which aortic regurgitation was produced, were divided into untreated and perindopril-treated (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) rats. The treatments were initiated 3 days after operation. Ten control rats were sham-operated. Measurements of blood pressure and echocardiography were repeated before and 100 days after operation (endpoint). Left ventricular uncoupling protein-2 expression, creatine phosphate, and adenosine triphosphate were measured at endpoint. In perindopril-treated rats, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased after treatment (92+/-4/65+/-2 mm Hg). At endpoint, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension in untreated (10.7+/-0.2 mm) and treated rats (9.2+/-0.2 mm) was increased, and fractional shortening was reduced in untreated rats (28+/-1%) but did not change in treated rats (36+/-2%). Uncoupling protein-2 mRNA expression increased in untreated rats (3.7-fold) and was suppressed by perindopril (1.5-fold). The creatine phosphate was reduced in untreated rats (10.6+/-0.7 micro mol/g) but not in treated rats (15.9+/-2.0 micro mol/g). In the chronic stage of aortic regurgitation, perindopril improved cardiac performance and myocardial energy efficiency, in which the suppression of uncoupling protein-2 may play an important role.", 
    "612": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) acts mainly on two receptor subtypes: AT1 and AT2. Most of the known biological actions of Ang II are mediated by AT1 receptors; however, the role of AT2 receptors remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the cardioprotective effects of AT1 receptor antagonists (AT1-ant) after myocardial infarction (MI) are partially mediated by activation of AT2 receptors; thus in AT2 receptor gene knockout mice (AT2-/Y), the effect of AT1-ant will be diminished or absent. MI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Four weeks later, AT2-/Y and their wild-type littermates (AT2+/Y) were started on vehicle, AT1-ant (valsartan, 50 mg/kg per day), or ACE inhibitor (enalapril, 20 mg/kg per day) for 20 weeks. Basal blood pressure and cardiac function as well as remodeling after MI did not differ between AT2+/Y and AT2-/Y. AT1-ant increased ejection fraction and cardiac output and decreased left ventricular diastolic dimension, myocyte cross-sectional area, and interstitial collagen deposition in AT2+/Y, and these effects were significantly diminished in AT2-/Y. ACE inhibitors improved cardiac function and remodeling similarly in both strains. We concluded that (1) activation of AT2 during AT1 blockade plays an important role in the therapeutic effect of AT1-ant and (2) the AT2 receptor may not play an important role in regulation of cardiac function, either under basal conditions after MI remodeling or in the therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "613": "The PICXEL study is designed to evaluate the effects of long-term administration of very low-dose combination perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg (Per/Ind) vs enalapril in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. This multicentre, controlled, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study is carried-out to assess the variation of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) after treatment, using a centralised control of M-mode echocardiography determinations, and a dedicated software for semi-automatic measurement. Following a 4-week placebo run-in period, hypertensive outpatients aged >/=18 years, with LVH (LVMI >120 and 100 g/m(2) for men and women, respectively), are randomised to receive once daily, over 52 weeks, either Per/Ind or enalapril. According to blood pressure levels, the dose may be adjusted. In addition to clinical examinations, ECG, blood pressure, heart rate and laboratory assessments echocardiographic determinations are performed for selection, at baseline, after 24 weeks and at the end of the study. The main outcome criteria is the change from baseline in LVMI which is considered the primary efficacy criterion; changes in blood pressure and echo-Doppler parameters constitute secondary criteria. Two-sided Student's t-test for independent samples will be used to differentiate the effects of the treatment between groups with alpha = 5%, and the inter-group difference of LVMI variation will be analysed with a power of 90%. A sample size of 500 patients is required making it necessary to randomise at least 550 patients, based on a 10% proportion of potentially non-assessable patients. The results of this study, obtained after applying strict methodological procedures and requirements, are expected to provide valuable and reliable information on the effects of long-term administration of Per/Ind on LVH, and on its potential superiority over enalapril.", 
    "614": "Since heart failure is a major cause of morbidity in the elderly, we studied the effect of up-titrated heart failure therapy in older vs. younger individuals on symptoms and left ventricular (LV) function over 1 year. Seventy-one patients with heart failure and an LV ejection fraction < or =35% were enrolled and were followed with echocardiography at baseline and at 1 year. Young patients were born in or after 1935 (n=48; 51.7+/-9.1 years); middle-aged were born between 1925-1934 (n=14; 69.7+/-2.8 years); and older patients in or prior to 1924 (n=9; 80.5+/-3.3 years). Baseline LV ejection fraction was 18%+/-7%, LV end-diastolic diameter 6.9+/-0.9 cm, and New York Heart Association class was 2.6+/-1.0, equivalent for all groups. On medical therapy, at 12 months, LV ejection fraction improved only for the young and middle-aged (36%+/-14% and 37%+/-17%; p=0.002), but not for the older patients (22%+/-7%; p=NS). Reductions in LV end-diastolic diameter and mitral regurgitation were significant only for the young. However, New York Heart Association status improved similarly for all groups (1.6+/-0.8; p<0.001), as did heart failure hospitalizations (p<0.0001). Although all groups tolerated intensified heart failure therapy, only the young and middle-aged improved LV remodeling. However, older patients experienced equivalent significant improvements in heart failure symptoms and hospitalizations.", 
    "615": "The authors identified 321 elderly Kansas Medicaid patients with congestive heart failure and examined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use. Using retrospective claims data, ACE inhibitor use was quantified and daily doses compared to a target enalapril-equivalent dose of 20 mg. The cohort patients averaged 80 years of age, 84% were female, and 70% resided primarily in a nursing home. Only 37.8% received an ACE inhibitor. Users were younger than nonusers (t=2.00; p=0.046), but there was no gender difference (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73, 2.6). ACE inhibitor users averaged eight prescriptions annually, providing approximately 257 medication days (70% of the study period). The average enalapril-equivalent daily dose was 10.6 mg, and only 22% received the target dose. Nursing home residents were less likely to receive an ACE inhibitor than ambulatory patients (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.89) but equally likely to receive target doses (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.34, 4.9). ACE inhibitor use in the Kansas Medicaid congestive heart failure population is not consistent with practice guidelines, particularly among older and/or nursing home patients.", 
    "616": "To assess the effects of pharmacological interruption of the renin-angiotensin system on the fibrinolysis, tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigens (PAI-1) and neurohormones, such as plasma renin activity, norepinephrine, angiotensin II (AII) and IV (AIV) concentrations, were measured in 60 hypertensives. Among them, 48 patients were divided into two groups (25 with 10-20 mg quinapril and 23 with 50-100 mg losartan) who received the drug for 6 months. AII had a weak positive correlation with free PAI-I (n = 60, r = 0.26, p < 0.05) whereas AIV had a strong positive correlation with free PAI-I (n = 60, r = 0.57, p < 0.0001). In both treatment groups, blood pressures were significantly reduced to similar levels after drug treatment. While plasma renin activity increased significantly in both groups after drug treatment, only the losartan group showed significant increases in AII and AIV concentrations. In the quinapril group, there was a significant change in t-PA (p < 0.001) without changes in PAI-1. In the losartan group, free PAI-I and total PAI-I (p < 0.05 for free PAI-I and p < 0.04 for total PAI-I) were significantly increased without a change in t-PA. Thus, quinapril enhanced fibrinolysis but losartan attenuated it. These unique effects of each drug on the fibrinolytic system appear to be associated with changes in AII and AIV concentrations.", 
    "617": "Phospholipase D 2 (PLD2) is the major PLD isozyme associated with the cardiac sarcolemmal (SL) membrane. Hydrolysis of SL phosphatidylcholine (PC) by PLD2 produces phosphatidic acid (PA), which is then converted to 1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG) by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase type 2 (PAP2). In view of the role of both PA and DAG in the regulation of Ca(2+) movements and the association of abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis with congestive heart failure (CHF), we examined the status of both PLD2 and PAP2 in SL membranes in the infarcted heart upon occluding the left coronary artery in rats for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks. A time-dependent increase in both SL PLD2 and PAP2 activities was observed in the non-infarcted left ventricular tissue following myocardial infarction (MI); however, the increase in PAP2 activity was greater than that in PLD2 activity. Furthermore, the contents of both PA and PC were reduced, whereas that of DAG was increased in the failing heart SL membrane. Treatment of the CHF animals with imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, attenuated the observed changes in heart function, SL PLD2 and PAP2 activities, as well as SL PA, PC and DAG contents. The results suggest that heart failure is associated with increased activities of both PLD2 and PAP2 in the SL membrane and the beneficial effect of imidapril on heart function may be due to its ability to prevent these changes in the phospholipid signaling molecules in the cardiac SL membrane.", 
    "618": "One of the efficient mode of treatments of chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disorders has been to restrain the formation of angiotensin-II by inhibiting the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin-I. A number of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) have been put to therapeutic use during the last two decades. The efforts continue towards achieving superior molecules or drugs with improved affinities, better bioavailability and thus long duration of action with minimum side effects. The present work evolves around similar objectives. In order to understand the mode of interaction of inhibitors with the active site of the enzyme and subsequently to have lead compounds as possible inhibitors the novel dipeptidomimics and tripeptidomimics have been designed and synthesized using combinatorial chemistry approach. A Focussed library of 10 di- and tri-peptides, eight dipeptidomemics and forty tripeptidomemics was generated. The pharmacophoric heterocyclic moieties and the amino acids have been selected to have affinities with the S1, S1', and S2' subsites of the active site of the enzyme. ACE inhibition studies clearly demonstrated the structural-activity relationships within these classes of peptidomimics. The dipeptidomimics interacted only with S1' and S2' subsites, whereas the tripeptidomemics had additional interaction with S1 subsite, which accounted for their significant ACE inhibition potencies. The in-vitro screening of these peptidomimics have resulted in identification of four promising tripeptidomimics 34[2-benzimidazolepropionyl-Val-Trp], 35[5hydroxytryptophanyl-Val-Trp], 40[2-benzimidazolepropionyl-Ile-Trp] and 45[2-benzimidazolepropionyl-Lys-Trp] with IC50 values in micromolar concentrations.", 
    "619": "Two circumventricular organs, the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT), may mediate salt appetite in response to acute intravenous infusions of angiotensin (ANG) II. Fluid intakes and mean arterial pressures were measured in rats with sham lesions or electrolytic lesions of the SFO or OVLT during an intravenous infusion of 30 ng/min ANG II. Beginning 21 h before the 90-min infusion, the rats were depleted of sodium with furosemide and given a total of 300 mg/kg captopril in 75 ml/kg water in three spaced gavages to block the usual salt appetite and to hydrate the rats. No other food or fluids were available for ingestion. Sham-lesioned rats drank 9.3+/-1.2 ml if 0.3 M NaCl alone was available and drank 8.9+/-1.6 ml of saline and 3.7+/-1.6 ml of water if both were available. Either SFO or OVLT lesions reduced the intakes of saline to <5 ml in both conditions and of water to <1 ml. Mean arterial pressure did not differ among the groups and was maintained above 100 mmHg after the depletion and captopril treatments because of the large doses of water. Thus, a full expression of salt appetite in response to an acute intravenous infusion of ANG II requires the integrity of both the SFO and OVLT.", 
    "620": "Volume overload is a chronic, troublesome problem in many patients on hemodialysis. These patients suffer from hyperdipsia with inability to excrete water. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has been shown to decrease thirst and interdialytic weight gain in 2-4 weeks of usage. We investigated the effect of long-term use of ACEI, as levels of angiotensin II tends to go back to normal level after 6 months of use. We compared hemodialysis patients on ACEI for more than 6 months to patients not on ACEI. Seven patients were taking ACEI compared to 51 controls in the other group. Almost one third of patients in each group had an interdialytic weight gain > 5% of dry weight. No significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to interdialytic weight gain, thirst and mouth dryness scores, and interdialytic mean blood pressure change. There was no demonstrable effect of angiotensin receptor blocking drugs on weight gain or thirst. We conclude that long-term ACEI may not continue to suppress inappropriate thirst and fluid intake after 6 months in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "621": "Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurs frequently in the postoperative period (< or = 30 days) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, a setting where many factors may play a role in its genesis. The prognosis of NSVT in this setting in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is unknown. This study was designed to assess its significance.",

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in 27% and 33% (P = 0.046) of patients with postoperative and nonpostoperative NSVT, respectively. The 2- and 5-year rates of arrhythmic events were 6% and 16%, respectively, in postoperative patients versus 15% and 29% in nonpostoperative patients (unadjusted P = 0.0020, adjusted P = 0.0082). The 2- and 5-year overall mortality rates were 15% and 36%, respectively, for postoperative patients versus 24% and 47% for nonpostoperative patients (unadjusted P = 0.0005, adjusted P = 0.027). Patients whose NSVT was identified early (<10 days) versus late (10-30 days) after CABG had significantly lower 2- (13% vs 23%) and 5-year (30% vs 52%) mortality rates (unadjusted P = 0.024, adjusted P = 0.018).", 
    "623": "In this population of patients with CAD and LV dysfunction, the occurrence of postoperative NSVT, especially within 10 days after CABG, portends a far better outcome than when it occurs in nonpostoperative settings. This suggests that in a such setting, NSVT represents a less specific risk factor for future events and should be considered when assigning risk and treatment of similar patients.",

The results showed that: 1. Four weeks later after injecting STZ, the function of ECs-dependent relaxation was not injured in diabetic control group(DC), but the concentrations of plasma glucose and AngII were increased significantly compared with normal control group(NC). The Ach-induced relaxation was declined obviously compared with NC at 8 or 16 weeks after injecting STZ. 2. treatment with Perindopril significantly protected the function of ECs-dependent relaxation, the Ach-induced relaxation was obviously increased compared with DC.

The plasma ET-1 levels of 36 patients with cor pulmonale and 20 normal subjects were measured by radioimmunoassay. Twenty patients were treated with antibiotics and oxygen, and the other 16 patients were treated with antibiotics, oxygen and captopril for 14 days. The results showed that the ET-1 level of patients with cor pulmonale (88.9 +/- 8.9 ng/L) was significantly higher than that of normal control (53.5 +/- 5.1 ng/L). After treatment, the ET-1 level declined significantly in both groups of patients (P < 0.01); the ET-1 level in patients treated with captopril was lower than that in patients not treated with captopril (P < 0.05), but the level of ET-1 in patients was still higher than that of normal control (P < 0.05). These suggest that ET-1 may play an important role in the onset of cor pulmonale and captopril can reduce the ET-1 level.", 
    "627": "Pyrimidine-specific ribonucleases are a superfamily of structurally related enzymes with distinct catalytic and biological properties. We used a combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic assays to investigate the release of such enzymes by isolated cells in serum-free and serum-containing media. We found that human endothelial cells typically expressed large amounts of a pancreatic-type RNase that is related to, if not identical to, human pancreatic RNase. This enzyme exhibits pyrimidine-specific catalytic activity, with a marked preference for poly(C) substrate over poly(U) substrate. It was potently inhibited by placental RNase inhibitor, the selective pancreatic-type RNase inhibitor Inhibit-Ace, and a polyclonal antibody against human pancreatic RNase. The enzyme isolated from medium conditioned by immortalized umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926) possesses an amino-terminal sequence identical to that of pancreatic RNase, and shows molecular heterogeneity (molecular weights 18,000-26,000) due to different degrees of N-glycosylation. Endothelial cells from arteries, veins, and capillaries secreted up to 100 ng of this RNase daily per million cells, whereas levels were low or undetectable in media conditioned by other cell types examined. The corresponding messenger RNA was detected by RT-PCR in most cell types tested so far, and level of its expression was in keeping with the amounts of protein. The selective strong release of pancreatic-type RNase by endothelial cells suggests that it is endowed with non-digestive functions and involved in vascular homeostasis.", 
    "628": "The bacterial Zn2+ metallo-beta-lactamase from B. fragilis is a zinc-enzyme with two potential metal ion binding sites. It cleaves the lactam ring of antibiotics, thus contributing to the acquired resistance of bacteria against antibiotics. The present study bears on the binuclear form of the enzyme. We compare several possible binding modes of captopril, a mercaptocarboxamide inhibitor of several zinc-metalloenzymes. Two diastereoisomers of captopril were considered, with either a D- or an L-proline residue. We have used the polarizable molecular mechanics procedure SIBFA (Sum of Interactions Between Fragments ab initio computed). Two beta-lactamase models were considered, encompassing 104 and 188 residues, respectively. The energy balances included the inter and intramolecular interaction energies as well as the contribution from solvation computed using a continuum reaction field procedure. The thiolate ion of the inhibitor is binding to both metal ions, expelling the bridging solvent molecule from the uncomplexed enzyme. Different competing binding modes of captopril were considered, either where the inhibitor binds in a monodentate mode to the zinc cations only with its thiolate ion, or in bidentate modes involving additional zinc binding by its carboxylate or ketone carbonyl groups. The additional coordination by the inhibitor's carboxylate or carbonyl group always occurs at the zinc ion, which is bound by a histidine, a cysteine, and an aspartate side chain. For both diastereomers, the energy balances favor monodentate binding of captopril via S-. The preference over bidentate binding is small. The interaction energies were recomputed in model sites restricted to captopril, the Zn2+ cations, and their coordinating end side chains from beta-lactamase (98 atoms). The interaction energies and their ranking among competing arrangements were consistent with those computed by ab initio HF and DFT procedures.", 
    "629": "Great strides have been made in identifying and managing the organ-based complications of systemic sclerosis (SSc). There is no room for the nihilism towards treating this disease that used to be so prevalent. However, there is still relatively little hard evidence on which to base treatment decisions. Previous trials have been constrained by the low disease prevalence and the difficulty in recruiting sufficient patients especially with disease of recent onset. The results of past trials have often been confounded by the failure to recognize the marked heterogeneity of SSc and the inclusion of patient subsets with widely varying disease expression, course and outcome. It is recognized that progress will only be made in this area with coordinated multicentre studies. As a result, national and international networks of clinicians with expertise in the management of SSc have been formed. In the UK, the Systemic Sclerosis Study Group has established a national scleroderma register and, together with the Scleroderma Special Interest Group of the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), a multicentre base for therapeutic studies. As a result of developments in our understanding of the pathogenesis of scleroderma and our ability to subset patients more effectively, a number of rather more rational approaches to treating the disease and its complications are being tested. In parallel with this, considerable progress is being made in developing universally agreed measures of disease activity and severity and in identifying surrogate laboratory markers of disease activity that are relevant to therapeutic studies. These multicentre trials need substantial funding and often do not attract support from the pharmaceutical industry. It was because of the difficulty in financing long-term, multicentre studies in uncommon conditions that the ARC/BSR Clinical Trials Programme was established. The QUINS trial, which is funded by this Programme, is described here as an example of one of several therapeutic protocols being developed by the UK Systemic Sclerosis Study Group that are currently being tested in multicentre trials. Contact details are provided in the appendix for clinicians who are interested in registering patients on the UK Scleroderma Register or participating in this or in the other therapeutic studies.", 
    "630": "1. Studies in isolated cells overexpressing ACE and bradykinin type 2 (B(2)) receptors suggest that ACE inhibitors potentiate bradykinin by inhibiting B(2) receptor desensitization, via a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatases. Here we investigated, in intact porcine coronary arteries, endothelial ACE/B(2) receptor 'crosstalk' as well as bradykinin potentiation through neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition. 2. NEP inhibition with phosphoramidon did not affect the bradykinin concentration-response curve (CRC), nor did combined NEP/ACE inhibition with omapatrilat exert a further leftward shift on top of the approximately 10 fold leftward shift of the bradykinin CRC observed with ACE inhibition alone. 3. In arteries that, following repeated exposure to 0.1 microM bradykinin, no longer responded to bradykinin ('desensitized' arteries), the ACE inhibitors quinaprilat and angiotensin-(1-7) both induced complete relaxation, without affecting the organ bath fluid levels of bradykinin. This phenomenon was unaffected by inhibition of PKC or phosphatases (with calphostin C and okadaic acid, respectively). 4. When using bradykinin analogues that were either completely or largely ACE-resistant ([Phe(8)psi(CH(2)-NH)Arg(9)]-bradykinin and [deltaPhe(5)]-bradykinin, respectively), the ACE inhibitor-induced shift of the bradykinin CRC was absent, and its ability to reverse desensitization was absent or significantly reduced, respectively. Caveolar disruption with filipin did not affect the quinaprilat-induced effects. Filipin did however reduce the bradykinin-induced relaxation by approximately 25-30%, thereby confirming that B(2) receptor-endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) interaction occurs in caveolae. 5. In conclusion, in porcine arteries, in contrast to transfected cells, bradykinin potentiation by ACE inhibitors is a metabolic process, that can only be explained on the basis of ACE-B(2) receptor co-localization on the endothelial cell membrane. NEP does not appear to affect the bradykinin levels in close proximity to B(2) receptors, and the ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin potentiation precedes B(2) receptor coupling to eNOS in caveolae.", 
    "631": "Although a cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are under-used, partly due to side effects. If proven at least similarly efficacious to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers may replace them due to their superior tolerability. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of valsartan and enalapril in heart failure patients stabilised on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We randomised 141 patients (mean 68 years, 74% males) with stable mild/moderate heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction 0.45 or less, to valsartan 160 mg q.d. (n=70) or enalapril 10 mg b.i.d. (n=71) for 12 weeks. Changes in 6-min-walk test (primary efficacy variable), patients' wellbeing and left ventricular size and function did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Valsartan was significantly non-inferior to enalapril in walk test distance change: least-square means treatment difference +1.12 m (95% confidence interval -21.9 to 24.1), non-inferiority P<0.001. Left ventricular size (P<0.001) and function (P=0.048) improved significantly only in the valsartan group. Fewer patients experienced adverse events in the valsartan group (50%) than in the enalapril group (63%), although statistically non-significant. Valsartan is similarly efficacious and safe to enalapril in patients with stable, mild/moderate heart failure, previously stabilised on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and directly switched to study medication.",

Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) are ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and may increase natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and perhaps endothelin-1 in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients (n = 107) with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class II to III, with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and on ACE inhibitor therapy were randomized to either the VPI omapatrilat 40 mg/day or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg/day. Trough levels of neurohormones (24 hours after dosing) were assessed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up. C-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP) levels decreased with lisinopril (p = 0.035), but not with omapatrilat. In contrast, N-terminal ANP levels did not change, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels tended to decrease similarly in both groups. Endothelin-1 levels increased in both groups, the increase reaching statistical significance with omapatrilat (p = 0.008). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tended to decrease, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 increased in both groups, with statistical significance only for interleukin-10 with omapatrilat therapy. Neither agent changed catecholamines or angiotensin II. Thus, even at trough levels, omapatrilat potentiates C-ANP more than lisinopril. Potentially important effects of omapatrilat on endothelin-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines were identified, providing potential explanations for differences in clinical outcome.",

The evidences are accumulating that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 antagonists could be novel anti-angiogenic, anti-invasive, and even anti-growth agents against neoplastic tissues: The renin-angiotensin system promotes angiogenesis directly or indirectly and growth of neoplastic cell. Some tumors carry angiotensin II type 1 receptors. Angiotensin II antagonists and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown some anti-neoplastic actions. Angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan antagonises platelets, which are thought to modulate via vascular endothelial growth factor.

We believe that these agents can be useful on clinical grounds and suggest their incorporation into clinical studies.", 
    "638": "1. Chronic antihypertensive treatment lowers cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The beneficial effect on the blood vessel wall may be due to the lowering of blood pressure (BP) and, hence, wall stress (WS), or to a treatment-induced change in wall structure. 2. We have previously shown that, when evaluated at the same level of BP and WS, the stiffness of the aortic wall of old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is higher than that of young and adult SHR and that of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the intrinsic changes in wall composition and mechanics in old SHR can be modulated by long-term treatment with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril; 40 mg/kg per day) combined with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide; 20 mg/kg per day) and that treatment withdrawal would reveal whether such changes are maintained when BP and WS return to pretreatment levels. 3. We evaluated aortic structure and mechanics in SHR following 1 week withdrawal of oral antihypertensive treatment from 3 to 15 months of age (n = 8). Results were compared with age-matched SHR that were maintained on treatment (n = 12) or were not treated (n = 13) and with WKY rats (no treatment n = 11; maintained n = 11; withdrawn n = 10). 4. Isobaric aortic wall stiffness was estimated from the ratio of baseline aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) to BP and the slope relating aortic PWV to BP following sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension. Relative wall stiffening was estimated as the ratio of elastic modulus (EM) to WS. We argued that if treatment produced a change in wall elastin or collagen content, with a subsequent decrease in isobaric wall stiffness, then this would be maintained when BP increased following withdrawal of treatment. 5. In old SHR, treatment lowered isobaric wall stiffness (baseline PWV/BP 4.6 +/- 0.3 cm/s per mmHg; slope relating PWV to BP 6.7 +/- 0.4 x 10-3 cm/s per mmHg and EM/WS 4.1 +/- 0.4 vs 6.1 +/- 0.4 cm/s per mmHg, 9.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 cm/s per mmHg and 8.9 +/- 1.1, respectively, without treatment; all P < 0.05). After 1 weeks treatment withdrawal, the indices (5.7 +/- 0.2 cm/s per mmHg, 9.1 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 cm/s per mmHg and 7.2 +/- 0.6) increased in parallel with the increase in WS to levels similar to those observed in untreated SHR. There were no significant differences among the WKY rat groups. 6. Treatment increased the elastin and collagen contents of the aortic wall in both SHR (196 +/- 13 and 128 +/- 5 vs 111 +/- 9 and 86 +/- 4 mg/g wet weight, respectively, in untreated; P < 0.05) and WKY rats (190 +/- 19 and 135 +/- 4 vs 115 +/- 7 and 114 +/- 5 mg/g wet weight, respectively, in untreated; P < 0.05). This increase remained following withdrawal (213 +/- 26 and 118 +/- 4 vs 161 +/- 14 and 127 +/- 4 mg/g wet weight in SHR and WKY rats, respectively). 7. In summary, 1 year of treatment with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide increases wall elastin content and reduces WS and stiffness in old SHR. Following withdrawal, elastin content remains high, but wall stiffness parallels WS in a manner similar to that in untreated SHR.",

Neuromelanine synthesis from DA produce highly reactive free radicals. Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to produce MPP(+)-induced.OH generation via NO synthase (NOS) activation by depolarization.

Whether the changes occurring after long-term hypertension could also be modulated in large arteries was investigated. Two-month-old SHRsp were salt loaded and treated with the drug regimen until they reached 50% mortality or around midlife.

Ultrastructural, histomorphometric, and biochemical studies were performed on the thoracic aorta. When compared with delapril (12 mg/kg) or indapamide (1 mg/kg) administered individually for 5 months, the combination 12 + 1 mg/kg was able to prevent the increase in extracellular matrix deposition observed in other treatment groups, as assessed by histomorphometry or 4-OH-proline biochemical determination. In the second experiment, a half-dose (delapril 6 mg/kg + indapamide 0.5 mg/kg) combination was similarly effective in counteracting fibrosis, but the other doses progressively failed. In the first experiment, the combination had a stabilizing effect on hypertension and stimulated diuresis. In the second experiment, arterial blood pressure values and sodium balance were not consistently affected by the treatments that antagonized fibrosis (i.e., delapril 6 mg/kg + indapamide 0.5 mg/kg and, less efficiently, delapril 3 mg/kg + indapamide 0.25 mg/kg).

The pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I (AI) was measured and normalized for the pressor response to angiotensin II (AII) to assess inhibition of the vascular converting enzyme (AII/AI ratio). Aldosterone levels were determined by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Eleven of the 34 subjects had plasma aldosterone levels above the upper limit of normal, ie, >15.0 ng/dL. Seven of these 11 subjects (64%) had an AII/AI ratio < or =0.05, indicating complete inhibition of the vascular converting enzyme.

    "681": "The enzyme EC 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15) is a zinc metalloendopeptidase whose precise function in vivo remains unknown but is thought to participate in the regulated metabolism of a number of specific neuropeptides. The lack of stable and selective inhibitors has hindered the determination of the exact function of EP 24.15. Of the limited number of EP 24.15 inhibitors that have been developed, N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (CFP) is the most widely studied. CFP is a potent and specific inhibitor, but it is unstable in vivo due to cleavage between the alanine and tyrosine residues by the enzyme neprilysin (EP 24.11). This cleavage by EP 24.11 generates a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, thereby limiting the use of CFP for in vivo studies. To develop specific inhibitors of EP 24.15 that are resistant to in vitro and potentially in vivo proteolysis by EP 24.11, this study incorporated beta-amino acids replacing the Ala-Tyr scissile alpha-amino acids of CFP. Both C2 and C3 substituted beta-amino acids were synthesized and substituted at the EP 24.11 scissile Ala-Tyr bond. Significant EP 24.15 inhibitory activity was observed with some of the beta-amino acid containing analogues. Moreover, binding to EP 24.11 was eliminated, thus rendering all analogues containing beta-amino acids resistant to degradation by EP 24.11. Selective inhibition of either EP 24.15 or EP 24.16 was also observed with some analogues. The results demonstrated the use of beta-amino acids in the design of inhibitors of EP 24.15 and EP 24.16 with K(i)'s in the low micromolar range. At the same time, these analogues were resistant to cleavage by the related metalloendopeptidase EP 24.11, in contrast to the alpha-amino acid based parent peptide. This study has therefore clearly shown the potential of beta-amino acids in the design of stable enzyme inhibitors and their use in generating molecules with selectivity between closely related enzymes.", 
    "682": "In a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study we evaluated the effect of ramipril prior to thrombolysis on the course of PAI-1 plasma levels and on the frequency of postinfarct ischemic events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Fifty-one out of 99 patients received 2.5 mg ramipril orally prior to thrombolysis and 12 h later. The blood samples for determination of PAI-1 plasma levels were collected on admission and 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after thrombolysis. Postinfarct ischemic events were registered until coronary angiography was performed and defined as recurrent chest pain and/or evidence of ischemic signs on the ECG (ST-depression or ST-segment elevation of 1 mm in one or more inferior or anterior leads). Coronary angiography was performed within 7 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. Patients were classified into two groups: those without reperfusion of the infarct-related artery (TIMI grade 0 or 1) and those with reperfusion of the infarct-related artery (TIMI grade 2.3). On admission, PAI-1 plasma levels were similar in both groups (ramipril: 47.1 [4.8] ng/ml; placebo: 49.1 [4.8] ng/ml). The PAI-1AUC was 77.2 [6.7] ng/ml/h in the ramipril group and 95.4 [6.2] ng/ml/h in the placebo group (p = 0.013). Significant differences between groups were observed at 4, 8 and 12 h after thrombolysis (4 h: 85.5 (11.3) vs. 116 (12.3) ng/ml, p < 0.01; 8 h: 79.1 (11.2) vs. 100.9 (9.3) ng/ml, p < 0.01; 12 hrs: 71.3 (9.5) vs. 87.4 (7.7) ng/ml, p < 0.05). The relative frequency of postinfarct ischemic events was significantly lower in the ramipril group (2.5% versus 7.1%, p = 0.001). Additionally, we observed a significant higher rate of TIMI grade 2 and 3 of the infarct-related artery in patients receiving oral ramipril compared to the placebo group (73% versus 54%; p = 0.035). Our study demonstrates a favorable effect of ramipril on the fibrinolytic system after thrombolysis associated with a lower rate of postinfarct ischemic events within the first days after myocardial infarction. Therefore, the application of ramipril prior to thrombolysis appears to be a reasonable concomitant treatment which may reduce early infarct-related complications.", 
    "683": "The renin angiotensin system plays an important role in growth and development. Exposure of the neonate to an ACE inhibitor increases mortality and results in growth retardation and abnormal development. We have demonstrated that ACE inhibition in the developing kidney increases apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation, which may account for renal growth impairment. To evaluate the role of endogenous angiotensin in cardiac development, the relationship between ACE inhibition, cell proliferation, apoptosis, several modulators of apoptosis (bcl-2, bcl-xl, and clusterin) was examined in the developing rat heart. Thirty-five newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg/d) or a vehicle (control group) for 7 d, and hearts were removed for rt-PCR and Western blotting of bcl-2, bcl-xl, and clusterin. An additional 10 rat pups were treated with hydralazine (10 mg/kg/d) or a vehicle, to serve as a hypotensive control. Cell proliferation was determined by PCNA immunostaining, and apoptosis was detected using the total TUNEL technique. Enalapril treatment resulted in a 24% mortality, reduced body weight, and decreased heart weight (p < 0.05). Enalapril decreased proliferating myocytes by 23%, and reduced proliferating cardiac interstitial cells by 8.1% (p < 0.05). Enalapril also decreased myocytes apoptosis by 60%, but the proportion of myocytes undergoing apoptosis was 10-fold less than that of proliferating cells. Cardiac bcl-2 mRNA, clusterin mRNA, bcl-2 protein, and bcl-xl protein content were not changed, but clusterin protein expression was decreased by enalapril treatment. Hydralazine did not alter cardiac cell proliferation or apoptosis. We conclude that ACE inhibition decreases cell turnover in the developing rat heart, which may contribute to cardiac growth impairment. The loss of myocytes may lead to greater myocyte hypertrophy and myocardial damage during later life.", 
    "684": "Mice with disruption of the kinin B(2) receptor (B(2)KO mice) are sensitive to salt-rich diets, which causes hypertension. The aim of the study was to assess the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin-II in hypertensive B(2)KO mice on a salt-rich diet. We also wanted to verify if there is an upregulation of the mRNA expression of the precursors or receptors for these hormones. Two groups of B(2)KO mice (20-25 g) were investigated. The first group received an 8% NaCl diet with 1% NaCl in drinking water (HS) and the second was fed with normal food with tap water (NS). The antagonists tested were the ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ-123 (1 and 5 mg/kg), the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ-788 (0.25 and 1 mg/kg), the angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (3 mg/kg). These were injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to blood pressure measurement by the tail-cuff method. We also studied the level of expression of preproET-1, ET-1 receptors, angiotensinogen and angiotensin receptors by RNA extraction from the heart and kidneys of these mice followed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. B(2)KO mice (HS) were hypertensive after 8 weeks compared with B(2)KO mice on normal diet (HS, 93.4+/-1.5 mmHg, n=7; NS, 61.4+/-2.7 mmHg, n=7). In the HS group, the mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced by BQ-123 (5 mg/kg) to 61.9+/-1.8 mmHg (n=7), by BQ-788 (1 mg/kg) to 58.8+/-2.6 mmHg (n=6), by losartan (10 mg/kg) to 73.2+/-1.7 mmHg (n=8) and by captopril (3 mg/kg) to 86.0+/-2.3 mmHg (n=8). The expression studied by RT-PCR did not show any difference (either in precursors or receptors expression) between hypertensive and normal mice. The four antagonists used seemed to reverse the hypertension. These results suggest that ET-1 and angiotensin-II are probably involved in the mechanism that leads to hypertension since the effect of these hormones is probably not compensated by kinins in B(2)KO mice. Further studies are necessary to understand the implication of the cross-talk between these hormones in the hypertensive state.", 
    "685": "Continuous intra-arterial administration of a selective endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitor CGS 35066 at a dose of 30 mg/kg decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in conscious unrestrained normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). At that dose, the magnitude of the antihypertensive effects was greater in SHRs than in normotensive rats. Additional administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazapril (lotensin) further reduced MABP in normotensive rats and completely blocked hypertension in SHRs. However, when the selective ECE inhibitor was subsequently removed, blood pressure was less inhibited in normotenive rats whereas it remained strongly inhibited in SHRs by the ACE inhibitor alone. These results imply that simultaneous treatment with benazepril and CGS 35066 gave additive antihypertensive effects in normotensive rats but not in SHRs, when both compounds were administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Our results suggest that: (i) the endothelin (ET) system together with the renin-angiotensin system contribute to the maintenance of blood pressure in normal healthy rats; (ii) while an ECE inhibitor acts as an antihypertensive agent on its own, the sole efficacy of ACE inhibitor at that dose is sufficient to block MABP without the participation of the ET system in SHR.", 
    "686": "It was recently demonstrated that angiotensin II (AngII) concentrations in the renal interstitial fluid (RIF) of anesthetized rats were in the nanomolar range and were not reduced by intra-arterial infusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalaprilat). This study was performed to determine changes in RIF AngI and AngII concentrations during interstitial administration of ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat and perindoprilat). Studies were also performed to determine the effects of enalaprilat on the de novo formation of RIF AngII elicited by interstitial infusion of AngI. Microdialysis probes (cut-off point, 30,000 D) were implanted in the renal cortex of anesthetized rats and were perfused at 2 micro l/min. The effluent dialysate concentrations of AngI and AngII were measured by RIA, and reported values were corrected for the equilibrium rates at this perfusion rate. Basal RIF AngI (0.74 +/- 0.05 nM) and AngII (3.30 +/- 0.17 nM) concentrations were much higher than plasma AngI and AngII concentrations (0.15 +/- 0.01 and 0.14 +/- 0.01 nM, respectively; n = 27). Interstitial infusion of enalaprilat through the microdialysis probe (1 or 10 mM in the perfusate; n = 5 and 8, respectively) significantly increased RIF AngI concentrations but did not significantly alter AngII concentrations. However, perindoprilat (10 mM in the perfusate, n = 7) significantly decreased RIF AngII concentrations by 22 +/- 4% and increased RIF AngI concentrations. Interstitial infusion of AngI (100 nM in the perfusate, n = 7) significantly increased the RIF AngII concentration to 8.26 +/- 0.75 nM, whereas plasma AngI and AngII levels were not affected (0.15 +/- 0.02 and 0.14 +/- 0.02 nM, respectively). Addition of enalaprilat to the perfusate (10 mM) prevented the conversion of exogenously added AngI. These results indicate that addition of AngI in the interstitial compartment leads to low but significant conversion to AngII via ACE activity (blocked by enalaprilat). However, the addition of ACE inhibitors directly into the renal interstitium, via the microdialysis probe, either did not reduce RIF AngII levels or reduced levels by a small fraction of the total basal level, suggesting that much of the RIF AngII is formed at sites not readily accessible to ACE inhibition or is formed via non-ACE-dependent pathways.",

    "689": "The aerobic exercise capacity (primary end-point) was significantly higher during the 5mg per day dosage compared to the 20 mg (1696 vs 1578 ml.min(-1), P=0.016), equivalent to a rise of 1.53 ml.kg(-1)min(-1) from the 19.6 ml.kg(-1)min(-1) with 20mg when normalized by body weight. Seventy-three percent of patients showed greater peak oxygen consumption and peak cardiac power output with the 5mg per day dose than the 20 mg, and none showed the opposite. In terms of cardiac performance, although the results were not statistically significant, there was a consistent pattern showing the same directional changes in favour of the lower dose in peak exercise cardiac power output and cardiac power output at maximal dobutamine. There were no significant differences in the resting values. A total of 24 adverse reactions were reported during the 5 mg phase compared to 38 during the 20 mg phase.",

The thermogram of the conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method was also compared. The results show new evidence of IR peaks at 3250 cm(-1) (the broad O-H stretching mode of water), and at 1738 and 1672 cm(-1) (the carbonyl band of DKP), indicating DKP formation in enalapril maleate via intramolecular cyclization. Moreover, the disappearance of IR peaks from enalapril maleate at 3215 cm(-1) (the secondary amine), 1728 cm(-1) (the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid), and 1649 cm(-1) (the carbonyl stretching of tertiary amide) also confirmed the DKP formation. The thermal FT-IR microscopic system clearly evidenced that the DKP formation in enalapril maleate started from 129 degrees C, and reached a maximum at 137 degrees C. This result was also confirmed by the conventional DSC thermogram of the compressed mixture of KBr powder and enalapril maleate, in which an endothermic peak at 144 degrees C with an extrapolated onset temperature at 137 degrees C was observed. This strongly suggests that the thermal FT-IR microscopic system was able to qualitatively detect the formation of DKP derivatives in solid-state enalapril maleate via intramolecular cyclization.", 
    "692": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be accompanied by a number of adverse events, including cough, angioedema, and hyperkalemia, as well as a peculiar form of functional renal insufficiency. Other, less obvious side effects accompany ACE inhibitor use, such as a reduction in red blood cell production. This feature of ACE inhibitor use may be employed to good effect, as in the management of post-transplant erythrocytosis. Alternatively, the suppressive effect of ACE inhibitors on red blood cell production may intensify the anemia of chronic renal failure and/or congestive heart failure. The untreated congestive heart failure patient typically has an increased red blood cell mass as a consequence of increased erythropoietin levels, with the latter governed by congestive heart failure-related renal hypoxia. This is not expressed as an increase in hemoglobin concentration because of the increase in plasma volume that marks advanced congestive heart failure. ACE inhibitor therapy can be expected to both reduce plasma volume and decrease red blood cell production. As a result, the hemoglobin concentration changes very little in the ACE inhibitor-treated congestive heart failure patient and usually falls in the low normal range. Recently, erythropoietin has been employed to good effect in congestive heart failure patients with borderline anemia. (c)2000 by CHF, Inc.",

These agents are widely and concomitantly used, and they share mechanisms that may interact in negative or positive pathways. Data derived from in vitro preparations, animal studies, human studies, and case-control studies are inconsistent. No study has established firm evidence regarding the safety or adverse effect of aspirin on patients who are on ACE inhibitors. The efficacy and safety of aspirin in combination with ACE inhibitors has been questioned and debated. If a negative interaction does exist, it will affect daily practice in treating patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure.

Beta adrenergic receptor-blocker therapy modifies these deleterious effects. Beta blockers have been shown to improve myocardial function and survival when used in conjunction with conventional treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and digoxin. Beta blocker therapy in mild-to-moderate heart failure should not be delayed because it causes some reversal of both neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms and the deleterious myocardial remodeling process.

In hypertensive patients in whom regression of LVH is achieved, systolic function also improves in the long term, at least when the therapeutic drug used is an ACE inhibitor. That the return to pretreatment blood pressures which occurs upon sudden withdrawal of medication is not accompanied by similar deterioration of ventricular function suggests regression of histological remodeling (i.e., not only a reduction in myocyte and interstitial volume, but also the amelioration of endothelial dysfunction and structural alterations in coronary microcirculation).", 
    "696": "The renin angiotensin aldosterone (RAA) axis is a common target for pharmacologic intervention in the treatment of hypertension, renal disease, and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). ACE inhibitors have increasingly been used in an effort to disable this neurohumoral system. Despite the almost elegant logic of this therapeutic approach it has not always proven uniformly successful. The fairly diverse response to ACE inhibitor therapy in CHF has been ascribed to a number of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations and most recently to a genetic polymorphism for ACE. The presence of a DD insertion/deletion pattern for ACE seems to predict an increased level of ACE, possibly increased angiotensin II concentrations, and a relative resistance to the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. The frequency of the particular insertion/deletion pattern in CHF is not known. Whether the particular insertion/deletion pattern of a patient will determine whether a patient receives angiotensin receptor antagonist therapy rather than ACE inhibitor treatment remains to be determined.

    "697": "Regulation of vascular tone by the endothelium is abnormal in patients with heart failure and contributes to the characteristic peripheral vasoconstriction and increased afterload. This endothelial dysfunction is mediated through several endothelium-derived factors, including nitric oxide; there is an important interplay between the endothelium and the renin angiotensin system. The benefits of ACE inhibition in heart failure relate, in part, to a reduction in ischemic events which may be mediated by improvements in endothelial function and the endothelium derived fibrinolytic parameters: tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In addition to potential improvements in the regulation of vasomotion, ACE inhibitor therapy may increase bradykinin induced t-PA release and/or reduce angiotensin II mediated PAI-1 release. Recent evidence suggests that both angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonism and ACE inhibition improve basal fibrinolytic parameters in patients with heart failure which may facilitate the acute endogenous fibrinolytic response. 1999 by CHF, Inc.",

The new perspectives concern drug therapy and non-pharmacological strategies, such as cardioverter-defibrillators, biventricular resynchronization and implantable assist devices. Trials on beta-blockers extended the indication to patients with advanced heart failure, but the choice of the \"best\" beta-blocker to use remains an unsolved issue. Moreover, the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is a recent acquisition. However, the Val-HeFT results underscored that the add-on hypothesis of a more complete inhibition obtained with the combination of multiple agents was not confirmed in patients already taking ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers. Regarding the new neurohormonal modulators (omapatrilat, etanercept, endothelin receptor blockers, arginine-vasopressin antagonists), more data are needed before using them in clinical practice. After the publication of the MADIT-II results, the cardioverter-defibrillator implantation will probably spread in patients with previous myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction to prevent sudden death, but the cost-effectiveness ratio is still to be clarified. In the advanced or end-stage heart failure, when the improvement of quality of life represents the main target of therapy, ventricular resynchronization and implantable assist devices may play a role in clinical settings. Before considering them like a real therapeutic option, final results from ongoing investigations should be awaited.",

Other angiotensin-receptor blockers do not alter renal handling of uric acid. The uricosuria, which accompanies losartan administration, has not been associated with adverse renal consequences, in part, because of the increase in urinary pH that follows its administration.",

Likewise, the correction of hyperuricemia is often accomplished by increasing its renal excretion. A number of medications, by way of varying mechanisms, can alter renal urate handling and thereby influence serum uric acid values. Most recently, the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan has been shown to reduce serum uric acid. The mechanism of this process relates to losartan alone and does not involve the E-3174 metabolite of this compound. This probenecid-like effect of losartan occurs shortly after drug administration, and is both transient and dose-dependent. This property of losartan, touted by some as a meaningful pharmacological distinction among the angiotensin-receptor blockers, remains to be proved, since, to date, the hypothesis that a reduction in serum uric acid alters the natural history of cardiovascular disease has not been formally tested.",

We have previously reported that activation of intra-renal renin-angiotensin system was a major contributing factor for renal injury in chronically NOS-inhibited rats. Massive interstitial infiltration of monocytes/macrophages (M/M) was characteristically seen in this model. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of chemokines, RANTES and MCP-1, in promoting M/M recruitment into the renal cortex. The number of infiltrating ED-1-positive cells was examined in association with the level of expression of RANTES and MCP1 mRNAs in the renal cortex of rats treated orally for 12 weeks with L-NAME. Compared to controls rats, the number of infiltrating ED-1-positive cells was significantly higher in L-NAME-treated rats. The mRNA expressions of both RANTES and MCP-1 were significantly higher in L-NAME-treated rats than the control. In L-NAME-treated rats, the high number of ED-1-positive cells and increased expression of both RANTES and MCP-1 were suppressed by ACE inhibitor, but not by hydralazine. In contrast, neither ED-1 counts nor RANTES mRNA expression were affected by angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest the likely involvement of RANTES and MCP-1 in the recruitment of M/M into the renal cortex of rats with chronic NOS inhibition. Furthermore, it is also indicated that Ang II stimulates MCP-1 expression via Ang II type 1 receptor, whereas RANTES expression is mediated via Ang II type 2 receptor.",

    "716": "Omapatrilat reduces the risk of death and hospitalization in chronic heart failure but was not more effective than ACE inhibition alone in reducing the risk of a primary clinical event. Between-group differences in favor of omapatrilat observed in secondary and post hoc analyses warrant further study.", 
    "717": "The role of aldosterone in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF) has long been recognized. The recent RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial demonstrated early reduction in morbidity and mortality using spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and loop diuretic, in patients with heart failure. This effect of spironolactone highlighted the importance of understanding the contributions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the progression of CHF, and increased interest in the use of aldosterone antagonists. While ACE inhibitors have had the largest impact on adverse events in CHF, numerous studies have shown that these drugs fail to completely suppress aldosterone. Blocking the effects of residual aldosterone has now been demonstrated to affect prognosis in these patients. This review will discuss the role of aldosterone in the pathophysiology of CHF, with an emphasis on both known and potential therapeutic benefits of aldosterone antagonism.", 
    "718": "After a change in Quebec's policy on drug coverage in August 1996, elderly patients' copayments for prescription drugs increased. We assessed the impact of this drug policy reform on prescribing patterns for essential cardiac medications, utilization of medical care and related health outcomes after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "719": "Patients at least 65 years of age who experienced acute myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1998 were identified through the Quebec discharge summary database. Drug claims databases were analyzed to determine rates of prescription of essential cardiac medications for cohorts of patients admitted before and after the policy reform. The impact on readmissions for cardiac-related complications, outpatient visits to physicians and emergency departments, and mortality rate was also assessed.", 
    "720": "The proportion of patients who received prescriptions for beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering drugs increased over time and, more specifically, did not appear to decline with the change in the drug policy. In addition, the policy reform did not appear to affect persistence of drug therapy (the proportion of time for which patients were covered by prescriptions over the year after discharge). There was no within-class shift from more to less expensive drugs. Use of cardiac procedures increased over time, but this increase was unrelated to the date of the policy reform. Finally, rates of readmission for complications, visits to individual physicians and to emergency departments, and mortality rate were unchanged. The findings did not vary with sex or socioeconomic status.",

    "722": "Visceral angioedema is a rare complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use. To date, 15 cases have been reported in the literature. Common presentation is that of a middle-aged woman with abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea who has recently begun taking an ACE inhibitor. Signs include leukocytosis, ascites, and edematous small bowel seen on computed tomography. Diagnosis is elusive, and frequently invasive procedures, including surgery, are pursued. These can be avoided if the astute physician recognizes the association and withdraws the offending medication. We present the typical diagnostic dilemma faced in the evaluation of a patient with ACE inhibitor angioedema of the intestine, and review the current available literature.", 
    "723": "Studies analyzing the biochemical and hemodynamic consequences of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene on angiotensin I and bradykinin metabolism have provided divergent results. Twelve DD and 12 II normotensive subjects were infused for 15 min with angiotensin I (30 ng kg(-1) x min(-1)) and with another angiotensin I converting enzyme substrate not related to the renin-angiotensin system, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP; 1.12 micro g kg(-1) x min(-1)), in the presence and absence of captopril. The infusion of the two peptides was repeated 15 days apart. In both the presence and the absence of captopril we found that DD and II subjects did not significantly differ in terms of endogenous plasma AcSDKP, angiotensin I, or angiotensin II concentrations, and that conversion of exogenous angiotensin I to angiotensin II was not faster in the DD subjects. Exogenously infused AcSDKP was metabolized slightly more rapidly in DD than in II subjects only when angiotensin I converting enzyme was not inhibited. The within-subject variability for angiotensin measurements was high, in contrast to AcSDKP measurements. This variability may account for the divergent results reported to date in the biochemical consequences of the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene. In conclusion, the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene has no effect on either endogenous AcSDKP metabolism or on the circulating renin-angiotensin system. It slightly affects the metabolism of exogenously infused AcSDKP and not that of angiotensin I.", 
    "724": "It has been proposed that fetal adaptations to intrauterine nutrient deprivation permanently reprogram the cardiovascular system. We investigated the impact of restricted periconceptional nutrition and/or restricted gestational nutrition on fetal arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, rate pressure product, and the fetal BP responses to ANG II and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril during late gestation. Restricted periconceptional nutrition resulted in an increase in fetal mean arterial BP between 115 and 125 days gestation (restricted 41.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg, n = 12; control 38.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg, n = 13) and between 135 and 147 days gestation (restricted 50.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg, n = 8; control 42.5 +/- 1.9 mmHg, n = 10) as well as an increase in the rate pressure product in twin, but not singleton, fetuses between 115 and 147 days gestation. Mean BP and fetal plasma ACTH were also positively correlated in twin, but not singleton, fetuses. This is the first demonstration that maternal undernutrition during the periconceptional period results in an increase in fetal arterial BP. This increase occurs concomitantly with an increase in fetal ACTH but is not dependent on activation of the fetal renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "725": "It is well known that nonselective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit renal renin production. Our previous studies indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-mediated renin increases were absent in rats treated with a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitor and in COX-2 -/- mice. The current study examined further whether COX-1 is also involved in mediating ACEI-induced renin production. Because renin increases are mediated by cAMP, we also examined whether increased renin is mediated by the prostaglandin E(2) receptor EP(2) subtype, which is coupled to G(s) and increases cAMP. Therefore, we investigated if genetic deletion of COX-1 or EP(2) prevents increased ACEI-induced renin expression. Age- and gender-matched wild-type (+/+) and homozygous null mice (-/-) were administered captopril for 7 days, and plasma and renal renin levels and renal renin mRNA expression were measured. There were no significant differences in the basal level of renal renin activity from plasma or renal tissue in COX-1 +/+ and -/- mice. Captopril administration increased renin equally [plasma renin activity (PRA): +/+ 9.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 50.1 +/- 10.9; -/- 13.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 43.9 +/- 6.6 ng ANG I x ml(-1) x h(-1); renal renin concentration: +/+ 11.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 35.3 +/- 3.9; -/- 13.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 27.8 +/- 2.7 ng ANG I x mg protein(-1) x h(-1); n = 6; P < 0.05 with or without captopril]. ACEI also increased renin mRNA expression (+/+ 2.4 +/- 0.2; -/- 2.1 +/- 0.2 fold control; n = 6-10; P < 0.05). Captopril led to similar increases in EP(2) -/- compared with +/+. The COX-2 inhibitor SC-58236 blocked ACEI-induced elevation in renal renin concentration in EP(2) null mice (+/+ 24.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.4; -/- 21.1 +/- 3.2 vs. 9.3 +/- 0.4 ng ANG I x mg protein(-1) x h(-1); n = 5) as well as in COX-1 -/- mice (SC-58236-treated PRA: +/+ 7.3 +/- 0.6; -/- 8.0 +/- 0.9 ng ANG I x ml(-1) x h(-1); renal renin: +/+ 9.1 +/- 0.9; -/- 9.6 +/- 0.5 ng ANG I x mg protein(-1) x h(-1); n = 6-7; P < 0.05 compared with no treatment). Immunohistochemical analysis of renin expression confirmed the above results. This study provides definitive evidence that metabolites of COX-2 rather than COX-1 mediate ACEI-induced renin increases. The persistent response in EP(2) nulls suggests involvement of prostaglandin E(2) receptor subtype 4 and/or prostacyclin receptor (IP).", 
    "726": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors and reduce the pressor effects of angiotensin in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure (BP). However, AT1 antagonists differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, which is related to bradykinin activation. Within the class of angiotensin II antagonists, eprosartan differs from other currently clinically available agents in terms of its chemical structure and its dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts not only at vascular AT1 receptors but also at presynaptic AT1 receptors, causing inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Eprosartan is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and therefore has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions, which may be of importance when treating the elderly and patients on multiple drugs. In clinical trials eprosartan has proven to be at least as effective as the ACE inhibitor enalapril in reducing BP, but with a significantly lower incidence of side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well tolerated in long-term treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "727": "Chronic proteinuric nephropathies may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) through a series of events relatively independent of the initial insult that causes parenchymal damage when the injury involves a critical number of nephrons. The key event is enhanced glomerular capillary pressure, which, among other effects, impairs glomerular permeability to proteins, which reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. In this pathological process angiotensin II has a central role. Reabsorption of filtered proteins contributes to the interstitial injury by activating intracellular events, including upregulation of vasoactive and inflammatory genes. Both interstitial inflammation and progression of disease can be limited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that strengthen the glomerular permeability barrier to proteins, thus limiting proteinuria and filtered protein-dependent inflammatory signals. Clinical evidence suggests that remission is now achievable in some patients with chronic nephropathies. The current lag time between starting treatment and remission, however, is such that a substantial proportion of patients still progress to ESRD before their renal function begins to stabilize. A multimodal approach aimed at reducing or abolishing all the risk factors for progression may shorten the time to remission for the majority of patients with proteinuric nephropathies.", 
    "728": "Early intervention studies have challenged the notion that lowering blood pressure is beneficial in women with mild hypertension. In contrast, results of more recent trials have clearly shown that treatment of hypertension is of benefit in women, particularly in elderly women. Aggressive treatment of hypertension is advisable in this subset of the population that is exposed to a greater risk of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases because of the greater prevalence of hypertension and of its inadequate treatment. Hypertensive women are preferentially treated with diuretics but the rationale for this therapeutic selection is unclear. Calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert an antihypertensive action similar to that of diuretics, but their use is limited by the adverse effects that are more frequent in women than in men. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, being effective in lowering blood pressure and particularly well tolerated, may represent, in the future, the first-line drugs for treating hypertension in women.", 
    "729": "The importance of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent from blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors, is widely recognized. Women have a lower prevalence of LVH than men for any given level of blood pressure. The occurrence of LVH increases progressively with older age and LVH becomes more common in women after menopause. Available data indicate that both hypertension and LVH are stronger risk factors for stroke and for heart failure in women than in men. Women are more likely to maintain a better left ventricular systolic function than men with similar heart failure symptoms, and heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction is more common in women than in men. Few studies have demonstrated that patients who fail to achieve a reduction of LVH are much more likely to suffer cardiovascular events than those in whom the left ventricular mass is reduced by antihypertensive treatment. Reversal of LVH therefore represents a major goal in the treatment of hypertensive patients. The degree of cardiac hypertrophy reduction is influenced by baseline severity of LVH, by the duration of treatment and by the degree of 24-h blood pressure control. In addition, beyond the control of blood pressure, different classes of antihypertensive drugs may differently interfere with several non-hemodynamic stimuli, and therefore have a different effect on left ventricular mass. Data regarding the effect of antihypertensive therapy on LVH in women are not adequate. Few studies have suggested a possible additive effect of estrogen replacement therapy on left ventricular mass changes in hypertensive postmenopausal women. Many of the major heart failure intervention trials did not include women or had only a small proportion of female patients. In the SAVE, AIRE, TRACE and SOLVD trials, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors resulted in similar benefit to women and in men. In studies evaluating the effect of beta-blocker treatment in patients with heart failure, the benefit was statistically significant in men but not in women. Results from further multicenter ongoing trials are awaited to definitely evaluate whether regression of LVH carries a similar benefit in women and men, and whether different therapeutic strategies may be applied to women to regress LVH and to prevent the progression to heart failure.", 
    "730": "In vitro studies have shown that telmisartan is an insurmountable angiotensin II subtype-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. Herein, the molecular basis of this insurmountable antagonism has been investigated in vitro, and the effect of telmisartan has been compared in vivo with that of irbesartan and candesartan. Association and dissociation kinetics of telmisartan to AT1 receptors have been characterized in vitro on rat vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMC) expressing solely the AT1 receptor subtype. In a second set of experiments, the antagonistic efficacy of single intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg) of telmisartan was compared with that of irbesartan (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) and candesartan (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) in conscious, normotensive, male Wistar rats. The results show that the specific binding of [(3)H]telmisartan to the surface of living RVSMC is saturable and increases quickly to reach equilibrium within 1 h. Telmisartan dissociates very slowly from the receptor with a dissociation half-life (t(1/2)) of 75 min, which is comparable with candesartan and almost 5 times slower than angiotensin II (AngII). In vivo, telmisartan blunts the blood pressure response to exogenous AngII dose dependently. The blockade is long lasting and remains significant at 24 h at doses >0.1 mg/kg. Ex vivo assessment of the AT1 receptor blockade using an in vitro AngII receptor binding assay shows similar results. When administered intravenously in rats, telmisartan is 10-fold more potent than irbesartan and comparable to candesartan. Taken together, our in vitro data show that the insurmountable antagonism of telmisartan is due at least in part to its very slow dissociation from AT1 receptors.", 
    "731": "The role of angiotensin IV (AngIV) in the regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was studied in vitro. This study demonstrates that this active fragment appeared as a novel endogenous ACE inhibitor. Inhibitory kinetic studies revealed that AngIV acts as a purely competitive inhibitor with a K(i) value of 35 microM. AngIV was found to be quite resistant to ACE hydrolysis opposite to hemorphins which are both ACE inhibitors and substrates. In order to confirm a putative role of AngIV and hemorphins in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) regulation, we studied their influence on AngI conversion. We noticed that 16.7 microM of both peptides decreased more than 50% of AngI conversion to AngII in vitro. The capacity of hemorphins, particularly LVVH-7, and AngIV to inhibit ACE activity here suggests a synergistic relation between these two peptides and the regulation of RAS.", 
    "732": "The interaction between angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) and bradykinin (BK) was determined in the mesentery of anesthetized Wistar alloxan-diabetic and non-diabetic rats using intravital microscopy. Impaired BK vasodilation observed in arterioles of diabetic rats was restored by acute and chronic insulin treatment as well as by enalapril. Though capable of potentiating BK in non-diabetic rats, Ang-(1-7) did not potentiate BK in diabetic rats. Chronic but not acute insulin treatment restored the potentiation, whereas enalapril did not. Potassium channel blockade (by tetraethylammonium (TEA)) but not nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition (by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-esther (L-NAME)) abolished the restorative effect of insulin. Our data allow us to suggest that the alteration observed is restored by insulin by a mechanism involving membrane hyperpolarization but not NO release. The beneficial effect of enalapril in diabetes might not involve the potentiation of BK by Ang-(1-7).", 
    "733": "When first introduced in 1981, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were indicated only for treatment of refractory hypertension. Since then, they have been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality in congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Pathologies underlying these conditions are, in part, attributable to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II contributes to endothelial dysfunction. altered renal hemodynamics, and vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors attenuate these effects. Clinical outcomes of ACE inhibition include decreases in myocardial infarction (fatal and nonfatal), reinfarction, angina, stroke, end-stage renal disease, and morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated and have few contraindications. (Am Fam Physician 2002;66:473.)",

    "737": "Recently, the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial provided sufficient data to conclude that the blockade of the All AT1 receptor with losartan confers renoprotection in patients with DM-2 and nephropathy. Similar results were obtained with irbesartan in the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and the Irbesartan in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria study (IRMA 2). The results of RENAAL indicate that the renoprotective effects of losartan were attributable to effects beyond blood pressure control. In addition to the favorable impact of the All blockade on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics, the blockade of the growth-promoting, profibrotic, nonhemodynamic actions of AII also may be important for renoprotection. Intensive blood pressure control also confers cardiovascular protection in pa- tients with DM-2. Some studies suggest that the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system confers superior cardioprotective effects in patients with DM-2. The RENAAL study also showed cardioprotection with losartan, with an important reduction in the risk for first hospitalization for heart failure.",

The examination of the patients consisted of 24-h arterial pressure (AP) monitoring, Holter ECG monitoring, cardiointervalography. For eight weeks 19 patients received enalapril (5-20 mg/day), 14 patients were given felodipin (5-10 mg/day) and 15 patients were treated with valsartan (80-160 mg/day). Enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertensive subjects with NIDDM raises daily average values of systolic and diastolic AP, variability and speed of AP morning rise. In NIDDM patients with moderate arterial hypertension vegetative regulation of AP was more stressed than in mild hypertension. Optimal medication of NIDDM patients' arterial hypertension may consist of ACE inhibitors and antagonists of angiotensin II receptors. These drug lower stress of the sympathetic nervous system and thus promote normalization of daily profile of AP.",

Rats were studied before (C), at 1 wk (1w) or 2 wk (2w) of pregnancy, and at 4 days after giving birth (-4d). Left ventricular endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. Oxygen consumption of left ventricular tissue samples was measured in vitro in response to increasing doses of bradykinin with or without addition of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Echocardiography indicated an increased cardiac output during pregnancy. Myocardial eNOS protein expression significantly increased by 46 +/- 9 and 39 +/- 8% at 1w and 2w, respectively, and returned to control levels at -4d.

Cardiovascular diseases, especially malignant hypertension syndrome with development of left ventricular insufficiency, are leading among the causes of late deaths of postdialysis patients. We studied hemodynamics in 18 children with terminal chronic renal failure running with marked arterial hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. We have found that high blood pressure was initially caused by hyperhydration and hypernatriemia. After hemodialysis, children with KT/V > 1 developed hypertension due to hyperkinetic hemodynamics. Establishment of \"dry weight\" of the child on programmed dialysis was followed by renin-dependent arterial hypertension which was treated by inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium antagonists, in one case by nephrectomy. In hemodialysis regimen KT/V < 1, dry weight was not achieved and hyperhydration-caused hypertension remained. Moderate arterial hypertension due to cukinetic hemodynamics was achieved only after 4 weeks of hemodialysis in administration of calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and central sympatholytics.",

Hypertension treatment must be considered as a secondary prevention approach with a blood pressure normalisation as a target.

    "747": "Imidapril hydrochloride (imidapril) is a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has been used clinically in the treatment of hypertension, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and diabetic nephropathy. It has the unique advantage over other ACE inhibitors in causing a lower incidence of dry cough. After oral administration, imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its active metabolite imidaprilat. The plasma levels of imidaprilat gradually increase in proportion to the dose, and decline slowly. The time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) is 2.0 h for imidapril and 9.3 h for imidaprilat. The elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is 1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted chiefly in the urine. As an ACE inhibitor, imidaprilat is as potent as enalaprilat, an active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as potent as captopril. In patients with hypertension, blood pressure was still decreased at 24 h after imidapril administration. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was dose-dependent. The maximal reduction of blood pressure and plasma ACE was achieved with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additional effect was not prominent with higher doses. When administered to patients with AMI, imidapril improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. In patients with mild-to-moderate CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III], imidapril increased exercise time and physical working capacity and decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP levels in a dose-related manner. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, imidapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly, imidapril improved asymptomatic dysphagia in patients with a history of stroke. In the same patients it increased serum substance P levels, while the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan was ineffective. These studies indicate that imidapril is a versatile ACE inhibitor. In addition to its effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI, imidapril has beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good tissue penetration and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contributes to its effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. The major advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases and lower incidence of cough compared with some of the older ACE inhibitors.", 
    "748": "Galantamine hydrobromide is a tertiary alkaloid drug that has been developed and approved in a number of countries including the USA and several countries in Europe as a treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Galantamine has a unique, dual mode of action. It is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and is the only drug actively marketed for the treatment of AD with proven activity as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This latter activity is thought to be particularly important since decreases in the expression and activity of nAChRs make a large contribution to the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in patients with AD. Galantamine exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics including predictable linear elimination kinetics at the recommended maintenance doses (16 and 24 mg/day), a relatively short half-life (approximately 7 h) and high bioavailability. It is extensively metabolized in numerous pathways, mainly in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and has a low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions. During four large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months duration, galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day significantly benefited cognitive and global function, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and behavior, relative to placebo and baseline, for up to 6 months. Caregiver burden (time spent by caregivers supervising patients or assisting them with ADL), and caregiver distress (related to patients' behavioral symptoms) were also reduced. Cognitive and functional abilities were preserved at or near baseline for at least 12 months in patients who received galantamine 24 mg/day for 12 months in a long-term US study. These benefits were maximized by early and continued galantamine treatment and, again, were associated with significant reductions in caregiver burden. Trials of the efficacy of galantamine in dementia related to cerebrovascular disease have also yielded positive results. There are no safety concerns associated with the use of galantamine. The incidence of adverse events, particularly cholinergically mediated events affecting the gastrointestinal system, is generally low and can be minimized using the recommended slow dose-escalation scheme. Galantamine may, therefore, help to reduce the overall burden and cost involved in caring for dementia patients. Taking all evidence into account, galantamine has the potential to become a first-line therapy for dementia.",

Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to determine the associations between LVSF and both 4-year mortality rates and 6-month readmission rates and the associations between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use and 4-year mortality rates, separately, in patients with preserved and impaired LVSF.", 
    "751": "Of the 438 patients, 200 (46%) had preserved LVSF. Women were more likely to have preserved LVSF (odds ratio [OR] = 2.44, 95% CI 1.57-3.81) than men. Preserved LVSF was associated with lower 4-year mortality rates (adjusted hazards ratio [HR] = 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.86) but not with 6-month readmission rates (adjusted HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.41-1.09). The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with lower 4-year mortality rates in patients with impaired LVSF (adjusted HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86) but not in those with preserved LVSF (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.42).", 
    "752": "Among older adults hospitalized with HF, preserved LVSF was common among women and was associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates, which were unaffected by treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "753": "Endothelial dysfunction ensuing inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats given N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in drinking water for 8 weeks. Age-matched rats served as controls. L-NAME-treated rats, as compared to control animals, showed: (1) a clear-cut increase in systolic blood pressure; (2) a consistent decrease of endothelial-cell NOS (eNOS) gene expression in aortic tissue; (3) a reduction of the relaxant activity of acetylcholine (ACh, from 10(-10) to 10(-4) M) on norepinephrine-precontracted aortic rings (reduction by 52+/-5%); (4) a marked decrease (-50%) of the basal release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1 alpha) (6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)) from aortic rings. In L-NAME-treated rats, administration in the last 2 weeks of either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (1 mg/kg/day) or the cognate drug quinapril (1 mg/kg/day) decreased systolic blood pressure levels, completely restored eNOS mRNA levels in aortic tissue, and allowed a consistent recovery of both the relaxant activity of ACh and the generation of 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha). No difference was present in the ability of the two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to reverse NAME-induced endothelial dysfunction. These findings indicate that L-NAME-induced hypertension in the rat relies on the marked impairment of the endothelial vasodilator function, with an ensuing contribution by a decreased production of prostacyclin by the endothelial cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by enalapril or quinapril was equally effective in improving endothelial vasodilator function, prostacyclin endothelial production and restoring aortic eNOS mRNA.", 
    "754": "Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in the plant kingdom, inhibits various enzymes. This study examined its inhibitory effect on the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity through the cardiovascular response to bradykinin and angiotensin I. Quercetin pre-treatment (88.7 micromol/kg p.o., 45 min; 14.7 micromol/kg i.v., 5 min) significantly potentiated the hypotensive effect of bradykinin (10 nmol/kg i.v.). This association was significantly attenuated by an antagonist of the B2 receptor. In addition, the hypertensive response to angiotensin I (0.1 nmol/kg i.v.) was significantly reduced by quercetin pretreatment using the same parameters as before. These results suggest an inhibitory effect of quercetin on the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, similar to that of captopril. Quercetin was equally effective when given orally or intravenously.", 
    "755": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers improve prognosis inpatients with chronic heart failure. Some patients, however, show little response to combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker. In addition, the ACE inhibitor cannot completely suppress angiotensin II production. Our objective was to examine whether replacing the ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II antagonist can improve the condition of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "756": "In 11 patients with chronic heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker, who have had severe left ventricular dysfunction or high plasma level of natriuretic peptides, left ventricular dimension, and fractional shortening, plasma atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP) levels were determined before and 3 months after the change of treatment.",

    "760": "Dose-ranging of antihypertensive agents have been done to optimize diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduction, but with little information on systolic (SBP), mean (MBP), or pulse (PP) pressures. A low-dose combination of perindopril (Per) and indapamide (Ind) has been shown to reduce more SBP than atenolol for the same DBP reduction. However, the possible influence of gender on this finding has never been tested.", 
    "761": "A database of five randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging studies was established to determine the optimal dose of the Per/Ind combination in hypertensive men and women. A total of 2907 patients were treated by either placebo or various combinations associating Per (2, 4, 8 mg) and Ind (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 mg).", 
    "762": "In the overall population, there was a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.001) for doubling the dose of Per 2/Ind 0.625 mg up to Per 8/Ind 2.5 mg with a progressive fall in SBP, DBP, MBP. When men and women were analyzed by dose, SBP, DBP and MBP (but not PP) decreased significantly more in women than in men until the Per 4/Ind 1.25 dosage was reached. Thereafter, with higher dosages, generating a slight but significant hypokalemia, the finding was reversed, resulting in a gender interaction in the overall population.", 
    "763": "In hypertensive subjects, the low-dose combinations Per 2/Ind 0.625 and Per 4/Ind 1.25 are the most effective in reducing blood pressure and avoiding hypokalemia. This effect is more pronounced in women, in which increased SBP and PP are predominant hemodynamic features.",

    "765": "Twenty-two patients with DCM underwent DOB-GBP to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest, and during 5, 10, and 15 microg/kg/min of dobutamine infusion before therapy. Examinations were performed before and after 1 year of therapy. The heart/mediastinum count (H/M) ratio and total defect score (TDS) were determined for 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine images from anterior planar image and single-photon emission CT images. LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) were determined by echocardiography. After 1 year of treatment, the echocardiographic LVEF improved > 5% in 11 patients (group A), but did not improve in the remaining 11 patients (group B). Before treatment, TDS, H/M, LVEF, and LVDd were similar in both groups. However, there was a greater increase in the LVEF during dobutamine infusion in group A than in group B (21 +/- 8% vs 9 +/- 3%, p < 0.001). If a critical value of 15% for the DeltaLVEF was used to predict the improvement in LVEF after treatment, the sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 82%. The TDS, H/M ratio, LVDd, and New York Heart Association functional class improved in group A to a greater extent than in group B.",

    "768": "Temocapril (an ACE inhibitor), CS-866 (an AT1 receptor antagonist), or their combination was given orally to rats, and their effects were compared on vascular hyperplasia induced by balloon injury. The maximal preventive effect of temocapril and CS-866 alone on neointimal thickening after balloon injury was obtained at a dose of 20 and 10 mg/kg per day, respectively. However, compared with either agent alone, combined temocapril and CS-866 (20 and 10 mg/kg per day, respectively) prevented intimal thickening to a larger extent. Furthermore, compared with either agent alone, combined temocapril and CS-866 prevented vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima more potently. The increase in platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosyl phosphorylation was reduced more potently by the combination of both agents compared with either agent alone. The nonpeptide bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist or the NO synthase inhibitor reduced the prevention of intimal thickening by combined temocapril and CS-866.",

Here we provide a comprehensive review of the basic medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of hydroxamic acid derivatives that have been examined as inhibitors of zinc metalloproteases, matrix metalloproteinases, leukotriene A(4) hydrolases, ureases, lipoxigenases, cyclooxygenases, as well as peptide deformilases.", 
    "771": "The study aim is to quantify the variation in prescribing rates of secondary preventative therapies for Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) across regions, age and gender. Patients receiving any prescriptions for a nitrate during a one year period (September 1999-August 2000) were considered using a national primary care prescribing database. Age-sex standardised prescribing rates of four secondary preventative therapies for IHD (Ace inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, statins) were calculated for each region. Wide variations between regions were observed with significantly higher variability for Ace inhibitors compared with aspirin (F-ratio=22.8, p<0.001). Men were more likely to prescribed these therapies and the elderly were less likely (except Ace inhibitors). The study suggests that access to secondary preventative therapy is not equitable across regions, gender and age in Ireland. The wide variability may be due to uncertainty in prescribing secondary preventative therapies and/or variability in clinical need between regions.", 
    "772": "Experiments on skinned and hybrid myocardial fibers isolated from normal dogs and animals subjected to 120-min occlusion of the anterior interventricular branch of the coronary artery showed that in contrast to cardiac glycosides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suppress contractile ability of myocardial myofibrils in a dose-independent manner within the concentration range of 10(-12)-10(-4)M. This effect is accompanied by a decrease in fiber relaxation rate most pronounced in the presence of captopril. Actin, the major protein of fine filaments is the target for b-acetyldigoxin, K-strophanthin, captopril, enalapril, and trandolapril in myocardial myofibrils. During coronary occlusion, the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme induce structural and conformational changes in actin that decrease efficiency of contraction. The data obtained cast doubt on advisability of therapeutic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the therapy of myocardial infarction, especially in its early period.",

We report a case of IgAN combined with PV. The patient was a 46-year-old male with chronic renal failure, heavy proteinuria and erythrocytosis. He also presented hypertension and hematuria as well as splenomegaly, high arterial oxygen saturation and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity. Possible causes of secondary erythrocytosis were ruled out. The renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative GN with predominant IgA deposition in mesangium. He was diagnosed as having IgAN and PV concomitantly. After administration of hydroxyurea, enalapril and felodipine, blood cell count and blood pressure normalized, while azotemia persisted. There was also a partial remission of the heavy proteinuria. We describe a case of IgAN associated with PV, and possible pathophysiologic relationships between two diseases are discussed with review of the literature.",

It is confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce urinary protein excretion (UPE) and attenuate the development of renal injury. The angiotensin II receptor blockers are an alternative class of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system activity with preliminarily confirmed renoprotective activity. However, there is lack of data concerning renoprotective action of very small doses of these drugs.",

Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were estimated before treatment (basal), during the first week and after 3 months of therapy.", 
    "776": "Both, monotherpy with losartan and enalapril significantly reduced proteinuria by 25.35 and 45.07%, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups. Combined therapy induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria (65.96%) than either of the drugs administered alone. This antiproteinuric effect was significantly more pronounced only in comparison with the losartan group (p = 0.009). Decreasing of blood pressure was most pronounced in the combined group. In all groups, no correlation between fall of UPE and reducing the systolic or diastolic blood pressure was found. Significant decline in CRCL was observed with enalapril treatment just after 1 week of therapy (p = 0.039) and at the end of observation (p = 0.043). CRCL remained stable in losartan-treated subjects. No changes in serum creatinine level, metabolic profile and sodium excretion were observed during therapy in studied groups.", 
    "777": "These results indicated that even very small doses of losartan and enalapril reduce proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. Combination of these drugs could cause significantly greater antiproteinuric effect than either of the agents in monotherapy. It is likely that the treatment with losartan, compared to enalapril, is associated with less risk of acute fall of glomerular filtration at the beginning of therapy.",

We found that the last value of the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of the observation period and the individual mean values of systolic BP, mean BP, and serum cholesterol closely correlated with the rate of decline in Ccr estimated by Cockcroft's formula. The last UAE closely correlated with the individual mean values of systolic BP and mean BP. For patients such as the present subjects, adequate retardation of decline in renal function requires that the estimated goal of antihypertensive treatment should be a BP below 130/70 mm Hg. The level of glycemic control and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors did not correlate with the rate of decline in Ccr.",

Two groups received quinaprilat (1 microg/mL), initiated either with cardioplegia (n = 7) or during reperfusion (n = 7). The third group received l-arginine (2 mmol/L) initiated with cardioplegia (n = 7). Eight hearts served as a control group.

When administered during ischemia, quinaprilat significantly improved recovery of coronary flow (70% +/- 8%, P =.028 vs quinaprilat during reperfusion [49% +/- 5%] and P =.023 vs control [48% +/- 6%]). l-Arginine (55% +/- 7%) showed no significant effect.

Afferent arteriolar diameters averaged 17.8 +/- 0.8 microm in wild-type (EP(2)+/+) mice and 16.7 +/- 0.7 microm in EP(2)-/- mice at a renal perfusion pressure of 100 mmHg. Vessels from both groups of mice responded to norepinephrine (0.5 microM) with similar 17-19% decreases in diameter. Diameters of norepinephrine-preconstricted afferent arterioles increased by 7 +/- 2 and 20 +/- 6% in EP(2)+/+ mice in response to 1 microM PGE(2) and 1 microM butaprost, respectively. In contrast, afferent arteriolar diameter of EP(2)-/- mice decreased by 13 +/- 3 and 16 +/- 6% in response to PGE(2) and butaprost. The afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction to butaprost in EP(2)-/- mice was eliminated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Sulprostone, an EP(1) and EP(3) receptor ligand, decreased afferent arteriolar diameter in both groups; however, the vasoconstriction in the EP(2)-/- mice was greater than in the EP(2)+/+ mice. Endothelin-1-mediated afferent arteriolar diameter responses were enhanced in EP(2)-/- mice. Afferent arteriolar diameter decreased by 29 +/- 7% in EP(2)-/- and 12 +/- 7% in EP(2)+/+ mice after administration of 1 nM endothelin-1. These results demonstrate that the EP(2) receptor mediates a portion of the PGE(2) afferent arteriolar vasodilation and buffers the renal vasoconstrictor responses elicited by EP(1) and EP(3) receptor activation as well as endothelin-1."
