    "1": "Previous reports have suggested that blacks receive life-saving cardioprotective therapies less often than whites, probably because of a lower socioeconomic status, which leads to poor access to physicians. We questioned whether racial disparity existed in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. We examined the Veterans' Integrated Service Network (VISN 16) database with regard to the prescription rates for 4 cardiovascular agents-aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The database, encompassing 474,565 patients (117,071 blacks and 357,494 whites), was analyzed. Cardioprotective drugs were prescribed significantly less often to black patients than compared to white patients (beta blockers 19.7% vs 24.8%, odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.75; statins 20.5% vs 30.2%, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.55; and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 27.7% vs 30.0%, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.96; all p <0.0001, after adjustment for all covariates used in the analysis). Nonetheless, the prescription rates for aspirin were greater among the black patients than among the white patients (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.35, p <0.001) after adjustment. The black patients received coronary artery bypass grafting less often than did the white patients (0.4% vs 1.21%, OR 0.40% to 0.48%, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.42, p <0.001). After adjustment for the use of cardioprotective drugs and coronary artery bypass grafting, black patients still had greater odds of developing angina (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.42, p <0.001) and acute myocardial infarction (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19, p <0.006) than did white patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans' Integrated Service Network 16 hospitals. In conclusion, the lower prescription rates of cardioprotective drugs and lower rates of coronary artery bypass grafting might be a partial basis for the high rates of cardiac morbidity among black patients.", 
    "2": "Preoperative medication by inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in coronary artery patients predisposes to vasoplegic shock early after coronary artery bypass grafting. Although in the majority of the cases this shock is mild, in some of them it appears as a situation, \"intractable\" to high-catecholamine dose medication. In this study we examined the possible role of prophylactic infusion of low-dose vasopressin, during and for the four hours post-bypass after cardiopulmonary bypass, in an effort to prevent this syndrome. In addition, we studied the influence of infused vasopressin on the hemodynamics of the patients, as well as on the postoperative urine-output and blood-loss. In our study 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were included in a blind-randomized basis. Two main criteria were used for the eligibility of patients for coronary artery bypass grafting: ejection fraction between 30-40%, and patients receiving ACE inhibitors, at least for four weeks preoperatively. The patients were randomly divided in two groups, the group A who were infused with 0.03 IU/min vasopressin and the group B who were infused with normal saline intraoperativelly and for the 4 postoperative hours. Measurements of mean artery pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), ejection fracture (EF), heart rate (HR), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac index (CI) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were performed before, during, and after the operation. The requirements of catecholamine support, the urine-output, the blood-loss, and the requirements in blood, plasma and platelets for the first 24 hours were included in the data collected. The incidence of vasodilatory shock was significantly lower (8% vs 20%) in group A and B respectively (p = 0,042). Generally, the mortality was 12%, exclusively deriving from group B. Postoperatively, significant higher values of MAP, CVP, SVR and EF were recorded in the patients of group A, compared to those of group B. In group A norepinephrine was necessary in fewer patients (p = 0.002) and with a lower mean dose (p = 0.0001), additive infusion of epinephrine was needed in fewer patients (p = 0.001), while both were infused for a significant shorter infusion-period (p = 0.0001). Vasopressin administration (for group A) was associated with a higher 24 hour diuresis) (0.0001).In conclusion, low-dose of infused vasopressin during cardiopulmonary bypass and for the next 4 hours is beneficial for its postoperative hemodynamic profile, reduces the doses of requirements of catecholamines and contributes to prevention of the postcardiotomy vasoplegic shock in the patient with low ejection fraction who is receiving ACE preoperatively.", 
    "3": "Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by morphological changes in the retina secondary to disturbances in retinal blood flow. It has been shown that antihypertensive treatment has a protective effect on the development of diabetic retinopathy, and evidence suggests that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system have a protective effect beyond the antihypertensive effect.

The aim of this study was to clarify whether ramipril was a therapeutic agent against monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 18 (IL-18), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in elderly patients with ACS. A total of 190 subjects including 72 elderly patients with ACS (78.1% male, mean age 67.12 +/- 5.06 years), 60 elderly patients with stable angina pectoris (76.9% male, mean age 68.00 +/- 4.52 years), and 58 healthy volunteers (77.8% male, mean age 65.96 +/- 4.18 years) were recruited into the study. Serum MCP-1, IL-10, and IL-18 were determined in 132 elderly patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and after treatment with low doses of ramipril (2.5-5 mg/day), and were determined in 58 healthy volunteers. The levels of serum MCP-1 and IL-18 were much higher in elderly patients with ACS than those in elderly patients with SAP and healthy volunteers. After treating with ramipril, the levels of MCP-1 and IL-18 were decreased in elderly patients with ACS. Moreover, ramipril significantly increased serum IL-10 in elderly patients with ACS. Ramipril plays an important role in elderly patients with ACS. With decreasing MCP-1 and IL-18, it can ameliorate cytokine-associated cardiac damage. This study may provide a new recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of ACS.",

    "21": "Ang I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely believed to suppress the deleterious cardiac effects of Ang II by inhibiting locally generated Ang II. However, the recent demonstration that chymase, an Ang II-forming enzyme stored in mast cell granules, is present in the heart has added uncertainty to this view. As discussed here, using microdialysis probes tethered to the heart of conscious mice, we have shown that chronic ACE inhibitor treatment did not suppress Ang II levels in the LV interstitial fluid (ISF) despite marked inhibition of ACE. However, chronic ACE inhibition caused a marked bradykinin/B2 receptor-mediated increase in LV ISF chymase activity that was not observed in mast cell-deficient KitW/KitW-v mice. In chronic ACE inhibitor-treated mast cell-sufficient littermates, chymase inhibition decreased LV ISF Ang II levels substantially, indicating the importance of mast cell chymase in regulating cardiac Ang II levels. Chymase-dependent processing of other regulatory peptides also promotes inflammation and tissue remodeling. We found that combined chymase and ACE inhibition, relative to ACE inhibition alone, improved LV function, decreased adverse cardiac remodeling, and improved survival after myocardial infarction in hamsters. These results suggest that chymase inhibitors could be a useful addition to ACE inhibitor therapy in the treatment of heart failure.",

In drug development, the focus has been on favourable multichannel-blocking profiles, atrial-specific ion-channels, and novel non-channel targets (upstream therapy). Molecular modification of the highly effective multichannel blocker, amiodarone, to improve safety and tolerability has produced promising analogues such as dronedarone, although this drug seems less effective than does amiodarone. Vernakalant, an atrial-selective drug with reduced proarrhythmic risk, might be useful for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation. Ranolazine, another atrial-selective agent initially developed as an antianginal, has efficacy for atrial fibrillation and is being tested in prospective clinical trials. So-called upstream therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-receptor inhibitors, statins, or omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil that target atrial remodelling could be effective, but need further clinical validation. We focus on the basic and clinical pharmacology of newly emerging antiarrhythmic drugs and non-traditional approaches such as upstream therapy for atrial fibrillation.",

The method showed adequate separation of perindopril and indapamide from their associated main impurities and degradation products. Separation was achieved on an XTerra RP18, 5 microm, 150 x 4.6 mm id column at 55 degrees C by using the mobile phase NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 2.0; 0.005 M)-acetonitrile (75 + 25, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and UV detection at 215 nm. Comprehensive stress testing of perindopril and indapamide was carried out according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline Q1A (R2). The specificity of the method was determined by assessing interference from the placebo and by stress testing of the drug (forced degradation). The drug was subjected to acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, oxidation, dry heat, and photolysis to apply stress conditions. There were no other coeluting, interfering peaks from excipients, impurities, or degradation products due to variable stress conditions, and the method was specific for determination of perindopril and indapamide in the presence of degradation products. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, and solution stability. The linearity of the proposed method was investigated in the range of 24-56 microg/mL (r2 = 0.9993) for perindopril and 7.5-17.5 microg/mL (r2 = 0.9992) for indapamide.

Patency of radial artery grafts was correlated to diabetes mellitus (detrimental), gender (women had higher occlusion rates), and use of angiotensin inhibiting medication (beneficial).", 
    "53": "The pre-study assumption that radial artery grafts would out-perform those of saphenous vein at mid-term is not borne out. The propensity of radial artery graft failure in diabetics and the higher patency associated with angiotensin inhibition might both relate to endothelial modulation of the muscular tone of the graft.", 
    "54": "We present the core information from the \"Reappraisal of European Guidelines on Hypertension Management\", an official document of the European Society of Hypertension updating the current guidelines of 2007 based on the new knowledge that became available over the last two years. The division of antihypertensive agents into 5 main groups remains unchanged. The key discussion is about whether the treatment of hypertension in high-risk patients should be initiated already at high normal blood pressure and whether the target value should be 130 mm Hg and less. Both objectives are just speculative at present as they have not been confirmed in a large clinical study. Thanks to the HWET study we have more evidence for the benefits of hypertension therapy in older patients. Substantial part of the document focuses on combination therapy; the most encouraged combination is an ACE inhibitor + Ca blocker, or, alternatively, an ACE inhibitor or AII antagonist + diuretic. The beta-blocker + diuretic and ACE inhibitor + AII antagonist combinations are not recommended. Statins should be included in the therapy of all patients with hypertension, antiaggregation as a secondary prevention.", 
    "55": "The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in regulating the volume and composition of extracellular fluid, blood pressure (BP) as well as onset and progression of cardiovascular and renal diseases has been studied for more than 150 years. The compounds that block the vital stages of the RAAS cascade, such as ACE-inhibitors (ACEI), AT1-receptor blockers (ARB) and aldosterone receptor antagonists, importantly extended our treatment options. However, the positive therapeutic effects of these compounds also have certain negative consequences. Administration of ACEIs and ARBs interrupts physiological feedback for renal renin release and leads to reactive elevation of circulating active renin and greater production of angiotensin I and angiotensin II with subsequent return of aldosterone secretion to the pre-treatment levels ('escape' phenomenon). These possible adverse effects of the intermediary products of incomplete RAAS blockade leading to organ complications have facilitated the efforts to develop compounds blocking the initial stages of renin-angiotensin cascade--i.e. direct renin blockers. After several years of unsuccessful attempts, the recent years have seen development of the first non-peptide, orally long-term effective renin inhibitor, aliskiren fumarate. In monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives (hydrochlorothiazide, ARB, ACEI), aliskiren reduces BP in a dose-dependent manner (75-600 mg/den). Aliskiren reduces plasma renin activity (PRA) and neutralises hydrochlorothiazide-induced RAAS activation. Once daily administration of the drug leads to longer than 24-hour activity and its prolonged blocking effects on the kidneys are the basis for its renoprotectivity. In addition to the significant antihypertensive effect, clinical studies also showed a range of organoprotective properties in patients with left ventricle hypertrophy (ALLAY study), heart failure (ALOFT study) and diabetic nephropathy (AVOID study). Similar to other AT1-blockers, aliskiren has a minimum of adverse side effects. Aliskiren for hypertension therapy was launched in clinical practice in USA in 2007 (Tekturna and combination formulation TekturnaHCl, respectively) and shortly after that in European Union as Rasilez. In the Czech Republic, aliskiren (Rasilez) was released for clinical use by diabetologists and nephrologists in patients with hypertension and concomitant diabetes, nephropathy and proteinuria in doses of 150-300 mg per day on 1. 8. 2009. It is recommended as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives to treat conditions with elevated PRA, including PRA elevation following diuretic, ACEI or ARB administration. Aliskiren might be used in patients who do not tolerate ACEIs as well as in patients in whom angiotensin II participates in the pathogenesis of their diseases. Reno-protective properties leading to a reduction in proteinuria and delaying renal failure progression were observed in patients with diabetic as well as non-diabetic nephropathy. The drug is the subject to similar precautions and contraindications as ACEIs and ARBs, i.e. pregnancy and bilateral renal artery stenosis. To make meaningful conclusions about the so far positive contribution of this new treatment class and its broad applicability for the therapy of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, it will be imperative to assess its long-term effects on morbidity and mortality as well as to compare these agents with other RAAS blockers in long-term clinical studies; this represents a research effort for another 7-8 years.", 
    "56": "The importance of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in blood pressure and electrolyte regulation has been well established. High RAS activity results in over-activation of the angiotensin AT1-receptor by its substrate, angiotensin II (AII), leading to increases in BP and direct growth-promoting effects on tissues that result in end-organ damage. The antihypertensive therapies, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) have proved to be successful treatments for hypertension, heart failure, and other related cardiovascular and renal disorders. However, these compounds do not completely inhibit the RAS as a result of AII formation by indirect pathways and compensatory feedback mechanisms, resulting in renin release. Thus renin inhibition has been identified as the preferred pharmacologic approach to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The advantages of inhibiting renin in the RAS have been recognized for almost half a century; however major advances in the development of potential clinically effective renin inhibitors have been made only in the past few years with the approval of Aliskiren for clinical use.", 
    "57": "Ac-SDKP (N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline) is a physiological tetrapeptide hydrolysed by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme). In experimental models of hypertension, Ac-SDKP has antifibrotic effects in the heart; however, the role of Ac-SDKP in diabetic cardiomyopathy is currently unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Ac-SDKP on cardiac systolic and diastolic function, and interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart of diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced in 55 Sprague-Dawley rats by streptozotocin injection. Control rats (n=18)underwent only buffer injection.Out of the 55 diabetic rats, 19 were chronically treated with insulin and 13 with the ACEI (ACE inhibitor) ramipril (3 mg x kg(-1 )of body weight x day(-1)). At 2 months after the onset of diabetes, Ac-SDKP (1 mg x kg(-1) of body weight x day(-1)) was administered by osmotic minipumps for 8 weeks to eight control rats, 13 diabetic rats, seven diabetic rats treated with ramipril and nine insulin-treated diabetic rats. Diabetic rats had a significant increase in blood glucose levels. Left ventricular interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) protein levels were increased in diabetic rats, but not in insulin-treated diabetic rats and ramipril-treated diabetic rats, compared with control rats. Ac-SDKP administration significantly reduced left ventricular interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in diabetic rats and in diabetic rats treated with ramipril. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in active TGF-beta1 and phospho-Smad2/3 protein levels in myocardial tissue of diabetic rats. Echocardiography showed that diabetes was associated with increased end-systolic diameters, and depressed global systolic function and diastolic dysfunction, as assessed by transmitral Doppler velocity profile. These changes were completely reversed by insulin or ramipril treatment. Ac-SDKP treatment partially restored diastolic function in diabetic rats. In conclusion, Ac-SDKP administration in diabetic rats reduces left ventricular interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, active TGF-beta1 and phospho-Smad2/3levels, and improves diastolic function. Taken together, these findings suggest that, by inhibiting theTGF-beta/Smad pathway, Ac-SDKP protects against the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy",

    "71": "Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine factor that controls vascular tone, inhibits platelet function, prevents adhesion of leukocytes, and reduces proliferation of the intima. An enhanced inactivation and/or reduced synthesis of NO is seen in conjunction with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This condition, referred to as endothelial dysfunction, can promote vasospasm, thrombosis, vascular inflammation, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Vascular oxidative stress with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to mechanisms of vascular dysfunction. Oxidative stress is mainly caused by an imbalance between the activity of endogenous pro-oxidative enzymes (such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, or the mitochondrial respiratory chain) and anti-oxidative enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, heme oxygenase, thioredoxin peroxidase/peroxiredoxin, catalase, and paraoxonase) in favor of the former. Also, small molecular weight antioxidants may play a role in the defense against oxidative stress. Increased ROS concentrations reduce the amount of bioactive NO by chemical inactivation to form toxic peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite-in turn-can \"uncouple\" endothelial NO synthase to become a dysfunctional superoxide-generating enzyme that contributes to vascular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction can promote atherogenesis. Therapeutically, drugs in clinical use such as ACE inhibitors, AT(1) receptor blockers, and statins have pleiotropic actions that can improve endothelial function. Also, dietary polyphenolic antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress, whereas clinical trials with antioxidant vitamins C and E failed to show an improved cardiovascular outcome.", 
    "72": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mediates the ventilator-induced inflammatory response in healthy lungs via angiotensin II (Ang II). A rat model was used to examine the role of ACE and Ang II in the inflammatory response during mechanical ventilation of preinjured (ie, lipopolysaccharide [LPS]-exposed) lungs. When indicated, rats were pretreated with the ACE inhibitor captopril and/or intratracheal administration of LPS. The animals were ventilated for 4 hours with moderate pressure amplitudes. Nonventilated animals served as controls. ACE activity and levels of Ang II and inflammatory mediators (interleukin-6, Cytokine-induced Neutrophil Chemoattractant (CINC)-3, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-10) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The localization of ACE and Ang II type 1 receptor in lung tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry. The role of the Ang II pathway was assessed by using its receptor antagonist Losartan. Mechanical ventilation of LPS-exposed animals increased ACE activity and levels of inflammatory mediators in BALF compared with ventilated nonexposed and LPS-exposed nonventilated animals. Blocking ACE by captopril attenuated the lung inflammatory response. Furthermore, increased ACE activity in BALF was accompanied by increased levels of Ang II and enhanced expression of its receptor on alveolar cells. Blocking the Ang II receptor attenuated the inflammatory mediator response to a larger extent than by blocking ACE. In conclusion, during mechanical ventilation ACE, via Ang II, mediates the inflammatory response of both healthy and preinjured lungs.", 
    "73": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been repeatedly described as a safe and efficacious procedure to provide a stroke-risk reduction benefit in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.",

A variety of susceptibility genes have been associated, but definitive conclusions have been difficult to draw and are partly hampered by the small number of patients in each study. We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis on any gene that was investigated in a case-control model of AAA. A comprehensive, genetic meta-analysis of all genes investigated by using an allelic-association, case-control model in AAA was conducted. Electronic databases were searched through July 2009 for any candidate gene in AAA. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for each gene-disease association by using fixed- and random-effect models. Twenty studies in 7 candidate genes were analysed among 16,748 individuals (i.e., 7891 patients and 8857 controls). Of the 8 genes studied, 5 genes were associated with AAA. The angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism (I/D) showed a significant association in both a dominant model (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.56; P < 0.0001) and a recessive model (OR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.42; P < 0.00001). The pooled ORs for the C677T variant of 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.65; P = 0.007) for the dominant model and 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.67; P = 0.41) for a recessive model. There was also significance in the dominant model of the angiotensin-1 receptor polymorphism (AT1R) A1166C (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.66 to 2.28; P < 0.00001) and in the dominant (95% CI, 1.18 to 2.11; P = 0.002) and recessive (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.02; P = 0.006) models of the interleukin-10 1082 polymorphism.

After 8 weeks of intravenous administration of Ucn in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), serum and tissue sACE, angiotensin II (Ang II), nitric oxide (NO), Ang-(1-7), and tissue chymase activities were evaluated. RT-PCR analysis was performed to determine the quantity of tissue sACE mRNA. Serum sACE activity was reduced by Ucn, although tissue sACE activity and tissue sACE mRNA were elevated. Chymase activity was observed to be enhanced by Ucn, whereas the ACE inhibitor enalapril failed to influence chymase. Serum and tissue Ang II activity was reduced, but NO and Ang-(1-7) production was increased in a concentration-dependent manner after Ucn treatment. Meanwhile, a significant decrease of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) was observed after the long-term Ucn administration, and there was a significant positive correlation (r2 = 0.6993) between serum ACE activity and SBP. Pretreatment with the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) blocker astressin and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway blocker PD98059 abolished these effects of Ucn.

Hypertensive patients under therapy were insulin resistant, had higher LDL-cholesterol levels, higher blood pressure and lower endothelial function than healthy controls. Flow-mediated dilatation showed, in the study population being treated for arterial hypertension, no relationships of all insulin sensitivity indices with flow-mediated dilatation, casual blood pressure in the morning before the tests and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Flow-mediated dilatation was strongly influenced by nocturnal systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (systolic: R\u00b2=0.0943, P<0.05; diastolic: R\u00b2=0.0947, P<0.05). Therefore, endothelial function in these patients is predominantly influenced by nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure and not by insulin sensitivity.",

    "102": "The relationship between ACR and TPCR is non-linear. TPCR is highly correlated with 24-h urine protein (Spearman's rho = 0.91), though ACR also performs well (rho = 0.84). Using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, TPCR outperforms ACR at predicting 0.5 g/day [area under the curve (AUC) 0.967 vs 0.951, P < 0.001] and 1 g/day of proteinuria (AUC 0.968 vs 0.947, P = 0.004). A TPCR threshold of 100 mg/mmol had a higher sensitivity (94% vs 79%) but lower specificity (88% vs 95%) than an ACR of 70 mg/mmol to predict 1 g/day of total proteinuria. To achieve comparable sensitivity, the ACR threshold falls to 17.5 mg/mmol, with lower specificity than TPCR (69.8%). Sensitivity of TPCR rose with increasing age, and in females: to achieve 95% sensitivity in a man <49 years, requires a TPCR of 65 mg/mmol, compared to 179 mg/mmol in a woman >79 years. Non-albumin proteinuria was a lower proportion of total proteinuria in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockade than in those who were not (P < 0.001).", 
    "103": "TPCR is a more sensitive screening test than ACR to predict clinically relevant proteinuria. The diagnostic performance of both tests varies substantially with age and gender, and should be taken into consideration when interpreting results. Total proteinuria cannot be adequately predicted from ACR, and our results suggest that caution is appropriate before utilizing ACR in patients with non-diabetic CKD.",

This significant change has been associated with the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists. High potassium concentrations in heart failure could lead to life threatening events, and therefore should be taken seriously. In this review we summarise the information about potassium homeostasis in heart failure and the current risk of developing potentially serious hyperkalaemia, particularly in association with the use of aldosterone antagonists.",

    "111": "Aldosterone, a steroid hormone with mineralocorticoid activity, is mainly recognized for its action on sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney, which is mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Beyond this well-known action, however, aldosterone exerts other effects on the kidney, blood vessels and the heart, which can have pathophysiological consequences, particularly in the presence of a high salt intake. Aldosterone is implicated in renal inflammatory and fibrotic processes, as well as in podocyte injury and mesangial cell proliferation. In the cardiovascular system, aldosterone has specific hypertrophic and fibrotic effects and can alter endothelial function. Several lines of evidence support the existence of crosstalk between aldosterone and angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells. The deleterious effects of aldosterone on the cardiovascular system require concomitant pathophysiological conditions such as a high salt diet, increased oxidative stress, or inflammation. Large interventional trials have confirmed the benefits of adding mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists to standard therapy, in particular to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy, in patients with heart failure. Small interventional studies in patients with chronic kidney disease have shown promising results, with a significant reduction of proteinuria associated with aldosterone antagonism, but large interventional trials that test the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists in chronic kidney disease are needed.",

Although components of the RAS are expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, a local RAS in bone has not yet been described and there is no information on whether the RAS is involved in fracture healing. Therefore, we studied the expression and function of the key RAS component, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), during fracture healing.", 
    "114": "In a murine femur fracture model, animals were treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril or vehicle only. Fracture healing was analysed after 2, 5 and 10 weeks using X-ray, micro-CT, histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and biomechanical testing.", 
    "115": "ACE was expressed in osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the periosteal callus during fracture healing, accompanied by expression of the angiotensin type-1 and type-2 receptors. Perindopril treatment reduced blood pressure and bone mineral density in unfractured femora. However, it improved periosteal callus formation, bone bridging of the fracture gap and torsional stiffness. ACE inhibition did not affect cell proliferation, but reduced apoptotic cell death. After 10 week treatment, a smaller callus diameter and bone volume after perindopril treatment indicated an advanced stage of bone remodelling.",

Somatic ACE comprises two homologous domains, the differing substrate preferences of which present a new avenue for domain-selective inhibitor design. We have co-crystallized lisW-S, a C-domain-selective derivative of the drug lisinopril, with human testis ACE and determined a structure using X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.30 A (1 A=0.1 nm). In this structure, lisW-S is seen to have a similar binding mode to its parent compound lisinopril, but the P2' tryptophan moiety takes a different conformation to that seen in other inhibitors having a tryptophan residue in this position. We have examined further the domain-specific interactions of this inhibitor by mutating C-domain-specific active-site residues to their N domain equivalents, then assessing the effect of the mutation on inhibition by lisW-S using a fluorescence-based assay. Kinetics analysis shows a 258-fold domain-selectivity that is largely due to the co-operative effect of C-domain-specific residues in the S2' subsite. The high affinity and selectivity of this inhibitor make it a good lead candidate for cardiovascular drug development.",

This study was designed to investigate whether chronic inhibition of ACE would have a therapeutic effect in attenuating the progression of renal cystogenesis in an orthologous rat model of ARPKD, the polycystic kidney (PCK) rat. Lisinopril (3 mg/kg per day) was administered orally for a period of 12 weeks, beginning at post-natal week 4. Lisinopril treatment resulted in an approximately 30% improvement in the collecting duct cystic indices (CT CI) of PCK animals. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and 2 (ERK2), proliferative signaling markers, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an end-point marker for proliferation, was reduced following chronic treatment with lisinopril compared to that in vehicle-treated PCK rats. To assess whether apoptotic pathways were altered due to chronic ACE inhibition, we examined p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), which are markers of apoptotic signaling cascades. p38 MAPK was significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) following chronic treatment with lisinopril, but no change in the activation of SAPK/JNK could be detected by immunoblot analysis. Lisinopril treatment resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in cleaved caspase-7 levels, but not caspase-3 activity, in PCK rat kidneys compared to the vehicle-treated PCK rat kidneys. Proteinuria was completely ameliorated in the presence of chronic ACE inhibition in the lisinopril-treated rats compared with the vehicle-treated PCK rats. In all, these findings demonstrated that chronic ACE inhibition can beneficially alter proliferative and apoptotic pathways to promote therapeutic reductions in renal cyst development in ARPKD.",

Therefore, emphatic treatment is necessary. Blood pressure goal is recommended below 130/80 mmHg with office measurements, and less than 7 out of 30 values below 135/85 mmHg with home measurements. Strict blood pressure control reduces macro- and microvascular morbidity. Usually combination of different drugs is necessary to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure control. First line should be an inhibitor of the RAS, commonly combined with a calcium channel blocker and/or a diuretic. Fixed-dose combinations are recommended.

We investigated whether the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) affects hypoxia-related target genes in developing kidneys. Newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg/d) or spironolactone (200 mg/kg/d) for 7 days. Tissue hypoxia was assessed by the uptake of a hypoxyprobe-1, pimonidazole (200 mg/kg), and the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes. In the enalapril group, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and Ets-1 protein expression were not changed, compared to the control group. In the spironolactone group, HIF-1alpha and Ets-1 protein expression were significantly increased by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry, whereas HIF-2alpha protein expression was not changed, compared to the control group. In the enalapril group, the immunoactivity of pimonidazole was not significantly different from that of the controls. However, in the spironolactone group, pimonidazole staining demonstrated that the cortex and medulla underwent severe hypoxia. In summary, our data showed that aldosterone inhibition in the developing kidney augmented the hypoxic responses, and up-regulated the expression of key mediators of hypoxia including HIF-1alpha and Ets-1. Angiotensin II inhibition did not affect hypoxia-related alterations in the developing kidney. The components of RAAS may differentially modulate renal hypoxia and its related target genes in the developing rat kidney.",

Yet, a widespread belief exists that underlying usual blood pressure can alone account for all blood-pressure-related risk of vascular events and for the benefits of antihypertensive drugs, and this notion has come to underpin all major clinical guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Other potentially informative measures, such as variability in clinic blood pressure or maximum blood pressure reached, have been neglected, and effects of antihypertensive drugs on such measures are largely unknown. Clinical guidelines recommend that episodic hypertension is not treated, and the potential risks of residual variability in blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients have been ignored.

Cardiac tissue kallikrein may play a greater cardioprotective role in type 2 diabetic than in non-diabetic patients and contribute to the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetic patients. However, our findings do not support a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in mediating the effects of statin therapy on endothelial function.", 
    "161": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Appropriate medical therapy using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers improves outcomes in HF, whereas the role of digoxin is still not clearly defined. Digoxin is currently recommended for patients with HF who are symptomatic despite standard therapy and for controlling the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. Digoxin is a time-tested drug that accounts for 20 million drug prescriptions annually in the United States. It has favorable hemodynamic effects for patients with HF and atrial tachyarrhythmias. We conducted a systematic literature search for the current indications for digoxin. Despite extensive research and safety data, the literature suggests that digoxin is underused in clinical settings. Citing the literature where available, our review highlights the various clinical settings where digoxin is indicated. Despite difficulties with designing prospective studies in acute HF settings and lack of outcomes data, we believe that digoxin will continue to serve an important role in optimizing care in certain acute and chronic cardiac conditions.", 
    "162": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common indication for the development of end stage renal diseases. Inflammation is increasingly seen as the core process in the development of diabetes. Inflammatory markers e.g. NFkappaB (p65 levels), TNFalpha, COX-2 and TGFbeta-smad signaling are the key elements in the development of DN. Renin-angiotensin system suppressors like telmisartan have been used to treat DN, but they are not able to prevent completely because of development of resistance against them. Anti-inflammatory agents like, aspirin acts through both COX dependent and COX independent pathways. Hence, we thought that combining aspirin with telmisartan will be better therapeutic option in preventing the progression of nephropathy in diabetes. In the present study we studied the effect of this combination on inflammatory markers [COX-2, NFkappaB (p65 levels), TNFalpha], TGFbeta-smad expression in preventing the progression of streptozotocin-induced type I diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of aspirin significantly prevented the progression of nephropathy and inhibited the augmented COX-2, NFkappaB (p65 levels), TNFalpha, and TGFbeta-smad expression. Combination of aspirin with telmisartan resulted in a further decrease in the development of nephropathy and inflammatory markers in comparison to aspirin alone treatment. This is the first report which shows that aspirin in combination with telmisartan is more proficient in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy than any single drug therapy and involves the change in expression of inflammatory markers and TGFbeta-smad signaling.",

ACEI-treated patients more often had vascular co-morbidities and were more frequently treated with anti-platelets. Admission NIHSS scores were significantly higher in ACEI-treated patients but 90 days NIHSS scores were not. Improvement from baseline NIHSS scores was significantly larger in ACEI-treated patients. Pre-ICH use of ACEI was not associated with lower mortality or better functional outcome on univariate analysis. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, controlling for possible confounding variables, ACEI use was not associated with increased chances for good outcome and failed to show an influence on mortality.",

At the same time, identification of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes has provided clues to how the disease develops when they (genetic mechanisms) and their encoded proteins (molecular mechanisms) are disrupted. Interventions designed to rectify downstream effects of these disruptions have been examined in animal models, and some are currently tested in clinical trials. Efforts are underway to determine whether interventions capable to slow down, stop, or reverse structural progression of the disease will also prevent decline of renal function and improve clinically significant outcomes.", 
    "169": "Hypertension is common and occurs in a majority of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients before the loss of kidney function. Hypertension relates to progressive kidney enlargement and is a significant independent risk factor for progression to ESRD. The pathogenesis of hypertension in ADPKD is complex and dependent on many factors that influence each other. Pkd1 and Pkd2 expression levels are highest in the major vessels and are present in the cilia of endothelial cells and in vascular smooth muscle cells. Decreased or absent polycystin 1 or 2 expression is associated with abnormal vascular structure and function. Pkd1/Pkd2 deficiency results in reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels, altered endothelial response to shear stress with attenuation in vascular relaxation. Ten percent to 20% of ADPKD children show hypertension and the majority of adults are hypertensive before any loss of kidney function. Cardiac abnormalities such as left ventricular hypertrophy and carotid intimal wall thickening are present before the development of hypertension in ADPKD. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs in ADPKD because of decreased NO production as well as bilateral cyst expansion and intrarenal ischemia. With increasing cyst size, further activation of the RAAS occurs, blood pressure increases, and a vicious cycle ensues with enhanced cyst growth and hypertension ultimately leading to ESRD. The inhibition of the angiotensin aldosterone system is possible with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. However, interventional studies have not yet shown benefit in slowing progression to renal failure in ADPKD. Currently, large multicenter studies are being performed to determine the beneficial effects of RAAS inhibition both early and late in ADPKD.", 
    "170": "Hydrolysis of flaxseed proteins using thermolysin and pronase followed by mixing with activated carbon, centrifugation and filtration yielded a filtrate (peptide mixture) with a Fischer ratio (branched-chain amino acids/aromatic amino acids) of 23.65 and a phenylalanine + tyrosine content of 1.11%. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the flaxseed peptide sample contained mainly low molecular weight peptides (<4 kDa). The high Fischer ratio peptide sample exhibited antioxidant property by scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and also by protecting linoleic acid from oxidation. In addition, the peptide mixture showed potential antihypertensive properties by inhibiting angiotensin I-converting enzyme in a mixed-type inhibition pattern. Protein hydrolysates with Fischer ratio higher than 20 and phenylalanine + tyrosine content lower than 2% have been used to treat patients with hepatic encephalopathy; thus, this multifunctional flaxseed peptide mixture could be used to formulate food products with multiple human health benefits during liver diseases, oxidative stress and hypertension.", 
    "171": "Current attention focuses on mechanisms of controlling blood pressure through the inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Bioactive antihypertensive peptides of food origin are increasingly gaining importance as alternates to synthetic drugs in hypertension therapy. The ACE inhibitory property of an enzymatic digest of arachin, the major storage globulin of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) has been demonstrated. The ACE inhibitory activity of a tripeptide (IEY) isolated from these digests has been characterized. Five synthetic structural analogs of this peptide (IEW, IKY, IKW, IEP and IKP) were assembled and their ACE inhibitory activity evaluated. Among these, the tripeptide IKP was a potent competitive inhibitor with an IC(50) of 7+/-1 x 10(-6)M similar to that of the potent whey peptides IPP and VPP. The inhibition data of these peptide analogs have been rationalized through docking simulations using the tACE-lisinopril complex at 2A resolution (PDB: 1086). The best docking poses were located at the tACE catalytic site resembling the mode of inhibition exerted by lisinopril, the synthetic drug. The degree of inhibition by the peptides correlated with the coordination distance between the catalytic Zn(II) and the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond between the amino-terminal and middle residue. These studies illustrate that these peptides, like lisinopril, behave as transition state analog inhibitors and are useful in therapeutic intervention for blood pressure management.",

The treatment of myocardial infarction and heart failure are particularly important and will continue to play an important role across the globe. Advances in treatment of myocardial infarction have made tremendous inroads in the short and long term survival of patients, young and old, however, many currently employed strategies have not been tested in patients who are elderly, who paradoxically, form a growing subset of patients with heart disease. A similar paradigm exists in heart failure for both diagnosis and treatment. Attention to this issue is important when selecting treatment strategies and a focus on the goals of care is critical when decisions for care must be undertaken.", 
    "177": "We reviewed 6 recent outcome trials of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs in 74,524 randomized hypertensive or high-risk patients. Over interpretation of nonsignificant or marginal probability values in large trials with overlapping end points, exclusion of patients not tolerating or not adhering to experimental treatments, labeling nonsignificant treatment effects as modest, and insufficient information on the quality of the BP measurements or on the BP changes early after randomization raise concern. From a clinical viewpoint, results should not be extrapolated to patients with characteristics dissimilar from those randomized. The benefit beyond BP lowering in cardiovascular prevention is tiny. Dual inhibition of the renin system should only be used in patients at high risk, in whom all drug combinations have been tried and who cannot be controlled by a single renin system inhibitor. Current evidence does not support BP lowering in normotensive patients or the use of renin system inhibitors for prevention of stroke recurrence. Because angiotensin-receptor blockers might offer less protection against myocardial infarction than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the latter should remain the preferred renin system inhibitor for cardiovascular prevention in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-tolerant patients. In 2 trials, in which new-onset diabetes was a predefined end point, 1000 patients had to be treated for 1 year with an angiotensin-receptor blocker instead of placebo to prevent just 2 cases. From a design viewpoint, the time has come to revise the concept of large simple trials and to pursue research questions that serve patient interests more than showing noninferiority or highlight the ancillary qualities of marketable antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "178": "Aortic aneurysms are common among the elderly population. A large majority of aortic aneurysms are located at two distinct aneurysm-prone regions, the abdominal aorta and thoracic aorta involving the ascending aorta. In this study, we combined two factors that are associated with human aortic aneurysms, hypertension and degeneration of elastic lamina, to induce an aortic aneurysm in mice. Roles of hemodynamic conditions in the formation of aortic aneurysms were assessed using two different methods for inducing hypertension and antihypertensive agents. In 9-week-old C57BL/6J male mice, hypertension was induced by angiotensin II or deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension; degeneration of elastic lamina was induced by infusion of beta-aminopropionitrile, a lysyl oxidase inhibitor. Irrespective of the methods for inducing hypertension, mice developed thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (38% to 50% and 30 to 49%, respectively). Aneurysms were found at the two aneurysm-prone regions with site-specific morphological and histological characteristics. Treatment with an antihypertensive agent, amlodipine, normalized blood pressure and dramatically reduced aneurysm formation in the mice that received angiotensin II and beta-aminopropionitrile. However, treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, did not affect blood pressure or the incidence of aortic aneurysms in the mice that received deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt and beta-aminopropionitrile. In summary, we have shown that a combination of hypertension and pharmacologically induced degeneration of elastic laminas can induce both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms with site-specific characteristics. The aneurysm formation in this model depended on hypertension but not on direct effects of angiotensin II to the vascular wall.", 
    "179": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy of blood pressure-lowering therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk in obese people. In this report we examine the effects of blood pressure lowering according to baseline body mass index (kilograms per meter squared) in the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study. A total of 6105 participants with cerebrovascular disease were randomized to perindopril-based blood pressure-lowering therapy or placebo. The overall mean difference in systolic/diastolic blood pressure between participants assigned active therapy or placebo was 9/4 mm Hg (SE: 0.5/0.3 mm Hg), with no difference by body mass index quarters (<23.1, 23.1 to 25.3, 25.4 to 27.8, and > or = 27.9 kg/m(2)). A consistent treatment benefit was demonstrated for protection against major vascular events across quarters with the following hazard ratios (95% CIs): 0.80 (0.62 to 1.02), 0.78 (0.61 to 1.01), 0.67 (0.53 to 0.86), 0.69 (0.54 to 0.88), and 0.74 (0.66 to 0.84; P for heterogeneity=0.16). Similar results were apparent for stroke and stroke subtypes (all P for heterogeneity > or = 0.07) or with the standard definitions of overweight and obesity (<25, 25 to 29, and > or = 30 kg/m(2); all P for heterogeneity > or = 0.28). The absolute effects of treatment were, however, more than twice that in the highest compared with the lowest body mass index quartile. Across increasing quarters of body mass index over 5 years, active therapy prevented 1 major vascular event among every 28, 23, 13, and 13 patients treated. In conclusion, blood pressure-lowering therapy produced comparable risk reductions in vascular disease across the whole range of body mass indices in participants with a history of stroke. However, the greater baseline level of cardiovascular risk in those with higher body mass index meant that these patients obtained the greatest benefit.", 
    "180": "Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the initial suppression of angiotensin II after the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is later reversed and returns almost to pretreatment levels. This raised the hypothesis of the \"escape phenomenon,\" which was strengthened by the discovery that angiotensin II can also be generated through non-ACEs. Therefore, the addition of angiotensin receptor blockers to ACE inhibitors would produce additional benefits by blocking all angiotensin II at the angiotensin II receptor type 1 level and in addition allowing angiotensin II to stimulate the unoccupied angiotensin II receptor type 2, causing additional vasodilation and antiremodeling effects. However, analysis of various studies including hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease has demonstrated that the gain is modest when combining ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or the renin blocker aliskiren. In conclusion, on the basis of the results of this analysis, dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system should not be used for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease, with perhaps the exception of diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria, until additional information is provided from ongoing studies.", 
    "181": "Landmark studies have proved that several therapies reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, the rates of secondary CVD in the context of therapies delivered according to current guidelines are largely unknown. Therefore, we sought to estimate the incidence of secondary CVD hospitalizations and all-cause mortality among patients who did and did not receive guideline-level pharmacotherapy. For the 12,278 patients added to the Kaiser Permanente, Northwest CVD registry in 2000 to 2005, we used the pharmacy records to define guideline-level care (GLC) as at least one dispense of aspirin/antiplatelets, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers within 6 months after registry enrollment. We followed patients until they died, experienced a CVD hospitalization, or June 30, 2008. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates per 1,000 person-years of CVD hospitalization, death, and the composite, and estimated the hazard ratios using Cox regression analysis. During a mean follow-up of 45.8 +/- 22.8 months, 25% of the study sample experienced the composite outcome. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence per 1,000 person-years of the composite outcome was significantly lower among GLC patients (hazard ratio 50.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.6 to 54.3) versus non-GLC patients (hazard ratio 60.7, 95% CI 58.1 to 63.4). The difference was driven by lower mortality rates (hazard ratio 18.1, 95% CI 16.1 to 20.4 vs hazard ratio 28.1, 95% CI 26.3 to 30.0). The incidence of CVD hospitalizations did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (hazard ratio 29.2, 95% CI 26.4 to 32.2 vs hazard ratio 27.7, 95% CI 26.0 to 29.5). Multivariate adjustment resulted in a marginally significant 8% lower risk of the composite outcome among GLC recipients (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01, p = 0.067). In conclusion, treatment according to current guidelines was significantly associated with reduced mortality but not the risk of secondary hospitalizations.", 
    "182": "During the past 50 years, a global pandemic of kidney failure attributed to diabetes mellitus provoked continuously changing treatment strategies based in the belief that micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes may be preventable. Both patient and physician have revised, and sometimes reversed drug regimens based on inferences extracted from prospective, controlled, properly populated trials. Illustrating this dilemma is a newly relaxed target for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7%, introduced because of the greater rate of cardiovascular complications noted when striving to reduce attained HbA1c to < or = 6.5%. Our concept of the natural history of kidney disease in diabetes has repeatedly been modified by a rising mean age of those developing uremia (now 64.5 years).

    "206": "We report the development of peripartum cardiomyopathy in two sisters, 27- and 35-year-old African women, one of whom presented with a large left ventricular thrombus. Subsequently, both patients were treated with bromocriptine, heparin and standard therapy for heart failure (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics). During follow-up, the left ventricular thrombus observed in one patient degraded. Neither patient experienced a thrombotic event, and both experienced continuous improvements in cardiac function and New York Heart Association stage.",

In Australia, the number of people with type 2 diabetes starting dialysis increased fivefold between 1993 and 2007. We must act now at local, national and international levels to prevent type 2 diabetes; screen for early diabetic kidney disease; increase public awareness of kidney disease; treat with medications proven to reduce kidney disease progression; and promote research into and trialling of new therapies.

Urinary protein excretion adjusted for urinary creatinine was reduced from 3,749 to 2,474 mg/g creatinine (p < 0.0001). No significant change was detected in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine level. With the switching from high-dose ARBs to the combination of normal-dose telmisartan and low-dose HCTZ treatment, the blood pressure decreased in all the subjects, and 36% of all the subjects achieved optimal blood pressure levels.

It might involve the gastro-intestinal tract, leading to abdominal pain, vomiting and/or diarrhea, as well as pancreatitis. Dipeptidyl-ptidase-4 (DPP-4) is another enzyme allowing the degradation of bradykinin and substance P.

Proteinuria adversely affects the outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial single-center results of a treatment protocol for severe HSP nephritis based on the Heaton classification. Age, gender, clinical features and duration of disease follow-up were assessed. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinalysis and 24-hour urinary protein excretion were analyzed. All patients with severe renal involvement were biopsied and a treatment plan was assigned: Class II received oral steroids, Class III (with crescentic nephritis) received additional oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/d for 12 weeks, and Classes IV and V received azathioprine for 9 months subsequent to the treatment for Class III. All patients received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors regardless of their blood pressure values. Eighteen patients presenting with severe HSP nephritis, defined as heavy proteinuria and/or decreased renal function, were evaluated. Based on the renal histology, 5, 10, 1 and 2 of the patients were classified as Classes II, III, IV and V, respectively. At presentation, 7 of the patients had impaired renal function with GFR below 75 ml/min/1.73 m2. With the presented treatment schema, all GFR returned to normal at the end of four years of follow-up. There was no proteinuria in any of the patients; only 8 had microscopic hematuria. This preliminary study suggests a stepwise treatment according to the renal histology. The excellent results with complete disappearance of proteinuria and normal renal function justify the use of the aforementioned immunosuppressive protocol with ACE inhibition. Long-term, multicenter controlled studies are needed to verify our results.", 
    "234": "It has been reported (this issue Pediatric Nephrology) that cyclosporine A (CyA) therapy in combination with corticosteroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and an angiotensin receptor blocker decreased proteinuria in three patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) due to WT1 mutations. Treatment with calcineurin inhibitors were found to induce a partial remission of proteinuria in several other children with genetic forms of NS, such as mutation in the podocine and in the phospholipase C epsilon gene. CyA therapy has also been reported to be beneficial to patients with Alport syndrome. Recent data have shown that the antiproteinuric effect of CyA in these cases may be due to a non-immunologic mechanism. CyA exerts an antiproteinuria effect by preventing the degradation of the actin organizing protein synaptodpodin and by a downregulation of TRPC6. This mechanism leads to the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in the kidney podocytes. This beneficial effect of CyA is interesting, but long-term results regarding function and nephrotoxicity are still missing.",

The assay was based on 500-microL plasma samples, following solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges. All analytes and the internal standard (trandolapril) were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography using a SeQuant Zic-HILIC analytical column (150.0 x 2.1 mm i.d., particle size 3.5 microm, 200 A) with isocratic elution. The mobile phase consisted of 10% 5.0 mM ammonium acetate water solution in a binary mixture of acetonitrile/methanol (60:40, v/v) and pumped at a flow rate of 0.10 mL min(-1). Quantitation of the analytes was performed with selected ion monitoring (SIM) in positive ionization mode using electrospray ionization interface. The assay was found to be linear in the concentration range of 5.0-500.0 ng mL(-1) for perindopril and perindoprilat. Intermediate precision were found less than 3.5% over the tested concentration ranges. A run time of less than 6.0 min for each sample made it possible to analyze a large number of human plasma samples per day. The method is the first reported application of HILIC in the analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and can be used to quantify perindopril and perindoprilat in human plasma covering a variety of pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence studies.",

The etiology of degenerative AoS is actually well known, the primary lesion being aortic sclerosis. Aortic sclerosis shares many pathological features and risk factors with atherosclerosis and, because atherosclerosis may be prevented and/or reversed by cholesterol lowering, there has been postulated that cholesterol lowering therapy using statin drugs could modify the course of aortic sclerosis/stenosis. Some studies also demonstrated the implication of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the degenerative aortic disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could also be used to delayed or even reverse the evolution of Ao sclerosis/stenosis.

WT1 is also a key regulator of podocyte functions and mutations have been found in a small percentage of children with isolated or syndromal steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. It is commonly assumed that the nephrotic syndrome (NS) in patients with WT1 mutations is unresponsive to therapy and characterized by rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. We report long-term observations in 3 children with focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with WT1 mutations and NS (2 cases) or nephrotic range proteinuria (1 case). All patients showed a favorable response to an intensified therapy consisting of cyclosporin A (CyA) in combination with induction therapy with intravenous and oral prednisone. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers was added to the regimen at various times. As shown both by the short-term response and during long-term follow-up, this treatment resulted in clinical remission of the NS and/or significant reduction of proteinuria, while normal renal function could be maintained over many years. Thus, glomerular diseases in selected patients with mutations in genes regulating renal development and podocyte function may respond to combination therapy with CyA and corticosteroids.",

    "240": "The effects of various protease inhibitors on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping were examined in morphine-dependent mice. The doses of morphine were subcutaneously given twice daily for 2 days (day 1, 30 mg/kg; day 2, 60 mg/kg). On day 3, naloxone (8 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 3h after final injection of morphine (60 mg/kg), and the number of jumping was immediately recorded for 20 min. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping was significantly suppressed by the intracerebroventricular administration of N-ethylmaleimide (0.5 nmol) and Boc-Tyr-Gly-NHO-Bz (0.4 nmol), inhibitors of cysteine proteases involved in dynorphin degradation, 5 min before each morphine treatment during the induction phase, with none given on the test day, as well as by dynorphin A (62.5 pmol) and dynorphin B (250 pmol). However, amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, an endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, and captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, caused no changes. The present results suggest that cysteine protease inhibitors suppress naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping in morphine-dependent mice, presumably through the inhibition of dynorphin degradation.",

The patients included were \u226565 years old, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, and without preexisting RF (defined by the criteria of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons as described in Method). Of all patients evaluated, 346 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: using (n = 122) or not using (n = 224) preoperative RAS inhibitors. A comparison of the two groups showed no significant differences in baseline parameters, including creatinine clearance, body mass index, history of diabetes and smoking, preoperative medicines (except that more patients with RAS inhibitors had a history of hypertension or congestive heart failure, fewer RAS inhibitor patients had chronic lung disease), in intraoperative perfusion and aortic cross-clamp time, and in postoperative complications and 30-d mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated, however, that preoperative RAS inhibitors significantly and independently reduced the incidence of postoperative RF in the patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared with those not taking RAS inhibitors: 1.6% versus 7.6%, yielding an odds ratio of 0.19 (95 % CI 0.04-0.84, P = 0.029).",

The peak current varied linearly over the range from 4.0 x 10(-7) to 5.2 x 10(-6) mol L(-1). The limits of detection and quantification were 6.87 x 10(-8) mol L(-1) and 2.29 x 10(-7) mol L(-1), respectively. The recovery was found in the range from 99.65% to 100.76%.

    "245": "The anti-hypertensive peptide Arg-Ile-Tyr, which was isolated based on its inhibitory activity (IC(50)=28microM) for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) from the subtilisin digest of rapeseed protein, exhibited vasorelaxing activity (EC(50)=5.1microM) in an endothelium-dependent manner in the mesenteric artery of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We named the peptide rapakinin. ACE inhibitors are reported to induce nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasorelaxation by elevating the endogenous bradykinin level; however, the vasorelaxation induced by 10microM of rapakinin was blocked only insignificantly by HOE140 or N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), antagonists of bradykinin B(2) receptor and an inhibitor of NO synthase, respectively. On the other hand, the vasorelaxation induced by 10microM rapakinin was significantly blocked by indomethacin and CAY10441, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor and an antagonist of the IP receptor, respectively. The vasorelaxing activity of rapakinin was also blocked by lorglumide, an antagonist of the cholecystokinin (CCK) CCK(1) receptor, although rapakinin has no affinity for the IP and CCK(1) receptors. The vasorelaxation induced by 10microM iloprost, an IP receptor agonist, was also blocked by lorglumide, suggesting that CCK-CCK(1) receptor system is activated downstream of the PGI(2)-IP receptor system. The anti-hypertensive activity of rapakinin after oral administration in SHRs was also blocked by CAY10441 and lorglumide. These results suggest that the anti-hypertensive activity of rapakinin might be mediated mainly by the PGI(2)-IP receptor, followed by CCK-CCK(1) receptor-dependent vasorelaxation.", 
    "246": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a pulmonary inflammatory response to inhaled substances, and individuals with COPD often have raised levels of several circulating inflammatory markers indicating the presence of systemic inflammation. Recently, there has been increasing interest in comorbidities associated with COPD such as skeletal muscle dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, diabetes and lung cancer. These conditions are associated with a similar inflammation-based patho-physiology to COPD, and may represent a lung inflammatory 'overspill' to distant organs. Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of mortality in COPD, and the concepts of an inflammatory link raise the possibility that treatment for one organ may show benefits to comorbidities in other organs. When considering treatment of COPD and its comorbidities, one approach is to target the pulmonary inflammation and hence reduce any 'overspill' effect of inflammatory mediators systemically as suggested by response to inhaled corticosteroids. Alternatively, treatment targeted towards comorbid organs may alter features of pulmonary disease as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists may have beneficial effects on COPD by reducing exacerbations and mortality. Newer anti-inflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), nuclear factor(NF)-kB, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, are given systemically and may confer benefits to both COPD and its comorbidities. With common inflammatory pathways it might be expected that successful anti-inflammatory therapy in one organ may also influence others. In this review we explore the concepts of systemic inflammation in COPD and current evidence for treatment of its related comorbidities.",

Analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, treatment groups were compared by the log-rank test without adjustment for covariates and hazard ratios with 95% CIs were obtained using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 7665 randomized patients, 1732 patients were receiving RAS blockade at baseline, the addition of nifedipine GITS significantly reduced any cardiovascular (CV) event (-20%; P<0.05), the composite of death, any CV event and revascularization (-16%; P<0.05) and coronary angiography (-22%; P<0.01). These benefits were achieved with relatively small differences in systolic (3.2\u2009mm\u2009Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (2.3\u2009mm\u2009Hg). In 2303 patients (30.0%) who had ISH at baseline (1145 nifedipine GITS and 1158 placebo), nifedipine significantly reduced the primary efficacy end point (-18%; P<0.03), any CV event (-22%; P<0.01) and new heart failure (-40%; P<0.01). The benefits were associated with between-group differences in achieved BP of 4.7 and 3.3\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. In summary, the lowest CV event rates were seen in those receiving (i) the combination of RAS blockade and nifedipine GITS and (ii) in those specifically treated for ISH.",

The drug had been prescribed to treat diabetic nephropathy. There was no previous history of drug induced or alimentary allergy. The patient was instructed to discontinue the use of ramipril and oral antihistaminic drug and topical corticosteroid were prescribed. Skin biopsies were performed and confirmed the clinical hypothesis of pharmacodermy. The evaluation of ACE polymorphism identified DD genotype.

    "262": "Tonin is a serine proteinase of the kallikrein family that can produce angiotensin II directly from angiotensinogen. To clarify the importance of this enzyme for central nervous control of the cardiovascular system, we generated transgenic mice, TGM(rTon), that express rat tonin in astrocytes. These mice present high levels of tonin mRNA and activity specifically in the brain. As a consequence, TGM(rTon) develop increased blood pressure and water intake. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is less hypotensive for transgenic mice than for control animals. The AT(1) receptor antagonist candesartan equally lowers blood pressure in transgenic and in control mice. Plasma angiotensin II, but not angiotensin I, is increased in TGM(rTon) compared to the wild type, suggesting release of the peptide from the brain into the circulation. However, AT(1) receptors are desensitized in this transgenic model, as demonstrated by a blunted pressor response to intravenous application of angiotensin II. In conclusion, tonin in the brain may represent an alternative pathway for angiotensin II generation with effects on the cardiovascular system.",

The hydrolysate generated by the crude enzyme from Bacillus mojavensis A21 displayed the highest ACE inhibitory activity, and the higher inhibition activity (87.11 +/- 0.92% at 2 mg/mL) was obtained with hydrolysis degree of 16%. This hydrolysate was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 into eight major fractions (P(1)-P(8)). Fraction P(6), which exhibited the highest ACE inhibitory activity, was then fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Eleven ACE inhibitory peptides were isolated, and their molecular masses and amino acids sequences were determined using ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS, respectively. The structures of the most potent peptides were identified as Ala-His-Ser-Tyr, Gly-Asp-Ala-Pro, Ala-Gly-Ser-Pro and Asp-Phe-Gly. The first peptide displayed the highest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC(50) of 11.6 microM.

From sequence analysis, we determined that P(I) was part of beta-casein in mare's milk. The 3 peptides P(K), P(M), and P(P) did not correspond with any known milk protein. The results suggest that koumiss is rich in ACE inhibitory peptides, and the ACE inhibitors in koumiss are of the pro-drug type or a mixture of the pro-drug type and the true inhibitor type.

Here, we investigated the chronic therapy effects of CCH on blood pressure and vascular relaxation in a cardiovascular damage model of Wistar-Kyoto rats induced by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Following co-treatment with CCH for 4 weeks, the increment of systolic blood pressure was suppressed significantly. At 8 weeks, the vasorelaxation of thoracic aorta increased significantly, and cardiovascular damage was ameliorated. The concentration of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in blood was reduced significantly by long-term administration of CCH, whereas the nitric oxide concentration was increased significantly at 1 hour post-treatment. The results suggest that beneficial effects of CCH result from antihypertensive function, but also from inhibition of cardiovascular damage to the endothelial cells via its ACE inhibitory activity and regulation of nitric oxide and ICAM-1, which suggests that CCH may be useful as a medicinal food for patients with cardiovascular disease.",

Eleven dual inhibitors were categorized in three classes, according to their zinc binding groups. Analysis of their docked conformers revealed the molecular environment of the catalytic sites and the specific interactions between the inhibitors and amino acid residues that are important for selectivity and cooperativity. In addition, inhibitors were predicted to bind to the C-domain of the ACE with greater affinity than the N-domain, with an average difference in the free energy of binding approximately 2-3 kcal mol(-1). Residues that were identified to actively participate in the binding and stabilizing of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were analyzed in a consensus way for both the ACE and the NEP. These atomic-level insights into enzyme-ligand binding can be used to drive new structure-based drug design processes in the quest for more selective and effective vasopeptidase inhibitors.",

We examined the effects of avosentan on progression of overt diabetic nephropathy in a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly assigned 1392 participants with type 2 diabetes to oral avosentan (25 or 50 mg) or placebo in addition to continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade. The composite primary outcome was the time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Secondary outcomes included changes in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and cardiovascular outcomes. We terminated the trial prematurely after a median follow-up of 4 months (maximum 16 months) because of an excess of cardiovascular events with avosentan. We did not detect a difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between groups. Avosentan significantly reduced ACR: In patients who were treated with avosentan 25 mg/d, 50 mg/d, and placebo, the median reduction in ACR was 44.3, 49.3, and 9.7%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation of trial medication significantly more often for avosentan than for placebo (19.6 and 18.2 versus 11.5% for placebo), dominated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure; death occurred in 21 (4.6%; P = 0.225), 17 (3.6%; P = 0.194), and 12 (2.6%), respectively. In conclusion, avosentan reduces albuminuria when added to standard treatment in people with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy but induces significant fluid overload and congestive heart failure.",

Overall, 62% of beneficiaries, or an estimated 20 million US adults aged 65 years and older, were hypertensive as extrapolated from MCBS data. From 1999 to 2004, the prevalence rate of hypertension increased from 59% to 65% (P<.001). Nonwhite persons and women had a higher prevalence of hypertension than whites and men. A history of diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or stroke was significantly associated with hypertension treatment. In addition, significant geographic variation in treatment was noted. There was a significant increase in hypertension prevalence in older Medicare beneficiaries from 1999 to 2004. Women, patients 85 years and older, and nonwhite patients were less likely to be treated with antihypertensive medications, and significant geographic variation existed in treatment.",

    "313": "Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Diabetic macrovasculopathy is associated with structural and functional changes in large arteries, which causes endothelial dysfunction, increased arterial stiffness, or decreased arterial distensability. Diabetic complications can be controlled and avoided by strict glycemic control, maintaining normal lipid profiles, regular physical exercise, adopting a healthy lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Treatment goals for patients with type 2 diabetes specify targets for glycemia and other cardiometabolic risk factors, for example, hypertension and dyslipidemia. In recent years, special attention has been devoted to both thiazolidindiones (TZDs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as clinical trials revealed that these drugs may reduce the rate of progression to diabetes or delay the onset of diabetes, regression of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to normoglycemia and reduces the composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with diabetes. This review focuses on the potential roles of rosiglitazone, a member of TZD class of antidiabetic agents, and ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, in preventing the preclinical macrovasculopathy in diabetes and IGT population.", 
    "314": "PURPOSE. To investigate the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II antagonist against retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat retina. METHODS. Retinal ischemia was induced by increasing intraocular pressure to 130 mm Hg. Rats were treated with an ACE inhibitor (captopril), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonist (candesartan), an AT2-R antagonist (PD123319), bradykinin, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant). At 7 days after the ischemia, retinal damage was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to measure changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the localization of AT1-R. Dark-adapted full-field electroretinography (ERG) was also performed. RESULTS. Pretreatment with captopril or candesartan significantly inhibited the ischemic injury of the inner retina. However, PD123319, bradykinin, or icatibant did not reduce the ischemic damage. In control retinas, retinal vessels were positive for AT1-R. In contrast, 12 hours after ischemia, immunohistochemical analysis detected numerous AT1-R-positive cells in the inner retina in vehicle-treated rats. After ischemia, the production of ROS was detected in retinal cells. However, pretreatment with captopril or candesartan suppressed the production of ROS. On the seventh postoperative day, the amplitudes of the ERG b-waves were significantly lower in the vehicle group than in the groups pretreated with captopril or candesartan. CONCLUSIONS. The present findings demonstrate that ischemic damage promotes the expression of AT1-R in the inner retina. Both the ACE inhibitor and the AT1-R antagonist that were examined can block the stimulation of the AT1-R and attenuate the subsequent ischemic damage in the rat retina.", 
    "315": "Renin, an aspartyl protease that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is proteolytically activated by a second protease [referred to as the prorenin processing enzyme (PPE)] before its secretion from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Although several enzymes are capable of activating renin in vitro, the leading candidate for the PPE in the kidney is cathepsin B (CTSB) due to is colocalization with the renin precursor (prorenin) in juxtaglomerular cell granules and because of its site-selective activation of human prorenin both in vitro and in transfected tissue culture cell models. To verify the role of CTSB in prorenin processing in vivo, we tested the ability of CTSB-deficient (CTSB-/-) mice to generate active renin. CTSB-/- mice do not exhibit any overt symptoms (renal malformation, preweaning mortality) typical of an RAS deficiency and have normal levels of circulating active renin, which, like those in control animals, rise more than 15-fold in response to pharmacologic inhibition of the RAS. The mature renin enzyme detected in kidney lysates of CTSB-/- mice migrates at the same apparent molecular weight as that in control mice, and the processing to active renin is not affected by chloroquine treatment of the animals. Finally, the distribution and morphology of renin-producing cells in the kidney is normal in CTSB-/- mice. In conclusion, CTSB-deficient mice exhibit no differences compared with controls in their ability to generate active renin, and our results do not support CTSB as the PPE in mice.",

Liberated peptides by the enzymatic action of fig protease in processing meat and free amino acids were determined and ACE inhibitory activity was assayed. Meat treated with fig protease became tender as indicated by shear force value (SFV) which was half of those of non-fig treated meat during storage even at 5 degrees C. Liberated peptides, free amino acids and GABA increased while extremely low levels of Glu were detected after storage. The optimal temperature of fig protease against meat was 80 degrees C. However, the activity of fig protease decreased after pre-heating more than 40 degrees C. High ACE inhibitory activity of a mixture of fig and meat was found around 80 degrees C, and the value corresponded to the amount of liberated peptide. A lot of liberated peptides were found at 60-80 degrees C and pasterization of meat product becomes convenient to produce peptides. Production of ACE inhibitory peptides and GABA can be expected as the healthy functional meat product such as antihypertensive activity and improve brain function.",

The hydrolysate has demonstrated potent in vitro ACE inhibitory activity, and has been shown to attenuate the development of hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). A4H is competitive for ACE and was separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a gel filtration column (Superdex Peptide HR 10/30). The results show that A4H is a mixed non-competitive inhibitor. Eighteen fractions were detected after separation of A4H, and most of them showed ACE inhibitory activity. Five fractions with strong ACE inhibitory activities (above 50%) were labeled from A to E. In addition, there were 10 peptides, consisting of 5-10 amino acid residues that were identified from fraction D that exhibited the strongest ACE inhibitory activity. Three of the identified peptides corresponded to peptides derived from collagen type I and chicken muscular protein. It is revealed that A4H has several peptides that possess ACE inhibitory activities.",

Our findings suggest that this syndrome is far more frequent than international literature would let us believe. We also describe one of the first male cases diagnosed with this entity for which there is a significant female predominance.

    "322": "A new robust high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS)-based screening method for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting substances in crude samples is described. The ACE assay is carried out in a typical offline setup by incubation of the samples with ACE and angiotensin I (AI), followed by stopping the reaction with acetonitrile containing val(5)-AI serving as internal standard (I.S.). AI and the product angiotensin II (AII) are extracted from the incubation mixture by turbulent-flow chromatography (TFC) applied in backflush mode as online solid-phase extraction and are directly quantified by ESI(+)-MS. The presence of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) is detected by an increase in AI signal intensity and a corresponding decrease of AII signal, as compared to the blank assay. The overall time of analysis of the TFC/ESI-MS method was 5 min, thus making the described setup suitable for a rapid screening method. The assay was validated using a known ACE inhibitor and the IC(50) values found were in good accordance with a common HPLC/UV method and literature data. The method was successfully applied for the screening of size-exclusion chromatography fractions of the venom of the pitviper Bothrops moojeni. Three of 18 analyzed fractions inhibited ACE, due to peptides present as components of this snake venom. These compounds were extracted from the two most-active fractions by means of TFC and isolated by means of HPLC. Three peptides with ACE inhibitory activity were characterized and their structures were elucidated with ESI-MS/MS-based de novo sequencing to be ZKWPPGKVPP, ZKWPRPGPEIPP and ZNWPRPGPEIPP, respectively (Z = pyroglutamic acid).", 
    "323": "Interrelationships between genetic and biochemical factors underlying ischemic stroke and ischemic heart disease are poorly understood. We: 1) undertook the most comprehensive meta-analysis of genetic polymorphisms in ischemic stroke to date; 2) compared genetic determinants of ischemic stroke with those of ischemic heart disease, and 3) compared effect sizes of gene-stroke associations with those predicted from independent biochemical data using a mendelian randomization strategy. Electronic databases were searched up to January 2009. We identified: 1) 187 ischemic stroke studies (37,481 cases; 95,322 controls) interrogating 43 polymorphisms in 29 genes; 2) 13 meta-analyses testing equivalent polymorphisms in ischemic heart disease; and 3) for the top five gene-stroke associations, 146 studies (65,703 subjects) describing equivalent gene-biochemical relationships, and 28 studies (46,928 subjects) describing biochemical-stroke relationships. Meta-analyses demonstrated positive associations with ischemic stroke for factor V Leiden Gln506, ACE I/D, MTHFR C677T, prothrombin G20210A, PAI-1 5G allele and glycoprotein IIIa Leu33Pro polymorphisms (ORs: 1.11 - 1.60). Most genetic associations show congruent levels of risk comparing ischemic stroke with ischemic heart disease, but three genes--glycoprotein IIIa, PAI-1 and angiotensinogen--show significant dissociations. The magnitudes of stroke risk observed for factor V Leiden, ACE, MTHFR and prothrombin, but not PAI-1, polymorphisms, are consistent with risks associated with equivalent changes in activated protein C resistance, ACE activity, homocysteine, prothrombin, and PAI-1 levels, respectively. Our results demonstrate causal relationships for four of the most robust genes associated with stroke while also showing that PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism influences cardiovascular risk via a mechanism not simply related to plasma levels of PAI-1 (or tPA) alone.",

Limited access to care due to geography or socioeconomic status significantly impairs control of hypertension in rural populations, resulting in poor health outcomes. Epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension and poor glycemic control are affected by race, increasing age, and residence in the rural southeastern United States. Optimization of the delivery of rural health care is needed to improve outcomes in patients with hypertension. New strategies such as programs targeting therapeutic inertia, home-based monitoring of blood pressure (BP), and Internet-based communication programs may significantly improve BP control rates among rural patients.

In this study, we examined the role of adipocyte-generated angiotensin II in PVAT-mediated potentiation of contraction to nerve stimulation. In rat mesenteric PVAT, the presence of angiotesinogen and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of angiotensin II in mesenteric PVAT. In rat mesenteric arteries, treatment of the vessels with an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) reduced PVAT-mediated potentiation of EFS-induced contraction. Exogenously applied angiotensin II enhanced EFS-induced contraction in arteries without PVAT, but not in the arteries with intact PVAT. Chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor quinapril (14 days) lowered blood pressure and alleviated the potentiation effects of PVAT in EFS-induced contraction. Mesenteric arteries from quinapril-treated group now exhibited the potentiation response to exogenously applied angiotensin II in arteries with intact PVAT to a comparable level as in arteries with PVAT removed. Treatment with hydralazine reduced blood pressure to the same level as quinapril treatment, but did not affect PVAT-associated potentiation of vasoconstriction to EFS and the response to exogenously applied angiotensin II in PVAT-intact arteries.

Vascular access options for HD include the placement of arteriovenous (AV) fistulas, AV grafts, and double-lumen, cuffed central vein catheters. Catheter use is generally associated with higher rates of infection and could compromise the adequacy of HD. Primary AV fistulas, which are generally recommended and provide excellent HD access, are not always the ideal choice for certain patients, such as the elderly or patients with diabetes mellitus. AV grafts allow for a large surface area available for cannulation, and thrombosed grafts have longer patency rates after revision than do revised fistulas. Although both AV fistulas and AV grafts are vulnerable to thrombosis and/or stenosis, surveillance and techniques such as Doppler ultrasound and intravascular ultrasound can minimize such complications. In addition, pharmacotherapeutic options are being studied to determine whether these complications can be prevented. Studies using a variety of pharmacologic agents have been conducted to determine whether stenosis and graft thrombosis can be prevented and have produced varying results. The use of warfarin can result in significant bleeding, but agents such as fish oil and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown some effect in increasing the patency in AV grafts and fistulas.

The hydrolysate was further subjected to reverse phase chromatography in order to separate the fractions with ACEI activity. Using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, 12 peptides were identified in these fractions. It is worth highlighting the novel peptides ER, KLP, and RPR with IC(50) values of 667 microM, 500 microM, and 382 microM, respectively. Results obtained by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry were complemented by a second approach consisting of the analysis of the hydrolysate directly by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS followed by a study of the obtained sequences and comparison with known ACEI peptide sequences. By using these two approaches, a total of 22 peptides were selected for its synthesis and further in vitro assay of ACEI activity. The strongest ACE inhibition was observed for peptide KAPVA (IC(50) = 46.56 microM) followed by the sequence PTPVP (IC(50) = 256.41 microM). Sequence similarity searches revealed that these two peptides derive from muscle titin, constituting the first identified ACEI peptides coming from this protein. This is also the first time that ACEI sequences MYPGIA and VIPEL have been reported. Other identified and synthesized sequences showed less ACEI activity. The obtained results evidence the potential of pork meat proteins as a source of antihypertensive peptides after gastrointestinal digestion.",

Several intervention trials and systematic overviews showed that both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs effectively reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in hypertensive patients. Two recent intervention trials conducted in Japan (JIKEI and Kyoto studies) suggested that the protective effect of ARBs on major cardiovascular events might be partly independent from the degree of blood pressure (BP) reduction. Both studies used a prospective randomized open blinded end point (PROBE) design. No significant differences emerged in both studies between the ARB group (valsartan) and the control group in the achieved BP. We made a pooled analysis of the JIKEI and Kyoto studies. Overall, valsartan significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome (by 42%; P<0.0001), angina pectoris (by 38%; P<0.0001), heart failure requiring hospitalization (by 43%; P=0.013) and cerebrovascular events (by 42%; P=0.002).

The importance of total cardiovascular risk with inclusion of subclinical cardiac, vascular, and renal organ damage was reemphasized, followed by a critical reappraisal of recommendations for the initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with high normal blood pressure (BP) and grade 1 hypertension. Whereas there is sufficient evidence for reducing BP below 140/90 mmHg in most hypertensives, the recommendation of previous guidelines to aim at a lower BP in diabetics and in patients at very high cardiovascular risk is not consistently supported by trial evidence. Moreover, the J-curve phenomenon may occur in patients at high cardiovascular risk. With regard to the choice of antihypertensive drugs, the conclusions of the 2007 guidelines that diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers are suitable for initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment are reinforced. Furthermore, apart from starting with combination therapy in certain conditions, adding a drug from another class to the initially prescribed one is preferred to increasing the dose of the first one. Some of the drug combinations recommended in 2007 are now regarded as more recommendable. In addition to the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly, the HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) has shown that antihypertensive treatment also has benefits in octogenarians.

    "365": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors) increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects on serum potassium levels of RAAS inhibitors. Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 assessing the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD); 39 studies were identified. In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (< or =2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition ( approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small ( approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%). Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover, these patients are likely to derive benefit from RAAS inhibition. Rather than denying them an effective treatment, electrolyte levels should be closely monitored in these patients.",

Three types of CRV are distinguished (low, medium, and high-amplitude). Differential hypotensive therapy is recommended depending on the initial CRV level. Patients with AH and markedly narrowed CRV spectrum should be treated with beta-adrenoblockers, those with moderate and elevated CRV with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists respectively.

For this purpose, we generated podocyte-specific knockout mice for the AT(1) gene (Agtr1a) and crossed with NEP25, in which selective podocyte injury can be induced by immunotoxin, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38. Four weeks after the addition of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio was not attenuated in Agtr1a knockout/NEP25 mice (n=18) compared with that in control NEP25 mice (n=13; 8.08+/-2.41 in knockout versus 4.84+/-0.73 in control). Both strains of mice showed similar degrees of sclerosis (0.66+/-0.17 versus 0.82+/-0.27 on a 0 to 4 scale) and downregulation of nephrin (5.78+/-0.45 versus 5.65+/-0.58 on a 0 to 8 scale). In contrast, AT(1) antagonist or an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, but not hydralazine, remarkably attenuated proteinuria and sclerosis in NEP25 mice. Moreover, continuous angiotensin II infusion induced microalbuminuria similarly in both Agtr1a knockout and wild-type mice. Thus, angiotensin inhibition can protect podocytes and prevent the development of glomerulosclerosis independent of podocyte AT(1). Possible mechanisms include inhibitory effects on AT(1) of other cells or through mechanisms independent of AT(1). Our study further demonstrates that measures that directly affect only nonpodocyte cells can have beneficial effects even when sclerosis is triggered by podocyte-specific injury.",

To define nmMLCK involvement further in acute inflammatory syndromes, we used two murine models of inflammatory lung injury, induced by either an intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS model) or mechanical ventilation with increased tidal volumes (the VILI model). Intravenous delivery of the membrane-permeant MLC kinase peptide inhibitor, PIK, produced a dose-dependent attenuation of both LPS-induced lung inflammation and VILI (~50% reductions in alveolar/vascular permeability and leukocyte influx). Intravenous injections of nmMLCK silencing RNA, either directly or as cargo within angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) antibody-conjugated liposomes (to target the pulmonary vasculature selectively), decreased nmMLCK lung expression (\u223c70% reduction) and significantly attenuated LPS-induced and VILI-induced lung inflammation (\u223c40% reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage protein). Compared with wild-type mice, nmMLCK knockout mice were significantly protected from VILI, with significant reductions in VILI-induced gene expression in biological pathways such as nrf2-mediated oxidative stress, coagulation, p53-signaling, leukocyte extravasation, and IL-6-signaling. These studies validate nmMLCK as an attractive target for ameliorating the adverse effects of dysregulated lung inflammation.",

The results showed that telmisartan was as effective as ramipril for the primary cardiovascular outcome during a 56-month follow-up but was better tolerated. However, dual RAS blockade was not associated with any additional benefits, and the incidence of adverse events was greater with the combination. Based on these findings, optimal cardioprotective strategies in high-risk patients are likely to involve the addition of either telmisartan or ramipril on top of the patient's usual care, but not both.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.", 
    "473": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays key roles throughout the cardiovascular continuum, and blockade of this system--either through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or through angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonism--now occupies a central place in the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Understanding of the RAS has expanded in recent years with the identification of new pathways for formation of angiotensin II and novel effector peptides, such as angiotensin-(1-7), which may constitute new therapeutic targets. A substantial proportion of the benefits of ACE inhibitors, including vasodilation, improvements in endothelial function, and inhibition of cell proliferation, appear to be attributable to decreases in angiotensin II and increases in bradykinin. In addition, however, there is evidence that other mechanisms, such as modulation of ACE signaling, may also contribute. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively block AT(1) receptors and allow unopposed stimulation of AT(2) receptors, with potentially beneficial vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. As a result, these agents share many of the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to exert multiple antiatherogenic actions, and to reduce clinical events in high-risk participants; their use is recommended in current guidelines for the secondary prevention of CVD.", 
    "474": "Current epidemiologic predictions show that the world is heading for a vascular tsunami of pandemic proportions. The number of people at high risk from cardiovascular disease is increasing; recent cohort studies suggest that only 2%-7% of the general population have no risk factors at all, and >70% of at-risk individuals have multiple risk factors. The recently published Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study, which showed that telmisartan was as effective as ramipril in the prevention of a range of cardiovascular outcomes, enrolled a broad cross section of high-risk patients. This population was chosen to reflect the type of patients encountered in general practice, and because the proportion of high-risk individuals is increasing worldwide, the ONTARGET results will be relevant for most at-risk patients. Further analysis of the ONTARGET results may also aid in the development of risk estimation scores populated with real-life data and could also determine the impact of treatment on the long-term reduction of total cardiovascular burden (ie, absolute risk reduction). This may be a particularly useful exercise because current risk estimation charts have limitations in their scope, sensitivity, and the ability to reflect changes in risk.",

    "479": "Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of hypertension, and it results from the imbalanced release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRFs; in particular, nitric oxide) and endothelium-derived contracting factors (EDCFs; angiotensin II, endothelins, uridine adenosine tetraphosphate, and cyclooxygenase-derived EDCFs). Thus, drugs that increase EDRFs (using direct nitric oxide releasing compounds, tetrahydrobiopterin, or L-arginine supplementation) or decrease EDCF release or actions (using cyclooxygenase inhibitor or thromboxane A2/prostanoid receptor antagonists) would prevent the dysfunction. Many conventional antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and third-generation beta-blockers, possess the ability to reverse endothelial dysfunction. Their use is attractive, as they can address arterial blood pressure and vascular tone simultaneously. The severity of endothelial dysfunction correlates with the development of coronary artery disease and predicts future cardiovascular events. Thus, endothelial dysfunction needs to be considered as a strategic target in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "480": "It has been shown that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. The aim of this work was to study and compare the molecular mechanisms of the antioxidant properties of l-carnitine and captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Antioxidant enzyme activity/regulation (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase) was measured in the erythrocytes and hearts of SHR. The molecular expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), NADPH oxidase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1) receptor) and NF-kappaB/IkappaB system was also measured in the hearts of these animals. Both l-carnitine and captopril augmented the antioxidant defense capacity in SHRs. This effect was mediated by an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, an increase in the plasma total antioxidant capacity and a reduction of lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion production in the heart. The administration of both compounds to hypertensive animals also produced an upregulation of eNOS and a normalization of ACE, angiotensin AT(1) receptor, and the NF-kappaB/IkappaB system expression. In addition, captopril reduced the arterial blood pressure and the relative heart weights back to control values, whereas l-carnitine caused only a partial reduction of blood pressure values and did not alter the cardiac hypertrophy found in SHRs. In conclusion, we have found that l-carnitine and captopril have a similar antioxidant effect in the hearts of hypertensive rats. The molecular regulation of antioxidant enzymes through an inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and a modulation of the NF-kappaB/IkappaB system seems to be responsible for this antioxidant effect.", 
    "481": "Stress stability testing and forced degradation were used to determine the stability of enalapril maleate (EM) and to find a degradation pathway for the drug. The degradation impurities, formed under different stressed conditions, were investigated by HPLC and UPLC-MS methods. HPLC analysis showed several degradation impurities of which several were already determined, but on oxidation in the presence of magnesium monoperoxyphthalate (MMPP) several impurities of EM were observed which were not yet characterized. The HPLC methods for determination of EM were validated. The linearity of HPLC method was established in the concentration range between 0.5 and 10 microg/mL with correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. The LOD of EM was 0.2 microg/mL and LOQ was 0.5 microg/mL. The validated HPLC method was used to determine the degradation impurities in samples after stress stability testing and forced degradation of EM. In order to identify new degradation impurities of EM after forced degradation UPLC-MS/MS(n), Orbitrap has been used.

    "482": "Sublethal doses of whole brain irradiation (WBI) are commonly administered therapeutically and frequently result in late delayed radiation injuries, manifesting as severe and irreversible cognitive impairment. Neural progenitors within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus are among the most radiosensitive cell types in the adult brain and are known to participate in hippocampal plasticity and normal cognitive function. These progenitors and the specialized SZG microenvironment required for neuronal differentiation are the source of neurogenic potential in the adult dentate gyrus, and provide a continuous supply of immature neurons which may then migrate into the adjacent granule cell layer to become mature granule cell neurons. The extreme radiosensitivity of these progenitors and the SGZ microenvironment suggests the hippocampus as a prime target for radiation-induced cognitive impairment. The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has previously been implicated as a potent modulator of neurogenesis within the SGZ and selective RAS inhibitors have been implicated as mitigators of radiation brain injury. Here we investigate the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation injury in this context.",

    "486": "A prospective, open label, parallel group and randomized study was conducted to see the effect of enalapril and losartan on proteinuria in type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients. 18 patients (proteinuria 2 0.5 gm/day and serum creatinine <3 mg/dL) were selected and then randomly grouped to receive enalapril (5-40 mg/day, n=10) and losartan (25-200 mg/day, n=8) in increasing dose for 16 weeks. No statistically significant alteration in the urinary total protein, protein creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum potassium and blood pressure was observed in any group. After attaining maximum dose (40 mg and 200 mg respectively), enalapril group showed significant (p < 0.04) reduction of protein creatinine ratio in comparison to losartan group. It may be concluded that 40 mg enalapril or 200 mg losartan are not sufficient to reduce proteinuria and blood pressure significantly in type 2 proteinuric diabetics with renal dysfunction although both drugs were well tolerated at high doses.",

Heart failure alone accounts for more than 1 million hospital admissions annually and has one of the highest ED morbidity and mortality to date (). Historically, CPE has been managed by the treating clinician in a manner that is based largely on anecdotal evidence. Furosemide (Lasix), morphine, and nitroglycerin have historically been the baseline standard for drug therapy in CPE management. A lack of drastic improvement in the patient's condition over the course of the ED visit may reflect a management style that results in higher morbidity and mortality for CPE patients. Several recent articles provide evidence-based outcomes that suggest changing standard therapy along with the adjunctive use of other medications. These articles also describe treatment modalities that result in a marked improvement in the management of patients with CPE along with decreases in adverse outcomes and hospital length of stay. The goal of this article is to present a summary of the evidence regarding the management of CPE and discuss the implications for current practice.",

Since the circulating RAAS is inhibited in this model, it permits examination of the role of local tissue RAASs in mediating this injury. To this end, male 8-wk SHR were divided into 7 groups. The control group (C) received normal NaCl (0.6%) diet. All other groups were given 8% NaCl chow. In addition, group 2 was given placebo, group 3 the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker eplerenone (100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), group 4 the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril (3 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), group 5 the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), and groups 6 and 7 eplerenone and either quinapril or candesartan. The treatments lasted 8 wk. Compared with controls, mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow, coronary flow reserve, minimal coronary vascular resistance, diastolic time constant, and maximal rate of ventricular pressure fall were all adversely affected by salt loading. Left ventricular mass and fibrosis as well as proteinuria were also markedly increased by salt overload. Eplerenone induced only slight changes, whereas quinapril and candesartan normalized all indexes except MAP. Combination therapy also normalized all indexes, including MAP. These data suggest that 1) cardiovascular and renal damage induced by salt excess in the SHR were not pressure dependent; 2) mineralocorticoids were only marginally involved in this model; and 3) local tissue generation of angiotensin II may be, at least in part, responsible for the other adverse effects.",

The prevalence of CHF increases with advancing life span, with diastolic heart failure predominating in the elderly population. Primary prevention of coronary artery disease and risk factor management via aggressive blood pressure control are central in preventing new occurrences of left ventricular dysfunction. Optimal therapy for CHF involves identification and correction of potentially reversible precipitants, target-dose titration of medical therapy, and management of hospitalizations for decompensation. The etiological phenotype, absolute decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and a widening of QRS duration on electrocardiography, is commonly used to identify patients at increased risk of progression of heart failure and sudden death who may benefit from prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Medical therapy focuses on comprehensive risk factor modification. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (including weight management, physical activity, tobacco cessation, and dietary modification) improve cardiac risk factors and are universally recommended by evidence-based guidelines. Treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia reduces morbidity and mortality. Recommendations for persons with diabetes mellitus generally encourage glucose control, but current evidence has not shown reductions in mortality with intensive glucose management.

Blockade of the system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is regarded as the first-line approach to managing hypertension and end-organ protection in patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are still the preferred agents for most patients. Dose should be lower with renal impairment unless an agent which is not excreted by the kidneys is chosen. Dose should be titrated up to the maximum tolerated to optimize end-organ protection, and intermediate-acting agents should be given in a twice daily divided dose when higher doses are used. Electrolytes should be checked before commencing, 1-2 weeks later, and after each dose increment. A modest decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increase in creatinine often occurs with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The agents may need to be discontinued if eGFR decreases by >15%, if creatinine increases by >20%, or if hyperkalemia develops. Cough occurs in 5-10% of patients taking ACE inhibitor, but not with ARBs. Angioedema is probably equally common with ACE inhibitor or ARBs. It is not widely appreciated that ACE inhibitors may precipitate hypoglycaemia in patients taking glucose-lowering medication. The combination of ACE inhibitor and ARB is not routinely indicated for either hypertension or end-organ protection.

Angioedema is a very rare side effect associated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and even rarer so with ARBs. The cause for angioedema in ACE inhibitors is said to be the rise in bradykinin levels. It has been postulated that angiotensin II receptor activates the bradykinin-prostaglandin-nitric oxide cascade, resulting in bradykinin-mediated side effects of ARBs such as angioedema, but the true mechanism remains largely unknown. We present here a rare case of late onset angioedema associated with losartan (an ARB) in a female patient. She had been started on an ARB as a first line treatment for uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension. She had no prior exposure to ACE inhibitors and did not have any other significant medical history.

We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 328 patients with nephrotic syndrome resulting from idiopathic membranous nephropathy that initially received conservative therapy. Spontaneous remission occurred in 104 (32%) patients: proteinuria progressively declined after diagnosis until remission of disease at 14.7 +/- 11.4 months. Although spontaneous remission was more frequent with lower levels of baseline proteinuria, it also frequently occurred in patients with massive proteinuria: 26% among those with baseline proteinuria 8 to 12 g/24 h and 22% among those with proteinuria >12 g/24 h. Baseline serum creatinine and proteinuria, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, and a >50% decline of proteinuria from baseline during the first year of follow-up were significant independent predictors for spontaneous remission. Only six patients (5.7%) experienced a relapse of nephrotic syndrome. The incidence of death and ESRD were significantly lower among patients with spontaneous remission. In conclusion, spontaneous remission is common among patients with nephrotic syndrome resulting from membranous nephropathy and carries a favorable long-term outcome with a low incidence of relapse. A decrease in proteinuria >50% from baseline during the first year predicts spontaneous remission.",

All hypertensive mice featured a thickened aortic wall, increased levels of Cx37 and Cx45 in SMC, and of Cx40 in EC (except in Cx40(-/-) mice). Cx43 was up-regulated, with no effect on its S368 phosphorylation, only in the SMCs of renin-dependent models of hypertension. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system of Cx40(-/-) mice normalized blood pressure and prevented both aortic thickening and Cx alterations. Ex vivo exposure of WT aortas, carotids, and mesenteric arteries to physiologically relevant levels of angiotensin II (AngII) increased the levels of Cx43, but not of other Cx.

    "556": "One-hundred years ago, Starling articulated the interdependence of renal control of circulating blood volume and effective cardiac performance. During the past 25 years, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the interdependence of blood pressure (BP), extracellular fluid volume (ECFV), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have begun to be revealed. These variables all converge on regulation of renal proximal tubule (PT) sodium transport. The PT reabsorbs two-thirds of the filtered Na(+) and volume at baseline. This fraction is decreased when BP or perfusion pressure is increased, during a high-salt diet (elevated ECFV), and during inhibition of the production of ANG II; conversely, this fraction is increased by ANG II, SNS activation, and a low-salt diet. These variables all regulate the distribution of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and the Na(+)-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi2), along the apical microvilli of the PT. Natriuretic stimuli provoke the dynamic redistribution of these transporters along with associated regulators, molecular motors, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins to the base of the microvilli. The lipid raft-associated NHE3 remains at the base, and the nonraft-associated NaPi2 is endocytosed, culminating in decreased Na(+) transport and increased PT flow rate. Antinatriuretic stimuli return the same transporters and regulators to the body of the microvilli associated with an increase in transport activity and decrease in PT flow rate. In summary, ECFV and BP homeostasis are, at least in part, maintained by continuous and acute redistribution of transporter complexes up and down the PT microvilli, which affect regulation of PT sodium reabsorption in response to fluctuations in ECFV, BP, SNS, and RAS.",

We tested whether uptitration of loop diuretics on top of combined half doses of ACEI and ARB would better decrease proteinuria than uptitration to combined full doses of ACEI and ARB in a randomized, crossover, three periods of 6-week controlled study. Eighteen patients with stable proteinuria over 1 g/day with combined ramipril at 5 mg/day and valsartan at 80 mg/day in addition to conventional antihypertensive treatments were randomized to receive combined ramipril at 5 mg/day and valsartan at 80 mg/day, or combined ramipril at 10 mg/day and valsartan at 160 mg/day, or combined ramipril at 5 mg/day, valsartan at 80 mg/day and increased furosemide dosage in random order.

These differences remained significant after adjustment for SBP, DBP or MAP and 24-hour natriuresis but not after adjustment on eGFR.

ACE inhibitors and their newer cousins, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), are powerful medications for the prevention of progression of diabetic renal disease. Unfortunately, among the elderly, these medications have been underutilized. The reasons for this include physician concerns regarding patient age and limited life expectancy and potential complications of ACE inhibitor or ARB use, specifically an increase in creatinine levels and hyperkalaemia. As discussed in this article, there have been several studies that show that the effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system can be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and renal disease among elderly patients with diabetes and that the potential risks mentioned above are no greater in this group than in the general population. For these reasons, several professional societies recommend that elderly patients with diabetes and hypertension (systolic blood pressure >or=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >or=90 mmHg) be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB (as is recommended for younger diabetics). Use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is also recommended for those with cardiovascular disease or those who are at risk of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in the management of diabetic kidney disease in elderly patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is also recommended to reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy. Renal function and potassium levels should be monitored within the first 12 weeks of initiation of these medications, with each dose increase, and on a yearly basis thereafter. This article summarizes the current guidelines on the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in older adults with diabetes, reviews the evidence for their use in the elderly population, and suggests potential reasons for the observed underuse of these powerful drugs in this vulnerable population.",

Data were collected from hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease Program (GWTG-CAD) from January 2000 to December 2008. In-hospital outcomes and quality of care were stratified by care at rural versus urban hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of rural locale with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and compliance with the GWTG-CAD performance measurements including (1) early aspirin use, (2) smoking cessation counseling and discharge prescriptions of (3) aspirin, (4) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers for left ventricular systolic dysfunction, (5) beta-blockers, and (6) lipid-lowering therapy and a composite of all 6 measurements. Data were collected from 22,096 patients at 71 rural centers and 329,938 patients at 477 urban centers. Unadjusted rates of compliance with performance measurements were lower in rural (range 82.4% to 90.5%) compared to urban (range 81.3% to 95.0%) hospitals including the composite (74.7% vs 80.6%, p <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, rural status was not independently associated with lower compliance with any of the performance measurements. Unadjusted mortality rates were higher in rural versus urban hospitals (5.7% vs 4.4%, p <0.0001), but this was not significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.26). In conclusion, within the GWTG-CAD quality improvement initiative, patients with CAD treated at rural hospitals receive similar quality of care and have similar outcomes as those at urban centers.",

To assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on in-stent restenosis and its relation to apoptosis, 86 patients with chronic coronary artery disease who required stent implantation in the left anterior descending coronary artery or a major diagonal branch were studied. Patients were randomized to receive quinapril 40 mg/day orally (n = 43) or a placebo (n = 43). Drug therapy was initiated 1 week before initial stenting and continued for 6 months. Plasma levels of the apoptotic signaling molecules soluble Fas and soluble Fas ligand obtained from blood drawn from the left anterior descending coronary artery were measured just before initial stenting and 6 months later, at the time of repeat coronary angiography. In-stent restenosis was present in 9.3% of patients in the quinapril group and 25.6% of patients in the placebo group (p = 0.047). Mean late luminal loss was 0.56 +/- 0.51 mm in the quinapril group and 0.95 +/- 0.95 mm in the placebo group (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in plasma soluble Fas or soluble Fas ligand levels at baseline. At 6 months, the change in plasma soluble Fas level was significantly higher in the quinapril group (0.72 +/- 1.24 ng/ml) than in the placebo group (0.28 +/- 0.72 ng/ml) (p = 0.024). The change in plasma soluble Fas ligand levels at 6 months was significantly higher in the quinapril group (7.43 +/- 12.2 pg/ml) than in the placebo group (0.06 +/- 6.8 pg/ml) (p = 0.002).

Black patients have a higher prevalence and earlier onset of hypertension than other ethnic groups, with poorer prognosis than white patients.

Despite many advances in the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, black patients continue to have increased morbidity and mortality from the end-organ complications of hypertension. The explanations for these observations remain incompletely understood, but genetic differences, added to socio-economic and environmental factors, have been proposed to explain this disparity. The first therapeutic approach is to decrease salt and increase potassium intakes. Diuretics (thiazides and potassium-sparing agents) and calcium channel blockers constitute the first antihypertensive drug choices. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers appear to be less effective in blacks with regard to uncomplicated hypertension, especially in older people, but addition of a small dose of diuretic improves their efficacy. These combinations are preferred among patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure.

Upon admission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable and exhibited tenderness of the epigastric region. Elevated pancreatic enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Common causes of pancreatitis were ruled out, and it was determined that the recent combination of lisinopril and olanzapine was the likely cause. Food and liquids were withheld, and all oral medications were stopped at hospital admission. Her pain resolved completely after two days. She was discharged on hospital day 4, and all of her medications except lisinopril and olanzapine were resumed. During a follow-up visit with her primary care physician, she reported to be doing well and had no systemic complaints. Olanzapine was reinitiated at that time but was discontinued a month later by her psychiatrist, who was concerned about the development of recurrent symptoms of pancreatitis.

The ERK1/2 activities, estimated as phospho-Elk-1 content, were also increased at 4 and 16 weeks of inducing volume overload. The increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 and E-26-like (Elk)-1 protein content in 16 weeks failing hearts was much greater than that in 4 weeks hypertrophied hearts. These changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Elk-1 protein content in both 4 and 16 weeks volume overloaded animals were attenuated by treatment with enalapril and/or losartan. The results indicate that activation of ERK1/2 may be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure due to volume overload, and these changes are partially prevented by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).",

These drugs produce severe adverse drug effects (ADEs) such as nephrotoxicity, posttransplantation diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Accumulated evidence suggests that the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure may be associated with specific DNA genotypes. In this review, the genes involved with the development of these disease processes are compared with those implicated in calcineurin inhibitor-induced ADEs. The renin-angiotensin system genes, cytokine-encoding genes, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 genes have been implicated in calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity, as well as in development of renal failure. A number of genes are implicated in contributing to diabetes, and these include the vitamin D receptor gene, VDR; hepatocyte nuclear factor genes, HNF; transcription factor 7-like 2 gene, TCF7L2; angiotensin-converting enzyme gene, ACE; cytokines; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene, PPARG; and others. Studies have suggested that the VDR, PPARG, HNF1A, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette ABCC8 (which encodes the sulfonylurea receptor) genes are associated with calcineurin inhibitor-induced diabetes. The genes encoding for the angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase, and cytochrome P450 3A isoenzyme have been involved in the development of hypertension and in calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension. The genetic study of disease states can be the stepping stones for thoroughly understanding the genetic basis of ADEs. Gene polymorphisms are implicated in the development of diseases and corresponding disease-like ADEs. The disease-associated genes provide candidate genes for exploring ADEs and may provide genomic biomarkers for assessing the risk for developing severe calcineurin inhibitor-related ADEs as well as for developing preventive strategies.",

One group of 26 patients was medicated with 10 mg ramipril per day only; a second group of 29 patients took Pycnogenol in addition to the ACE inhibitor over a period of 6 months. At trial end, a lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found in both groups, with a significant further reduction of diastolic pressure in the group given Pycnogenol in addition to ramipril. The major aim of this study was the investigation of kidney-protective effects of Pycnogenol. Urinary albumin decreased from 87 +/- 23 to 64 +/- 16 mg/d with ramipril only. Additional Pycnogenol lowered albumin significantly better from 91 +/- 25 to 39 +/- 13 mg/day (P < .05). In both groups, serum creatinine was lowered; however, only in the combination treatment group did the effect reached statistical significance. In both groups, CRP levels decreased from 2.1 to 1.8 with ramipril and from 2.2 to 1.1 with the ramipril-Pycnogenol combination; the latter reached statistical significance. Kidney cortical flow velocity was investigated by Doppler color duplex ultrasonography. Both systolic and diastolic flow velocities increased significantly after 6 months medication with ramipril. The addition of Pycnogenol to the regimen statistically significantly further enhanced kidney cortical flow velocities, by 8% for diastolic flow and 12% for systolic flow, relative to values found for the group taking ramipril only.

    "645": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a common element of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), is involved in myelopoiesis modulation, mainly by cleaving the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP). Based on this finding and in our results showing B1 and B2 kinin receptors expression in murine bone marrow (BM) cells, we evaluated the ACE influence on myelopoiesis of kinin B1 receptor knockout mice (B1KO) using long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs). Captopril and AcSDKP were used as controls. Enhanced ACE activity, expressed by non-hematopoietic cells (Ter-199(-) and CD45(-)), was observed in B1KO LTBMCs when compared to wild-type (WT) cells. ACE hyperfunction in B1KO cells was maintained when LTBMCs from B1KO mice were treated with captopril (1.0microM) or AcSDKP (1.0nM). Although no alterations were observed in ACE mRNA and protein levels under these culture conditions, 3.0nM of AcSDKP increased ACE mRNA levels in WT LTBMCs. No alteration in the number of GM-CFC was seen in B1KO mice compared to WT animals, even when the former were treated with AcSDKP (10microg/kg) or captopril (100mg/kg) for 4 consecutive days. Hematological data also revealed no differences between WT and B1KO mice under basal conditions. When the animals received 4 doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a decreased number of blood cells was detected in B1KO mice in relation to WT. We also found a decreased percentage of Gr1(+)/Mac-1(+), Ter119(+), B220(+), CD3(+), and Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) cells in the BM of B1KO mice compared to WT animals. Low AcSDKP levels were observed in BM cultures from B1KO in comparison to WT cultures. We conclude that ACE hyperfunction in B1KO mice resulted in faster hydrolysis of AcSDKP peptide, which in turn decreased in BM tissues allowing HSC to enter the S stage of the cell cycle.", 
    "646": "The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the capacity of Labrasol as surfactant for self-nanoemulsification efficiency of ramipril nanoemulsion formulation. Based on the solubility profile of ramipril, Sefsol-218, Labrasol and Carbitol were selected as oil phase, surfactant and cosurfactant, respectively. Based on the stability profile of ramipril, standard buffer solution of pH 5.0 was selected as an aqueous phase for the development of ramipril nanoemulsion formulation. Nanoemulsion formulations of ramipril were developed using an aqueous phase titration method. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the nanoemulsion region. Selected formulations were subjected to different thermodynamic stability tests using centrifugation, heating cooling cycles and freeze thaw cycles. The formulations which were stable at thermodynamic stability tests were taken for self-nanoemulsification efficiency test. No creaming, cracking, coalescence or phase inversion was observed on most of the formulations upon thermodynamic stability tests. All the formulations passed self-nanoemulsification tests in grade C, D and E but not in grade A and B. Because none of the formulation passed self-nanoemulsification efficiency test in grade A and B, it was concluded that Labrasol is not suitable as surfactant for oral or self nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of ramipril.",

Indeed the most common procedure for the treatment of access stenosis and thrombosis is the same model for the creation and study of intimal hyperplasia. The evolution of our understanding of vascular thrombosis is reviewed with a current concept that includes a dynamic interplay of the biophysics, chemistry and biology of the blood vessel with the blood and its constituents. Implications for possible future interventions based on these novel concepts are offered, and the significance of improving our understanding of the pathobiology is emphasized.", 
    "648": "A sustained status of chronic inflammation is closely linked to several complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as vascular degeneration, myocardial fibrosis, loss of appetite, insulin resistance, increased muscle catabolism and anemia. These consequences of a chronically activated immune system impact on the acceleration of atherosclerosis, vascular calcification and development of heart dysfunction. Recent evidence suggests that these immune-mediated consequences of uremic toxicity are not only important to stratify the risk and understand the mechanisms of disease, but also represent an important area for intervention. Thus, the aim of this brief review is to discuss the immune mechanisms behind atherosclerosis and myocardiopathy in CKD. We also display the emerging evidence that strategies focusing on modulating the immune response or reducing the generation of triggers of inflammation may represent an important tool to reduce mortality in this group of patients. Ongoing studies may generate the evidence that will translate these strategies to definitive changes in clinical practice.", 
    "649": "Hypertension is present in most patients with end-stage renal disease and likely contributes to the premature cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. Previous practice guidelines have recommended that, in patients on chronic dialysis, blood pressure (BP) should be reduced below 130/80 mm Hg. This is based on opinions but not strong evidence, since no concrete information exists about which BP values should be the parameter to follow and which should be the target BP values. The majority of the antihypertensive agents can be used in this population, but the pharmacokinetics altered by the impaired kidney function and dialyzability influence the appropriate dosage as well as the time and frequency of administration. Combination therapy using multiple agents is often necessary. Because of the prevalence of overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic tone as well as the high calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells in dialysis patients, drugs acting in these three specific systems may potentially have additional cardioprotective benefits beyond their BP-lowering effect. Thus, antihypertensive regimens should preferably be based on these classes of drugs, alone or in combination. Other antihypertensive drug classes can play a complementary role.",

Indeed, pretreatment of THP-1 macrophages with an MMP-2/9 inhibitor (20 micromol/L, 4 hours) attenuated OxLDL-induced foam-cell formation. Imidaprilat or the MMP-2/9 inhibitor blocked OxLDL-induced expressions of LOX-1 and scavenger receptor-A (SR-A), but not that of CD36, in THP-1 macrophages. In addition, OxLDL-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ERK, but not JNK, was blunted by imidaprilat or the MMP-2/9 inhibitor. Finally, siRNA against MMP-9 inhibited foam cell formation as well as lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages.",

    "661": "To determine the surface acidity and stability profiles of quinapril hydrochloride (QHCl) coground with silicates, solid-state equivalent pH (pHeq) of amorphous samples was measured by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using pH indicator probes. Calibration curves for pH indicators were developed in buffer solutions. Amorphous samples with and without pH indicators were prepared by cryo-grinding. Different pH grades of silicates and various QHCl/silicate ratios were used to make amorphous samples over a range of surface acidity. Diffuse reflectance spectra of amorphous samples were measured and pHeq was determined using the calibration curves of pH indicators developed in solution. Suspension pH of amorphous samples was also measured. The chemical stability of coground amorphous samples was assessed at 40 degrees C and 0% or 48% RH. The chemical stability of neat amorphous quinapril lyophilized from solutions over a range of pH was also assessed at 40 degrees C/0% RH and the reconstituted pH-stability profile of lyophiles was determined. For all silicate and QHCl/silicate amorphous samples, the same pH rank order was obtained based on pHeq and suspension pH. However, the pHeq was significantly lower than the corresponding suspension pH. Discrepancies between pH-stability profiles based on the pHeq and the suspension pH were observed. In general, the pHeq- and reconstituted pH-stability profiles were essentially identical, but the suspension pH-stability profile deviated from the reconstituted pH-stability profile by 2-3 pH units. The results indicate that solid-state surface acidity measurement provides a more accurate prediction of the effective surface acidity of amorphous formulations than the suspension pH. In conclusion, solid-state surface acidity measurement of excipients and solid formulations using pH indicator probes as surrogates can be used to determine the ionization state of the drug and to predict the chemical stability profile of the drug in actual solid formulations.",

Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, active smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and inactivity are the major cardiovascular risk factors, which can produce compounding effects on human health, leading to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We review the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors and explain the rationale for using ACE inhibitors not only in hypertensive patients but also in patients with congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or coronary artery disease. ACE inhibitors can reduce preload and afterload on the heart, prevent ventricular remodeling, and even retard atherogenic changes in the vessel walls. ACE inhibitors can also be helpful in slowing the progression of kidney disease, especially in diabetics. Some studies such as the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk individuals. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in regulating blood pressure and body volume in the human body. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are the two classes of antihypertensives that primarily act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

To improve the quality of life and prolong life, the treatment goal is no longer just temporary improvement of symptoms, more importantly, is to prevent and delay the occurrence and development of ventricular remodeling. Long-term chronic over-activation of sympathetic system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and other neuroendocrine factors promotes myocardial remodeling, increases myocardial injury and deteriorates cardiac function. Despite short-term use can significantly improve the blood flow dynamics, long-term use of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulators and phosphodiesterase inhibitors does not prolong life, but increases the rate of sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have become the preferred drugs in treating chronic heart failure. In fact, after long-term use, beta-blockers can significantly improve ventricular remodeling, enhance ventricular function and reduce the incidence of sudden death of patients with CHF. In traditional Chinese medicine practice, short-term use of drugs for warming yang and reinforcing qi can improve symptoms of CHF, but long-term use may have adverse effects, for these medicines can stimulate sympathetic system. Early treatment with medicines of cold and cool property may be more favorable to patients with CHF, except the advanced patients who need special intervention. Eliminating heat and nourishing yin may play more active role in controlling the occurrence and development of CHF. Drugs with good efficacy and value in treating CHF may be developed from the Chinese herbal medicines with eliminating heat and nourishing yin property.",

The methods are based on the bromination of captopril with a solution of excess brominating mixture in hydrochloric acid medium. After bromination, the excess brominating mixture is followed by the estimation of surplus bromine by three different reaction schemes. In the first method (A), the determination of the residual bromine is based on its ability to bleach the indigo carmine dye and measuring the absorbance at 610 nm. Method B, involves treating the unreacted bromine with a measured excess of iron(II) and the remaining iron(II) is complexed with 1,10-phenanthroline and the increase in absorbance is measured at 510 nm. In method (C), the surplus bromine is treated with excess of iron(II) and the resulting iron(III) is complexed with thiocyanate and the absorbance is measured at 478 nm. In all the methods, the amount of bromine reacted corresponds to the drug content. The different experimental parameters affecting the development and stability of the color are carefully studied and optimized. Beer's law is valid within a concentration range of 0.4-6.0, 0.4-2.8 and 1.2-4.8 microg mL(-1) for methods A, B and C, respectively. The calculated apparent molar absorptivity was found to be 5.16x10(4), 9.95x10(4) and 1.74x10(5)L mol(-1) cm(-1), for methods A, B and C, respectively. Sandell's sensitivity, correlation coefficients, detection and quantification limits are also reported. No interference was observed from common additives found in pharmaceutical preparations.

The incidence of persistent AF at 1 year was 26 per 1000 person-years, ranging from 15 in New York Heart Association class I/II to 44 in class III/IV. AF occurred either at the same time or prior to HF in 76% of patients and following HF in 24%. A risk score was developed to predict the occurrence of persistent AF. The annual risk of persistent AF developing was 0.5% (0%-1.3%) for those in the low-risk group compared with 15% (3.4%-26.6%) in the high-risk group. Despite a high prevalence of persistent AF in patients with HF, the incidence of persistent AF is relatively low. This is predominantly due to AF coinciding with or preceding the development of HF. The annual risk of persistent AF developing can be estimated from clinical variables.",

This study examined the antihypertensive effects of EGCG3''Me and Benifuuki tea. First, it was determined that EGCG3''Me has a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Second, clinical trials showed that Benifuuki tea suppressed high blood pressure to a greater extent than green tea that did not contain EGCG3''Me after equal amounts of tea catechins were consumed for 8 weeks. The effect of Benifuuki tea on human hypertension is mainly the result of the strong inhibitory effect of EGCG3''Me on ACE activity, its high rate of absorption, and its stability in the blood.",

Recently, prorenin bound to (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) was found and shown to evoke two pathways; the generation of Ang peptides and the receptor-dependent activation of extracellular signal-related protein kinase (ERK).

Several registries have shown that evidence based treatments are under-utilised in this patient population, particularly in high-risk patients. There is evidence that systematic educational programmes can lead to improvement in the management of these patients.

    "737": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is very common within the first 5 days of cardiac surgery. It is associated with significant morbidity including stroke, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, acute kidney injury, prolonged hospital stay, and also short- and long-term mortality. The underlying mechanisms of developing AF after cardiac surgery are multifactorial; risk factors may include advanced age, withdrawal of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, valve surgery, obesity, increased left atrial size, and diastolic dysfunction. There are many pharmacological options in preventing AF, but none of them are effective for all patients and they all have significant limitations. Beta-blockers may reduce the incidence of AF by more than a third, but bradycardia, hypotension, or exacerbation of heart failure often limit their utility postoperatively. Recent evidence suggests that class III antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol and amiodarone, are more effective than beta-blockers, but they both share similar hemodynamic side effects of beta-blockers. Magnesium, antiinflammatory drugs such as statins, omega fatty acids, and low-dose corticosteroids also have some efficacy and they have the advantages of not causing significant hemodynamic side effects. Data on effectiveness of calcium channel blockers, digoxin, alpha-2 agonists, sodium nitroprusside, and N-acetylcysteine are more limited. Because the pathogenesis of AF is multifactorial, a combination of drugs with different pharmacological actions may have additive or synergistic effect in preventing AF after cardiac surgery. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of a multimodality pharmacological approach in patients at high-risk of AF after cardiac surgery are needed.",

Because prior studies demonstrated sex-related differences in many aspects of HF care (in the appropriate use and dosing of evidence-based therapy and in the individual response to pharmacological treatment between women and men with HF). In general, benefit of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and spironolactone in clinical trials was similar, regardless ofgender. Women with HF appear to have significantly lower mortality rates on ARBs than on the more standard HF therapy (ACE inhibitors), but there was no difference in survival in men prescribed ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors. In a post hoc subgroup analysis digoxin was associated with a increased risk of death from any cause among women with HF, but not men. ACE inhibitor-induced cough was more frequent among women. The risk ofhyperkalemia was increased with male gender in HF patients treated with candesartan. The use ofspironolactone was inversely associated with fractures in men with CHF. Previous studies have suggested that female with HF are less likely received guideline-recommended therapies (in appropriate doses). Female patients with HF were less likely to receive certain guideline-recommended evidence-based treatments, but the influence of patient sex on delivery of these therapies was disappeared when the objective reasons for non-using of these therapies were taken into account. These sex differences could have potential widespread implications for routine heart failure care.", 
    "743": "Aliskiren (Rasilez), a direct renin inhibitor, is currently indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension, as monotherapy or in combination, especially with hydrochlorothiazide (Rasilez HCT). It may also be use to obtain a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) when it is associated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (or an AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist) (ARA). There is some room for agents that may be more efficacious in reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy than ACEI or ARA. In this context, the dual blockade of RAAS most probably offers a better efficacy than the simple blockade, but also exposes to a higher risk. Should ongoing trials confirm the preliminary favourable results, aliskiren might reach a forefront position among the armamentarium now available to optimize the RAAS blockade. The present article will summarize advances concerning the biochemical effects of the specific mode of action of aliskiren, especially the potential interferences related to increased renin/pro-renin levels, as well as results of recent clinical trials, not only in hypertension, but also in the fields of diabetes, renal insufficiency and cardiology. The objectives and design of the landmark study ALTITUDE will also be briefly presented.", 
    "744": "The advancing chronic renal failure is at most the consequence of secondary haemodynamic and metabolic factors as intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy. Although tight blood pressure control is the major preventive mechanism for progressive renal failure, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have some other renoprotective mechanisms beyond the blood pressure control. That is why these two groups of antihypertensive drugs traditionally have advantages in treating renal patients especially those with proteinuria over 400-1000 mg/day. Even if earlier experimental studies have shown renoprotective effect of calcium channel blockers, later clinical studies did not prove that calcium channel blockers have any advantages in renal protection over ACE inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with ACE inhibitors. It was explained by action of calcium channel blockers on afferent but not on efferent glomerular arterioles; a well known mechanism that leads to intraglomerular hypertension. New generations of dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers can dilate even efferent arterioles not causing unfavorable haemodynamic disturbances. This finding was confirmed in clinical studies which showed that renoprotection established by calcium channel blockers was not inferior to that of ACE inhibitors and that calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors have additive effect on renoprotection. Newer generation of dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers seem to offer more therapeutic possibilities in renoprotection by their dual action on afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles and, possibly by other effects beyond the blood pressure control.",

    "751": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic cardiac arrhythmia and a major public health problem, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. The most prevalent cause of AF in the western world is hypertensive heart disease. Blood pressure increase leads to hemodynamic modifications which usually have direct effects on left ventricular and atrial structure and function. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in regulating blood volume and systemic vascular resistance. Furthermore, recent studies showed that RAAS plays a key role in left atrial and ventricle structural and functional remodeling. Experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-II converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers are effective in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients with arterial hypertension or several forms of heart disease. In our study, we showed that ramipril is effective in preventing AF relapses in patients with lone AF (LAF: i.e AF in the absence of clinical and echocardiographic evidence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, or endocrine disease), independently of any sizeable effect on cardiac echocardiographic anatomy when compared with baseline data. In this paper, we briefly discuss: 1) the role of ACE inhibitor ramipril in preventing AF relapses in LAF patients; 2) the underlying mechanisms by which it can potentially act; 3) the possibility of considering the occurrence of LAF as a marker of subclinical organ damage in subjects with blood pressure values in the 130 to 139 mm Hg range, that is in the pre-hypertension classification according to the JNC-7 Report, of high normal blood pressure levels according to the 2007 ESC/ESH guidelines.",

We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study: (1) from 400 young-onset hypertension (YOH) subjects and (2) a confirmation study with an additional 623 YOH subjects. In the first stage, eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ACE structural gene and one SNP of ABO genes were significantly associated with ACE activity. SNP rs4343 in exon17 near the well-known insertion/deletion polymorphism had the strongest association. We confirmed in the second stage that three SNPs: rs4343 in ACE gene (P=3.0 x 10\u207b\u00b2\u2075), rs495828 (P=3.5 x 10\u207b\u2078) and rs8176746 (P=9.3 x 10\u207b\u2075) in ABO gene were significantly associated with ACE activity. We further replicated the association between ABO genotype/blood types and ACE activity in an independent YOH family study (428 hypertension pedigrees), and showed a potential differential blood pressure response to ACEI in subjects with varied numbers of ACE-activity-raising alleles. These findings may broaden our understanding of the mechanisms controlling ACE activity and advance our pharmacogenetic knowledge on ACEI.", 
    "753": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors go beyond the inhibition of ACE to decrease angiotensin (Ang) II or increase kinin levels. ACE inhibitors also affect kinin B1 and B2 receptor (B1R and B2R) signaling, which may underlie some of their therapeutic usefulness. They can indirectly potentiate the actions of bradykinin (BK) and ACE-resistant BK analogs on B2Rs to elevate arachidonic acid and NO release in laboratory experiments. Studies indicate that ACE inhibitors and some Ang metabolites increase B2R functions as allosteric enhancers by inducing a conformational change in ACE. This is transmitted to B2Rs via heterodimerization with ACE on the plasma membrane of cells. ACE inhibitors are also agonists of the B1R, at a Zn-binding sequence on the second extracellular loop that differs from the orthosteric binding site of the des-Arg-kinin peptide ligands. Thus, ACE inhibitors act as direct allosteric B1R agonists. When ACE inhibitors enhance B2R and B1R signaling, they augment NO production. Enhancement of B2R signaling activates endothelial NO synthase, yielding a short burst of NO; activation of B1Rs results in a prolonged high output of NO by inducible NO synthase. These actions, outside inhibiting peptide hydrolysis, may contribute to the pleiotropic therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors in various cardiovascular disorders.",

In the last few years some polymorphisms of ACE such as the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism have been described, but their physiologic relevance is poorly understood. In addition, few studies investigated if the specific activity of ACE domain is related to the I/D polymorphism and if it can affect other systems. The aim of this study was to establish a biochemical and functional characterization of the I/D polymorphism and correlate this with the corresponding ACE activity. For this purpose, 119 male brazilian army recruits were genotyped and their ACE plasma activities evaluated from the C- and N-terminal catalytic domains using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptides, specific for the C-domain (Abz-LFK(Dnp)OH), N-domain (Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH) and both C- and N-domains (Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH). Plasma kallikrein activity was measured using Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as substrate and inhibited by selective plasma kallikrein inhibitor (PKSI). Some physiological parameters previously described related to the I/D polymorphism such as handgrip strength, blood pressure, heart rate and BMI were also evaluated. The genotype distribution was II n=27, ID n=64 and DD n=28. Total plasma ACE activity of both domains in II individuals was significantly lower in comparison to ID and DD. This pattern was also observed for C- and N-domain activities. Difference between ID and DD subjects was observed only with the N-domain specific substrate. Blood pressure, heart rate, handgrip strength and BMI were similar among the genotypes. This polymorphism also affected the plasma kallikrein activity and DD group presents high activity level. Thus, our data demonstrate that the I/D ACE polymorphism affects differently both ACE domains without effects on handgrip strength. Moreover, this polymorphism influences the kallikrein-kinin system of normotensive individuals.",

Moreover, there is a strong theoretical framework to explain the effects of dietary calcium on energy metabolism. The supporting mechanisms include dietary calcium-correcting suboptimal calcium intakes, thereby preventing the endocrine response (parathyroid hormone [PTH] and calcitriol), which favors adipocyte energy storage and inhibits adipocyte loss via apoptosis. Dietary calcium appears to further promote energy loss via formation of calcium soaps in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby modestly reduces net energy absorption. Dietary calcium appears to be responsible for approximately 50% of the antiobesity bioactivity of dairy foods. The additional dairy bioactivity has not been fully identified, but is primarily localized in whey protein. The major components are the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity of whey proteins and the high concentration of leucine in whey. This high leucine content appears to be primarily responsible for the repartitioning of dietary energy from adipose tissue to skeletal muscle during weight loss, resulting in greater preservation of skeletal muscle and accelerated loss of adipose tissue during negative energy balance. Finally, high-calcium diets suppress obesity-induced oxidative and inflammatory stress independently from its role in modulating adiposity; these effects are similarly augmented by other dairy food components. However, the number of randomized clinical trials conducted is still modest, and a small number have not confirmed significant effects in weight management. Thus, the protective effects of dairy foods against obesity and its comorbidities are promising, but warrant further large-scale studies.", 
    "819": "Because epidemiological studies have indicated that the relation of blood pressure to cardiovascular risk is lineally extended to the normal blood pressure range, strict blood pressure control is desired in the antihypertensive therapy. For this purpose, combination of multiple antihypertensive drug is required in a large part of hypertensive patients. In combining antihypertensive drugs, it is preferable that the antihypertensive effects are augmented and the adverse effects are cancelled each other. Calcium channel blockers exert consistent hypotensive effects dose-dependently and scarcely cause hazardous side effects. Calcium channel blockers are preferentially used when angina pectoris and cerebrovascular disease exist, moreover, the prominent antihypertensive effects are useful as combination drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal diseases where the strict blood pressure control is strongly needed.", 
    "820": "Japanese Society of Hypertension Committee published Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 2009 (JSH2009). The first choices of antihypertensive drugs are calcium channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-adrenergic blockers. Because dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have the greatest hypotensive efficacy without affecting organ blood flow, they are indicated in the patients with complications and the aged. Positive indications of calcium channel blockers are left ventricular hypertrophy, tachycardia (non-dihydropyridine), angina pectoris, chronic phase of cerebrovascular disease, and elderly patients. Patients with bradycardia are contraindicated by non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.", 
    "821": "Angiotensin II maintains renal cortical blood flow and renal oxygenation in the clipped kidney of early 2-kidney, 1-clip Goldblatt hypertensive (2K,1C) rats. The involvement of Ang II is believed to decline, whereas oxidative stress increases during the progression of 2K,1C hypertension. We investigated the hypothesis that the acute administration of drugs to inhibit reactive oxygen species (Tempol), angiotensin II type 1 receptors (candesartan), or angiotensin-converting enzyme (enalaprilat) lowers mean arterial pressure and increases kidney blood flow and oxygenation in the clipped kidney of chronic 2K,1C rats in contrast to sham controls. Twelve months after left renal artery clipping or sham, mean arterial pressure, renal cortical blood flow, and renal cortical and medullary oxygen tension were measured after acute administration of Tempol followed by enalaprilat or candesartan followed by enalaprilat. The mean arterial pressure of the 2K,1C rat was reduced by candesartan (-9%) and, more effectively, by Tempol (-35%). All of the applied treatments had similar blood pressure-lowering effects in sham rats (average: -21%). Only Tempol increased cortical blood flow (+35%) and cortical and medullary oxygen tensions (+17% and +94%, respectively) in clipped kidneys of 2K,1C rats. Administration of enalaprilat had no additional effect, except for a modest reduction in cortical blood flow in the clipped kidney of 2K,1C rats when coadministered with candesartan (-10%). In conclusion, acute administration of Tempol is more effective than candesartan in reducing the mean arterial blood pressure and improving renal blood perfusion and oxygenation in the clipped kidney of chronic 2K,1C rats.", 
    "822": "Patient adherence to antihypertensive medication is vital to ensure the successful treatment of hypertension. Low levels of adherence to and persistence with prescribed therapy are major factors leading to the current poor rates of blood pressure control among patients with hypertension. There are many reasons for nonadherence to therapy including patient-, physician-, and therapy-related factors. Poor tolerability has a detrimental effect on adherence, therefore reducing the apparent effectiveness of agents with dose-dependent side effects. Various effective combination therapies are recommended by current guidelines, eg, beta-blocker plus calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) plus thiazide diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus thiazide diuretic, CCB plus thiazide diuretic, ACE inhibitor plus CCB, and ARB plus CCB, and these have the potential to increase adherence to therapy by combining a favorable tolerability profile with once-daily dosing.",

In comparison to patients with LVSD, those with HFPSF were more often female (62.4% v 38.5%; P = 0.001), had less social support, and were more likely to live in nursing homes (17.9% v 7.6%; P < 0.001), and had a greater prevalence of renal impairment (86.7% v 6.2%; P = 0.004), anaemia (34.3% v 6.3%; P = 0.013) and atrial fibrillation (51.3% v 47.1%; P = 0.008), but significantly less ischaemic heart disease (53.4% v 81.2%; P = 0.001). Patients with HFPSF were less likely to be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (61.9% v 72.5%; P = 0.008); carvedilol was used more frequently in LVSD (1.5% v 8.8%; P < 0.001). Readmission rates were higher in the HFPSF group (median, 2 v 1.5 admissions; P = 0.032), particularly for malignancy (4.2% v 1.8%; P < 0.001) and anaemia (3.9% v 2.3%; P < 0.001). Both groups had the same poor survival rate (P = 0.912).",

    "828": "The importance of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in cardiovascular and renal diseases has long ago been recognized. However despite the availability of many effective drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, RAAS blockade is incomplete in several patients with consequent uncontrolled high blood pressure and not efficacy cardiovascular and renal protection. Aliskiren is a new renin inhibitor that block the RAAS at its origin. Recent studies suggest that Aliskiren reduces blood pressure, inhibits plasma renin activity and attenuates renal damage in diabetic patients with nephropathy. This review summarized the results of the more important studies performed in hypertensive and diabetic patients in which Aliskiren showed to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent that can be used in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs to provide additional options to improve blood pressure control.",

Blood pressure, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, and creatinine clearance were measured prior to, after two months of combined therapy, and after a 2-month withdrawal period of spironolactone. While systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after spironolactone therapy, proteinuria did not improve. Serum potassium increased significantly as well, with three patients requiring resin-binding therapy. Thus, spironolactone seems to have no additional antiproteinuric effects over ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with IMN and nephrotic syndrome and carries the risk of significant hyperkalemia.",

    "834": "While blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is beneficial in treating many patients with diabetic nephropathy, some patients show a poor response. We hypothesized that the poor response of RAS blockade is attributed to inability to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide. Recently, we reported that diabetic eNOS knockout (KO) mice develop advanced diabetic nephropathy similar to human disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of the RAS would be less beneficial in this model than in diabetic wild-type mice. Both enalapril and telmisartan were less effective at reducing renal injury in diabetic eNOSKO mice compared with diabetic wild-type mice. Blood pressure was only transiently reduced by these treatments in diabetic eNOSKO mice and later returned to levels similar to that of untreated diabetic eNOSKO mice. Serum aldosterone tended to be paradoxically higher with enalapril or telmisartan in diabetic eNOSKO mice, whereas these treatments tended to lower aldosterone in diabetic wild-type mice. The pathogenic role of aldosterone was demonstrated by the evidence that spironolactone significantly reduced blood pressure and prevented renal injury. In addition, a higher dose of enalapril also failed to prevent hypertension and renal injury in diabetic eNOSKO mice. In conclusion, an impaired endothelial NO response could lessen the benefit of RAS inhibition in diabetic renal disease. Aldosterone blockade may provide superior protection in this setting.",

    "838": "The hybrid operating room is the venue for transcatheter therapy with the convergence of three specialties: cardiac surgery, cardiovascular anesthesiology, and interventional cardiology. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is proof that cardiac specialists have embraced the endovascular revolution. Since pharmacologic and ischemic myocardial conditioning are safe and effective, they are currently the focus of multiple trials. Angiotensin blockade, anemia and endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting worsen outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Although off-pump CABG is equivalent to on-pump CABG, it may improve outcomes in high-risk groups. Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) significantly decreases mortality after myocardial infarction, the evidence is less convincing for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Even though prasugrel was recently approved for platlet blockade in PCI, it may be superceded by ticagrelor. Although PCI and CABG appear equivalent for multivessel coronary disease, CABG lowers revascularization rates and also has superior outcomes in diabetics and the elderly. Hetastarch and N-acetylcysteine both increase bleeding and transfusion in cardiac surgery. Factor VII can treat life-threatening bleeding, but its safety requires further evaluation. Since eltrombopag and romiplostim stimulate platelet production, they may have a future role in hemostasis after cardiac surgery. Even though fenoldopam, atrial natriuretic peptide and sodium bicarbonate are nephroprotective, further trials must confirm these findings. Intensive insulin therapy offers no further outcome advantage and significantly increases hypoglycemic risk.

It is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers reduce CASP more than some antihypertensives such as beta-blockers. White coat hypertension with CASP has not been described and validated. The present report describes a very anxious 24-year-old patient on telmisartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker), with a very high CASP compared with his peripheral blood pressure (BP). He had a strong family history of hypertension, and was fairly well controlled on 80 mg/day telmisartan, with his BP ranging from 125/80 mmHg to 130/85 mmHg (home BP monitoring). In May 2009, he underwent routine CASP at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (Singapore), and ambulatory BP measurements using a BPro watch (HealthSTATS, Singapore). The patient had a CASP of 132 mmHg at the hospital, but his calculated CASP by ambulatory BP measurement at 1 pm was 120 mmHg. His ambulatory BPs were 137/94 mmHg; thus, hydrochlorothiazide was added for further control. He was advised to repeat CASP measurements on follow-up in six weeks. He followed up on June 18, 2009, and July 30, 2009, and his CASPs were 139 mmHg and 137 mmHg, respectively. He underwent a magnetic resonance aortogram to exclude any obstructive cause for very high CASPs. His magnetic resonance aortogram revealed no evidence of coarctation of the aorta.

    "851": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and a challenging clinical problem encountered in daily clinical practice. There is an increasing body of evidence linking inflammation to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular conditions including AF. Historical evidence supports an association between AF and inflammation and is consistent with the association of AF with inflammatory conditions of the heart, such as myocarditis and pericarditis. AF has been associated with myocardial oxidative stress, and antioxidant agents have demonstrated antiarrhythmic benefit in humans. Increased plasma interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma viscosity support the existence of an inflammatory state among \"typical\" populations with chronic AF. These indexes of inflammation are related to the prothrombotic state and may be linked to the clinical characteristics of the patients (underlying vascular disease and comorbidities), rather than simply to the presence of AF itself. It has been suggested that inflammation may have a role in the development of atrial arrhythmias after cardiac surgery, and that a genetic predisposition to develop postoperative complications exists. Cytokines can have a prognostic significance; IL-6 levels, CRP, and other cytokines may have prognostic value in AF. Cytokine lowering therapies, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other anti-inflammatory agents may have a role in the treatment of AF. The present article provides an overview of the evidence linking inflammatory cytokines to AF and their therapeutic and prognostic implications.",

A large body of data now exists to support the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) which act on RAS, in the management of hypertension and their effect on cardiovascular risk reduction. Current evidence suggests that inhibition of the RAS is an important target for cardioprotection. RAS inhibition controls blood pressure and also reduces target-organ damage. This is especially important in populations at high-risk for damage including patients with diabetes and those with chronic kidney disease. Both ARBs and ACEIs target the RAS offering important reductions in both BP and target organ damage.", 
    "853": "Arterial hypertension is one of the major diseases in the Western world. It is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several drug classes have been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor and belongs to the class of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Several large studies have shown that aliskiren is effective in lowering blood pressure, and equivalent in this respect to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor-1 blockers (ARBs). Furthermore, aliskiren has a safety and tolerability profile comparable with that of the ARBs and slightly better than that of the ACE inhibitors. From a pathophysiologic perspective, it can be combined with hydrochlorothiazide successfully, because it can block the diuretic-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Its combination with hydrochlorothiazide in a single pill has been investigated and shown to be superior to monotherapy with respect to blood pressure control and improvement in patient compliance with therapy. Further studies are needed to show whether aliskiren and its combination with hydrochlorothiazide is effective in preventing cardiovascular events and mortality when end organ damage is present.", 
    "854": "Hypertension (HTN) is an important factor in progressive loss of renal function. The kidney can be both a contributor to and a target of HTN. The functional integrity of the kidney is vital for the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Chronic activation of the renin system causes HTN and, ultimately, end-organ damage. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) inhibit plasma renin activity (PRA), thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; consequently, the levels of both Ang I and Ang II are reduced. There is no compensatory increase in PRA activity with DRIs as seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are reasons to speculate that renin inhibition might prove to be a superior strategy for blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system compared with ACEIs or ARBs. Evidence for the efficacy of aliskiren (a DRI) is considered to be relatively strong, based on published, short-term, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials showing that aliskiren is as effective as other antihypertensive agents in reducing blood pressure (BP), with no rebound effects on BP after treatment withdrawal. When combined with diuretics, fully additive BP reduction is seen. When given with an ACEI or ARB, aliskiren produces significant additional BP reduction indicative of complimentary pharmacology and more complete renin-angiotensin system blockade.",

Several large-scale trials have focused on the effect of telmisartan on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including comparisons of that with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in subjects at high vascular risk.

Treatment of hypertension leads to reduction of CV morbidity and mortality through blood pressure reduction. The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathophysiology of hypertension is mainly through generation of potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, stimulation of aldosterone secretion, and increase in sympathetic activation. Angiotensin II receptor blockers such as candesartan, a long-acting agent, alter this system by blocking the activation of angiotensin I receptors. Several important clinical trials have tested the efficacy of candesartan with placebo, antihypertensive agents, or other agents that block the RAAS for the control of hypertension and reduction of key CV risk factors such as microalbuminuria, heart failure, retinopathy, and carotid intima medial thickness. Candesartan has been shown to be a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent with positive metabolic characteristics and additional benefits on CV and cerebrovascular outcomes.

    "867": "All spontaneously reported cases of ED submitted to the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) between 1990 and 2006, where at least one antihypertensive drug was the suspected agent, were scrutinized. Patient demographics, drug treatment and adverse reactions were recorded. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method, the information component (IC) was calculated.", 
    "868": "Among a total of 225 reports of ED, 59 involved antihypertensive drugs including ARB (9 cases) as suspected agents. A positive IC value was found indicating that ED was reported more often in association with antihypertensive drugs classes, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, compared with all other drugs in the database. Positive dechallenge was reported in 43 cases (72%).", 
    "869": "All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB were implicated as suspected agents in cases of ED. Few risk factors were identified. The relatively high reporting of ED in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies, suggesting that ARB have neither a positive nor any effect on ED. This discrepancy suggests that further studies are warrnted on this potential adverse reaction to ARB.", 
    "870": "In hypertension, the blood pressure curve may be divided into two sets of components. The first set is mean arterial pressure, steady flow, and vascular resistance, thus acting on small arteries; the second set refers to large arteries, hence to pulse pressure, arterial stiffness, and wave reflections. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril not only reduces mean arterial pressure but also acts specifically on pulse pressure. The effect on pulse pressure predominates on central rather than peripheral (brachial) large arteries, reducing aortic stiffness and most wave reflections. Such hemodynamic changes are not observed with standard \u03b2-blockade, which reduces aortic stiffness and brachial systolic and pulse pressure but not central pulse pressure and wave reflections. In hypertensive subjects, perindopril and other ACE inhibitors seem to predict more consistently the reduction of cardiovascular events, mainly of cardiac origin, than standard \u03b2-blockers alone. This effect is associated with the important biochemical finding that mechanotransductions of angiotensin and \u03b2-blockade are markedly different, acting in the former specifically on the \u03b15\u03b21 integrin complex and on the fibronectin ligand of arterial vessels.", 
    "871": "In 1955, Dr. Jerome Conn described a patient with severe hypertension and hypokalemia and an aldosterone-secreting adenoma. The prevalence of hyperaldosteronism is increased among patients with obesity or resistant hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the secretion of aldosterone, but with chronic treatment aldosterone concentrations \"escape\" back to baseline values. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism reduces mortality in patients with heart disease who are already taking an ACE inhibitor and diuretic. In addition to affecting sodium and potassium homeostasis via classical MR-dependent pathways, aldosterone induces inflammation and causes cardiovascular remodeling and renal injury. Some of these effects involve MR-independent pathways. At the same time, ligands other than aldosterone can activate the MR. This paper reviews mechanism(s) for the proinflammatory and profibrotic effects of aldosterone and presents data indicating that endogenous aldosterone, acting at the MR, contributes to many of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects of angiotensin II in vivo.", 
    "872": "It has been demonstrated in a series of studies that erectile dysfunction (ED) appears to be one of risk factors and predictors of ischemic heart disease (IHD). According to the SSRC PM data in a cohort of 300 men with high cardiovascular risk ED was diagnosed in 61% of cases, while among 300 men with verified diagnosis of IHD was detected in 92.7% of cases. According to recommendations of the European Society of Urology changes of life style and correction of risk factors should precede therapy of ED or be components of complex therapy. It is known that some antihypertensive drugs (nonselective beta-adrenoblockers, thiazide diuretics) can negatively affect erectile function. According to data of comparative randomized clinical study average therapeutic doses of thiazide-like and thiazide diuretics in combination with ACE inhibitors do not worsen erectile function. Data on effect of lipid lowering therapy on erectile function are equivocal. Type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDI) are first line preparations for the treatment of patients with ED. Safety of combination of type 5 PDI with main groups of antihypertensive drugs has been demonstrated in persons with risk factors of CVD and ED. The use of type 5 PDI in men depends on degree of compensation of cardiovascular system. In unstable cardiovascular events preparations of this group can be also carefully used. Simultaneous administration of nitrates is a contraindication for type 5 PDI.", 
    "873": "Recently the pleiotropic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors which lay beyond their pure antihypertensive effects are widely discussed. Antiproliferative, antiatherosclerotic, antiproliferative and antiarrhythmic properties, as well as positive effects on hemostasis and endothelial function allows angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to occupy very important position among other cardiovascular medications and to have a number of indications: arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy and patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease.",

During long-term carvedilol therapy, CHF patients with the Arg/Arg genotype of the ADRB1 gene were observed to have a more pronounced decrease in the functional class of heart failure, a significant increase in left ventricular ejection, and a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic sizes as compared with patients with the Gly/Arg genotype.",

With consideration of high plasma renin activity, the renal computed tomography angiography was performed and showed tumor mass in the left kidney. An uncomplicated partial left nephrectomy was performed. Histopathological examination and electron microscopy showed typical features of juxtaglomerular cell tumor (JCT). Imunohistochemistry of tumor was positive for CD34 and CD117 and this finding is effective in the diagnosis of JCT if immunostain for renin is unavailable. After the resection of JCT, the patient's blood pressure and hypokalemia returned to normal range.

Previously, pulmonary arterial hypertension was suspected and therapy with sildenafil was initiated. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) showed marked hypoplasia of the right ventricular free wall and marked dilation of the right heart without pulmonary arterial hypertension. The diagnosis of Uhl's disease was confirmed by typical MRI morphology. A slow cardiac recompensation was achieved by medicinal treatment of heart insufficiency. Hence the patient remained stable for 9 months with medicinal therapy without signs of further decompensation.",

The kinetic parameters for LdDCP with substrate, Hip-His-Leu were determined as, Km, 4 mM and Vmax, 1.173 micromole/ml/min. Inhibition studies revealed that known ACE inhibitors (captopril and bradykinin potentiating peptide; BPP1) were weak inhibitors for LdDCP as compared to human testicular ACE (htACE) with Ki values of 35.8 nM and 3.9 microM, respectively. Three dimensional model of LdDCP was generated based on crystal structure of Escherichia coli DCP (EcDCP) by means of comparative modeling and assessed using PROSAII, PROCHECK and WHATIF. Captopril docking with htACE, LdDCP and EcDCP and analysis of molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) suggested that the active site domain of three enzymes has several minor but potentially important structural differences. These differences could be exploited for designing selective inhibitor of LdDCP thereby antileishmanial compounds either by denovo drug design or virtual screening of small molecule databases.",

A new flavonoid glycoside, kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-xylopyranoside, named roxyloside A was isolated from the buds of this plant, along with four known compounds, isoquercitrin, afzelin, cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucoside, and quercetin gentiobioside. The chemical structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic analyses, including FAB-MS, UV, IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, DEPT, and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC). All the isolated compounds except cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucoside exhibited high levels of inhibitory activity against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase with IC(50) values ranging from 47.1 to 80.6 microM. Cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucoside significantly suppressed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, with an IC(50) value of 138.8 microM, while the other four compounds were ineffective. These results indicate that R. damascena and its flavonoids may be effective to improve the cardiovascular system.", 
    "902": "To investigate the effects of rennin angiotensin system blockade on the microvessel density in islets of diabetic rats and its relationship with islet function, diabetes model was created by feeding of high-caloric laboratory chow plus intraperitoneal injection of a small dose of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg). After 8 weeks intervention with perindopril (AE, n=10) or valsartan (AR, n=10), the islet function of the animals was evaluated by intravenous insulin release test (IVIRT). The pancreases were immunohistochemically stained to analyze the content of insulin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the islets. The microvessel density (MVD) of islets was detected by counting CD34 positive cells. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA expression in the islets was detected by RT-PCR. Compared with normal control group (NC, n=10), the area under the curve for insulin from 0 to 30 min (AUCI(0-30)) of diabetes group (DM, n=8) was decreased by 66.3%; the insulin relative concentration (IRC) of betacell was decreased significantly; the relative content of VEGF was increased obviously [(-4.21+/-0.13) vs (-4.06+/-0.29)]; MVD in islets was decreased by 71.4%; the relative expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA was increased by 1.19 times (all P<0.01). Compared with DM group, the AUCI(0-30) of AE and AR group was increased by 44.6% and 34.9% respectively; IRC was also increased significantly; the relative content of VEGF was decreased by 21.2% and 21.7% respectively; MVD was increased by 62.5% and 75.0% respectively; the relative expression of HIF-1alpha was decreased by 27.2% and 29.0% respectively (all P<0.01 or P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the said indexes between group AE and AR. It is concluded that the blockade of RAS may ameliorate islets function of diabetic rats by increasing the MVD in islets.", 
    "903": "Survivors of paraquat poisoning are left with pulmonary fibrosis which results in a restrictive type of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key growth factor that initiates tissue repair and underlies the development of lung fibrosis. Angiotensin (ANG) II may induce CTGF expression in the heart and kidney and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. The biological effects of ANG II are mediated by ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AT2R. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of paraquat on ANG II, ANG II receptors, CTGF, and collagen expressions and to assess the role of ANG II receptors in paraquat-induced collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5). MRC-5 cells were incubated with various concentrations of paraquat with or without the ANG II receptor antagonist, saralasin. Paraquat increased ANG II production and AT1R mRNA and protein expression and decreased AT2R mRNA expression. Furthermore, paraquat treatment increased CTGF and collagen mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner and saralasin inhibited these effects. These results indicate that paraquat increases CTGF and collagen expression by activating angiotensin signaling pathway in human lung fibroblasts.", 
    "904": "We investigated if a history of FURO/CAP, a protocol that increases brain angiotensin II (ANG II), sensitizes or enhances sodium intake. A subcutaneous injection of the diuretic furosemide (FURO, 10mg/kg) was combined with a converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 5mg/kg) to induce a short latency stimulated sodium (0.3M NaCl) and water intake in a 2h FURO/CAP test. Repeated injections of only FURO/CAP, separated by one-week interval, enhanced stimulated and spontaneous (daily) sodium intake. Stimulated fluid intake was completely suppressed when FURO/CAP was combined with two intraperitoneal injections of the ANG II type-1 receptor antagonist losartan (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg each) given within 1h prior to the FURO/CAP test. Losartan reduced by only 35% the FURO/CAP-induced natriuresis. A history of FURO/CAP, FURO/CAP+losartan (all doses), or vehicle produced similar stimulated fluid intake when all animals received only FURO/CAP in the third final FURO/CAP test. However, a history of vehicle or FURO/CAP+losartan 10mg/kg precluded the enhancement in spontaneous sodium intake after the third final FURO/CAP. The FURO/CAP combined with losartan (all doses) also precluded the spontaneous sodium intake enhancement in the weeks that preceded the third final FURO/CAP test. A history of only FURO/CAP, but not vehicle, also enhanced water deprivation-induced sodium appetite. The results suggest that a history of FURO/CAP enhances stimulated and spontaneous sodium intake, as well as water deprivation-induced sodium appetite, and reinforce the role of ANG II as a peptide that mediates long-term effects on behavior.",

A 36-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, optional-titration study was performed in 901 patients (aliskiren, n=457; ramipril, n=444) > or =65 years of age with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or =140 mm Hg. Aliskiren 150-300 mg per day or ramipril 5-10 mg per day for was administered for 12 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg per day) at week 12 and amlodipine (5-10 mg per day) at week 22. The primary end point was non-inferiority of aliskiren vs ramipril monotherapy for change from baseline in mean sitting SBP (msSBP) at week 12. Decreases from baseline msSBP and mean sitting diastolic BP with aliskiren monotherapy (-14.0 and -5.1 mm Hg, respectively) were non-inferior (P<0.001 for both values) and superior to ramipril monotherapy (-11.6, -3.6 mm Hg; P=0.02, P<0.01, respectively). More patients achieved BP control with aliskiren (42%) than ramipril (33%; P<0.01). At week 36, fewer patients receiving aliskiren-based therapy required add-on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine (P=0.01 and 0.048, respectively). Tolerability was similar, but more patients receiving ramipril reported cough (P<0.001). In elderly patients with systolic hypertension, aliskiren proved to be more effective and better overall anti-hypertensive therapy compared to ramipril.", 
    "906": "Recent identification of a counterregulatory axis of the renin-angiotensin system, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)]-Mas receptor, may offer new targets for the treatment of renal fibrosis. We hypothesized that therapy with ANG-(1-7) would improve glomerulosclerosis through counteracting ANG II in experimental glomerulonephritis. Disease was induced in rats with the monoclonal anti-Thy-1 antibody, OX-7. Based on a three-dose pilot study, 576 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1) ANG-(1-7) was continuously infused from day 1 using osmotic pumps. Measures of glomerulosclerosis include semiquantitative scoring of matrix proteins stained for periodic acid Schiff, collagen I, and fibronectin EDA+ (FN). ANG-(1-7) treatment reduced disease-induced increases in proteinuria by 75%, glomerular periodic acid Schiff staining by 48%, collagen I by 24%, and FN by 25%. The dramatic increases in transforming growth factor-beta1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, FN, and collagen I mRNAs seen in disease control animals compared with normal rats were all significantly reduced by ANG-(1-7) administration (P < 0.05). These observations support our hypothesis that ANG-(1-7) has therapeutic potential for reversing glomerulosclerosis. Several results suggest ANG-(1-7) acts by counteracting ANG II effects: 1) renin expression in ANG-(1-7)-treated rats was dramatically increased as it is with ANG II blockade therapy; and 2) in vitro data indicate that ANG II-induced increases in mesangial cell proliferation and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 overexpression are inhibited by ANG-(1-7) via its binding to a specific receptor known as Mas.",

Provincial rates of filled prescriptions for HF drugs in QC, ON, and BC were 62%, 58%, and 47% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; 34%, 22%, and 16% for beta-blockers; 9%, 5%, and 3% for angiotensin receptor blockers; and 79%, 76%, and 62% for loop diuretics, respectively. In multivariate analyses, patients residing in provinces with restrictive plans were less likely to be prescribed drugs that were restricted, such as beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.60; 0.36, 0.29 to 0.44, for ON and BC, respectively) and angiotensin receptor blockers (0.50, 0.45 to 0.56; 0.38, 0.32 to 0.46, for ON and BC, respectively), than drugs with no restrictions, such as loop diuretics (0.81, 0.74 to 0.88; 0.40, 0.36 to 0.45, for ON and BC, respectively) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.80, 0.75 to 0.86; 0.47, 0.43 to 0.52, for ON and BC, respectively).", 
    "915": "Among HF patients, residing in a province with a more restrictive prescription plan may be associated with lower use of restricted HF medications over and above the expected regional differences in HF drug use across provinces.", 
    "916": "The use of evidence-based medications in patients with heart failure has increased over the past 10 years. We aimed to determine whether adherence to these medications has also increased during this time.", 
    "917": "A retrospective cohort was created using administrative databases from the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Subjects discharged alive from their first hospitalization for heart failure between 1994 and 2003 were eligible. Those filling a prescription for a beta-blocker (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) within 6 months of discharge were followed for 1 year after the initial prescription. Of 8805 eligible patients, 67% of BB users (941/1414) and 74% of ACEI/ARB users (4441/5991) exhibited optimal adherence at 1 year (defined as >or=80% adherence calculated from pharmacy refill records). When grouped by year of initial heart failure hospitalization, the proportion of optimally adherent patients improved from 54% to 75% with BB and from 67% to 80% with ACEI/ARBs between 1994/1995 and 2002/2003 (P for trend <0.001 for both). Mean 1-year adherence improved from 71% to 83% for BB and 80% to 88% for ACEI/ARBs. After adjustment using multivariable logistic regression, subjects discharged in 2003 were significantly more likely to exhibit optimal adherence to a BB (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.44) or an ACEI/ARB (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.08) than those prescribed therapy in 1994/1995.", 
    "918": "One-year adherence to BB and ACEI/ARB is improving over time in patients discharged after first heart failure hospitalization. Patients taking multiple cardiac medications were not any less likely to exhibit optimal adherence than patients taking only 1 medication.",

Little is known about hospitals with consistently poor adherence with AMI process measures and whether these hospitals also have increased patient mortality.", 
    "920": "We conducted a retrospective study of 2761 US hospitals reporting AMI process measures to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare database during 2004 to 2006 that could be linked to 2005 Medicare Part A data. The main outcome measures were hospitals' combined compliance with 5 AMI measures (aspirin and beta-blocker on admission and discharge and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use at discharge for patients with left ventricular dysfunction) and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality for 2005. We stratified hospitals into those with low AMI adherence (ranked in the lowest decile for AMI adherence for 3 consecutive years [2004-2006, n=105]), high adherence (ranked in the top decile for 3 consecutive years [n=63]), and intermediate adherence (all others [n=2593]). Mean AMI performance varied significantly across low-, intermediate-, and high-performing hospitals (mean score, 68% versus 92% versus 99%, P<0.001). Low-performing hospitals were more likely than intermediate- and high-performing hospitals to be safety-net providers (19.2% versus 11.0% versus 6.4%; P=0.005). Low-performing hospitals had higher unadjusted 30-day mortality rates (23.6% versus 17.8% versus 14.9%; P<0.001). These differences persisted after adjustment for patient characteristics (16.3% versus 16.0% versus 15.7%; P=0.02).",

Overall, 5049 of 85 671 (5.9%) non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes patients (2156 women, 2893 men) had troponin 1 to 1.5x ULN within 24 hours of presentation. Compared with troponin >1.5x ULN, \"gray-zone\" patients less often received all guidelines-indicated acute (mean composite score, 63% versus 72%) and discharge therapies (mean composite score, 73% versus 78%), but received them more frequently than patients with troponin <1x ULN (mean composite scores, 58% acute and 67% discharge). Among \"gray-zone\" patients, acute and discharge therapy use was similar between women and men, except acute aspirin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98]) and discharge angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88]). \"Gray-zone\" patients had lower mortality (2.3%) than the >1.5x ULN (4.5%) group but higher than the <1x ULN group (1.1%).

Interventions that counteract women's psychosocial stress have not previously been presented. This study implemented a stress reduction program for women and investigated its ability to improve survival in women coronary patients.", 
    "926": "Two hundred thirty-seven consecutive women patients, aged 75 years or younger, hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, or percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to a group-based psychosocial intervention program or usual care. Initiated 4 months after hospitalization, intervention groups of 4 to 8 women met for a total of 20 sessions that were spread over a year. We provided education about risk factors, relaxation training techniques, methods for self-monitoring and cognitive restructuring, with an emphasis on coping with stress exposure from family and work, and self-care and compliance with clinical advice. From randomization until end of follow-up (mean duration, 7.1 years), 25 women (20%) in the usual care and 8 women (7%) in the stress reduction died, yielding an almost 3-fold protective effect of the intervention (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.74; P=0.007). Introducing baseline measures of clinical prognostic factors, including use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, and statins into multivariate models confirmed the unadjusted results (P=0.009).",

    "928": "Membrane-bound human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been reported to initiate intracellular signaling after interaction with substrates or inhibitors. Somatic ACE is known to contain two distinct, extracellular catalytic centers. We analyzed the signal transduction mechanisms in cells transfected with different forms of murine ACE (mACE) and investigated whether the two domains are similarly involved in these processes. For this purpose, CHO cells were stably transfected with mACE or with its domain-selective mutants. In addition to these modified cellular models, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used in this study. Signal transduction molecules such as JNK and c-Jun were analyzed after activation of cells with several ACE substrates and inhibitors. ACE-targeting compounds such as substrates, inhibitors, or even the ACE product angiotensin-II induce in mACE-expressing cells a signal transduction response. These processes are also evoked by partially inactivated forms of mACE and finally result in an enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 transcription. Surprisingly, the membrane-bound ACE activity is also influenced by ACE-targeted interventions. Our data suggest that the two catalytic domains of mACE do not function independently but that the signal transduction is influenced by negative cooperativity of the two catalytic domains. This study underlines that ACE indeed has receptor-like properties which occur in a species-specific manner.", 
    "929": "Serious hyperkalemia was reported in 10% of chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients that could lead to arrhythmia and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are well accepted for cardio-protective benefits. The relationship between renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB) and hyperkalemia in chronic HD patients remains controversial. The aim of this study was to find the relationship between RASB and hyperkalemia in these patients.",

Seven variables--non-DM, longer HD duration, lower dialysate calcium, lower serum glucose, higher serum iPTH, not using RASB, and not using furosemide--were more frequent in hyperkalemia group. In logistic regression analysis, RASB was associated with decreased odds for hyperkalemia (OR 0.262, p = 0.001 in model A; OR 0.205, p = 0.001 in model B). In addition, furosemide was associated with decreased odds for hyperkalemia (OR 0.068, p = 0.022 in model B).",

Then, spironolactone (25 mg/d) was added to the therapy. The antiproteinuric effect of spironolactone was examined for eight weeks.", 
    "935": "At eight weeks, there was a significant decrease in proteinuria (p < 0.001, 47.9% decrease). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased (p < 0.004, p < 0.001, respectively). However, no correlation was detected between the reductions in systolic and diastolic BP and the reduction in proteinuria (p = 0.464, p = 0.239, respectively). Serum potassium level increased significantly (p < 0.001).",

For all patients, history and clinical examinations and serum potassium level was measured three times--pre- and post-1st session and pre-next session--at two successive sessions of hemodialysis.", 
    "939": "The results of this study showed that the prevalence of hyperkalemia was 41.2%, 6.5%, and 66.9% of pre- and post-dialysis and before the next session of dialysis, respectively. Hyperkalemia significantly correlates with potassium-rich diets, non-compliant patients, two sessions of hemodialysis per week, and constipation in ESRD patients during the study periods. Serum potassium level was significantly higher in anuric ESRD patients than those who had residual renal function, patients using acetate dialysate than those using bicarbonate dialysate, and patients with low blood flow rate than those with higher blood flow rates. There was a non-significant correlation between serum potassium and ACEls, B-blockers, or diabetes.", 
    "940": "Hyperkalemia is a frequent problem in patients with end stage renal disease in Egypt. Hyperkalemia significantly correlates with a potassium-rich diet and inadequate dialysis either by prescription or non-compliance.

Inhaled tussive agents are used to quantify cough, and the citric acid cough threshold has been shown to fall on ascent to altitude. Cough can occur in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors due to stimulation of airway sensory receptors by increased levels of bradykinin. We hypothesized that increased levels of bradykinin could be responsible for the decrease in citric acid cough threshold on exposure to altitude and a possible etiologic factor in altitude-related cough.", 
    "942": "Twenty healthy volunteers underwent baseline tests at 700 m before a 2-week stay at 3800 m. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma bradykinin were measured at baseline and altitude.

Nocturnal cough frequency was unchanged compared to baseline. Plasma bradykinin fell from 0.43 ng/mL at baseline to 0.08 ng/mL at altitude (geometric mean difference 5.7, 95% CIs 2.1-15.5, P = .002), but angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was unchanged (mean difference 0.06, 95% CIs -2.7-2.8, P = .97).

The incidence rates demonstrate that for every 10,000 veterans treated for 30 days with NSAIDs, there were 20 extra hospitalizations in the diabetes population, 30 additional hospitalizations in the ACE inhibitor/ARB and frusemide cohort and 6 extra hospitalizations in the reference population compared with those not treated with NSAIDs.", 
    "949": "NSAID use is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in all groups, with similar risk ratio estimates.

Consideration may need to be given to differential presentation of risk information to clinicians.", 
    "950": "Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the development of hypertension, and cardiac and renal diseases. RAAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, studies have shown that residual morbidity and mortality remains high, despite current optimal treatment. More comprehensive control of the RAAS might provide additional reductions in morbidity and mortality. Direct renin inhibitors offer the potential for enhanced RAAS control as they target the system at the point of activation, thereby reducing plasma renin activity (PRA); by contrast, ARBs and ACE inhibitors increase PRA. Elevated PRA is independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A single-pill combination of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, and the ARB, valsartan, at once-daily doses of 150/160 mg and 300/320 mg, has recently been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of hypertension in patients not adequately controlled on aliskiren or ARB monotherapy, and as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. This article examines the efficacy, safety and tolerability of aliskiren/valsartan combination therapy, and considers the evidence for the potential organ-protection benefits of this treatment.",

CKD is an increasing burden in the community as more patients fall prey to kidney failure. Both dialysis and renal transplantation are expensive modalities of treatment for end stage renal failure [ESRF]. Through the years many clinical trials have been performed to retard the progression of CKD to ESRF. Most of the trials focus on three main strategies which aim at renal retardation, namely, control of hypertension, treatment of proteinuria and control of hypercholesterolaemia. More recently, investigators have been exploring the role of high dose ARBs as well as the use of Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor. Early therapeutic intervention is necessary as it will contribute to better chances of minimising glomerular damage and in the case of some, even lead to the improvement of renal function with regression of glomerulosclerosis.",

We reported previously that, in models of both hypertension and postmyocardial infarction, Ac-SDKP reduces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. However, it is unknown whether Ac-SDKP can prevent or reverse renal injury and dysfunction in hypertension. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx)-induced hypertension, Ac-SDKP reduces renal damage, albuminuria, and dysfunction by decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and renal fibrosis and by increasing nephrin protein. Ac-SDKP (800 microg/kg per day, SC via osmotic minipump) or vehicle was either started 7 days before 5/6Nx (prevention) and continued for 3 weeks or started 3 weeks after 5/6Nx (reversal) and continued for another 3 weeks. Rats with 5/6Nx developed high blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and increased macrophage infiltration (inflammation) and renal collagen content (fibrosis). Ac-SDKP did not affect blood pressure or left ventricular hypertrophy in either group; however, it significantly reduced albuminuria, renal inflammation, and fibrosis and improved glomerular filtration rate in both prevention and reversal groups. Moreover, slit diaphragm nephrin protein expression in the glomerular filtration barrier was significantly decreased in hypertensive rats. This effect was partially prevented or reversed by Ac-SDKP. We concluded that Ac-SDKP greatly attenuates albuminuria and renal fibrosis and improves renal function in rats with 5/6Nx. These effects may be related to decreased inflammation (macrophages) and increased nephrin protein.",

The latter in these cases is instead supplied by a long posterior descending coronary artery (PDA), originating from the right coronary artery (RCA) at the crux, then passing along the entire length of the posterior interventricular groove, and either terminating at the apex or extending beyond it to pass upward in the anterior interventricular groove.

It is seen in both inpatient and outpatient settings with variable presentations ranging from mild, reversible injury to advanced kidney disease. Manifestations of drug-induced nephrotoxicity include acid-base abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, urine sediment abnormalities, proteinuria, pyuria, hematuria, and, most commonly, a decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The mechanisms of drug-induced nephrotoxicity may differ between various drugs or drug classes, and they are generally categorized based on the histological component of the kidney that is affected. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, radiocontrast media, conventional nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, amphotericin B, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been frequently implicated. This chapter reviews the clinical presentation and basic mechanisms of drug-induced nephrotoxicity.",

This study was undertaken to investigate whether CILO has in fact any vasculoprotective effects in aldosterone-induced hypertensive rats (Aldo-rats), and whether CILO affects Aldo-induced oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) production and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Treatment with CILO markedly ameliorated perivascular inflammatory changes in the coronary arterioles of Aldo-rats without affecting the systolic blood pressure and left ventricular weight. Treatment with CILO also prevented the increase in plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, an oxidative stress marker, as well as decreased urinary NOx excretion in Aldo-rats. Furthermore, CILO almost completely inhibited a set of upregulated proinflammatory genes (ICAM-1, MCP-1, PDGF-A, osteopontin, MMP-2 and ACE), as well as NAD(P)H oxidase components (p22phox, gp91phox, p47phox) and Aldo-inducible genes (SGK-1 and NHE-1) in the aortic tissues from Aldo-rats. Taken together, this study showed for the first time that CILO prevented Aldo-induced vascular inflammation and injury without affecting the blood pressure, suggesting its vasculoprotective effect on Aldo-induced vascular injury independent of blood pressure.",

Broncholytic therapy was prescribed in compliance with GOLD (2006) recommendations. Patients in groups 2 and 3 continued to receive antianginal therapy started before the onset of the study. Combined therapy included ACE inhibitor enalapril. Positive effect of inpatient treatment of COPD on lung function was transient and subsided with time. Specifically, forced expiratory volume in the 1st second and forced pulmonary vital capacity decreased below the acceptable physiological bounds. BODE index tended to drop too because exercise tolerance increased while dyspnea index by MMRC decreased despite impaired FEV1 and tendency toward a fall in BMI. Echocardiography revealed diminished size of both ventricles and improved left ventricular systolic function. However, heart remodeling progressed with time. Adequate therapy resulted in the reduction of CHD functional class and produced positive antianginal, antihypertensive, and antiarrhythmic effects. The treatment was well tolerated by the patients.

Criteria for inclusion in the study of 86 patients (20 men and 66 women) were diastolic cardiac insufficiency diagnosed as recommended by the Working Group of European Society of Cardiologists (2002). The patients were divided into 2 groups receiving either spirapryl (n = 42) or spirapryl with carvedilol (alpha, beta-adenoblocker). The patients were examined before and 24 weeks after therapy for the evaluation of their clinical condition, tolerance of physical activity, transmitral and transcuspidal diastolic flows (ECG and Doppler-ECG). All therapeutic modalities significantly improved the patients\" conditions, diastolic function, and ECG/ECG characteristics, but the best results were obtained with combined therapy that had beneficial effect on transmitral and transcuspidal diastolic flows (P < 0.01) and tolerance of physical exercises (P < 0.05).

    "997": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a major source of nitric oxide during inflammation whose activity is thought to be controlled primarily at the expression level. The B1 kinin receptor (B1R) post-translationally activates iNOS beyond its basal activity via extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser(745) . Here we identified the signalling pathway causing iNOS activation in cytokine-treated endothelial cells or HEK293 cells transfected with iNOS and B1R. To allow kinetic measurements of nitric oxide release, we used a sensitive porphyrinic microsensor (response time = 10 msec.; 1 nM detection limit). B1Rs signalled through G\u03b1i coupling as ERK and iNOS activation were inhibited by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, transfection of constitutively active mutant G\u03b1i Q204L but not G\u03b1q Q209L resulted in high basal iNOS-derived nitric oxide. G-\u03b2\u03b3 subunits were also necessary as transfection with the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminus inhibited the response. B1R-dependent iNOS activation was also inhibited by Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 and trans-fection with dominant negative Src. Other ERK-MAP kinase members were involved as the response was inhibited by dominant negative H-Ras, Raf kinase inhibitor, ERK activation inhibitor and MEK inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, PI3 kinase inhibitor LY94002, calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o-Aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C and protein kinase C activator PMA had no effect. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat also directly activated B1Rs to generate high output nitric oxide via the same pathway. These studies reveal a new mechanism for generating receptor-regulated high output nitric oxide in inflamed endothelium that may play an important role in the development of vascular inflammation.", 
    "998": "Hypertension is one of the major risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. A range of blood pressure-lowering agents is available including diuretics, alpha- and beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, calcium-channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and direct renin inhibitors (DRI). Most patients require two or more medications to control their blood pressures within normal ranges. When high blood pressure cannot be controlled by low-dose monotherapy, physicians employ either high-dose monotherapy or combination therapy. High-dose ARB monotherapy is more effective for reducing proteinuria against low-dose ARB monotherapy or CCBs. Combination therapy is recommended for hypertension patients to facilitate prompt maintenance of blood pressure. Single-pill combination therapy simplifies treatment and optimizes long-term compliance. Thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), alone or in combination are still widely used as first-line hypertension treatment. Recent studies have shown that double (CCB+ARBs) or triple (CCB+ARBs+HCTZ) combination therapies have a greater lowering efficacy and are better tolerated. Moreover, the use of DRIs has been patented and proven effective in selected categories of hypertensive patients with or without concomitant target organ damage (TOD).", 
    "999": "Diabetes mellitus is a common disease and contributes to a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy are major causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a condition that affects the myocardium, primarily. It is not necessarily associated with ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, valvular or congenital anomalies. The pathology of diabetic cardiomyopathy includes interstitial fibrosis, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, abnormal energy utilization, small vessel disease and cardiac neuropathy. These pathologies are induced by hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Biochemical as well as electrolyte changes, especially reduced calcium availability also occurs in the myocardium of diabetic patients. The abnormal structure and biochemistry of the myocardium result in functional problems such as diastolic and systolic dysfunctions, which may cause symptoms of dyspnea and inability to tolerate exercise. No single specific therapeutic agent can treat diabetic cardiomyopathy because once the disease is overt, the management may require a variety of approaches such as risk factors and lifestyle modification, glucose control (insulin, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors); hormones (IGF-1); ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril); angiotensin II receptor antagonists (losartan, olmesartan); beta adrenoreceptor antagonists (acebutolol, carvedilol); peptides (adrenomedullin); endothelin-1 receptor antagonists (bosentan, tezosentan); calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, verapamil); antioxidants (methalothionein, alpha tocopherol, alpha lipoic acid) and antihyperlipidemic drugs (simvastatin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe) to effectively treat patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "1000": "Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) offer superior tolerability to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and are increasingly used in patient management. ARBs vary in their pharmacological profiles, which results in efficacy differences. Therefore, deciding between ARBs should be evidence-based and related to the specific requirements of the individual patient. For patients with hypertension but at low additional risk, an ARB that provides sustained, powerful 24-h reductions in blood pressure is suitable. For patients at very high additional risk (with heart failure), an ARB with demonstrated efficacy in this patient population is the preferred option. For patients at increased risk, telmisartan should be the ARB of choice based on the results from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global End Point Trial (ONTARGET), which demonstrated for the first time that an ARB has equivalent protection to the reference angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in a broad cross-section of at-risk patients but a better side-effect profile.",

SRC occurs in 5% of patients with SSc, particularly in the first years of disease evolution and in the diffuse form. The occurrence of SRC is more common in patients treated with glucocorticoids, the risk increasing with increasing dose. Left ventricular insufficiency and hypertensive encephalopathy are typical clinical features. Thrombotic microangiopathy is detected in 43% of the cases. Anti-RNA-polymerase III antibodies are present in one third of patients who develop SRC. Renal biopsy is not necessary if SRC presents with classical features. However, it can help to define prognosis and guide treatment in atypical forms. The prognosis of SRC has dramatically improved with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). However, 5 years survival in SSc patients who develop the full picture of SRC remains low (65%). SRC is often triggered by nephrotoxic drugs and/or intravascular volume depletion. The treatment of SRC relies on aggressive control of blood pressure with ACEi, if needed in combination with other types of antihypertensive drugs. Dialysis is frequently indicated, but can be stopped in approximately half of patients, mainly in those for whom a perfect control of blood pressure is obtained. Patients who need dialysis for more than 2 years qualify for renal transplantation.",

Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce degradation of kinins, we studied the effects of PostC on infarct size and postischemic myocardial dysfunction in both normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) acutely or chronically treated with the ACE inhibitor Captopril. Isolated hearts from SHR and WKY rats were subjected to the following protocols: (a) ischemia for 30- and 120-min reperfusion (I/R); (b) I/R + PostC protocol (5-cycles 10-s I/R); (c) pretreatment with Captopril for 4-weeks before to subject the hearts to I/R with or without PostC maneuvers. Some SHR hearts were treated with Captopril during the 20- or 40-min early reperfusion with or without PostC maneuvers. Cardiac function was assessed in vivo with echocardiography. Left ventricular pressure and infarct size were measured ex vivo. Chronic Captopril significantly reduced left ventricular hypertrophy in SHR, and reduced infarct size in both WKY and SHR hearts. PostC maneuvers significantly reduced infarct size in WKY, but not in SHR hearts. Yet, PostC slightly improved postischemic systolic function in untreated SHR. Captopril given in reperfusion was unable to limit I/R injury in SHR hearts. Data show that PostC protection against infarct size is blunted in SHR and that PostC is unable to add its protective effect to those of chronic Captopril, which per se reduces cardiac hypertrophy and heart susceptibility to I/R insult.", 
    "1009": "The leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are insulin resistant and obese. However, the control of blood pressure in this model is not well defined. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of leptin and of the renin-angiotensin system in the cardiovascular abnormalities observed in obesity using a model lacking leptin. To this purpose, we measured blood pressure in ob/ob and control animals by radiotelemetry combined with fast Fourier transformation before and after both leptin and enalapril treatment. Autonomic function was assessed pharmacologically. Blood pressure during daytime was slightly higher in the ob/ob compared to control mice, while no difference in heart rate was observed. Blood pressure response to trimetaphane and heart rate response to metoprolol were greater in ob/ob mice than in control littermates indicating an activated sympathetic nervous system. Heart rate response to atropine was attenuated. Baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability were blunted in ob/ob mice, while low frequency of systolic blood pressure variability was found increased. Chronic leptin replacement reduced blood pressure and reversed the impaired autonomic function observed in ob/ob mice. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by enalapril treatment had similar effects, prior to the loss of weight. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the autonomic dysfunction caused by the lack of leptin in ob/ob mice and support a role of this interplay in the pathogenesis of obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome.",

The chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC, BEH C8 (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) column using a photodiode array detector. The mobile phase used consisted of a mixture of phosphate buffer pH 3.0 (0.01 M aqueous potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 3.0 adjusted with orthophosphoric acid) and solvent mixture (equal mixture of acetonitrile and methanol) in the ratio of 45:55 (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The described method was linear over ranges of 5.21-15.63 microg/mL for AB and 20.24-60.72 microg/mL for BH. The mean recoveries were 100.47 and 99.97% for AB and BH, respectively.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The present analysis included subjects (n = 982) from DREAM trial centers in Canada who had oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline, after 2 years, and at the end of the study. beta-Cell function was assessed using the fasting proinsulin-to-C-peptide ratio (PI/C) and the insulinogenic index (defined as 30-0 min insulin/30-0 min glucose) divided by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (insulinogenic index [IGI]/insulin resistance [IR]). RESULTS Subjects receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in IGI/IR between baseline and end of study compared with the placebo group (25.59 vs. 1.94, P < 0.0001) and a significant decrease in PI/C (-0.010 vs. -0.006, P < 0.0001). In contrast, there were no significant changes in IGI/IR or PI/C in subjects receiving ramipril compared with placebo (11.71 vs. 18.15, P = 0.89, and -0.007 vs. -0.008, P = 0.64, respectively). The impact of rosiglitazone on IGI/IR and PI/C was similar within subgroups of isolated IGT and IFG + IGT (all P < 0.001). Effects were more modest in those with isolated IFG (IGI/IR: 8.95 vs. 2.13, P = 0.03; PI/C: -0.003 vs. -0.001, P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, resulted in significant improvements in measures of beta-cell function over time in pre-diabetic subjects. Although the long-term sustainability of these improvements cannot be determined from the present study, these findings demonstrate that the diabetes preventive effect of rosiglitazone was in part a consequence of improved beta-cell function.",

In addition, cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies used to treat cancer, including classic chemotherapeutic agents, monoclonal antibodies that target tyrosine kinase receptors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and even antiangiogenic drugs and chemoprevention agents such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, all affect the cardiovascular system. One of the reasons is that many agents reach targets in the microenvironment and do not affect only the tumor. Combination therapy often amplifies cardiotoxicity, and radiotherapy can also cause heart problems, particularly when combined with chemotherapy. In the past, cardiotoxic risk was less evident, but it is increasingly an issue, particularly with combination therapy and adjuvant therapy. Today's oncologists must be fully aware of cardiovascular risks to avoid or prevent adverse cardiovascular effects, and cardiologists must now be ready to assist oncologists by performing evaluations relevant to the choice of therapy. There is a need for cooperation between these two areas and for the development of a novel discipline, which could be termed cardio-oncology or onco-cardiology. Here, we summarize the potential cardiovascular toxicities for a range of cancer chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents and emphasize the importance of evaluating cardiovascular risk when patients enter into trials and the need to develop guidelines that include collateral effects on the cardiovascular system. We also discuss mechanistic pathways and describe several potential protective agents that could be administered to patients with occult or overt risk for cardiovascular complications.", 
    "1034": "Involvement of the kidneys in Fabry disease (\"nephropathy\") occurs in male and female individuals. The majority of patients with progressive nephropathy will have significant proteinuria and develop progressive loss of kidney function, leading to ESRD. All too often, treating physicians may ignore \"normal\" serum creatinine levels or \"minimal\" proteinuria and fail to assess properly the severity of kidney involvement and institute appropriate management. Fabry nephropathy is treatable, even in patients with fairly advanced disease. Although the cornerstone of therapy remains enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase, this treatment alone does not reduce urine protein excretion. Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors must be added to enzyme replacement therapy to reduce urine protein excretion with the hope that this will stabilize kidney function. Kidney function, with at least estimated GFR based on serum creatinine and measurements of urinary protein, should be measured at every clinic visit, and the rate of change of the estimated GFR should be followed over time. Antiproteinuric therapy can be dosed to a prespecified urine protein target rather than a specific BP goal, with the proviso that successful therapy will usually lower the BP below the goal of 130/80 mmHg that is used for other forms of kidney disease. The overall goal for treating Fabry nephropathy is to reduce the rate of loss of GFR to -1 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr, which is that seen in the normal adult population. A systematic approach is presented for reaching this goal in the individual patient.", 
    "1035": "Renal fibrosis is the final common pathway of chronic kidney disease, and its progression predicts the degree of renal dysfunction. We investigated the renoprotective properties of pirfenidone in a remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure to determine its pharmacological potency compared to enalapril. Five-sixths nephrectomized rats were fed diet containing pirfenidone (approximately 700mg/kg/day) for 8weeks. Pirfenidone steadily inhibited the progression of proteinuria, but not to a significant degree. Pirfenidone prevented the elevation of plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. At the end of the experiment, pirfenidone had reduced systolic blood pressure by means of its renoprotective effect. In a histological study, pirfenidone improved interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex. These effects were supported by the suppression of the expression of TGF-beta and fibronectin in the mRNA of the kidney. In contrast, pirfenidone had little effect on the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, which is one of the proteins responsible for epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This property was confirmed by the TGF-beta-induced transdifferentiation observed in cultured normal rat kidney tubular epithelial NRK52E cells. These results suggest that pirfenidone improves the progression of chronic renal failure via its antifibrotic action, although pirfenidone has less effective TGF-beta-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation.",

A distintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS-1) is a newly discovered metalloproteinase. It was reported ADAMTS-1 had novel gelatin (type I collagen) degrading activities. We examined the role of ADAMTS-1 in the antifibrotic activity of the ACE inhibitor Captopril in a chronic viral myocarditis (CVMC) model. Balb/c mice were assigned to five groups: normal control group1 (group 1), normal control group2 (group 2), CVMC model group (group 3), CVMC control group (group 4) and Captopril therapy group (group 5). Group 3, 4 and 5 received Coxsackievirus B(3) to induce CVMC and group 5 was treated with Captopril (100mg/kg)for 28days. Heart sections were stained with picrosirius red and collagen volume fraction calculated. ADAMTS-1 expression was determined by Western blot. Type I collagen and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were measured by RT-PCR. Group 4 mice had significantly increased collagen volume fraction compared to groups 2 and 5 (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively) and higher type I collagen mRNA expression than groups 2 and 5 (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Group 5 ADAMTS-1 and ICTP expression was significantly higher than in groups 2 and 4 (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). ADAMTS-1 levels in group 5 negatively correlated with collagen volume fraction (r=-0.68, P<0.01) and type I collagen (r=-0.67, P<0.01) but positively correlated with ICTP (r=0.72, P<0.01). We conclude that ADAMTS-1 contributes to the antifibrotic effect of Captopril by accelerating the degradation of type I collagen in CVMC.",

To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-alpha production in lung tissues.

We previously reported that cardiac fibrosis induced by aldosterone and salt (Ald-NaCl) was exaggerated in AT1aR knockout mice (AT1aR-KOs). As the association of Rho kinase and oxidative stress was reported in Ald-NaCl-induced hypertension of rats, we investigated the effects of an MR antagonist (eplerenone) and a Rho kinase inhibitor (fasudil) on Ald-NaCl-induced cardiac fibrosis in AT1aR-KOs. AT1aR-KOs were administered aldosterone (0.15 microg/h) subcutaneously using an osmotic minipump and were provided with 1% NaCl drinking water for 4weeks. AT1aR-KOs receiving Ald-NaCl were treated with a low (30 mg/kg/day) or high (100mg/kg/day) dose of eplerenone or a fasudil (100mg/kg/day). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW), histological examination and cardiac gene expression were evaluated on day 28. Ald-NaCl treatment caused increases in SBP and LVW/BW in AT1aR-KOs, and eplerenone dose-dependently decreased SBP, LVW/BW and cardiac fibrosis. Fasudil decreased LVW/BW and cardiac fibrosis without affecting SBP. The expressions of connecting tissue growth factor (CTGF) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) components (p22phox, p47phox and p67phox) were increased in Ald-NaCl-treated AT1aR-KOs, and eplerenone or fasudil decreased the expression of CTGF and NADPH components. Phosphorylated ERM (a marker of the phosphorylation of Rho kinase) was increased in Ald-NaCl-treated AT1aR-KOs and was decreased by eplerenone. Nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which indicate tissue damage via oxidative stress, were increased in AT1aR-KO and were apparently attenuated by eplerenone or fasudil. These results suggested that the Rho kinase pathway was activated to induce cardiac fibrosis by Ald-NaCl via MR in AT1aR-KOs. A Rho kinase inhibitor as well as eplerenone might be useful for cardiac damage by Ald-NaCl.", 
    "1065": "Although therapeutic angiogenesis is a most promising strategy for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), it remains unknown if and how endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, such as endostatin, regulate angiogenesis in MI. In the present study the role of endostatin in left ventricular (LV) remodeling and heart failure was tested in a rat MI model.", 
    "1066": "When exposed to hypoxia, rat cardiomyocytes showed increased expression of endostatin. After MI induction in the rat MI model, endostatin expression was upregulated in cardiomyocytes, and serum endostatin levels were significantly elevated. Anti-endostatin antibody treatment resulted in significantly higher mortality of MI rats than controls. The MI rats with endostatin neutralization displayed adverse LV remodeling and severe heart failure compared with control MI rats. Although angiogenesis was increased, tissue remodeling and interstitial fibrosis were further exaggerated in post-MI hearts by endostatin neutralization. Furthermore, the expression and protease activity of matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9, and of angiotensin-converting enzyme were markedly elevated by endostatin neutralization.", 
    "1067": "Neutralization of endostatin worsens the symptoms and outcomes of MI in a rat model. The results imply that endogenous endostatin/collagen XVIII may suppress aberrant LV remodeling and heart failure after MI. (Circ J 2010; 74: 109 - 119).", 
    "1068": "Of 529 patients with heart failure and a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 29%, 209 (40%) were treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and 320 (60%) with an ICD. Mean follow-up was 34 months for both groups. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that significant independent variables for appropriate ICD shocks were statins (risk ratio = 0.35, P < .0001), smoking (risk ratio = 2.52, P < .0001), and digoxin (risk ratio = 1.92, P = .0001). Significant independent variables for time to deaths were use of CRT (risk ratio = 0.32, P = .0006), statins (risk ratio = 0.18, P < .0001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (risk ratio = 0.10, P < .0001), hypertension (risk ratio = 24.15, P < .0001), diabetes (risk ratio = 2.54, P = .0005), and age (risk ratio = 1.06, P < .0001). In conclusion, statins reduced and smoking and digoxin increased appropriate ICD shocks. Use of CRT, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers reduced mortality and hypertension, diabetes, and older age increased mortality.", 
    "1069": "Chronic inflammation may play a role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. CRP gene polymorphisms are associated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. It is unknown if CRP polymorphisms are associated with CKD progression or modify the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive therapy in delaying CKD progression.", 
    "1070": "We genotyped 642 participants with CKD from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), selecting five tag polymorphisms: rs2808630, rs1205, rs3093066, rs1417938, and rs3093058. We compared the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AASK to MAFs of African Americans from NHANES III. Among AASK participants, we evaluated the association of SNPs with CRP levels and prospectively with a composite: halving the GFR, ESRD, or death.", 
    "1071": "The MAF was higher for the rs2808630_G allele (P = 0.03) and lower for the rs1205_A allele (P = 0.03) in the AASK compared with NHANES III. Among AASK participants, the rs3093058_T allele predicted higher CRP concentrations (P < 0.0001) but not CKD progression. The rs2808630_GG genotype was associated with higher risk of the composite endpoint compared with the AA genotype (P = 0.002). Participants with the rs2808630_GG genotype on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus beta blockers had increased risk of progression (P = 0.03).", 
    "1072": "CRP SNPs that were associated with higher levels of CRP did not predict CKD progression. The rs2808630_GG genotype was associated with higher risk of CKD progression, and in patients with this genotype, ACEIs did not slow progression."
