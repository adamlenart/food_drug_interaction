    "0": "The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) among clinical status groups of 23 dogs with chronic heart failure was compared at various times after diagnosis of the problem. Eighteen dogs admitted in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV clinical status had significant elevations in PAC (P<0.0001), when compared with clinically normal dogs. Five dogs admitted in NYHA class III status and 4 dogs that responded with a change to NYHA class III status had significant elevations in PAC (P<0.01), when compared with clinically normal dogs. In patients with NYHA class IV status, the PAC was significantly greater (P<0.01) than in patients in NYHA class III status. For patients with the poorest prognosis, ie, severe signs of NYHA class IV status, the PAC was not markedly different, when compared with that for patients with a favorable prognosis, ie, recent onset of signs of NYHA class IV status. Patients treated with captopril had significantly lower PAC after therapy (P<0.01), whereas patients treated with hydralazine had significantly higher PAC (P<0.05) after therapy. It was concluded that heart failure in the dog increases PAC, most likely because of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activation, and that the increase is related directly to the clinical status of the patient. Further, it was concluded that treatment of dogs in heart failure with captopril causes a decrease in circulating PAC, whereas treatment with hydralazine causes an increase in circulating PAC.", 
    "1": "The hypotensive action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was investigated in 13 hypertensive patients in relation to their age, body weight, the pretreatment level of plasma renin activity (PRA), serum creatinine concentration and suppression of angiotensin II (PA II) by captopril. Captopril was administered in biweekly doubling doses (15 mg, 50 mg and finally 100 mg t.i.d.). The change in systolic blood pressure produced by captopril was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05 or less) related to age (r = 0.67), to weight (r = 0.55), to the initial PRA levels (r = -0.63) and to the drop in PA II (r = 0.67) but not to the serum creatinine concentration. The change in diastolic blood pressure was also (p less than or equal to 0.05 or less) related to age (r = 0.59), to the pretreatment PRA level (r = -0.71) and to the fall in PA II (r = 0.70) but not to weight or to serum creatinine concentration. Our data suggest that the hypotensive action of captopril is more pronounced in younger hypertensive patients.", 
    "2": "Captopril was tested as the treatment for a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) and its effects were compared with those of hydralazine. Captopril induced a rise in pulmonary pressures and in intrapulmonary shunt; hydralazine lowered pulmonary resistances and increased paO2 and blood O2 transport. Prospective studies in PPH treated with captopril are recommended and evaluation of all drugs not only by hemodynamic but also respiratory and O2 transport measurements.", 
    "3": "A comparison has been made of intestinal fluid absorption between male Okamoto spontaneously hypertensive rats (s.h.r.) and normotensive male Wistar controls. S.h.r. show enhanced fluid absorption both in hypertensive adults and in young s.h.r. before hypertension has developed. Several potential causes for increased fluid transport in s.h.r. were tested using pharmacological antagonists. It is unlikely that enhanced fluid absorption is due to high sympathetic nervous activity, the renin-angiotensin system or is secondary to hypertension. Intestine from s.h.r. have a high short-circuit current indicating a change in ion pump activity. These results are discussed in relation to the possible causes of increased fluid (ion) transport by the intestine of s.h.r.", 
    "4": "To test the peripheral mechanisms of prevention and reversal of two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) hypertension in the rat by lesion of the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region, we studied blood pressure responses in rats to AV3V lesion produced before (n = 8) or after (n = 8) clipping the left renal artery. Two groups of sham-lesioned, clipped rats (n = 9 each) served as controls. At the end of the experiments, saralasin and captopril were given to evaluate the angiotensin-dependent component of blood pressure. To study the influence of the procedures on plasma renin activity (PRA), two parallel groups of rats (n = 26 and 24, respectively) were submitted to similar surgical protocols. We observed that increases in blood pressure were significantly smaller in the previously lesioned compared to previously sham-lesioned animals (delta BP = 21.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 32.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01); also, AV3V lesion almost completely reversed hypertension (BP from 167.5 +/- 2.9 to 136.0 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), which was not observed in the sham-lesioned animals (BP from 172.0 +/- 2.8 to 168 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, NS). Saralasin produced a significantly smaller decrease in BP in the lesioned animals compared to those with sham lesions during both prevention and reversal experiments. Similar results were observed with captopril. Previous AV3V lesion did not significantly affect PRA with clipping of the renal artery, but AV3V destruction after hypertension had been established resulted in significantly lower PRA compared to sham-lesioned animals (4.58 +/- 0.72 vs 8.38 +/- 1.79, respectively, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Angiotensinogen is the most important component of the renin-angiotensin system present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the rat. Its physiological significance as well as its origin have not been clearly elucidated. In this experiment we have examined plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma and CSF angiotensinogen concentration under the following experimental conditions in male rats of the Wistar strain: 1) adrenalectomy (Adx) 4 days prior to sample collection; controls were sham Adx animals; 2) nephrectomy (Nx) 48 hours before blood and CSF collection; controls were sham Nx rats; 3) DOC-salt treatment (Cortexon depot, 50 mg/kg.s.c. twice a week) plus saline to drink was given during 4 weeks; controls were intact rats; 4) DOC-salt plus captopril: captopril (100 mg/kg/day) in the drinking fluid was added to the treatment of experimental and control animals of Group 3; 5) two-kidney, two clip hypertension: silver clips placed in both renal arteries 8 weeks before samples collection; control: sham-operated rats; 6) water deprivation: rats deprived of water for 5 days; controls: intact rats; 7) peripheral sympathectomy: 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HODA) injected s.c. from birth until 16 weeks of age, adrenodemedullectomy and adrenal denervation performed at 8 weeks; controls were vehicle-injected animals. Determination of angiotensinogen concentration in plasma and CSF was accomplished by incubation of the samples with excess hog renin. The angiotensin I released as well as PRA were evaluated using an specific radioimmunoassay technique. PRA was significantly increased by Adx, captopril treatment, and water deprivation, and was almost suppressed by Nx, DOC-salt, and DOC-salt plus captopril treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "When administered to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), dihydralazine (25 mg kg-1, daily) and captopril (100 mg kg-1, daily) prevent with the same efficacy genetic hypertension development (GHD). Dihydralazine treatment increased vascular mesenteric compliance, as shown by a significant decrease in the stiffness of the vessels (-27%), and induced slight reductions in contractility (-12%) and in wall to lumen (W/L) ratio (-15%). After treatment withdrawal, all these parameters returned to control values within 7 weeks, as did blood pressure. Captopril treatment also strongly increased the mesenteric vessels compliance, vessel stiffness being decreased by 16%, and reduced their contractility (-15%) and their W/L ratio (-30%). These effects as well as those exerted on blood pressure persisted up to 7 weeks after treatment ceased although there was a slight trend to a progressive reduction in the intensity of both phenomena. These experiments show that captopril but not dihydralazine has a long-lasting effect in opposing the functional and morphological vascular alterations occurring during GHD in SHRs and this phenomenon probably contributes to a large extent to the sustained preventive effects of the drug against GHD.", 
    "7": "The transient vasodepressor action of Met-enkephalin (10-80 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) in anaesthetized rats was significantly potentiated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (2 mg kg-1, i.v.); at this dose, it failed to modify the transient vasodepressor action of the non-specific vasodilator, nitroprusside (2.5, 5.0, 10 micrograms kg-1, i.v.). Captopril (2 mg kg-1, i.v.) caused a slow, progressive fall in the blood pressure of anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Pretreatment with naloxone (1.5 mg kg-1, i.v.) 30 min earlier failed to alter significantly the hypotensive action of captopril in anaesthetized SH rats. It was concluded that although captopril potentiated the vasodepressor action of Met-enkephalin in anaesthetized normotensive rats, potentiation of endogenous opioids does not appear to be involved in the hypotensive action of captopril in anaesthetized SH rats.", 
    "8": "This paper reports the experiences of our group with 68 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) admitted to hospitals of the University of Pittsburgh Health Center between 1955 and 1981 with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). The onset of SRC was characterized by four features, namely, onset or aggravation, usually abrupt, of arterial hypertension; appearance of Grade III or IV retinopathy; elevations of peripheral renin activity to at least twice the upper limit of normal; and rapid deterioration of renal function within a period of less than one month. Over 90% of our patients in whom these criteria could be determined had at least three of them present with the onset of SRC. Management of these patients during the first 15 years of this period was uniformly ineffective. Before 1971, no patients lived longer than a year; usual survival ranged from 1 to 3 months. With the advent of renal dialysis and the more effective treatment of severe hypertension, along with the utilization of bilateral nephrectomy in selected anuric patients, some improvement in longevity was achieved. However, only in the past few years have we accumulated a group of 11 patients who have survived for longer than one year. The clinical characteristics of the onset and progression of SRC suggest the sudden imposition of severe stress such as cold or an autoimmune insult affecting vulnerable arteries and arterioles. The renal damage becomes self-perpetuating with extremely high renin activity causing further rise in blood pressure and additional renal and systemic vascular damage. Progress in the last few years seems to have been achieved primarily by the advent of pharmacologic agents that specifically block the effect of angiotensin II by inhibiting the angiotensin I converting enzyme. When diagnosis is prompt and the condition is treated as an emergency with these compounds, we and others have found that normal renal function can be restored in a number of patients. The result is a considerably brighter outlook for patients with this previously rapidly fatal complication of progressive systemic sclerosis.", 
    "9": "Nine patients with refractory hypertension, ranging in age from 6 to 18 years, were given captopril. The underlying cause of hypertension varied widely, but in all patients captopril produced a marked decrease in blood pressure. After treatment with captopril, patients showed an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I levels, with a concomitant fall in plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone concentrations. Our data are similar to those reported in adults, and support the view that one mode of action of captopril is mediated via a decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration.", 
    "10": "The efficacy and safety of captopril were studied in 10 patients with secondary hypertension (renal parenchymal disease, four patients; renal artery stenosis, two; and renal transplant rejection, four). Captopril was administered according to a dose titration protocol that randomized the initial three doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) of drug to one of six possible sequences. All patients received diuretics prior to and during captopril therapy. A significant reduction in mean blood pressure was observed in all 10 patients during the initial dose titration. No correlation was observed between captopril dose and magnitude of the blood pressure reduction. The onset of antihypertensive action began approximately 15 minutes after each orally administered dose and reached the nadir approximately 1 1/2 hours later. Blood pressure returned to predrug levels between 6 and 10 hours after the dose. A significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted in all subjects after 1 week of captopril treatment and was maintained during the course of continuous therapy in nine of 10 patients. Captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide produced a satisfactory therapeutic response in five patients; in four others, additional antihypertensive drugs were required. No significant adverse effects were observed. Plasma renin activity determined prior to initiation of captopril was not predictive of blood pressure response to the drug. The clearance of captopril from patients with kidney failure ranged from 14.1 to 18.8 ml/min/kg in five subjects with creatine clearance between 10 and 21 ml/min/1.73 m2.", 
    "11": "Most diagnostic tests for primary aldosteronism use maneuvers to expand the extracellular fluid volume, thereby suppressing the renin-angiotensin system. This results in a decline in plasma aldosterone concentrations in normal subjects and essential hypertension (EH) patients, but not in patients with primary aldosteronism. Captopril blocks angiotensin II synthesis and might be used as a diagnostic test for primary aldosteronism. We have measured plasma aldosterone concentrations 2 h after the administration of 25 mg captopril in 9 normotensive subjects, 10 patients with EH, and 12 patients with primary aldosteronism while they were ingesting an unrestricted diet. The plasma aldosterone concentration decreased to less than 15 ng/dl in all normotensive subjects and in 9 of 10 patients with EH, but remained greater than 15 ng/dl in 4 of 5 patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and in all patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma. The aldosterone to renin ratio was greater than 50 in 4 of 5 patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and in all adenoma patients, but less than 50 in all normotensive subjects and EH patients. A nomogram comparing the plasma aldosterone concentration with the aldosterone to renin ratio clearly separated primary aldosteronism patients from EH patients.", 
    "12": "Direct renal effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs), captopril, SA446 and MK421, were examined in isolated rat kidneys perfused with a renin-substrate-free medium. Among three CEIs, only captopril induced a significant natriuresis, whereas SA446 and MK421 did not. UKV, renal vascular resistance and creatinine clearance were not affected by any of these CEIs. Renin release from perfused rat kidneys were not influenced by CEIs under the present experimental conditions. These results suggest that among three different types of CEIs, only captopril possesses natriuretic action in the isolated perfused rat kidney and that this action may be independent of its inhibitory action on angiotensin converting enzyme. It is also suggested that these three CEIs themselves do not have a direct effect on the renal vascular bed.", 
    "13": "The effects of a short-term oral treatment with captopril or enalapril, two converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) administered in equipotent antihypertensive doses, on the systemic vasopressor and on the renal, mesenteric and hind-limb vascular responses to cirazoline and UK 14304, respectively alpha1- and alpha2- adrenoceptor specific agonists, were investigated in the adult pithed SHR. Cirazoline and UK 14304 induced vasoconstrictor responses in the three investigated territories, demonstrating the location and a functional role at these levels of the two sub-types of alpha-adrenoceptors. Both captopril and enalapril reduced, to the same extent, the systemic pressor and the regional vasoconstrictor responses, especially in the renal and mesenteric territories, elicited by cirazoline and UK 14304, demonstrating that both subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors are involved in the CEIs-induced attentuation of sympathetic responses.", 
    "14": "The effects of a single oral dose (100 mg) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14,224), on blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA), and serum ACE were investigated in 18 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and in 4 with renovascular hypertension (RVH). in most patients, SQ 14,225 caused a significant reduction of BP during the subsequent 6 h, particularly in RVH patients. A significant correlation between basal PRA levels and BP reduction was observed only by considering all the patients together. After ACE blockade, a significant increase of PRA was observed in RVH and in normal-renin EH patients, but not in EH patients with lower PRA. Maximal serum ACE inhibition (over 50%) occurred after 2 h but diminished after 4 h and 6 h, whereas the BP decrease persisted for 6 h. After 3-day treatment with indomethacin (six patients) captopril's antihypertensive action was blunted, despite a reduction of baseline PRA levels and of captopril-induced PRA elevation. The antihypertensive effects of SQ 14,225 in low-renin EH patients, the lack of effect of ACE blockade on renin secretion in these patients, and the reduction of the antihypertensive effects of SQ 14,225 after indomethacin refute the interpretation of purely angiotensin-related antihypertensive mechanism.", 
    "15": "Bradykinin (BK) produced concentration-related relaxations of cat middle cerebral arteries and was ineffective in cat basilar arteries. On rabbit basilar arteries, BK initially produced concentration-related relaxations; however, when repeated at 2-hour intervals, BK eventually produced pure contractile responses. After preincubation of the tissues with cycloheximide, BK produced reproducible relaxation responses. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, SQ 14,225, BPP5a, and BPP9a, had no effect on the concentration-effect curves of BK, AII, or 5-HT with any of the preparations, but responses to AI were inhibited. These results suggest that, in these tissues, angiotensin-converting enzyme is important for conversion of AI to AII, but apparently not for the degradation of BK.", 
    "16": "Intravenous infusion of the converting-enzyme (CE) inhibitor, MK422 (1 mg X kg-1 X hr-1 for 30 minutes) in normotensive controls and two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) rats in the acute phase of renovascular hypertension had a significant hypotensive effect that persisted after 24 hours. In contrast to that prolonged effect, inhibition of the pressor responses to intraarterial or intravenous angiotensin I, and the potentiation of the depressor responses to intravenous bradykinin (BK), were evident during the hour following the infusion of MK422, but not 24 hours later. Potentiation of intraarterially administered BK, however, persisted for 24 hours after infusion of the CE inhibitor. It is concluded that at least the prolonged (24-hour) effect of the treatment with MK422 was due to inhibition of the CE activity in tissues other than the lung, and that increased levels of endogenous BK may be responsible for the inhibitor's hypotensive effect.", 
    "17": "The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been suggested as contributing to the pathogenesis of spontaneous hypertension in rats. Brain angiotensinogen- and angiotensin II (AII)-sensitive neurons were therefore investigated in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-sp) and in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with and without treatment by captopril (CAP). Angiotensinogen was decreased in the anterior hypothalamus but increased in the cortex, the hippocampus, and cerebellum of SHR-sp. There were no differences between SHR-sp and WKY rats concerning the angiotensinogen content of posterior hypothalamus, brain stem, and septum. The sensitivity of the septal neurons to microiontophoretically applied AII was elevated, however, in SHR-sp as compared to WKY rats with regard to threshold and maximal response for AII-evoked neuronal discharges. The excitation characteristics did not change with the age of animals in both WKY rats and SHR-sp. The treatment of SHR-sp with CAP (50 mg/kg/day per os) starting in weanlings kept animals normotensive and reduced the high sensitivity of septal neurons to AII. Simultaneously angiotensinogen content was increased in the anterior hypothalamus and suppressed in the hippocampus. The same treatment of WKY rats reduced blood pressure somewhat and increased the angiotensinogen content in the anterior hypothalamus without affecting the neuronal sensitivity to AII. Thus, malfunction of the brain RAS may participate in the hypertension of SHR-sp, since converting enzyme blockade with CAP inhibited the blood pressure rise, augmented the angiotensinogen content of the anterior hypothalamus, and decreased the sensitivity of AII receptors in the brains of these rats.", 
    "18": "The renin-angiotensin system is the most important hormonal system in the control of blood pressure. It can be blocked at several steps in its reaction pathway. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, or kininase II, is responsible for catalysing the formation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin II as well as for the breakdown of the vasodilator bradykinin. With the advent of specific orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) a practical and effective means of blocking angiotensin formation is now clinically available. ACE inhibitors are effective long-term therapy in patients with essential hypertension. They are particularly useful in the treatment of severe accelerated drug-resistant hypertension and renovascular hypertension, and the agents of choice for afterload reduction in severe congestive cardiac failure. They have several pharmacological advantages, important in anaesthetic practice, over other hypotensive agents. They have no central nervous or autonomic nervous system effects. Thus, patients being treated with ACE inhibitors retain normal sympathetic cardiovascular responses.", 
    "19": "Experiments were performed in 14 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs to 1) determine if the hepatic arterial vasoconstrictor effects of [des-Asp1]angiotensin I [( des-Asp1]ANG I) were due to its local conversion to angiotensin III (ANG III) and 2) to evaluate the magnitude of conversion of ANG I to angiotensin II (ANG II) and of [des-Asp1]ANG I to ANG III in the hepatic arterial vascular bed. Graded doses of these peptide agonists were administered as bolus injections directly into the hepatic artery; hepatic arterial blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. Dose-response relationships were determined before and during the inhibition of kinase II activity with captopril (2-D-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-proline) and antagonism of angiotensin receptor sites with [Ile7]angiotensin III [( Ile7]ANG III). ANG I and [des-Asp1]ANG I were equipotent at all doses tested, as were ANG II and III. At all doses tested, ANG II and III were approximately three times more potent than ANG I and [des-Asp1]-ANG I. Captopril attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses to ANG I and [des-Asp1]ANG I only, whereas [Ile7]ANG III inhibited the responses to all four angiotensin peptides. These data indicate that the hepatic arterial vasoconstrictor responses to [des-Asp1]ANG I were due to the intrahepatic formation of ANG III. The extent of intrahepatic conversion of [des-Asp1]-ANG I to ANG III that occurred in one transit through the hepatic arterial vascular bed was estimated to be 33%, which was similar to the estimated 38% conversion of ANG I to ANG II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Bradykinin (BK) and [des-Arg9]-bradykinin (-9BK) concentrations in blood and urine samples from 18 normotensive subjects and 23 patients with low-renin essential hypertension were determined by radioimmunoassay. BK and -9BK levels in venous blood from normotensive subjects were 67.1 +/- 60.8 pg/ml and 204.1 +/- 44.5 (mean +/- S.D.), respectively, and levels in urine from normotensive subjects were 5.3 +/- 5.3 ng/ml and 1.6 +/- 1.2, respectively. The blood and urinary levels of BK and -9BK in low-renin essential hypertensives were not significantly different from those of normotensives and did not change when the hypertensives were treated with the new orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril (MK421). It has been proposed that BK levels do not change with ACE inhibition because under these conditions BK might be metabolized to -9BK by kininase I. Since -9BK levels did not increase with MK421 treatment, this possibility can be excluded. The absence of elevations in blood and urine BK and -9BK after administration of MK421 does not support an involvement of kinins in the mechanism of antihypertensive action of MK421 in these patients. On the basis of the data, it is not possible to exclude such an involvement, however, because local changes in kinin concentrations could occur that are not reflected by changes in circulating or urinary kinin levels.", 
    "21": "Hemodynamic effects of the new oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were evaluated acutely in 15 patients with chronic heart failure and in 7 patients after 4 weeks of maintenance therapy. Initial hemodynamic effects were characterized by a significant increase in cardiac index (from 2.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.6 +/- 0.7 liters/min per m2) and a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (from 30 +/- 6 to 24 +/- 7 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (from 14 +/- 5 to 11 +/- 4 mm Hg), mean arterial pressure (from 96 +/- 16 to 80 +/- 17 mm Hg) and systemic vascular resistance (from 1,820 +/- 480 to 1,200 +/- 410 dynes . s . cm-5) without any significant change in heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. During maintenance therapy, the dose of diuretic drugs had to be increased because of systemic venous hypertension. Repeat hemodynamic study showed that after chronic therapy, cardiac index (2.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.08 liters/min per m2) and stroke volume index (24 +/- 10 vs. 36 +/- 7 ml/m2) remained elevated and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was lower than control (30 +/- 6 vs. 16 +/- 6 mm Hg), indicating sustained improvement in left ventricular performance. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma norepinephrine levels decreased after enalapril therapy and these humoral changes persisted during maintenance therapy. All patients receiving chronic therapy had symptomatic improvement. Significant hypotension, which occurred in five patients at the initiation of therapy, appears to be the major side effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Enalapril (MK-421) is a new oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor which was administered to eight patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Four hours after enalapril administration (10 to 20 mg), mean arterial pressure fell from 95.6 +/- 11.4 (SD) to 84.8 +/- 17.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), systemic vascular resistance fell from 18.5 +/- 3.0 to 15.8 +/- 4.1 units (p less than 0.02), while pulmonary artery wedge pressure changed insignificantly from 17.5 +/- 9.2 to 14.5 +/- 10.2 mm Hg and cardiac index rose insignificantly from 2.63 +/- 0.46 to 2.82 +/- 0.75 L/min/m2. These hemodynamic effects persisted during one month of enalapril administration. Baseline plasma renin activity of 0.76 +/- 1.07 ng/ml/hr rose to 3.23 +/- 2.87 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.05) after one month of enalapril administration. During the month of enalapril administration, maximal exercise duration rose from 465.1 +/- 233.0 to 572.3 +/- 233.7 seconds (p less than 0.05), and maximal oxygen uptake increased from 12.3 +/- 2.7 to 16 +/- 11.2 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.05). No major side effect occurred. These sustained effects may be clinically beneficial, and enalapril deserves further evaluation in the long-term treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "23": "Systolic time measurements, echocardiography, and bicycle exercise testing with cardiac output determinations (CO2 rebreathing) were used to evaluate cardiac performance in 16 male hypertensives at the end of a 4-wk placebo period and after 12 wk of treatment with increasing doses (maximum = 40 mg/day) of enalapril maleate (N = 11) and of placebo (N = 5). The effect of exercise on plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration was also measured. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 10 mm Hg or more in all but one subject who received enalapril. In both the enalapril- and placebo-treated subjects, the preejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio and fractional shortening of the left ventricle at rest and cardiac output and stroke volume during moderate exercise did not change during the study. Enalapril induced a compensatory rise in PRA (N = 10). Compared to plasma NE concentration, 1124 +/- 380 pg/ml (mean +/- SD), during exercise at the end of the initial placebo period, there was attenuation of the rise of plasma NE concentration, 851 +/- 290, at the same load of exercise during enalapril therapy. Unchanged cardiac performance despite effective long-term lowering of blood pressure with enalapril may relate to inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated facilitation of NE release from peripheral nerve endings.", 
    "24": "Angiotensin II and bradykinin are potent releasers of prostanoids, and it has been suggested that these prostanoids may modulate vascular tone in a number of organs. We previously showed that the pericardium is an important site of prostacyclin biosynthesis, and in this study we have investigated whether or not prostacyclin released into the pericardial fluid influences coronary blood flow. Angiotensin II and bradykinin were infused intra-aortically into anaesthetized dogs, and coronary blood flow in the circumflex artery was measured with electromagnetic probes. Krebs solution irrigating the pericardial surfaces was monitored for prostanoid release using a cascade of bioassay tissues as previously described. Angiotensin II infusions (25 ng/kg/min) increased arterial blood pressure, decreased coronary blood flow, and increased the release of a prostacyclin-like substance into the pericardial irrigating fluid. Inclusion of indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) in the pericardial irrigating fluid abolished angiotensin II-induced release of the prostacyclin-like substance from the heart, did not affect resting coronary flow, but potentiated the coronary vasoconstrictor response to intra-arterial angiotensin II. Bradykinin infusions (0.2 microgram/kg/min) also released the prostacyclin-like substance into the pericardial fluid, and caused a transient decrease in arterial pressure and increase in coronary blood flow. Inclusion of captopril (1 microgram/ml) in the irrigating fluid increased slightly the release of the prostacyclin-like substance, but did not alter the increase in coronary blood flow produced by bradykinin. Moreover, when prostacyclin release was abolished by pericardial indomethacin, the coronary vasodilator response to bradykinin was not altered. A large intravenous dose of indomethacin (5 mg/kg) increased the coronary vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II, but, again, did not alter the vasodilator response to bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Enalapril (MK 421) is a long-acting angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor which specifically lacks the sulfhydryl group of captopril. We measured arterial pressure and hormonal responses that occurred in 22 normotensive subjects treated with increasing doses of enalapril (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg) once daily, who were on either low (10 mEq) or high (200 mEq) sodium diets. In sodium-restricted subjects (n = 12), mean diastolic blood pressure declined from control levels in a dose-related fashion during the first 2 h. The mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure values were significantly lower than control (p less than 0.01) at all doses, with the greatest declines occurring with the 10 and 20 mg doses. Accompanying the decline in blood pressure was a significant increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) and reduction in plasma angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone levels. As with blood pressure, the greatest changes were observed with the 5, 10, and 20 mg doses. However, only the 20 mg dose of enalapril produced prolonged and significant PRA increments (p less than 0.01) and AII decrements (p less than 0.05) of at least 24 h in duration. In sodium-replete subjects (n = 10), a similar pattern of diastolic blood pressure responses was observed; however, the effect of the drug was not so profound. No significant decrease in AII occurred at any dose of enalapril; however, PRA increased modestly but significantly (p less than 0.01) after administration of 5, 10, and 20 mg enalapril. Plasma aldosterone declined modestly but significantly, 2 (p less than 0.05) and 4 (p less than 0.01) h after the 10 mg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II/III (AII/III) were detected by radioimmunoassay in homogenates of isolated liver granulomas from mice infected for 8 wk with Schistosoma mansoni. Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity, which could be completely inhibited by captopril, a specific ACE inhibitor, was also present as determined by radioassay. Spontaneous angiotensin I-generating activity was detected in homogenates that received supplemental angiotensinogen (protein renin substrate). This activity was partly inhibited by pepstatin, an acid protease inhibitor, indicating the presence of angiotensinogenase(s). Trypsinization of homogenates resulted in some AI generation, which suggests that homogenates had AI precursor. Treatment of infected mice with MK421, another specific ACE inhibitor, decreased granuloma ACE activity and AII content and size. AII, and to a lesser extent AIII, inhibited mouse peritoneal macrophage migration in an in vitro assay. These data support the contention that components of the angiotensin system are in the granuloma and may serve a function in regulation of the inflammation.", 
    "27": "The renal microcirculation was assessed in non-clipped kidneys of 23 Munich-Wistar rats with two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertension. Four weeks after placement of a renal arterial clip, mean systemic arterial pressure averaged 163 +/- 5 mm Hg in hypertensive rats as compared to 108 +/- 2 in sham-operated controls (n = 6 rats). Non-clipped kidneys in hypertensive rats were characterized by higher glomerular capillary hydraulic pressures, single nephron glomerular filtration rate, and afferent arteriolar resistance. The glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient was significantly reduced in hypertensive rats. In 10 of these rats, intravenous infusion of the angiotensin antagonist, saralasin, or the converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ20881, led to significant reductions in systemic arterial pressure and in afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance, on average by 8 +/- 3%, 15 +/- 4%, 28 +/- 5%, respectively. These changes were associated with significant increase in glomerular plasma flow, while ultrafiltration coefficient remained unaffected. In the presence of saralasin or SQ20881, infusion of a specific antagonist of the vascular action of arginine vasopressin led to significant systemic but not renal vasodilation. Thus, whereas systemic arterial pressure fell further, on average by 23 +/- 2%, renal arteriolar resistance remained constant, resulting in marked reduction in glomerular capillary hydraulic pressures (by 18 +/- 2%) and glomerular plasma flow rate (by 28 +/- 10%). Because of these pronounced reductions in glomerular pressures and flows induced by vasopressin antagonist, single nephron glomerular filtration rate fell markedly in hypertensive rats (by 34 +/- 6%) despite normalization of ultrafiltration coefficient. When hypertensive rats (n = 7) were treated with vasopressin antagonist alone, a modest fall in systemic arterial pressure was again observed in the absence of changes in renal arteriolar resistance. Due to this selective extrarenal vasodilatory action of vasopressin antagonist, glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure, plasma flow rate, and single nephron glomerular filtration rate again fell markedly. When these vasopressin antagonist pre-treated hypertensive rats were given saralasin or SQ20881, marked reductions in renal arteriolar resistance were observed in association with a significant increase in glomerular plasma flow rate. These observations made during acute inhibition of angiotensin II and vasopressin indicate that both of these vasopressin hormones may play important roles in maintaining systemic hypertension in hypertensive rat. By virtue of its preferential constrictor effects on extrarenal rather than renal vasculature vasopressin serves to maintain high glomerular pressures and flows in the non-clipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats.",

The hydroxamido function was borne by aspartic, glutamic, or aminoadipic acid and extended by 2, 3 or 4 bond lengths from the proline amide bond. L-glu(NHOH)-L-pro (Ki = 3.4 microM) and D,L-aminoadipicyl (NHOH)-L-pro (Ki = 1.2 microM) were the best competitive inhibitors of the hydrolysis of benzoyl-gly-his-gly but were not effective as affinity ligands for purification of the enzyme.", 
    "29": "The use of captopril in pregnancy has not previously been reported. We describe a patient who presented in the third trimester of pregnancy with severe hypertension secondary to renal artery fibromuscular hyperplasia and who was successfully treated with captopril alone and in combination with labetalol and frusemide.", 
    "30": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (captopril, enalapril) offer a new principle in the drug treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The present survey deals with the mode of action of the converting enzyme inhibitors, including possible interference with the renin-angiotensin systems in the kidney, the vascular wall and the brain, with the kallikrein--bradykinin system and with the sympathetic nervous system, at both pre- and postjunctional sites. Furthermore, the haemodynamic pattern as well as the therapeutic applications are discussed, including the most important side-effects, contra-indications, interactions and clinical pharmacokinetic properties.", 
    "31": "In order to clarify the role of the kallikrein-kinin system in the hypotensive mechanisms of converting-enzyme inhibition, captopril was administered in a single oral dose of 50 mg to 17 hypertensive patients, of whom 14 had essential hypertension, one had chronic renal failure, one had primary aldosteronism, and one had glucocorticoid responsive hyperaldosteronism. Captopril lowered blood pressure remarkably in either low-renin or normal-, and high-renin hypertensives, however, there was no significant relationship between the fall in blood pressure and pretreatment levels of plasma renin activity (PRA) in any of the patients any time after the administration. PRA was significantly increased in normal- and high-renin hypertensives but not in low-renin patients. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was decreased significantly in normal- and high-renin patients, while no significant change in PAC was observed in patients with low-renin activity. Captopril elevated plasma bradykinin concentration (PBK) from a control value of 12.5 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- s.d.) to 20.3 +/- 7.7 pg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 30 min, and there was a significant correlation between changes in PBK and changes in mean blood pressure 120 min after the administration in all the patients (r = 0.741, p less than 0.01, n = 17). In one patient with primary aldosteronism, PBK increased from a baseline of 10.0 to a maximum value of 19.0 pg/ml, corresponding to the rapid fall in blood pressure. Also, in one patient with glucocorticoid responsive hyperaldosteronism, captopril increased PBK from a control of 14.1 to 27.9 pg/ml at 30 min, corresponding to the marked fall in blood pressure from 170/106 to 136/90 mmHg. From these findings, it is suggested that the accumulation of kinins following captopril administration plays a major role in the short-term reduction of blood pressure in hypertensive patients, especially in those with low renin-angiotensin activity.", 
    "32": "Antihypertensive agents possess many properties that could cause alterations in renal function. These are: alterations in systemic hemodynamics, changes in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, direct intrarenal effects, and alterations in salt and water metabolism. This article reviews the antihypertensive agents in general usage and major points are made concerning potential deleterious effects of methyldopa and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on renal function. In particular, recent data are shown concerning the effects of labetalol on renal function indicating the absence of decrements in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. A possible decrease in these parameters in patients with severe renal insufficiency is presented and discussed.", 
    "33": "On the basis of the distribution of enkephalins within the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as on responses to their administration, it has been suggested that these peptides participate in the regulation of the circulation. The present series of experiments examined the effects of thiorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinase A, on cardiovascular responses to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of [D-Ala2,Met5]enkephalin (DAME) and its amide and on peripheral interactions with the sympathetic nervous system and vasoactive peptides. Thiorphan (30 micrograms i.c.v.) potentiated the pressor response to i.c.v. DAME and DAMEamide in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Responses to i.c.v. angiotensin I (AI) were unaffected suggesting lack of inhibition of central angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Peripheral administration of relatively large doses of thiorphan (30 and 100 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated the pressor response to i.v. AI by 30-40% and enhanced the depressor effect of i.v. bradykinin in anesthetized normotensive rats indicating inhibition of peripheral ACE. Pressor and tachycardic responses to activation of spinal sympathetic outflow were not altered by thiorphan in pithed normotensive rats. Thiorphan itself did not affect baseline blood pressure or heart rate in any of these experiments. In conclusion, inhibition of central enkephalinase A by i.c.v. administration of thiorphan potentiates the pressor response to i.c.v. DAME. The compound inhibits peripheral ACE but has little direct cardiovascular activity in its own right.", 
    "34": "In experiments lasting 8 h, low (0.5 mg kg-1) or medium (5 mg kg-1) subcutaneous doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were mildly dipsogenic in sham-operated rats, much more so in rats subjected to bilateral ureteric ligation and not at all in bilaterally nephrectomized rats. Rats with ligated ureters drank enough water to gain weight during the experiments. All other groups lost weight. The enhanced responsiveness of rats with ligated ureters, despite fluid retention, shows that captopril-induced drinking was not secondary to increased renal fluid loss. Ureteric ligation alone which caused some increase in renin secretion was mildly dipsogenic compared with sham operation. Captopril caused further increases in plasma renin concentration and more drinking suggesting that the captopril response is renin-dependent. The failure of the nephrectomized rat to drink after captopril also shows that the response is renin-dependent. The highest dose (50 mg kg-1) of captopril did not at first stimulate drinking, though water intake increased later. Slowness to drink was not the result of general depression of behaviour since drinking in response to subcutaneous hypertonic NaCl or intracranial angiotensin II was not inhibited by the highest dose. Slowness to drink after the highest dose was attributable to blockade of converting enzyme centrally as well as peripherally. This meant that the increased circulating angiotensin I resulting from peripheral blockade of converting enzyme was only slowly converted to angiotensin II in the brain. When cerebral conversion of angiotensin I was prevented by a single intracranial injection of 25 micrograms captopril, drinking in response to the lower doses of captopril was also inhibited in normal rats and in rats with ligated ureters. The same intracranial dose of captopril also inhibited drinking in response to intracranial injections of renin or angiotensin I, but not angiotensin II. The time course of inhibition of renin-induced drinking was similar to that of inhibition of subcutaneous captopril-induced drinking. In conclusion, subcutaneous captopril causes increased water intake through activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system, an effect that is enhanced when the system has already been partly activated by ureteric ligation. Increased circulating angiotensin I resulting from blockade of peripheral converting enzyme must be converted to angiotensin II in the brain in order to stimulate drinking. Drinking is not the consequence of increased fluid loss.", 
    "35": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of sodium depletion on basal sympathetic adrenergic vascular tone and vasoconstrictor responses to adrenergic nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Mean arterial pressure, tibial blood flow, and tibial vascular resistance were not significantly different between sodium-replete and sodium-deplete dogs. However, plasma renin activity (PRA) was 11-fold higher in sodium-deplete dogs (P less than 0.01). Sympathetic denervation in sodium-replete and -deplete dogs resulted in a similar decrease in tibial vascular resistance. Nerve stimulation at 0.25 and 0.5 Hz caused 40 +/- 5 and 48 +/- 5% decreases, respectively, in tibial blood flow in sodium-replete dogs and 71 +/- 3 and 77 +/- 3% decreases, respectively, in sodium-deplete dogs (P less than 0.01). Responses to norepinephrine administered intra-arterially were similar in both groups. Neither captopril nor saralasin reduced the potentiated responses to nerve stimulation in sodium-deplete dogs. Bilateral nephrectomy 24 h prior to the experiment reduced PRA to an undetectable level in both sodium-replete and -deplete dogs and equalized the responses to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in both groups. Because bilateral nephrectomy, but neither captopril nor saralasin, abolished the potentiated responses in sodium depletion, a renal hormone other than renin or vascular angiotensin II may be responsible for this prejunctional adrenergic potentiation.", 
    "36": "Increased renal production of prostaglandins are thought to be important for the maintenance of kidney blood flow in advanced cirrhosis. In alert, unanesthetized dogs with chronic cirrhosis and ascites, produced by bile duct ligation, we measured inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance before and after the intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production. Inulin and PAH clearance declined by 42 and 43%, respectively. This decline in renal perfusion was not associated with changes in blood pressure or cardiac output. If portal hypertension was prevented by creating an end-side portacaval anastomosis at the time of bile duct ligation, indomethacin was without effect on renal perfusion whether or not the dog had ascites. If ascites was completely mobilized in cirrhotic dogs with portal venous hypertension with the aid of a LeVeen valve, indomethacin depressed inulin and PAH clearance as usual during the steady-state period once all ascites had been removed. An attempt was made to determine some of the factors mediating the apparent increase in renal prostaglandin synthesis by administering various pharmacological antagonists. The inhibition of angiotensin effect with saralasin and the inhibition of kallikrein with aprotinin prevented the usual indomethacin effect. It is concluded that portal hypertension, but not a \"sick liver per se, in cirrhosis activates the renin-angiotensin system to both produce renal vasoconstriction and stimulate prostaglandin synthesis, thereby normalizing renal perfusion. Renal kallikrein also appears to play a role, probably by augmenting renin release.", 
    "37": "To determine the relationship between the early and late hemodynamic effects of captopril in patients with severe heart failure, we performed serial right heart catheterizations in 51 such patients who were treated with the drug for 2 to 8 weeks. Four hemodynamic patterns of response were observed. Nine patients had minimal responses initially (type I); six failed to improve during long-term treatment, but three showed delayed hemodynamic benefits. Twenty-eight patients had initial beneficial drug effects that were sustained after 48 hr and after 2 to 8 weeks (type II). In seven patients, first doses of captopril produced marked beneficial responses, but these became rapidly attenuated after 48 hr; nevertheless, continued therapy for 2 to 8 weeks was accompanied by spontaneous restoration of the hemodynamic effects of first doses of the drug, i.e., triphasic response (type III). In the remaining seven patients, attenuation of initial response was not reversed by prolonged captopril therapy; hemodynamic variables after 2 to 8 weeks had returned to their pretreatment values, i.e., drug tolerance (type IV). Plasma renin activity was lower in patients with minimal responses (0.6 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr) and was higher in patients with triphasic responses (9.4 +/- 2.5 ng/ml/hr) than in patients with types II and IV response patterns (4.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.8 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/hr, respectively; both p less than .05). Although first-dose effects of captopril are frequently sustained, the occurrence of delayed, attenuated, and triphasic responses indicates that a complex and variable relationship may exist between the early and late hemodynamic effects of vasodilator drugs in patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "38": "Ninety-two patients with heart failure refractory to digitalis and diuretic therapy had captopril (n = 50) or placebo (n = 42) added to their therapeutic regimen in a randomized, double-blind trial. During a 2 week dosage titration period, one captopril-treated patient died of an intracerebral hemorrhage. Over the remaining 10 week evaluation period, 1 captopril-treated patient (2%) was excluded from the study because of treatment failure as compared with 12 discontinuations (4 deaths and 8 failures [29%]) among the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Eighty percent of patients in the captopril group exhibited some degree of clinical improvement, whereas only 27% in the placebo group did so (p less than 0.001). The therapeutic advantage of captopril over placebo was evidenced by a mean improvement of 0.52 (2.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1) in the New York Heart Association functional class value as compared with 0.03 (2.9 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.1) with placebo (p less than 0.0001). There was a 24% mean increase in exercise tolerance with captopril (495 +/- 22 to 614 +/- 27 seconds) as compared with 0.4% with placebo (480 +/- 28 to 483 +/- 43 seconds) (p less than 0.01); the captopril group had an increase in the ejection fraction from a mean baseline value of 0.19 +/- 0.02 to 0.22 +2- 0.02 as compared with 0.19 +/- 0.02 to 0.18 +/- 0.002 (p less than 0.05) in the placebo group. A cohort analysis revealed that improvement in exercise tolerance with captopril was gradual and progressive throughout the 12 weeks. Improvement in specific symptoms of heart failure, that is, dyspnea, fatigue and orthopnea, and the reduction of edema also were greater in the captopril-treated patients (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001). Captopril therapy was well tolerated, although symptomatic hypotension after the first dose caused withdrawal of three patients (3%) from the study. It was concluded that captopril is an effective adjunctive treatment to digitalis and diuretic drugs for patients with refractory heart failure.", 
    "39": "To examine the importance of angiotensin II formation in the production of frusemide's acute peripheral venous and arterial responses, the effect of pretreatment with captopril was studied. Captopril abolished the acute increases in venous capacitance and blood pressure and attenuated the increases in forearm vascular resistance produced by intravenous frusemide. The study provides evidence that angiotensin II formation performs an essential role in the production of the acute vascular effects of frusemide in man.",

    "41": "Bradykinin (BK, 0.03-3.11 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) was infused intravenously for 4-5.5 h to assess its effects on pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein exchange in three groups of artificially ventilated sheep prepared with lung lymph fistulas. In group I, BK was infused alone for 5.5 h. In group II, BK and captopril (SQ 14,225), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), were infused together because the effects of BK may be attenuated by its rapid degradation in the lung by ACE. In group III, BK was infused in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, to prevent any permeability-decreasing effects of beta-adrenergic activation. The dosages of BK used, which decreased systemic arterial blood pressure by 10-20 mmHg, did not alter either pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein exchange or pulmonary hemodynamics at any time during infusion of BK alone or in combination with captopril or propranolol. Raising pulmonary microvascular pressure (Pmv) by inflating a left atrial balloon during the last 2 h of infusion in all three groups slightly increased pulmonary lymph flow and markedly decreased the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio. These results are comparable with those obtained after increasing Pmv in normal anesthetized sheep and indicate that BK did not alter the pulmonary vascular permeability to proteins.",

Dramatic and sustained symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement is reported. The possible clinical significance of this agent's favorable profile is briefly discussed.", 
    "43": "The renal effects of long-term antihypertensive treatment with enalapril were evaluated in 34 subjects (age, 53 yr; range, 27 to 65) with mild, uncomplicated hypertension. After receiving placebo for 4 wk, subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving incremental doses of enalapril (10, 20, or 40 mg/day for 4 wk each) in a single morning dose or two divided doses, or of placebo. One subject who received enalapril developed acute renal failure by the end of the study. There was no evidence of glomerular or tubular damage in the other subjects; as measured by 24-hr urinary protein excretion, urinary activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and uric acid clearance. During treatment with enalapril, renal plasma flow (measured with 131I-iodohippurate sodium) and glomerular filtration rate increased by 12.1% and 6.8%. Changes in renal plasma flow correlated inversely with age and final mean arterial pressure and correlated positively with initial plasma renin activity of subjects. Except for an occasional idiosyncratic adverse reaction, enalapril is a safe and effective antihypertensive drug with the unique ability to increase renal function despite a fall in renal perfusion pressure.", 
    "44": "Dietary sodium restriction reduces vascular smooth muscle, particularly renovascular, responsiveness to infused angiotensin II (AII), while the responsiveness of the adrenal and the AII-renin short feedback loop to AII is enhanced. To determine whether circulating AII mediates these changes in responsiveness, we studied 11 sodium-restricted and 9 sodium-replete normal subjects before and after 75 h of converting enzyme inhibitor pretreatment with MK421. All subjects received infusions of paraaminohippurate (PAH) to assess renal plasma flow during graded AII infusion (0.3-10 ng/kg X min) before and after MK421 administration. Plasma aldosterone, cortisol, PRA, AII, sodium, potassium, and PAH clearance were measured at the onset and end of each AII dose. In sodium-restricted subjects, preinfusion AII and aldosterone levels were significantly reduced, (P less than 0.001) to the range found in sodium-replete subjects, after 75 h of MK421 administration, whereas blood pressure and PAH responses to infused AII were significantly enhanced (P less than 0.01). Blood pressure and PAH responses to infused AII in sodium-replete subjects were not significantly modified by MK421 treatment, confirming that the drug effect was specific. In contrast, the plasma aldosterone increment and PRA decrement after AII infusion were similar before and after MK421 on both diets. Thus, sodium-modulated changes in PAH and blood pressure responsiveness to infused AII depend on circulating AII levels. However, circulating AII does not mediate sodium modulation of adrenal or PRA short-feedback loop responsiveness to infused AII. Two different mechanisms determine sodium modulation of tissue responsiveness to AII; in one, circulating AII via a receptor mechanism is the mediator, and in the other, some other factor(s) also linked to sodium intake must be responsible.", 
    "45": "We have studied the effect of blood pressure control upon left ventricular mass and function. Twenty hypertensive patients without clinical or electrocardiographic signs of cardiac involvement were given sequentially: placebo for two weeks; captopril (250 mg/day) for eight weeks; and captopril (125 mg/day), alone or combined with chlorthalidone (25 mg/day), for eight weeks. M-mode echocardiography was performed at the end of placebo period, after eight and after 16 weeks active treatment. Blood pressure was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) by therapy, the maximum decrease being observed at the end of the study. Similarly, interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness and left ventricular mass index showed a significant reduction (P less than 0.01 at the eighth and P less than 0.001 at the 16th week), while no changes were detected in left ventricular function. Furthermore, both wall stress index at end-diastole and end-systolic stress were significantly lowered by treatment (at the 16th week P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Baseline systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with the ratio of the left ventricular radius to posterior wall thickness (r = -0.97, P less than 0.001) but no relation was found between post-treatment fall in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass index. After treatment more patients showed normal left ventricular wall thickness in relation to systolic blood pressure. We conclude that in uncomplicated hypertensive patients captopril, either alone or combined with chlorthalidone, can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy by decreasing both septal and posterior wall thickness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be a safe and effective class of drug for treating the entire spectrum of hypertension, from very mild to severe. For the vast majority of patients who do not experience adverse side effects, these drugs appear to be remarkably well tolerated and are without the adverse metabolic and depressive effects associated with other antihypertensive drugs. Many patients report an enhanced feeling of well-being and may even experience euphoria. Whenever possible, CEIs should be used in the lowest possible effective dose in order to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit with a minimum or complete absence of adverse effects.", 
    "47": "Acute administration of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (2 X 10(-4) M), was shown in an earlier study to attenuate the contractile responses of aortic rings of rats to alpha-adrenergic agonists in vitro. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of chronic treatment with captopril on reactivity of aortic rings from both normotensive and renal hypertensive rats when captopril was no longer present. Four groups of rats were used: (1) normotensive, untreated; (2) normotensive, captopril-treated (48 mg/kg b.w. per day for five weeks); (3) hypertensive (bilateral renal encapsulation for five weeks), untreated and (4) hypertensive, captopril-treated. Renal encapsulation was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, which was prevented by concomitant treatment with captopril. At the end of the five weeks treatment aortic rings, 4 mm in length, were washed for 2 h to remove the captopril, following which contractile responses to various vasoactive agents were studied in vitro. Chronic treatment with captopril attenuated significantly contractile responses to both norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) and phenylephrine (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) but had no effect on isoproterenol-induced relaxation of KCl-depolarized tissue in the presence of 10(-5) M phentolamine. Contractile responses to angiotension I (10(-10) to 10(-7) M) did not differ statistically among the four groups. Following addition of captopril (2 X 10(-4) m) to the bath for 30 min, contractile responses to angiotensin I were attenuated in all four groups of rings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "The renal effects of the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK-421) and of its active metabolite MK-422, were investigated in patients with essential hypertension. Together with a reduction in blood pressure, renal blood flow increased after intravenous injection of MK-422. Glomerular filtration as well as fractional sodium excretion increased. The latter was explained by the inhibition of both proximal and distal tubular sodium reabsorption. During oral enalapril therapy renal blood flow remained elevated, whereas glomerular filtration did not differ significantly from pretreatment values. Body weight fell after 12 weeks of therapy, a possible consequence of the 'diuretic' effect of enalapril which may contribute to the antihypertensive action of the drug. In conclusion, enalapril had either no, or even beneficial, effects on renal function.", 
    "49": "Renin is stored in synaptosomes of rat brain, separately from cathepsin D and intraneuronal angiotensin II (ANG II) has been demonstrated with the electron-microscope. Although the subcellular localization of other components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have still to be investigated, these data suggest possible intracellular synthesis of ANG II in the brain. Brain ANG II is biochemically identical to the plasma peptide and corresponds to (IIe) 5-ANG II. The peptide level is unchanged after bilateral nephrectomy, and angiotensin I (ANG I) accumulation is observed in nephrectomized animals following brain angiotensin converting enzyme blockade. The significantly greater accumulation of ANG I and reduction of ANG II in stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) indicates a higher synthesis and turnover rate of ANG II in SHR. Most converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) penetrate the brain after chronic oral treatment. Part of their blood pressure lowering action may therefore be explained by an inhibition of the brain RAS.", 
    "50": "To assess the effects of enalapril eight hospitalized hypertensive patients on constant sodium intake were treated with incremental doses of this angiotensin converting enzyme blocking drug. After four days of placebo treatment enalapril was given in single daily doses, starting with 1.25 mg and increasing until blood pressure was adequately controlled. On the 1.25 mg dose, angiotensin II (AII) and blood pressure did not change significantly, despite a 50% reduction in converting enzyme activity. There were, however, significant increases in noradrenaline, renin and aldosterone. With high doses a more pronounced reduction in converting enzyme activity was found while AII, aldosterone and blood pressure all fell significantly. Renin levels rose, but noradrenaline and adrenaline were reduced. Orthostatic hypotension did not occur. With continued treatment renal vascular resistance decreased concurrently with enhanced natriuresis and a reduction in body weight. Plasma volume rose slightly. The data indicate that enalapril may lower blood pressure by converting enzyme inhibition, but sodium loss and a decrease in sympathetic activity are associated features.", 
    "51": "In hypertensive patients the time courses for the rise in serum MK-422 level, and fall in both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and blood pressure after 10 mg of enalapril were very similar. A close relationship between serum MK-422 levels and percentage ACE inhibition could be demonstrated and the acute fall in blood pressure showed a good correlation with either measurement. With chronic administration, serum MK-422 levels increased linearly with the dose of enalapril. As in the acute study, close relationships between the serum MK-422 level and ACE inhibition, and between either measurement and the fall in blood pressure, could be demonstrated after chronic enalapril administration. However, when compared to the acute response, the ACE inhibition dose-response line was shifted to the right after chronic enalapril therapy suggesting that enalapril may lead to ACE induction in humans. This did not appear to influence significantly the blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril or the relationship between ACE inhibition and the hypotensive effect.", 
    "52": "Enalapril, a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is well absorbed after oral administration, and hydrolised to its bioactive form, enalaprilic acid (EA). Administration with food does not affect its bioavailability; elimination is predominantly renal. Peak serum EA concentrations occur 4 h after an oral dose; its serum half-life is approximately 35 h, and steady state is achieved by the fourth day of treatment. Enalapril controls blood pressure in essential and renovascular hypertension without affecting heart rate or cardiovascular reflexes. It also decreases serum concentrations of ACE (for greater than 24 h), angiotensin II and aldosterone, and increases plasma renin activity. Once and twice-daily regimens are equally effective. In patients with congestive heart failure refractory to digitalis and diuretics, enalapril increases cardiac output and decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Long-term treatment produces improvement in NYHA functional classification, exercise capacity and ejection fraction. Human experience to date indicates that enalapril is safe and well tolerated.", 
    "53": "The mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower blood pressure remains unclear, but the weight of available data favour peripheral blockade of the formation of angiotensin II (AII). Previous work in rats has shown that the prodrug ACE inhibitor, enalapril (MK-421), lowered blood pressure most effectively when PRA was elevated [sodium deficiency, two-kidney, one figure 8 hypertension, diuretic-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)]. In sodium-deficient rats, the enalapril-sensitive component of the blood pressure was greatly reduced after salt loading, and nephrectomy blocked the antihypertensive response to enalapril in SHR. In the present study, further support that the mechanism of action of enalapril involves a reduction in AII has been obtained from rats made hypertensive by continuous intravenous (i.v.) AII infusion for 10 days. Enalapril administered for seven days did not significantly lower blood pressure, suggesting that there were no important non-angiotensin mechanisms (such as bradykinin potentiation) involved in its action. From earlier studies in SHR, the time course for blockade of angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses and the blood pressure reduction did not correspond, suggesting a tissue site of action. In the present studies in adult SHR, a central site of action was ruled out since the parent inhibitor, enalaprilic acid (MK-422), injected into the brain ventricles did not acutely reduce blood pressure. An interaction of enalaprilic acid with the sympathetic nervous system was evaluated in dogs in which adrenergic activity was enhanced as a result of diuretic-induced renin release. Enlaprilic acid did not alter the enhanced hindquarter vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Enalapril increased renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion. The mechanism of the natriuresis in dogs probably involves several mechanisms including a decrease in aldosterone biosynthesis, changes in renal function (glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow) and possibly blockade of a direct tubular effect of AII on sodium reabsorption. Enalaprlic acid was also studied in a closed chest dog model of acute left ventricular (LV) failure caused by embolization via the left main coronary artery with 50 microns plastic microspheres. Enalaprilic acid at 100 micrograms/kg i.v. reduced preload, afterload and improved LV performance without changing the heart rate. In conclusion, enalapril the prodrug, and enalaprilic acid the active inhibitor, are potentially useful in the treatment of hypertension and LV failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Plasma angiotensinogen was measured by two different methods in three groups of sodium-depleted rats: control rats, captopril-treated rats and enalapril-treated rats. The enzymatic method of measurement is an exhaustion technique which measures the amount of angiotensin I liberated from plasma by an excess of renin. Direct radioimmunoassay measures both angiotensinogen and its inactive residue, des-angio I-angiotensinogen, and the difference between the results of both methods can be used as an indirect measurement of plasma des-angio I-angiotensinogen. Both converting enzyme inhibitors decreased blood pressure, stimulated renin secretion, decreased plasma angiotensinogen and increased des-angio I-angiotensinogen. Plasma des-angio I-angiotensinogen levels were positively correlated with plasma renin levels. In converting enzyme inhibitor-treated rats, plasma aldosterone was slightly, but not significantly, lower than in control rats. Although plasma aldosterone was significantly correlated with plasma renin both in control rats and converting enzyme inhibitor-treated rats, plasma renin was elevated 10-fold in treated rats.", 
    "55": "We present a brief survey of changes in vasoactive peptide systems during therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Particular attention is paid to several methodological problems which are relevant to the clinical biochemistry and physiology of patients treated with this new type of drug.", 
    "56": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE;EC 3.4.15.1), or kininase II, was studied in serum, cultured endothelial cells from cord artery, in macrophages of humans, and in serum and purified plasma membranes of rats following treatment with inducers of ACE biosynthesis. ACE activity was measured in biological fluids with an enzyme kinetic method employing synthetic 1-hipp-1-his-l-leu tripeptide as a substrate, and with a new method using 125I-labelled specific inhibitor of ACE as a sensitive probe for ACE binding sites. The latter technique also proved suitable for the quantification of ACE in cells. Anti-human ACE antibody was employed for immunofluorescence studies in human cells. Dexamethasone treatment caused an increase in ACE in cultured human endothelial cells, macrophages and in rat pulmonary plasma membranes, but failed to increase serum ACE activity in rats. Captopril and enalapril treatment of hypertensive patients increased total serum ACE, the increase being evident after removal of the active drug from the serum by prolonged storage or chloramine T treatment (captopril) or by dialysis (enalapril). Captopril increased the ACE content of endothelial cells and macrophages. Macrophages appeared sensitive to captopril induction of ACE biosynthesis after pre-stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Dexamethasone treatment potentiated the known induction of ACE in rat pulmonary tissue. Thus ACE biosynthesis may be enhanced by three categories of treatment: (1) glucocorticoid; (2) macrophage activation; (3) ACE inhibitors. The precise mechanism of ACE induction and its possible biological relevance await further clarification.", 
    "57": "To define the short-term haemodynamic, hormonal and electrolyte effects of enalapril in chronic heart failure, we administered it to nine patients. The first dose (5 mg) induced a gradual reduction in plasma angiotensin II, systemic vascular resistance, arterial pressure, heart rate and right heart pressures, the maximum effects occurring within 4-8 h. Angiotensin II levels were still suppressed 24 h after the initial dose, but haemodynamic indices had returned almost to control values by this time. Dose-related increases in cardiac index and plasma renin, and decreases in angiotensin II, systemic vascular resistance and urine aldosterone excretion were seen with 5, 10 and 20 mg enalapril. Cumulative balances for sodium and potassium were positive, plasma potassium increased and plasma antidiuretic hormone fell. After 4-8 weeks of enalapril therapy, clinical status and exercise tolerance improved in the patients who were most severely restricted initially. Enalapril may be useful in the treatment of chronic heart failure.", 
    "58": "Enalapril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was given orally to 12 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA functional class III and VI) and cardiomegaly. Heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, right and left ventricular filling pressures and cardiac index were monitored during dose efficacy titration. The optimal dose averaged 17 mg given once-daily. All patients were recatheterized three months later. After stabilization of cardiac filling pressures, all patients had left ventricular filling pressures in excess of 18 mmHg. Enalapril increased cardiac index acutely by 34% but at 12 weeks follow-up, cardiac index was not different from control levels. Left ventricular filling pressure was reduced acutely by 36% and by 41% at three months. Heart rate, systemic arterial and right atrial pressures and plasma concentrations of aldosterone were reduced during the observation period. Renin was markedly elevated. These changes were accompanied by marked and sustained clinical improvement and subjective well-being.", 
    "59": "The haemodynamic effects of enalapril were evaluated by sequential radionuclide studies in 10 patients followed for three to seven months. The pattern of response was remarkably similar to that of angiotensin antagonists and other oral converting enzyme inhibitors; it consisted of a reduction in peripheral resistance, minimal blood volume changes and no significant increase in either cardiac output or heart rate. The haemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt remained normal, despite the lack of supine tachycardia in response to peripheral vasodilation. The pattern of response suggests that the haemodynamic effects of enalapril resulted from interference with angiotensin II (AII) generation rather than from a direct drug effect. Serial echocardiographic studies showed a significant regression in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in six out of seven hypertensive patients followed sequentially for three to seven months. Ventricular performance was well preserved despite the reduction in ventricular mass, as indicated by maintenance of the normal relationship of LV fractional shortening (% Sh) to LV end-systolic stress.", 
    "60": "Enalapril (10 mg), in young sodium replete normotensive males significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the supine and erect posture without orthostatic effects. As with captopril (25 mg) erect and supine heart rate did not differ from that after inactive placebo even at the time of maximum blood pressure reduction. The absence of reflex bradycardia was not related to a sympatho-inhibitory effect as the responses to Valsalva's manoeuvre, cold stress and dynamic and isometric exercise were unchanged by enalapril. Plasma noradrenaline was not different from that found after placebo treatment. Increased parasympathetic tone may contribute to the absence of tachycardia after converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "61": "Sodium intake has a substantial effect on target tissue responsiveness to angiotensin II (AII). These changes seem to be critical for normal regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure control. In a substantial number of patients with essential hypertension this normal sodium-mediated modulation of tissue responsiveness to AII is absent. These individuals may have either normal or high renin levels and can be characterized by a decreased adrenal responsiveness to AII on a low sodium intake and/or decreased vascular, particularly renal vascular, responsiveness to AII on a high sodium intake. While the underlying mechanisms are unclear, it is likely that a defect in the regulation of responsiveness to AII at the tissue level and/or its receptor is a major factor. The elevated blood pressure may result either from an alteration in renal sodium handling or inappropriate increases in AII levels, depending on ambient sodium intake. Thus, the patients can have either volume or AII-dependent hypertension. A most intriguing aspect of their disease process is that converting enzyme inhibitors appear to correct the underlying abnormality. If our hypothesis is confirmed, converting enzyme inhibitors may provide a more definitive and specific way to treat their hypertension than was anticipated when these drugs were developed.", 
    "62": "The converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, was given to 20 hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a single daily dose of 10-40 mg. Enalapril effectively controlled hypertension long-term, and only two of the 20 patients required concomitant diuretic treatment. The blood pressure reduction 6 h after the first dose of enalapril was significantly related to pre-treatment plasma concentrations of active renin and angiotensin II (AII), and to the concurrent fall in AII. Blood pressure fell further with continued treatment; the long-term reduction was not significantly related to pretreatment plasma renin or angiotensin II. At three months, 24 h after the last dose of enalapril, blood pressure, plasma AII and converting enzyme activity remained low, and active renin and angiotensin I (AI) high; 6 h after dosing, AII had, however, fallen further. During prolonged therapy, the increase of active renin was proportionately greater than that of angiotensin I. Enalapril alone caused a long-term reduction in exchangeable sodium, with slight increases in serum potassium, creatinine and urea. Enalapril alone did not impair overall renal function in five patients with bilateral renal lesions despite effective blood pressure reduction. Enalapril was well tolerated with no serious side-effects. Enalapril given once daily is effective in controlling hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis.", 
    "63": "This study was undertaken to evaluate whether, after long-term enalapril administration tachyphylaxis to the blockade of angiotensin II (Ang II) generation occurs. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, six patients taking enalapril once daily with or without an associated diuretic were studied for 7 h in hospital. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma converting enzyme activity, angiotension I (Ang I), Ang II and aldosterone were measured before and 2, 4 and 6 h after the morning dose of enalapril. While blood pressure remained unchanged after drug administration, Ang II and aldosterone levels fell following enalapril to very low levels, similar to those observed during the initial study, at the time of peak effect of enalapril. After enalapril administration, there was no correlation between plasma Ang I and Ang II suggesting that blockade of Ang II generation was complete, excluding the possibility of Ang I related interference with the Ang II measurements. These results indicate that virtually complete angiotension converting enzyme inhibition can still be achieved after prolonged use of enalapril.", 
    "64": "The efficacy of MK-421 was compared with that of propranolol in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, using a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized protocol. The two drugs reduced supine and standing blood pressures, but propranolol, unlike MK-421, reduced heart rate. Using a pulsed Doppler method, brachial artery diameter, blood velocity and blood flow were measured during the study. These indices increased after MK-421 but were not modified after propranolol. Forearm vascular resistance decreased both after MK-421 and propranolol. Thus, chronic treatment with MK-421 or propranolol in hypertension lowers blood pressure but acts differently on forearm circulation. MK-421 dilates both the brachial artery and the arterioles of the forearm while propranolol has no effect on these arterial indices.", 
    "65": "Enalapril maleate (MK 421), and hydrochlorothiazide were used to evaluate the control of hypertension and reversal of myocardial hypertrophy in Dahl sensitive (DS) and Dahl resistant (DR) rats given either a high (8% NaCl) or a low salt (0.4% NaCl) diet. Groups of six-week-old male DS and DR rats were treated with enalapril (15-100 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for eight weeks. Additional comparable groups of DS and DR were also treated with hydrochlorothiazide (60-400 mg/kg/day). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and heart weight/body weight (Hwt/Bwt) ratio were determined. We observed significant reduction in Hwt/Bwt ratio (P less than 0.001) along with control of SBP and DBP in the DS given a high salt diet treated with either enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide. However, in the DR given a high salt diet, cardiac regression (Hwt/Bwt ratio, P less than 0.05), SBP and DBP (P less than 0.01) reduction were seen only with enalapril. Similarly, cardiac regression (Hwt/Bwt ratio, P less than 0.05) was observed along with reduction of SBP and DBP (P less than 0.001) in the DS given a low salt diet and DR given enalapril. These data indicate that enalapril reduced SBP and DBP in association with cardiac regression in hypertensive and normotensive rats. In contrast, hydrochlorothiazide only reduced SBP, DBP and caused cardiac reversal (Hwt/Bwt ratio) in DS placed on a high salt diet.", 
    "66": "Ten years of experience with three different converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI; teprotide, captopril and enalapril) in over 300 hypertensive patients reveals that CEI act largely to block renin-angiotensin mediated vasoconstriction. Thus, their effectiveness or lack of it is predicted by the baseline plasma renin measurement. Accordingly, responses to these pharmacological agents can be used to identify and quantify renin-mediated vasoconstriction in the spectrum of hypertensive diseases. The converse is also generally true. Patients failing to respond to CEI exhibit low renin values and their increased peripheral resistance appears related to other mechanisms, possibly involving a subtle increase in total body sodium. Thus, low renin states such as low-renin essential hypertension, primary aldosteronism, and anephric man exhibit little or no response to CEI. The relationship between the renin system activity and effectiveness of CEI reflects a specific interference with a particular pathogenic mechanism which is further supported by the fact that two other types of renin system inhibitors (beta-blockers and saralasin) are similarly effective or ineffective according to the operant renin profile also by studies in patients with congestive heart failure without hypertension in whom the same relationships can be demonstrated. Like hypertensives, heart failure patients exhibit a broad spectrum of renin activity values, and their pretreatment renin levels predict the responses to CEI. We have also found that plasma renin values in heart failure are dependent on sodium intake. When salt is administered, renin falls and patients then become unresponsive to CEI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Male Broad Breasted White Turkeys (BBWT) represent an experimental model of arterial hypertension characterized by high levels of circulating and tissue catecholamines. We thought interesting to evaluate the efficacy of the long term treatment with different antihypertensive drugs. 59 male BBWT were studied, divided in five groups. The first group (13 animals) was treated with placebo; the second (14 animals) with oxprenolol 4 mg/Kg/q.d.; the third (10 animals) with labetalol 25 mg/Kg/q.d.; the fourth (11 animals) with verapamil 15 mg/Kg/ q.d.; the fifth (11 animals) with captopril 8 mg/Kg/ q.d. and furosemide 2,5 mg/Kg/q.d. All drugs were given p.o, from the 8th to the 33rd week of age. Weekly or every two weeks Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) were measured by an indirect method. In all animals BP progressively increased and HR progressively decreased with age. Only the labetalol-treated animals showed a significant reduction of BP and HR through the study period as compared with the placebo-treated animals. These results confirm the preminent role played by the high levels of circulating catecholamines in determining and maintaining the arterial hypertension.", 
    "68": "Fifty patients in severe congestive heart failure (CHF) were treated with captopril (Capoten; Squibb), an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, over a 2-year period (range 3-24 months, mean 8,6 +/- 7,7 months). At entry, all patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV despite high-dose diuretic and conventional vasodilator therapy. The overall cumulative survival at 6 and 12 months was 64% and 53% respectively. There were 22 deaths (18 during captopril therapy) including 8 sudden deaths. At 2-year follow-up (mean 14,6 +/- 6,9 months), there were 25 survivors on captopril; 18 in NYHA class I or IIS and 7 in class IIM or III. Diuretic requirements were decreased considerably in all. Side-effects were common but transient and in no case did captopril have to be withdrawn. We confirm our earlier conclusion that captopril has long-term beneficial effects and is a highly effective drug in the treatment of patients with CHF refractory to currently accepted therapy. Sudden death despite satisfactory clinical improvement continues to cause concern. Precautions which may reduce or avoid these are briefly discussed.", 
    "69": "Peptidergic-noradrenergic interactions were examined in explants of rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglia and in cultures of dissociated cells. The putative peptide transmitters substance P and somatostatin each increased the activity of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase after 1 week of exposure in culture. Maximal increases occurred at 10(-7) molar for each peptide, and either increasing or decreasing the concentration reduced the effects. Similar increases in tyrosine hydroxylase were produced by a metabolically stable agonist of substance P, while a substance P antagonist prevented the effects of the agonist. The data suggest that the increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity was mediated by peptide interaction with specific substance P receptors and that peptides may modulate sympathetic catecholaminergic function.", 
    "70": "Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of captopril attenuates the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat of the Okamoto strain (SHR) without altering sodium and water balance, plasma renin, or sympathoadrenal activities. To determine whether the depressor effect of intracerebroventricular captopril was associated with an alteration in peripheral vascular reactivity and/or baroreflex sensitivity, vascular reactivity to phenylephrine and vasopressin was assessed in renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter vascular beds using pulsed Doppler flow probes. Captopril was infused into the jugular vein or lateral ventricle of male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats for 4 weeks (osmotic mini pump, 1.25 micrograms/0.5 microliter/hr). Control SHR or WKY received intracerebroventricular infusions of vehicle. Four weeks of captopril decreased arterial pressure in both SHR and WKY. In response to phenylephrine and vasopressin, SHR and WKY treated with intracerebroventricular captopril showed significantly attenuated increases in arterial pressure and vascular resistance in comparison to either vehicle-treated rats or rats receiving intravenous captopril. Reflex decreases in heart rate in response to phenylephrine were also greater in SHR and WKY treated with intracerebroventricular captopril than in the other rat groups. Neither vascular reactivity nor baroreflex sensitivity was altered in rats treated with intravenous captopril. We conclude that the depressor effect of captopril involves a blunting of vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictors and a potentiation of the baroreflex.", 
    "71": "We examined the acute hemodynamic response to Captopril, an oral converting enzyme inhibitor, in 13 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) refractory to conventional therapy, including other vasodilators. Captopril was administered in four increasing doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg. The cardiac index (Cl) increased significantly (average +22%) in patients with high plasma renin activity (PRA). Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP) considerably decreased in all patients. A moderate decrease in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) was also observed. The heart rate (HR) did not change. Peak effect occurred 90 minutes after administration for the Cl, 30 to 120 minutes for PADP and SAP. The drug was well tolerated. This study confirms the acute beneficial hemodynamic effects of Captopril in patients with CHF refractory to conventional therapy. The possible mechanisms are discussed and the literature is reviewed.", 
    "72": "Studies were carried out in 39 barbiturate-anesthetized dogs to determine whether the renin-angiotensin system is important in control of hemodynamics and coronary flow during myocardial ischemia. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was 2.2 +/- 0.4 ng x ml-l x hr-1 immediately before coronary artery occlusion (CAO) and increased to 3.8 +/- 0.5 (p less than .005) 15 minutes after CAO. In nephrectomized dogs, PRA was 0.76 +/- 0.14 ng x ml-l x hr-1 two hours after nephrectomy and remained unchanged after CAO. In contrast, hemodynamic changes following CAO were similar between nephrectomized and intact dogs: mean arterial pressure fell from 126 +/- 4 pre CAO to 116 +/- 4 mm Hg post CAO (p less than 0.005) in nephrectomized dogs and from 130 +/- 11 to 120 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) in intact dogs. Left atrial pressure rose from 5.4 +/- 0.9 pre CAO to 7.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) post CAO in nephrectomized from 5.4 +/- 0.9 pre CAO to 7.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) post CAO in nephrectomized dogs and 6.3 +/- 1.3 to 9.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) in intact dogs. Heart rate remained unchanged in both groups. In sham-operated dogs without CAO, neither the angiotensin II blocker Saralasin nor the converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril had significant effects on systemic (SVR) and coronary (CVR) vascular resistances. In contrast, in dogs with CAO, these drugs reduced CVR from 1.28 +/- 0.13 mm Hg x ml-1 x min x 100 g heart weight (resistance units = RU) to 0.85 +/- 0.08 RU (p less than 0.05) (Saralasin) 15 minutes after treatment and from 1.17 +/- 0.09 to 0.88 +/- 0.08 RU (p less than 0.025), (Captopril) respectively. However, only Captopril reduced SVR, from 10.7 +/- 1.13 to 8.2 +/- 0.8 RU (p less than 0.025). Both Captopril and Saralasin induced a significant increase in collateral blood flow. Nephrectomy, two hours prior to CAO, significant increase in collateral blood flow. Nephrectomy, two hours prior to CAO, significantly reduced the effect of Captopril on CVR and collateral blood flow while the effect on SVR persisted. Thus the reduction in CVR appears to be an effect of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system; this system participates in control of CVR during CAO and may limit coronary collateral blood flow.", 
    "73": "Low doses (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril given intravenously to pithed rats were followed by long lasting falls in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures. Concomitantly pressor responses were reduced to either electrical stimulation of the thoraco-lumbar sympathetic outflow or intravenous injection of the ganglion stimulant McNeil-A-343. Positive chronotropic responses of the heart to cardiac nerve stimulation were unchanged after relatively large doses of the drug (3.0 mg/kg). The reductions in arterial blood pressure and pressor responses to McNeil-A-343 caused by captopril persisted following beta-adrenoreceptor blockade, renal sympathectomy or unilateral nephrectomy, but did not occur after acute bilateral nephrectomy nor during sodium and water retention due to unilateral nephrectomy plus subacute administration of desoxycorticosterone and saline. Pressor responses to noradrenaline were reduced after 1.0 mg/kg captopril i.v. whereas those to methoxamine or vasopressin were unaltered after 5.0 mg/kg. It is concluded that in the rat, after elimination of sympathetic tone by pithing, the level of the arterial blood pressure and the magnitude of pressor responses to peripheral sympathetic nerve activation depend on the basal activity of the renin-angiotensin system. This maintains sufficient angiotensin II production to ensure retention of some tone in resistance vessels together with presynaptic augmentation of noradrenaline output at a sympathetic postganglionic nerve endings. The latter effects are abolished after converting enzyme inhibition with captopril, consequent to reduced tissue levels of angiotensin II and perhaps potentiation of the actions of bradykinin.", 
    "74": "Subcutaneous administration of l-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the precursor of serotonin, to female rats induces copious drinking accompanied by activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Neither a reduction in blood pressure nor body temperature accompanied administration of 5-HTP. The objective of the present study was to determine whether serotonin-induced dipsogenesis, like that of 5-HTP, is mediated via the renin-angiotensin system. Serotonin (2 mg/kg, SC)-induced drinking was inhibited by the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol (150 micrograms/kg, IP), which also inhibits angiotensin II-induced drinking. Both captopril (35 mg/kg, IP), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and propranolol (6 mg/kg, IP), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocked serotonin-induced dipsogenesis. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine (6.25 micrograms/kg, SC), which suppresses renin release from the kidney, attenuated serotonin-induced water intake. The dipsogenic responses to submaximal concentrations of both serotonin (1 mg/kg, SC) and isoproterenol (8 micrograms/kg, SC) were additive rather than interactive suggesting that similar pathways mediate both responses. The serotonergic receptor antagonist, methysergide (3 mg/kg, IP), inhibited serotonin-induced drinking but had no effect on isoproterenol (25 micrograms/kg, SC)-induced dipsogenesis. However, neither serotonin (2 mg/kg, SC) nor isoproterenol (25 micrograms/kg, SC)-induced drinking was inhibited by cinanserin (25 micrograms/kg, IP). These data indicate that serotonin induces drinking in rats via the renin-angiotensin system. However, the results of the studies using methysergide suggest that serotonin appears to act at a point prior to activation of beta-adrenoceptors in the pathway leading to release of renin from the kidneys.", 
    "75": "A small double-blind pilot study was carried out to assess whether captopril treatment in hypertension has a euphoriant effect. Eight patients were maintained on constant therapy of atenolol and bendrofluazide for at least 4 weeks before and throughout the study. Captopril 25 mg three times daily or matching placebo was administered double-blind for 6 weeks, with crossover to placebo or captopril from Weeks 7 to 12. Psychiatric assessment was made at Weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. During the captopril phase, blood pressure was reduced, plasma angiotensin II lowered, and plasma renin raised. Mood was slightly, but significantly, lower during captopril administration; thus, there was no evidence of an euphoriant effect of captopril. This pilot trial also indicates the feasibility of the approach, and such studies of hypertensives under therapy should be usefully extended and refined.", 
    "76": "In hypertension, irrespective of its underlying etiology, the baseline pretreatment renin-sodium profile predicts the antihypertensive action or the lack of it for five major types of antihypertensive drugs: 1) diuretic agents; 2) beta-receptor blockers; 3) converting-enzyme inhibitors; 4) the alpha 1 postsynaptic blocker, prazosin; and 5) the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine. Moreover, vigorous compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system in response to therapy often explains initial drug ineffectiveness or resistance to treatment by diuretics and nonspecific vasodilators. This correlation between renin system behavior and antihypertensive drug efficacy likely reflect basic pharmacologic-physiologic interactions. This correlation is also observed in congestive heart failure without hypertension, where operant renin-aldosterone profiles may help to explain both drug efficacy and drug resistance to commonly administered therapeutic agents. Accordingly, a control system analysis of the renin axis has broad applications in therapy. The analysis is also conceptually significant since it exposes the operation of fundamentally different mechanisms of increased vascular resistance to flow occurring in different patients with hypertension or heart failure. One form is renin-angiotensin-mediated whereas the other, in the absence of renin, is associated with sodium-volume excess and/or abnormal alpha-adrenergic and calcium channel activity. Further definition of these two mechanisms of increased peripheral resistance could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of some forms of essential hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "77": "We have investigated the antihypertensive activity of relatively low daily doses of captopril in patients with mild and moderate arterial hypertension. In a first trial, at the end of a 2-week placebo washout period, 18 patients with essential hypertension WHO Stage I or II were treated with captopril, 25 mg three times daily (t.i.d.), 25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), 50 mg t.i.d., and 50 mg b.i.d., according to a randomized within-patient open design, with each regimen lasting for a 2-week period. In a second trial, 12 hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by chlorthalidone 25 mg daily as monotherapy (supine diastolic blood pressure at rest greater than 95 mm Hg), continued the diuretic treatment in combination with captopril, 25 mg t.i.d. and 25 mg b.i.d. according to a randomized within-patient open design. Analysis of variance did not reveal differences between the four captopril dosing schedules (1st trial), or between the two captopril dosing schedules (2nd trial). Both the patients on captopril monotherapy (1st trial) and those cotreated with chlorthalidone (2nd trial) showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values on each captopril regimen compared to prerandomization values (all p less than 0.01). No relevant unwanted effects were noted. We conclude that in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, either untreated or resistant to chlorthalidone, captopril is effective in reducing blood pressure even at daily doses not exceeding 150 mg, without differences between a t.i.d. and a b.i.d. dosing schedule.", 
    "78": "Nine patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension received, according to a randomized sequence, captopril (25 mg three times daily), nifedipine (10 mg three times daily), and both drugs for 1 week, with each treatment period separated by a 1-week interval during which a placebo was given. Captopril significantly reduced blood pressure and plasma aldosterone, increased plasma renin activity (PRA), and did not change heart rate. Nifedipine exerted a similar effect on blood pressure and PRA, but it increased heart rate and did not change aldosterone. Captopril plus nifedipine further reduced blood pressure and increased PRA, did not change heart rate, and reduced aldosterone to values similar to those after captopril alone. The hypotensive effect of captopril was highly predictable by basal PRA values, and that of nifedipine by age, while PRA increments induced by captopril were unrelated to those induced by nifedipine. These data indicate that: 1) captopril and nifedipine exert an additive effect on blood pressure and renin; 2) captopril counteracts the heart rate increase induced by nifedipine; 3) nifedipine does not influence the aldosterone inhibition induced by captopril. It is suggested that the association of the two drugs can be usefully employed in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "79": "The effects of 6 weeks of treatment with captopril on the renal hemodynamics of 16 patients with treatment-resistant renal hypertension (six had diabetic nephropathy, seven had other renal parenchymatous disease, and three had renovascular disease) were studied. Significant changes in glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, plasma renin activity, urinary aldosterone, and mean blood pressure were noted in the patients with renal parenchymatous disease, but not in those with diabetic nephropathy. Renal blood flow remained unchanged in all patients. Captopril was well tolerated.", 
    "80": "Most forms of hypertension require life-long treatment; thus, it is important to determine the continuing effectiveness and safety of any new therapeutic agent. While participating in various investigational studies, 7103 hypertensive patients received captopril, of whom 4397 were treated for 3 months to 4 years. The 4-year patients included 2498 with mild or moderate essential hypertension (diastolic pressure less than 120 mm Hg), 893 with severe essential hypertension, and 517 with renovascular hypertension. Repeated examinations of these long-term therapy patients, the majority of whom also were receiving a diuretic, indicated no drug tolerance to the combination, i.e., there was continuing control of the blood pressure without significant increases in dosage or addition of other drugs. Side-effects occurring during the first few months of captopril administration (rash, taste disturbances, and, rarely, neutropenia) were not a problem during prolonged therapy. A few patients (70/7,103, or 1.0%) developed proteinuria, usually reversible and seldom associated with any deterioration of renal function. The proteinuria occurred most often in patients who had preexisting renal disease and were receiving high doses of the drug. There were no significant changes in key biochemical parameters. A total of 230 patients discontinued treatment for failure to maintain adequate blood pressure reduction, and 397 for side-effects. The estimated 4-year cumulative frequency of drug discontinuance for side-effects was 11.6% (life table method), which compares favorably with other classes of antihypertensive drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Short-term results of this double-blind control trial (previously reported) in patients with initial diastolic blood pressures (DBP) in the range of 92-109 mm Hg indicated that doses of 12.5 or 25 mg captopril (C) three times daily (t.i.d.) and 37.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) had similar antihypertensive effectiveness as 50 mg t.i.d. After 7 weeks of C, the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (H) to two-thirds of the patients enhanced the antihypertensive response. This report presents the results of unchanged and uninterrupted treatment for 9.5 months in 46 patients taking C alone, and for 7.8 months in 94 patients taking C plus H or H alone. With C alone, reductions in DBP averaged 8.3, 11.0, 15.1, and 17.5 mm Hg with the 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg doses respectively. The response to the 12.5 mg dose only was significantly less than the 50 mg dose. With H alone, the reduction in DBP averaged 10.6 mm Hg and with C plus H reductions averaged 15.6, 18.1, 16.8, and 18.7 mm Hg with the 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg doses of C, respectively. Reductions in DBP with C plus H regimens were significantly different from H alone. There was no waning of effectiveness from short to long term except for the 12.5 mg dose of C alone. During the long-term phase, two patients developed rash and one lost the sense of taste. Neutropenia in one patient probably was not drug-related. There were no terminations for elevated DBP greater than 104 mm Hg on two successive visits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Drinking behaviour and its possible regulation by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been examined in the euryhaline flounder. Fluid intake was greater in seawater (SW)-adapted than freshwater (FW)-adapted fish, the latter having significantly lower plasma sodium, chloride, and osmotic concentrations. Oesophageal cannulation in SW-adapted fish resulted in further elevation of drinking rates, which increased proportionally with progressive body water loss as measured by the fall in body weight and rise in plasma tonicity. The influence of the RAS on drinking in SW-adapted fish was examined in animals with an intact gastrointestinal tract. Fluid intake fell markedly following administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril. Infusions of angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) induced dose-related increments in the rate of drinking. The increased drinking in response to AI was inhibited, however, by the simultaneous administration of Captopril. The results are consistent with the presence in the flounder of the major elements of the RAS, including AI, AII, and a converting enzyme-like substance. The RAS appears to play an important regulatory role in the adaptative drinking behaviour associated with migration of euryhaline teleosts between FW and SW.", 
    "83": "The effect of acute renal failure (ARF) on the metabolism and covalent binding to plasma proteins (PP) of [14C]captopril [( 14C]CP) was investigated in the Wistar rat in vivo and in vitro using human and rat plasma. In the rat, ARF was induced by parenteral administration of glycerol. Glycerol-induced ARF markedly reduced the renal excretion of [14C]CP, the major route of elimination of the drug in control rats, but did not alter the plasma clearance of [14C]CP. However, there was a significant increase in the plasma concentrations of [14C]CP mixed disulphides with glutathione, cysteine and PP. The increase in mixed disulphide formation did not result in an increase in the concentration of radioactivity in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen or bile. Thus, control rats excreted 9.64 +/- 4.24% of the dose into bile in 3 hr while rats with ARF excreted 7.14 +/- 2.46%. In vitro, [14C]CP reacted rapidly with human or rat plasma to form mixed disulphides with endogenous thiols and PP. With uraemic plasma, there was a significant decrease in the amount of [14C]CP covalently bound to PP from both man and the rat.", 
    "84": "In mice, the juxtaglomerular cells were examined using qualitative and quantitative electron microscopy after an administration of captopril. After treatment with captopril for 2, 7 and 14 days, the specific granules were decreased in number, the Golgi apparatus was well developed, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum was dilated in profile. In the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, the intracisternal granules were occasionally seen after a 2-day treatment, were increased in size and number after a 7-day treatment and were hardly seen after a 14-day treatment. In a few cells associated with intracisternal granules on the 7th day, the Golgi apparatus was not well developed and some lysosomal bodies containing granules similar to the intracisternal granules were seen. In these cells, an excess of the intracisternal granules may be controlled by lysosomes. These findings suggest that the juxtaglomerular cells stimulate renin synthesis after long-term treatment with captopril, but a further increase in renin synthesis cannot be expected after the 7th day.", 
    "85": "We evaluated electrocardiographically the acute effect of captopril in the initial treatment of malignant or severe hypertension and the findings were compared with the data obtained with diazoxide. The captopril group included seven patients treated with captopril or with a combination of diuretics. The diazoxide group included seven patients initially treated with diazoxide. A significant and similar degree of reduction in blood pressure was observed the second day after treatment in both groups. From 15 to 60 minutes after treatment, however, the reduction in mean blood pressure was more pronounced in the diazoxide group and was followed by a reflex tachycardia. In the diazoxide group, two patients went into shock and another three had nausea and vomiting, whereas in the captopril group there were no complications in any of the patients. In the captopril group ECG ST-T findings in leads V5 and V6 did not deteriorate, while in the diazoxide group there was a significant deterioration (p = 0.01). Thus captopril may be an effective and safe compound for the initial treatment of malignant or severe hypertension.", 
    "86": "Diuretic therapy is frequently accompanied by undesirable biochemical changes and side-effects. Two multicenter trials compared the effects of captopril combined with a diuretic to the administration of either agent alone in mild-to-moderate hypertensives. In addition to blood pressure, effects on serum potassium, uric acid, glucose, and cholesterol were examined. The first study (Study A) was conducted on 210 such patients randomly assigned to receive: 1) hydrochlorothiazide (H) 15 mg three times daily (t.i.d.); 2) captopril (C) 25 mg t.i.d.; or 3) C + H for 6 weeks. The second study (Study B) involved 415 patients randomly assigned to receive: 1) C 25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) + H 25 mg b.i.d.; 2) C 50 mg b.i.d. + H 25 mg b.i.d.; 3) C 50 mg b.i.d. + placebo b.i.d.; 4) placebo b.i.d. + H 25 mg b.i.d.; or 5) placebo b.i.d. + placebo b.i.d. for 6 weeks. In both Studies A and B, all patients except those receiving placebo only (Study B-5) had significant (p less than 0.05) blood pressure reductions. In Study A, the combination of C + H (A-3) produced a significantly greater (p less than 0.001) reduction in blood pressure than either agent alone. In Study B, both C + H groups (B-1, B-2) had a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) blood pressure reduction than that seen with C alone (B-3). In Study A, those treated with H alone (A-1) had a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in serum potassium and increases in uric acid, glucose, and cholesterol when compared to C alone (A-2) where no changes in these parameters were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The antihypertensive effectiveness of twice-daily dosing with the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was examined in a multicenter study of 294 patients (181 white, 111 black, two oriental) with essential hypertension whose supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was 95 mm Hg or higher after 4 to 6 weeks of preliminary placebo administration. In this double-blind study, the patients were randomized into one placebo and three captopril-treated groups: twice-daily placebo (n = 77) or twice-daily captopril 25 mg (n = 77), 50 mg (n = 71), or 100 mg (n = 69). The average decreases in SDBP after 8 weeks of treatment were 5.2%, 7.7%, 11.7%, and 10.5%, respectively. Only the two higher dose groups differed significantly from the placebo group; they also differed from the lowest dose group. The proportions of patients classified as having normalized pressures (SDBP less than 90 mm Hg) in the four groups were 39%, 47%, 70%, and 50%. If the results were analyzed by race, all three captopril-treated groups differed significantly from the placebo-treated group in the white patients but not in the black patients. However, direct comparisons between the white and black groups showed a difference only at the low, 25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), captopril dose. Thus, although conventionally given on a three-times daily basis, the twice-daily (12-hourly) administration of captopril provides effective antihypertensive treatment in doses of 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. Moreover, white patients also exhibit a significant response to captopril at doses as low as 25 mg b.i.d.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Similar pressor mechanisms should be active in hypertensive and normotensive subjects since hypertension is a quantitative rather than qualitative disorder. Consequently, if an antihypertensive drug is designed to specifically block a well-defined mechanism involved in blood pressure regulation, it should be possible to evaluate its efficacy rather precisely in normotensive volunteers before even administering the compound to a hypertensive patient. That this is indeed the case is illustrated by the example of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. The magnitude of blockade that can be obtained in humans, the minimal does needed for maximal efficacy, and the onset and duration of action of the agents have all been precisely determined in normotensive volunteers. Subsequent administration to hypertensive patients merely confirmed these findings. Moreover, if the antihypertensive effect of converting-enzyme inhibitors could not be predicted in an individual hypertensive patient, this is not related to some unknown action of the drug that cannot be assessed in normal volunteers but rather to our lack of understanding of the precise mixture of pathogenetic mechanisms prevailing in any particular patient. Only the safety evaluation and the search for side-effects still has to be carried out in nonspecific fashion, thus requiring long-term observations in large numbers of patients. If the tolerance of new converting-enzyme inhibitors were more predictable, the number of studies in hypertensive patients could be drastically reduced since the antihypertensive profile of any new converting-enzyme inhibitor can probably be precisely determined in normotensive volunteers.", 
    "89": "Captopril infused into the lateral ventricle (ICV) of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) decreases blood pressure. The current study was designed to explore the effects of brain converting-enzyme inhibition in young animals before the development of established hypertension and to characterize changes induced by captopril in a variety of pressor systems that might be responsible for the development of hypertension in this strain. Captopril (1.25 micrograms/0.5 microliter/hr) was infused into male SHR starting at 7 weeks of age. Four weeks later systolic blood pressure was only 157 +/- 3.3 compared to 181 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in vehicle-infused controls, and the pressor effect of ICV-injected angiotensin I was attenuated by 50%. When the same dose of captopril was infused intravenously, hypertension progressed as in vehicle-treated rats. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (SACE) and plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration were significantly higher (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively), in the ICV captopril group than in the ICV vehicle group, while plasma aldosterone concentration and renin activity, fluid intake, urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion were similar in the two groups. Peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity assessed in the resting state was not altered by captopril treatment. In addition, AVP content of the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and pons medulla were not altered by ICV captopril. Renin activity was elevated in the telencephalon of ICV captopril-treated animals but unaltered in the other brain regions examined. These data demonstrate that ICV administration of captopril attenuates the development of hypertension in young SHR by mechanisms apparently independent of altered fluid and sodium balance and the sympathoadrenal system. The effect on blood pressure occurs in the absence of changes in renin activity or AVP content of plasma or those brain regions most often associated with blood pressure control.", 
    "90": "Intrarenal conversion of angiotensin I (ANG I) to angiotensin II (ANG II) under conditions of normal and reduced renal blood flow (RBF) elicited by constriction of the renal artery was examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. In eight animals, tracer doses of 125I-ANG I (5-12 pmol) were injected into the renal artery and 125I-ANG I, 125I-ANG II, and 125I-labeled metabolites were measured in renal venous effluent by high-voltage paper electrophoresis. The mean conversion of ANG I to ANG II during a single passage through the kidney was 21.8 +/- 2.1% at control RBF. When RBF was decreased by 25 and 53%, percent ANG I conversion was not altered significantly. In six dogs percent conversion of 125I-[Sar1, Ile5]ANG I, an ANG I analogue refractory to hydrolysis by aminopeptidases, was 18.1 +/- 1.7% at control RBF and did not change significantly when the RBF was reduced by 55%. Although there were severalfold increases in renal renin secretion rate and net ANG I generation rate during reduced RBF, net renal ANG II formation rate did not change significantly. These data indicate that there is substantial conversion of ANG I in a single passage through the dog kidney and that intrarenal ANG I conversion is independent of RBF even under conditions in which renin secretion rate and ANG I generation rate are increased severalfold.",

All underwent a 4-wk washout-placebo phase and were then assigned to a dosing schedule of either 10 mg enalapril once daily, 5 mg enalapril twice daily, or placebo twice daily for 12 wk. Conditional on diastolic pressure, the dose was increased at 4-wk intervals to a maximum of 40 mg daily or until control was achieved or the end of the study reached. At the end of the 12-wk titration phase, there was a follow-up period during which measurements were made after discontinuation of the medication. Mean supine diastolic pressure decreased from baseline (98.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg) during the titration phase (86.3 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) in the group taking enalapril once daily. In three of the eight patients in the once-daily group and five of eight in the twice-daily group, supine diastolic pressures fell below 90 mm Hg. Neither supine nor standing systolic pressure nor standing diastolic pressure decreased significantly from pretreatment levels during enalapril once or twice daily. Heart rates measured after 5 min supine rest were not altered by enalapril. Enalapril induced inhibition of converting enzyme activity at all dose levels and with both dosing schedules. No adverse effect attributable to enalapril occurred during the study. The data indicate that once-daily enalapril is safe and effective treatment for mild low-renin essential hypertension.", 
    "94": "The first oral converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril, has been used to treat hypertension and cardiac failure since 1978. Based on this two year experience, we studied the side-effects of this drug in 64 patients, a privileged series as it included 32 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure and 32 patients with cardiac failure and normal renal function. After 16 months of treatment, we observed 19 p. 100 of skin complaints, 17 p. 100 disturbance of taste, 6 p. 100 oral problems, and one case of orthostatic hypotension. From the biological point of view: 20 p. 100 eosinophilia, 10 p. 100 hyperkalemia, 5 p. 100 antinuclear antibodies, 2 p. 100 renal failure, and one case of agranulocytosis. The group with renal failure had many more side effects due to a relative dosage (corrected for weight and renal function) which was three times as great. It would therefore appear to be essential to adapt the dosage in each individual case, a task which we have attempted using a formula which considerably reduced the incidence of side effects in our series: (formula; see text)", 
    "95": "We investigated the role of prostaglandins in the renal effects of endogenous kinins in anaesthetized dogs. Endogenous kinin levels, as indicated by urinary kinin excretion, were increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or by 10-min renal artery occlusion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril resulted in increased renal blood flow that was not prevented by prior inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin. The renal vasodilation after temporary renal artery occlusion was also not altered by indomethacin treatment. Thus both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and renal artery occlusion caused increased kinin levels and renal vasodilation that was not dependent on prostaglandins. These results also suggest that intrarenal kinins have a role in the control of renal blood flow.", 
    "96": "To assess the effect of MK-421 (enalapril) we treated six hospitalized hypertensive patients receiving constant sodium intake with incremental doses of this new angiotensin-converting enzyme blocking drug. After a few days of placebo treatment, MK-421 was given in single daily doses, starting with 1.25 mg and increasing until blood pressure was adequately controlled. On the lowest dose, converting enzyme activity was reduced by 50%, but angiotensin II and blood pressure did not change significantly. There were, however, significant increases in noradrenaline, renin, and aldosterone. With higher doses there was a more pronounced reduction in converting enzyme activity, while angiotensin II, aldosterone, and blood pressure all fell significantly. Renin levels rose, but noradrenaline and adrenaline were reduced. Orthostatic hypotension was not observed. With continued treatment, renal vasodilatation and enhanced natriuresis occurred together with a 1.2 kg decrement in body weight. Concurrently plasma volume rose, but renal blood flow remained unchanged. The data indicate that MK-421 effectively lowers blood pressure, and it does so by converting enzyme inhibition; sodium loss and a decrease in sympathetic activity are associated features. Since plasma volume increased despite enhanced natriuresis, the drug may act both at the arteriolar and at the venular level.", 
    "97": "The patient's age has great impact on the development of hypertension, its duration, and severity. In patients with essential hypertension, sympathetic cardiovascular control changes from an early phase with increased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, e.g., cardiac output and renin, into a later phase where these responses are blunted and alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction prevails, associated with higher intracellular free sodium and calcium concentration. This pathophysiological view of essential hypertension has its corollary in the pharmacotherapeutic approach. Younger patients, who often have high renin levels, respond better to monotherapy with a beta-blocker or with a converting-enzyme inhibitor. Older patients, who often have low renin levels, respond less well to beta-blockers but particularly well to calcium entry blockers as an alternative to diuretics. Therefore, beta-blockers and calcium entry blockers form new cornerstones for antihypertensive treatment and strategy, with the potential of cardioprotection.", 
    "98": "The converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) is known to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. In order to analyse the regulatory mechanisms involved in aldosterone secretion independent of renin-angiotensin system, one of the CEIs, SQ 14,225 was infused to the dogs in association with several pharmacological agents. To the mongrel dogs under pentobarbital anesthesia, SQ 14,225 was administered intravenously as a bolus injection (0.5 mg/kg), followed by two hour infusion (0.5 mg/kg/hr). The effects of several pharmacological agents on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PA) were examined in the condition in which endogenous angiotensin II production was blocked by CEI. PRA was increased significantly from the basal level (6.4 +/- 1.2; mean +/- SEM) to 14.1 +/- 2.6 ng/ml/hr 60 min after the administration of SQ 14,225. PA, on the other hand, was decreased from 12.2 +/- 3.6 to 7.6 +/- 2.2 ng/dl. The CEI-induced increase in PRA was completely blocked by infusion of angiotensin II (40 ng/kg/min), physiological saline (0.25 approximately 0.44 ml/kg/min), pretreatment of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or norepinephrine (200 ng/kg/min). Both pindolol and indomethacin had no significant effect on the CEI-induced increase in PRA. Increase in PRA was also observed by the infusion of furosemide, prostaglandin 1 or E1. PA was increased by KCl infusion (1.0 mEq/kg/hr), but was not affected significantly by the administration of furosemide, pindolol, prostaglandin A1 or E1, during the SQ 14,225 infusion. An elevation of PRA observed under the converting enzyme inhibition, was considered to be due to decreased feedback inhibition as a result of reduction of angiotensin II formation. It was suggested from the present results, that the CEI-induced increase in PRA might be mediated by beta-receptor and baroreceptor in addition to the direct negative feedback by angiotensin II. The present data also suggested that both furosemide and prostaglandins stimulated aldosterone secretion via the renin-angiotensin system, rather than by acting directly on the adrenal cortex.", 
    "99": "In the present study, pretreatment of rats with captopril significantly stimulated prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis by their isolated aorta. This effect was maximal at captopril doses of 1.0 mumol/kg body weight. When added directly into the incubation buffer, captopril at final concentrations of 50 and 500 nM also increased the synthesis of PGI2 by isolated rat aorta. Our results show that captopril stimulates PGI2 synthesis in vascular tissue and that this effect may be due at least in part to a direct action of this substance.", 
    "100": "Metal ion-chelating agents inhibited enkephalin degradation by a rat striatal membrane-associated endopeptidase termed 'enkephalinase'. The combination of a hydrophobic dipeptidyl moiety and a transition metal-chelating moiety in the same molecule resulted in very efficient and selective inhibitors of enkephalinase. The mercaptoacetyl dipeptides (2-mercaptoacetyl-Leu-Phe and 2-mercaptoacetyl-Phe-Leu) and the N-phosphorylated dipeptides (phosphoryl-Leu-Phe and phosphoramidon) inhibited enkephalinase with IC50 values of 15, 70, 0.3 and 1 nM respectively, but were much less potent against the aminopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, two other metalloenzymes implicated in the degradation of the enkephalins in brain. The inhibition of enkephalinase, using phosphoryl-Leu-Phe as a selective inhibitor, resulted in a 4 fold increase in the amount of enkephalin recovered following K+ depolarization of rat striatal slices.", 
    "101": "The present study was undertaken to quantify the circulating kinins in patients with various cardiovascular diseases using a newly developed radioimmunoassay technique and to evaluate this method in terms of its clinical application. For the determination of bradykinin (BK), this assay uses a rabbit anti-serum which has been injected with kallidin. This assay shows good specific activity, recovery and reproducibility. In order to avoid the formation of kinin as well as to block its inactivation, human blood samples were collected with a polypropylene syringe containing an inhibitor mixture (EDTA, trasylol, 1-10-phenanthroline, soybean trypsin inhibitor, polybrene). 1) The plasma BK concentration in normal human subjects, in patients with essential hypertension, effort angina and other cardiac diseases were 12.2, 9.2, 8.0 and 14.0 pg/ml, respectively. 2) Thirty min after captopril (12.5 mg, p.o.) administration, blood pressure and pulmonary wedge pressures decreased, and cardiac output increased accompanied with increases in plasma renin activity, plasma BK concentration and plasma norepinephrine concentration. 3) During the cold pressor test, both plasma BK concentration and blood pressure increased in the normal human subjects, whereas plasma BK levels decreased and blood pressure increased in the patients with hypertension. This radioimmunoassay for plasma BK determination makes it possible to measure plasma BK concentration in patients with various cardiac diseases.", 
    "102": "Papillary plasma flow (PPF) was measured by the albumin accumulation technique in Wistar rats. PPF was significantly lower in male (293 +/- 5 microliter X min-1 X g-1) than in female (499 +/- 17) rats. Castration in male rats increased PPF; testosterone administration in gonadectomized rats returned PPF to control. Acute indomethacin administration equalized PPF in both sexes to low values close to those found in normal males (320 +/- 5 in males, 326 +/- 17 in females). Conversely, captopril administration equalized PPF in both sexes by raising PPF in males (505 +/- 21) without significant change in females (526 +/- 88). Dehydration decreased PPF slightly in males (255 +/- 28) but more markedly in females (349 +/- 11). This decrease was prevented by captopril administration (520 +/- 34 and 609 +/- 61 in males and females, respectively). In captopril-treated male rats, angiotensin II (AII) was continuously infused by osmotic minipumps at a rate of 5 micrograms/h. This did not restore PPF (405 +/- 12) to basal values. In contrast, AII infusion together with indomethacin administration completely restored PPF (322 +/- 22) in captopril-treated rats whereas indomethacin alone did not normalize PPF (425 +/- 18). We suggest that male sex hormones and AII decrease PPF, and account for the low PPF measured in male rats. Vasodilator PGs are involved in the high PPF found in female rats. The vasodilator action of captopril on papillary circulation is explained by both decreased AII formation and increased PG synthesis.", 
    "103": "We investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system during furosemide (F) administration. The effects of adding captopril (C) (25 mg . 6 hr-1) to F (40 mg daily for 3 days) were studied in six normal subjects equilibrated to a daily sodium (Na) intake of 270 mmoles. Without C, F produced a marked natriuresis but Na+ excretion fell sharply between drug doses. This resulted in neutral Na balance (+22 +/- 58 mmoles . 3 days-1; mean +/- SE). Plasma angiotensin (AII) and aldosterone (Aldo) rose, but mean blood pressure (MBP) was unaltered. C abolished the F-induced increases in AII and Aldo but did not modify the pattern of Na+ excretion. Na+ balance remained neutral (+42 +/- 54 mmoles . 3 days-1). With C alone, Na+ balance was positive (+110 +/- 30 mmoles . 3 days-1; P less than 0.02). In protocols C alone and F + C, MBP fell by a comparable amount. F alone and F + C increased plasma norepinephrine and prostaglandin E2 metabolite; these did not change with C alone. In conclusion, activation of the RAA system by F is not essential for the compensatory increase in Na+ reabsorption that maintains Na+ balance after F.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "104": "The influence of CG 4203, a chemically and metabolically stable prostacyclin analogue, on plasma renin activity, arterial blood pressure, renal function and water intake was investigated in conscious rats. CG 4203 infused intravenously starting at 1 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 induced both a fall in blood pressure and an increase of plasma renin activity. The angiotensin II antagonist saralasine infused simultaneously intensified the hypotensive effect of CG 4203 (1.0 microgram X kg-1 X min-1). Within a similar dose range CG 4203 dose-dependently inhibited diuresis and saluresis and reduced the urinary sodium/potassium ratio. These effects were partially reversed by adrenalectomy and completely abolished by pretreatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Similarly, CG 4203 (0.21 - 4.64 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) dose-dependently caused increased water intake which was prevented by previous nephrectomy. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that CG 4203 like prostacyclin itself already at hypotensive threshold dosages stimulates a functionally relevant renin release. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system attenuates the intrinsic hypotensive effects of CG 4203. the antidiuretic and dipsogenic efficacy of CG 4203 can also be attributed to renin-dependent angiotensin II formation.", 
    "105": "In a patient with an uncomplicated pheochromocytoma, we observed high basal value of plasma renin activity (PRA), 16.2 ng/ml/h, and a remarkable elevation in PRA from 18.2 to 90.4 ng/ml/h and concomitant blood pressure reduction following a single oral administration of 25 mg of captopril. The response was same as that observed in renovascular hypertensives, and disappeared during the period of alpha-, beta-blocker administration or after the surgery. Basal PRA also returned to low normal level. The renin-angiotensin (R-A) system probably had a role in the maintenance of high blood pressure. The mechanism of the activation of the R-A system was thought to be renal vasoconstriction due to excessive circulating catecholamines.", 
    "106": "Vasodilator agents are relatively new additions to the armamentarium for the management of patients with congestive heart failure. Myocardial failure, irrespective of the aetiology, tends to create a vicious cycle characterised by reduced cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance, which further decrease cardiac output by increasing left ventricular ejection impedance. The rationale for the use of vasodilators is to interrupt the vicious cycle by decreasing the left ventricular ejection impedance by peripheral vasodilatation. Although most vasodilator agents produce qualitatively similar haemodynamic responses, quantitatively their haemodynamic effects differ considerably. Knowledge of the haemodynamic effects of the various vasodilators helps in the selection of a particular drug for the management of such patients. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, haemodynamic effects, pharmacokinetics, clinical usage and adverse effects of non-parenteral vasodilator agents currently available for the management of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "107": "The effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on the decreased renal excretion of sodium and water resulting from behavioral stress (shock avoidance) were examined in conscious saline-infused (4-5 ml/min) dogs. During saline infusion alone in six dogs, avoidance decreased sodium excretion (64% from 329 mueq/min) and urine flow (63% from 1.9 ml/min). During converting enzyme inhibition with captopril in the same dogs, the decreases in sodium excretion (35% from 464 mueq/min) and urine flow (35% from 2.6 ml/min) during avoidance were attenuated. Similarly, in six other dogs, avoidance decreased sodium excretion (41% from 361 mueq/min) and urine flow (43% from 2.1 ml/min) with saline infusion alone. During angiotension II (ANG II) receptor antagonism with saralasin, decreases in sodium excretion (29% from 417 mueq/min) and urine flow (27% from 2.2 ml/min) were attenuated. These mean changes in excretion during inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system were significantly (P less than 0.05) less than during saline alone. Whereas decreases in fractional sodium and water excretion were attenuated by renin-angiotensin inhibition, decreases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal blood flow and increases in mean arterial pressure were not affected. These results indicate that ANG II contributes to the renal excretory response to avoidance.", 
    "108": "An angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) was given by gastric lavage at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight per day to Long-Evans rats for a 13-day period during which they received a sodium-deficient diet. This regime was preceded by a 3-day period during which measurements were made on the animals on a sodium-replete dietary intake. Control sodium-deprived rats showed increased plasma renin activities, increased peripheral aldosterone concentrations and reduced urinary sodium excretion; they maintained positive sodium balance and the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex hypertrophied. Captopril-treated sodium-deprived rats failed to reduce urinary sodium excretion sufficiently and entered a period of marked and sustained negative sodium balance. Peripheral aldosterone concentrations after 12 days of sodium deprivation in the presence of captopril treatment were similar to those of sodium-replete rats. The adrenocortical zona glomerulosa of the captopril-treated rats did not increase in size and regressive changes were noted.", 
    "109": "In a double-blind crossover trial, 15 captopril (daily dose 600 mg) treated patients received in addition to the converting enzyme inhibitor, placebo, propranolol (240 mg), or bendroflumethiazide (7.5 mg). Propranolol produced an additional hypotensive effect, while pulse rate slowed, indicating effective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Plasma renin activity decreased, but the hypotensive effect of propranolol was not accompanied by changes in the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone levels or in the urinary aldosterone excretion. Also bendroflumethiazide lowered blood pressure, while body weight decreased slightly. During captopril-bendroflumethiazide treatment, serum sodium and potassium decreased while the plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated. In these captopril-treated patients, the hypotensive response to bendroflumethiazide tended to be somewhat larger than the response to propranolol, but the difference was small and statistically not significant.", 
    "110": "The hemodynamic benefits and safety of combined therapy with captopril and hydralazine were studied during invasive hemodynamic monitoring in 14 patients with severe heart failure. In eight patients, the individual effects of both drugs were evaluated before the administration of combined therapy, whereas hydralazine was added to maintenance captopril therapy in the other six patients. In the first group, captopril alone produced a marked decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (28 +/- 4 to 18 +/- 5 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (85 +/- 20 to 69 +/- 13 mm Hg) (both p less than 0.001) without a significant increase in cardiac index. Hydralazine alone produced a marked increase in cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.4 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 liters/min per m2) (p less than 0.001), but with a minimal decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (28 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 4 mm Hg) (p less than 0.05) and without a significant change in mean arterial pressure. The combination of captopril and hydralazine produced an increase in cardiac index similar to that of hydralazine alone and decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure and mean arterial pressure similar to those with captopril alone. Most important, when hydralazine was added to captopril in the entire group of 14 patients, cardiac index increased markedly with little additional decrease in mean arterial pressure and no significant increase in heart rate. The one patient who experienced symptomatic hypotension with combination therapy also had dizziness with captopril alone. Seven of the nine patients maintained on long-term treatment experienced symptomatic improvement. Thus, in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the combined use of captopril and hydralazine is feasible and produces acute hemodynamic improvement superior to that from either drug alone.", 
    "111": "Enalapril, the new converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to eight patients with heart failure (NYHA Functional Class II to IV) during standardised and intensive haemodynamic, hormone, and electrolyte monitoring. The first dose (5 mg) of enalapril induced a fall in plasma angiotensin II and noradrenaline levels, and prolonged decrements in systemic vascular resistance, arterial pressure, heart rate, and right heart pressures. Maximum haemodynamic effects were evident four to eight hours after the first dose, with return to baseline by 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin II levels, however, were still suppressed at 24 hours. The magnitude of haemodynamic response was related closely to baseline (pre-enalapril) activity of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system. Enalapril treatment over three days induced a positive cumulative balance of sodium and potassium, and a small increase in plasma potassium. Urine aldosterone excretion decreased in a stepwise fashion. Continued enalapril administration for four to eight weeks resulted in improved clinical status (NYHA Functional Class) and exercise tolerance in patients who initially were most severely incapacitated, but little change was observed in healthier subjects. We conclude that in heart failure, enalapril is a long acting converting enzyme inhibitor with clear cut beneficial haemodynamic effects in the short term. Long term controlled studies of enalapril in heart failure are warranted.", 
    "112": "The role of vasopressin, the renin system, and sympathetic activity in sustaining blood pressure in the dehydrated state was investigated in normotensive nonanesthetized male Wistar rats. After 48-h dehydration, plasma arginine vasopressin was 14.0 +/- 1.7 pg/ml and plasma norepinephrine 0.46 +/- 0.05 ng/ml. In another group of rats in which the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (MK 421, 5 mg po twice daily) was administered throughout the dehydration period, blood pressure was reduced by more than 20% (P less than 0.001), and both plasma arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine were higher at 23.4 +/- 3.9 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) and 0.83 +/- 0.07 ng/ml (P less than 0.01), respectively. Taken together, in rats with or without converting enzyme blockade, there was an inverse correlation between mean blood pressure and plasma arginine vasopressin (r = 0.67, P less than 0.01) as well as plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.82, P less than 0.01) levels. The acute administration of a specific vasopressin pressor inhibitor (dPVDAVP) reduced mean blood pressure in the rats with a blocked renin system by 16.9 mmHg (P less than 0.001). In rats without converting enzyme inhibition, the induced fall was only 6.4 mmHg. These results indicate that following 48-h dehydration the renin angiotensin system interacts with the vasopressin secretory mechanism to sustain blood pressure, with renin playing a predominant role. They further suggest that, following blockade of the renin system, activation of the sympathetic nervous system probably also contributes to blood pressure maintenance.", 
    "113": "Neurotensin was inactivated by membrane-bound and soluble degrading activities present in purified preparations of rat brain synaptic membranes. Degradation products were identified by HPLC and amino acid analysis. The major points of cleavage of neurotensin were the Arg8-Arg9, Pro10-Tyr11, and Tyr11-Ile12 peptide bonds with the membrane-bound activity and the Arg8-Arg9 and Pro10-Tyr11 bonds with the soluble activity. Several lines of evidence indicated that the cleavage of the Arg8-Arg9 bond by the membrane-bound activity resulted mainly from the conversion of neurotensin1-10 to neurotensin1-8 by a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. In particular, captopril inhibited this cleavage with an IC50 (5.7 nM) close to its K1 (7 nM) for angiotensin-converting enzyme. Thiorphan inhibited the cleavage at the Tyr11-Ile12 bond by the membrane-bound activity with an IC50 (17 nM) similar to its K1 (4.7 nM) for enkephalinase. Both cleavages were inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline. These and other data suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme and a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase (enkephalinase) were the membrane-bound peptidases responsible for cleavages at the Arg8-Arg9 and Tyr11-Ile12 bonds, respectively. In contrast, captopril had no effect on the cleavage at the Arg8-Arg9 bond by the soluble activity, indicating that the enzyme responsible for this cleavage was different from angiotensin-converting enzyme. The cleavage at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond by both the membrane-bound and the soluble activities appeared to be catalyzed by an endopeptidase different from known brain proline endopeptidases. The possibility is discussed that the enzymes described here participate in physiological mechanisms of neurotensin inactivation at the synaptic level.", 
    "114": "The binding properties of N6-cyclohexyl [3H]adenosine ( [3H]CHA) and 1,3-diethyl-8-[3H]phenylxanthine ( [3H]DPX) in rat forebrain membrane are compared. The kinetic parameters of binding for each ligand are quite distinct, with [3H]CHA displaying two populations of binding sites (KD = 0.4 +/- 0.05 nM and 4.2 +/- 0.3 nM; Bmax = 159 +/- 17 and 326 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein), whereas [3H]DPX yielded monophasic Scatchard plots (KD = 13.9 +/- 1.1 nM; Bmax = 634 +/- 27 fmol/mg protein). The metals copper, zinc, and cadmium are potent inhibitors of [3H]CHA binding, with respective IC50 concentrations of 36 microM, 250 microM, and 70 microM. Copper is a much less potent inhibitor of [3H]DPX binding (IC50 = 350 microM). The inhibitory effect of copper on both [3H]CHA and [3H]DPX binding is apparently irreversible, as membranes pretreated with copper cannot be washed free of its inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of both copper and zinc on [3H]CHA binding was reversed by the guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p. [3H]DPX binding is only partially inhibited by zinc and cadmium (60% of specific binding remains unaffected), suggesting that this adenosine receptor ligand binds to two separate sites. Guanine nucleotides had no effect on the inhibition of [3H]DPX binding by either copper or zinc. Differential thermal and proteolytic denaturation profiles are also observed for [3H]CHA and [3H]DPX binding, with the former ligand binding site being more labile in both cases. Stereospecificity is observed in the inhibition of both [3H]CHA and [3H]DPX binding, with L-N-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) being 50-fold more potent than D-PIA in both cases. Evidence is therefore provided that adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists have markedly different binding properties to brain adenosine receptors.", 
    "115": "There have been considerable advances in understanding the metabolic role of the endothelial lining cells of the blood vessels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is concentrated in these cells, especially those lining the pulmonary circulation. The enzyme exerts control over systemic vascular tone indirectly through the powerful pressor effect of angiotensin II. A number of therapeutic agents are now available which directly inhibit converting enzyme activity and thereby effect a reduction in blood pressure. Macrophages are the source of increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity commonly found in association with active sarcoidosis. A better understanding of this phenomenon may give fresh insight into this puzzling condition. Pulmonary endothelial metabolism is affected by lung injury and it is likely that in this situation changing activities of serum angiotensin converting enzyme may indicate the extent of damage and the response to therapy. The full clinical significance of serum ACE measurements has yet to be established. However, raised activities have been reported in a number of other conditions and diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism are of particular current interest. The numerous methods and reference ranges described in the literature for the measurement of serum ACE activity require further assessment, and there is a clear need for an accepted reference method.", 
    "116": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme was solubilized with papain from a particulate fraction of rat brain and purified to apparent homogeneity by a procedure including DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Sephadex G-200, Cys(Bzl)-Pro-Sepharose, and ricin-Sepharose chromatography. Bradykinin potentiators, SQ 14,225, and Arg-Pro-Pro strongly inhibited the activity of the purified enzyme, whereas Phe-Ala, phosphoramidon, and pentobarbital exerted little inhibitory effect on the activity. Among neuropeptides investigated, substance P, bradykinin, and Leu-enkephalin (Arg6) exerted strong inhibitory actions on the enzyme. Furthermore, the latter two peptides were shown to be good substrates for the enzyme. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme of rat brain is distinct from endogenous enkephalinase and may interact with various neuropeptides located in the brain.", 
    "117": "The responses to 48 h of renal artery stenosis were compared in uninephrectomized, chronically-instrumented dogs with or without inhibition of angiotensin II (AII) formation by enalapril. Mean arterial pressure rose by an average of 29.9 mmHg (s.e.m. 3.5) in untreated dogs and by 14.5 mmHg (s.e.m. 2.8) in enalapril-treated dogs over the two days of stenosis. Renal artery stenosis reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 49% (s.e.m. 9) in untreated dogs and by 86% (s.e.m. 8) in enalapril-treated dogs. Compared to untreated dogs, enalapril-treated dogs also had lower renal artery pressure distal to the stenosis, drank less water and had larger rises in plasma K+ following renal artery stenosis. There were no differences in renal blood flow or urinary Na+ excretion in the two groups of dogs. Thus blockade of AII production did not prevent hypertension occurring in response to renal artery stenosis, but the rise in blood pressure was only about half that which occurred in normal dogs and GFR was much more severely reduced.", 
    "118": "Vascular noradrenergic transmission and the effect of captopril on this transmission were examined in the blood perfused rat mesenteric vasculature in situ during the development of two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension. Three groups of rats including sham operated, 6-8 day hypertensive and 4-6 week hypertensive were studied. Mean blood pressures during anaesthesia were 90.0 +/- 2.0, 119.7 +/- 4.7 and 131.8 +/- 6.8 mmHg in the three groups, respectively. Mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine were significantly potentiated in both of the hypertensive groups relative to the sham group. Mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation were similar in the sham and 6-8 day hypertensive groups. However, responses to nerve stimulation were significantly potentiated in the 4-6 week hypertensive group relative to the sham group. Captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) lowered mean blood pressure in all groups, equalizing blood pressure in the 6-8 day hypertensive and sham groups. However, the blood pressure in the 4-6 week hypertensive rats remained significantly elevated after 1 mg/kg captopril. An additional dose of captopril did not lower blood pressure further in this group. Mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the three groups were minimally affected by captopril, with significant differences between control and captopril-treated responses occurring randomly at a point or two in a dose-response or frequency-response curve for a given group. The differences in vascular responsiveness to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine between the hypertensive and sham groups continued to be evident after captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "119": "In order to determine if long-term treatment with captopril affects vascular collagen biosynthesis we administered the agent at a dose of 30 or 100 mg/kg/day p.o. for 6 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats. At the 6th week of captopril treatment the aorta was excised and the activity of prolyl hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of collagen biosynthesis, was measured. Vascular enzyme activity was decreased by 7.0% and 34.6% in the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. A single oral administration of captopril, on the other hand, did not decrease the enzyme activity in the aorta. Furthermore, captopril had no direct inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity in vitro. These findings suggest that the decrease in vascular prolyl hydroxylase activity resulted from a sustained decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "120": "A specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed to monitor plasma levels of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Because of the reactive nature of the captopril thiol group, captopril was measured as the captopril-N-ethylmaleimide complex (captopril-NEM). Accuracy studies, using samples with known added concentrations of captopril, were satisfactory (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001, y = 0.97x - 2.02), and the radioimmunoassay results compared well with those determined by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometric method (r = 0.98, p less than 0.0005, y = 1.2x - 19). The minimum detection limit of the assay was 2 micrograms captopril/litre plasma.", 
    "121": "Captopril, an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was administered for 12 months to 20 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension who initially responded favourably to this pharmacological treatment. Captopril induced a significant reduction in blood pressure which remained unmodified throughout the study. This fall in blood pressure was mainly due to a significant decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance, since no change in cardiac output was observed. Simultaneously, there was no significant change in left ventricular anatomy and performance evaluated by echocardiographic technique.", 
    "122": "Plasma renin activity was measured in samples collected in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The samples were incubated under two widely used sets of conditions to generate angiotensin I, and the results were compared. Under certain incubation conditions, the absence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate from the sample tube produced low plasma renin activity values. This was obviated by using an alternative incubation medium and was not, therefore, due to direct inhibition of renin by heparin. These lower values were not seen in samples from patients receiving captopril. This suggests that the discrepant values were due to some angiotensin I conversion to angiotensin II and lower homologues in the incubates. Sodium heparin samples compared closely with lithium heparin samples, indicating that the presence of lithium is not significant. These results show that, provided the incubation conditions are suitably modified, samples collected into lithium or sodium heparin can be used for measurement of plasma renin activity.", 
    "123": "The inhibition of renin release by angiotensin II (AII) is well documented. However, the interaction of this short loop feedback mechanism of AII with the sympathetic nervous system is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the possible functional relationship between AII and the beta-adrenergic receptors with respect to renin release in vivo. First, the effect of propranolol on captopril-induced renin release was examined in conscious rats. Secondly, the effect of AII on isoproterenol-induced renin release was determined. Captopril (1 mg/Kg) increased plasma renin activity (PRA) from 1.6 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr to 4.5 +/- 0.6 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant change in PRA in rats which received both captopril and propranolol (before 0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr, after 1.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr). Thus, propranolol attenuated the increase in PRA caused by captopril. Isoproterenol infusion (0.1 micrograms/Kg/min) provoked a significant increase in PRA (before 1.3 +/- 0.4 ng/ml/hr, after 6.6 +/- 1.7 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.01). AII infusion in combination with isoproterenol also increased PRA from 1.6 +/- 0.4 ng/ml/hr to 5.2 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.01). AII in this dose did not suppress isoproterenol-induced renin release. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor mediating renin release is functionally located distal to the AII receptor in the short loop mechanism controlling renin release.", 
    "124": "The chronic effects of oral administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 63-80 mg/Kg/day) on blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were-studied in normotensive male Wistar rats. Blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma renin substrate concentration (PRS), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and renal renin content (RRC) were measured after 2, 9, 19, 29 and 58 days of captopril administration. BP was determined in awake rats and blood samples were obtained by decapitation. In addition, BP responses to bolus injections of angiotensin I (AI, 80 ng/Kg), angiotensin II (AII, 80 ng/Kg) and bradykinin (BK, 10 micrograms/Kg) were examined in conscious rats which had received captopril for 20 days. The BP of the rats which had been given captopril for 9 days or longer was significantly lower than that of the control rats. PRA and PRC were markedly increased, and both PRS and PAC were decreased in the captopril-treated rats. RRC, which was reduced after 2 days of captopril administration, was substantially increased thereafter. Although the pressor responses to AII were similar in the captopril treated and the control rats, the responses to AI were reduced to 50% of those to AII in the former. The depressor responses to BK in the captopril-treated rats were 2.3 times as large as those in the control rats. Our results show that long-term use of captopril lowers BP in normotensive rats on a normal sodium intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "125": "The roles of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and aldosterone in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome were investigated with rats following subcutaneous injections of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) for 7 d. Prominent reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) was observed at day-15 after the initial treatment with PAN preceded by the onset of the nephrosis and there was no significant difference in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) between the nephrosis and normal control groups despite the higher levels obtained in the nephrosis animals. Although we could not elucidate the precise mechanism of reduction in PRA, it was suggested that neither the RAS nor aldosterone secretion played a primary role in the pathogenesis of the nephrosis. PAN-induced nephrosis is interesting in studying the pathophysiological mechanism of the lowered activity of plasma renin in some patients with nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "126": "Microsphere techniques were employed to investigate the role of intrarenal angiotensin generation in producing the arteriolar constriction associated with 24-h tubular obstruction in rats. In each animal, glomerular blood flow (GBF) and nephron vascular resistance were determined for normal and oil-blocked superficial cortical nephrons. In 17 control rats, GBF of normal and blocked nephrons averaged 226 +/- 12 and 130 +/- 9 nl/min, respectively (P less than 0.001). Captopril treatment in five rats (10 mg/kg orally) improved GBF to blocked nephrons to 252 +/- 31 nl/min. Saralasin treatment in six rats (10 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 i.v.) lessened the difference between GBF of normal and obstructed nephrons. In six rats subjected to a high salt intake and deoxycorticosterone injections, GBF to obstructed nephrons was improved to 181 +/- 21 nl/min. Since both pharmacologic interruption of angiotensin activity and renin suppression were associated with improved GBF of blocked nephrons, these observations support a role for angiotensin as a local factor controlling glomerular hemodynamics of chronically obstructed nephrons.", 
    "127": "A patient who was subsequently shown to have stenosis of the artery to a transplanted kidney sustained three episodes of impaired renal function during treatment with low doses of captopril. On each occasion this was reversed by withdrawal of therapy. The effect was not related to reduction of blood pressure since lower pressures were recorded during treatment with minoxidil, without deterioration of renal function. A possible mechanism involving blockade of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is discussed.", 
    "128": "Twenty-six patients being evaluated for renovascular hypertension were studied to assess the diagnostic value of enhancing the differential between renal venous renins (PRA) by a single 25 mg oral dose of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI, captopril). Antihypertensive medications were not discontinued prior to the study, and renal venous effluent was sampled before and 30 minutes after CEI. Eight patients without stenosis who did not have surgery had post-CEI ratios of less than 3.0. The other 18 patients had operative intervention, with 14 subsequently having improved blood pressure control. Of these 14, seven patients with unilateral stenosis, four patients with bilateral stenosis, and one patient without overt stenosis but with other evidence of reduced renal blood flow had 30-minute PRA ratios of 3.0 or greater. Five of these 14 patients had prestimulation ratios of less than 1.5 and might not be considered operative candidates by conventional criteria. Four other patients unimproved by surgery had post-CEI ratios of less than 3.0 despite a baseline ratio of greater than 1.5 in two of four. Only two patients with post-CEI ratios of less than 3.0 were improved with surgery. We conclude that a 30-minute post-CEI renal venous ratio of 3.0 or greater enhances the probability that patients with renovascular disease, and hypertension will respond to surgical intervention with improved blood pressure control.", 
    "129": "Conscious pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits were used to further evaluate the role of prostaglandin (PG) and plasma renin activity (PRA) in the systemic hemodynamics of pregnancy. Pregnant rabbits had high peripheral blood levels of both PGE2 and PRA. Systemic blood pressure was not affected in either pregnant or nonpregnant by the administration of an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Pregnant rabbits, however, had a much larger decrease in blood pressure than nonpregnant animals when given the angiotensin I (AI)-converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Pregnant rabbits were more resistant to the pressor effect of exogenous AII than nonpregnant animals. The pressor effect of AII increased in pregnant rabbits after the administration of meclofenamate and parturition but was not changed by volume expansion. In contrast, the sensitivity of nonpregnant rabbits to AII increased after volume expansion, but not after treatment with inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. These studies demonstrate that a remarkable similarity exists between pregnant rabbits and pregnant women in the pressor response to AII. This study is the first to correlate the vasopressor response to AII with PRA and the level of a circulating vasopressor prostaglandin in pregnant animals. The results strongly suggest that this model will be fruitful in further attempts to define the factors controlling systemic hemodynamics during pregnancy.", 
    "130": "1. Oral administration of dexamethasone (about 2.5 X 10(-7) mol/day) caused hypertension in rats. The blood pressure rose from 108 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) to 156 +/- 17 mmHg on the seventh day. The urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium were increased. The plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were unchanged. However, the urinary excretions of prostaglandin E2 (UPGE2V) and kallikrein (Ukall.V) were markedly decreased throughout the experiment. 2. With concurrent administration of captopril, the elevation of blood pressure was partially prevented. In this group of rats, the plasma renin activity was elevated and the reductions in UPGE2V and Ukall.V were partially prevented. 3. Based on these results, it is suggested that suppression of the kallikrein-kinin and prostaglandin systems, in addition to involvement of the renin-angiotensin system, is one of the factors contributing to the hypertensive action of dexamethasone.",

Angiotensin I and II (AI, AII) produced concentration-related contraction on both arteries, AII being approximately 10 times more potent than AI. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, SQ, 14225, BPP5a and BPP9a had no effect on the concentration effect curves to BK, AII or 5-HT but responses to AI were inhibited. These results suggest that angiotensin-converting-enzyme is present in both preparations and is important for the conversion of AI to AII but apparently not for the degradation of BK.", 
    "132": "Serum ACE activity increased as expected about three-fold following six weeks of captopril (30 mg/kg/day) treatment in Wistar rats (n = 9). The effect on serum and lung ACE activity and concentration, respectively, was studied after captopril discontinuation. Serum ACE activity was measured at start and 3, 6, and 12 days after captopril withdrawal. The approximal half-life of serum ACE activity was 72 hours as judged from the decrease rate after stimulated ACE biosynthesis induced by captopril. No differences in lung plasma membranes and lung homogenate ACE concentrations between treated and untreated rats were observed 12 days after discontinuation of captopril treatment. Serum ACE activity remained unchanged in the control rats (n = 9). We conclude that induction of ACE biosynthesis in the rat is reversible after withdrawal of captopril.", 
    "133": "The study reported here prospectively evaluated the prevention of diuretic-induced secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia by a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (MK 421). Eighteen normal subjects were randomized into three groups: (1) a HCTZ group (hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50 mg/day); (2) a MK-421 group (MK-421 10 mg/day); and (3) a HCTZ + MK-421 group [HCTZ 50 mg/day plus MK-421 10 mg/day]. Following a five-day control and a 28-day treatment period, the HCTZ group demonstrated an attenuated but persistent secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia, the MK-421 group manifested a gradual decline in aldosterone secretion, and the HCTZ + MK-421 group had a delayed but effective correction of secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia at 28 days but not before. In conclusion, MK-421 reversed diuretic-induced secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia after 28 days of hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Therefore, converting enzyme inhibitors, such as enalapril, provide useful adjunctive therapy in diuretic-treated patients, but potassium supplementation may be required before the start of four weeks of combined therapy.", 
    "134": "Immunization of dog and rat high pure rabbit pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme elicited, in some individuals, antibodies that inhibited their own converting enzyme. Active immunization with an immunologically related enzyme is thus a plausible approach for developing biologically based inhibitors of enzymes that are either in or accessible to the circulation. Rabbit testicular peptidyldipeptide hydrolase was purified to homogeneity and found to be a considerably smaller (Mr approximately 100,000) glycoprotein than pulmonary converting enzyme (Mr approximately 140,000). The two enzymes differed at their amino- and carboxy-termini. However, they exhibited identical catalytic properties, and antibodies prepared against either inhibited both similarly. In competition radioimmunoassays, antibodies against the pulmonary enzyme preferred it to the testicular species, whereas those against the latter did not distinguish between the two molecules. The testicular isozyme thus resembles an internal part of the pulmonary polypeptide, which includes its active site. In a reticulocyte lysate, mRNA from the lungs of immature and mature rabbits comparably primed the synthesis of a polypeptide (Mr approximately 129,000) that reacted with anticonverting enzyme antibodies. In contrast, an immunoreactive species was programed only by mRNA from the testis of mature animals, and this protein was much smaller (Mr approximately 85,000). Maturation dependence and a shorter polypeptide chain, the regulatory and structural properties that distinguish the testicular isozyme, are thus each pretranslationally determined.", 
    "135": "Twenty years ago it was demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) acts on the brain, which results in an elevation of blood pressure. Ten years later, reninlike activity was discovered in the brain of the rat and dog, which gave rise to the concept of an endogenous brain renin-angiotensin system. In the periphery, the kidney, liver, and lungs work in unison to produce Ang II. Evidence for brain renin, substrate, converting enzyme, and angiotensins is reviewed. New data indicate that the enzyme system for the synthesis of Ang II within the brain may in fact be contained in the cell. All the components for a renin-angiotensin system have now been found in neuroblastoma/glioma cell lines and Ang II is present in primary cell culture of rat brain neurons. The significance of angiotensin in the brain for hypertension is that it may be a stimulus for vasopressin release and sympathetic activation, which can maintain high blood pressure. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, there is evidence of increased brain angiotensin. Also, experiments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors show that blockade of brain angiotensin production leads to a long-lasting lowering of blood pressure. The activity of the inhibitors in part appears to be directly on the brain.", 
    "136": "A case of acute renal failure associated with captopril administration is reported. A woman, age 57, with a two-year history of hypertension presented with a generalized maculopapular rash preceded by pruritus after three weeks of captopril therapy. Her serum creatinine level on admission was 11.0 mg/dl. Renal biopsy was compatible with acute tubular necrosis without evidence of interstitial nephritis. A skin biopsy did not show any evidence of vasculitis. Captopril was discontinued, and her renal failure reversed over the course of nine days. A year later, the patient has good blood pressure control with stable renal function. Captopril has been associated with renal failure in patients with preexisting renovascular hypertension, and with acute interstitial nephritis in one case. The presentation of this case was similar to the latter case, but the renal biopsy did not show any evidence of acute interstitial nephritis.", 
    "137": "[1-deaminopenicillamine, 4-valine, 8-D-arginine]Vasopressin (DPVDAVP), a specific antagonist of the pressor activity of vasopressin, and teprotide, a converting enzyme inhibitor, were infused intravenously in conscious, fasted (24-30 h) but not water-deprived cats which had been implanted previously with flow probes on their superior mesenteric arteries and with arterial and venous cannulae. Infusion of DPVDAVP (20 micrograms/min) alone or teprotide (1 mg over 5 min) alone caused only small and statistically nonsignificant changes in mesenteric conductance and arterial pressure. However, infusion of DPVDAVP during the plateau phase of the response to teprotide or, conversely, administration of teprotide during the plateau phase of the response to DPVDAVP caused large increases in mesenteric conductance and small but significant decreases in arterial pressure. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that vasopressin and angiotensin are redundant overlapping mechanisms that play a significant role in the control of the mesenteric resistance vessels of the conscious fasted cat; when one system is inhibited, the other compensates to maintain resistance.", 
    "138": "The antihypertensive, hemodynamic, and autonomic actions of SCH 31846, a new, potent and long-acting non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were evaluated in several experimental preparations. Oral administration of 0.3-3 mg/kg caused dose-related decreases in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Pretreatment with a diuretic augmented the maximum hypotensive response attainable. Single doses (3 mg/kg) of SCH 31846 reduced pressure for over 24 h. Five-day treatment lowered pressure progressively. Single oral doses of 3.2 and 10 mg/kg reduced blood pressure of conscious normotensive dogs. Diuretic pretreatment also enhanced the response. The antihypertensive action of SCH 31846 in SHRs was eliminated by nephrectomy, but not attenuated by indomethacin, indicating its dependency on renal renin but not on prostaglandin synthesis. Other studies using SHRs pointed to an absence of a central effect. SCH 31846 (1 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and peripheral resistance of anesthetized dogs but did not alter cardiac output. Autonomic interactions were examined in normal and diuretic-pretreated SHRs and anesthetized dogs. SCH 31846 affected the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation and cardiovascular reflexes only minimally. It is concluded that SCH 31846 is a potent and long-lasting antihypertensive agent, the action of which is mediated, in all probability, by ACE inhibition.", 
    "139": "SCH 31846, 1-(N-[1(S)-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanyl)-cis, syn-octahydro-(H-indole-2-S)-carboxylic acid; CI-907; PD 109, 763-2, is a new non-sulfhydryl-containing, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The present investigation describes its ACE inhibitory properties and compares them to those of MK 421. The diacid of SCH 31846 inhibited rabbit pulmonary ACE with an IC50 of 2.2 nM (MK 421 diacid 2.5 nM). The drug behaved as a competitive and specific inhibitor in vitro. SCH 31846 and its diacid effectively inhibited pressor actions of intravenous injection of angiotensin I (AI) in anesthetized rats. ID50 values were 27 and 11 micrograms/kg for SCH 31846 and SCH 31846 diacid, respectively (MK 421 and MK 421 diacid 57 and 15 micrograms/kg, respectively). Oral administration of SCH 31846 (0.03-1 mg/kg) inhibited pressor actions of AI in conscious rats with a duration of over 16 h at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. SCH 31846 was 2.2 times as potent as MK 421 in this regard. The diacid of SCH 31846 was considerably less potent than the ester, implying poor oral absorption of the former. Effective ACE inhibition, as judged by attenuation of pressor actions of AI, was noted in dogs after both intravenous and oral administrations of SCH 31846. Onset of action was more rapid than that of MK 421. Intravenous administration of SCH 31846 inhibited the renal vascular actions of intrarenal injection of AI, indicating effective blockade of the renal enzyme. Intracerebroventricular administration of SCH 31846 diacid blocked pressor responses to intracerebroventricular AI, whereas oral administration of SCH 31846 (10 mg/kg) did not, implying that SCH 31846 inhibits brain ACE but does not gain access to the cerebral enzyme when administered orally. These data indicate that SCH 31846 is a potent and specific non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor. As such, it should be useful in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "140": "We studied blood pressure, arterial diameter, and blood flow of the brachial artery in patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after administration of the vasodilating drugs nitroglycerin, captopril, dihydralazine, diltiazem, and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). The diameter and the blood flow of the brachial artery were measured with a pulsed Doppler device which allowed the angle between the ultrasound beam and the vessel axis to be determined with a precision better than 2%. Nitroglycerin and captopril decreased blood pressure slightly but increased arterial diameter markedly. Dihydralazine, diltiazem, and ISDN decreased blood pressure similarly and significantly and also reduced forearm vascular resistance. Dihydralazine reduced arterial diameter (p less than 0.001), but did not change brachial blood flow. Diltiazem and ISDN increased the arterial diameter markedly (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively), but only the former increased brachial blood flow. We conclude that antihypertensive drugs that dilate small arteries can either reduce (dihydralazine) or increase (nitroglycerin, captopril, diltiazem, ISDN) the caliber of large peripheral arteries and thus have different effects on peripheral blood flow.", 
    "141": "The new converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 13945 was evaluated in 14 male volunteers. The study consisted of two parts. First, the capacity of a single oral dose (10, 20, 50, 100, 250, or 500 mg) to inhibit the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested, with blood pressure and heart rate monitored continuously through an intra-arterial catheter. The 250-mg and particularly the 500-mg dose markedly reduced the pressor response to angiotensin I within 1/2 h and for a period exceeding 4 h. There was a close correlation between the pressor response to angiotensin I and plasma converting enzyme activity. In a second part, plasma renin and converting enzyme activity, angiotensin I and II, and plasma aldosterone were measured serially before and up to 48 h after oral administration of either 250 or 500 mg of CGS 13945 to six volunteers each. As expected, plasma renin activity and angiotensin I levels rose, while plasma converting enzyme activity and angiotensin II and aldosterone levels fell within 1/2 h. Twenty-four hours following administration of 500 mg CGS 13945, plasma converting enzyme had not quite returned to base line. No side effects were observed. CGS 13945 seems less potent than previously studied converting enzyme inhibitors, but equally effective and relatively long acting.", 
    "142": "The role of renal nerves in influencing the control of arterial pressure was studied in Wistar rats with aortic depressor nerve (ADN) transection. Renal denervation prevented or reversed the normal increase in arterial pressure seen after ADN transection. This effect was not due to an effect on the renin-angiotensin system, as the elevated arterial pressure after ADN section in rats with renal nerves intact was shown to be due to increased alpha-adrenergic activity. Food and water intake and urine output decreased significantly in both renal-denervated and sham-denervated rats after ADN section, suggesting that a pressure diuresis mechanism was not responsible for preventing the rise in pressure in renal-denervated rats. In another study, the concentration of norepinephrine in skeletal muscle and hypothalamus at 0 and 8 hours after inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with alpha-methyltyrosine was used as an index of norepinephrine turnover. Norepinephrine turnover in skeletal muscle was increased significantly over control values by ADN transection in sham renal-denervated rats, but was not significantly different from controls in renal-denervated rats with ADN section. In the hypothalamus, there was a significant difference between the turnover of norepinephrine in the two groups of ADN-sectioned rats. The results taken together suggest that renal denervation prevents the arterial pressure response to ADN transection by altering the central mechanisms governing sympathetic outflow. It is suggested that this effect may be due to elimination of information carried by afferent renal fibers.", 
    "143": "Circulating prorenin is an enzymatically inactive form of renin, also present in kidney, which can be activated in vitro. Its biochemical properties and physiological behavior suggest that it may be a biosynthetic precursor of active renin. However, in contrast to typical prohormones, the normal plasma concentrations of prorenin are much higher than the active hormone. The purposes and functions of prorenin are unclear. It may have no further role after its secretion into the circulation. On the other hand, it may be a transport form of renin that can enter or exit cells more easily than the active form. It is also possible that the activity of the renin-angiotensin system may be regulated by the conversion of prorenin to renin in the kidney (which may be under beta-adrenergic control) or at other possible sites. Irreversible activation of prorenin appears to be a proteolytic process. In addition, acidification causes reversible activation, perhaps through a change in molecular conformation. Such reversible activation might occur in vivo by unknown mechanisms. Future studies are needed to define the biochemical processes by which increased physiological demand for renin is translated into the production of more active enzyme.", 
    "144": "Previous work from this laboratory (J. S. Lazo, J. D. Catravas, and C. N. Gillis, Biochem. Pharmacol. 30, 2577-2584, 1981; J. D. Catraveras, J. S. Lazo, and C. N. Gillis, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 217, 524-529, 1981) demonstrated that subacute bleomycin (BLM) administration (5 mg/kg) to rabbits three times weekly for 4 weeks produced a marked decrease in serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in addition to producing both morphological and biochemical evidence of pulmonary endothelial damage. In this work, the reversibility of the decreased serum ACE activity and the biochemical and morphological status of the pulmonary endothelium after a substantial drug-free period in rabbits was examined. Rabbits were injected sc three times weekly for 4 weeks with vehicle or BLM (5 mg/kg) and then maintained drug free for an additional 6 or 7 weeks. Serum ACE activity decreased over 60% during the BLM treatment but did not return to control levels at any time during the drug-free period. The pulmonary endothelium, however, appeared undamaged. No decrease in pulmonary ACE activity was detected either in vitro or in vivo nor was the single-pass pulmonary removal in vivo of [3H]norepinephrine and 5-[14C]hydroxytryptamine different between BLM-treated and control rabbits after the drug-free period. In addition, no evidence of pulmonary endothelial damage was observed by light and electron microscopy. Thus, reduction in serum ACE activity appears to be a durable reflection of BLM toxicity in rabbits that persists even in the absence of any detectable biochemical or morphologic endothelial injury.", 
    "145": "In order to investigate the possible role of bradykinin in the hypotensive mechanism of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril) in renin-independent essential hypertension (EHT), we studied the effects of the single administration of 100 mg captopril on plasma bradykinin levels by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 21 EHT, who showed agonistic responses to 1Sar, 8Ile-angiotensin II (A IIA). Fourteen of the patients were low renin and 7 were normal renin EHT. There was no correlation between the baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) and the fall in mean blood pressure (MBP) following captopril administration. When the patients were analyzed according to MBP response, the responders (R) showed a significantly greater bradykinin increment (delta BK, +64%) (p less than 0.05), whereas the nonresponders (NR) did not show such an increase. There was a positive correlation between delta BK and the MBP reduction after captopril in the R group (r = 0.623, p less than 0.05). Plasma aldosterone (PA) decreased profoundly in the R group (-36% from baseline, p less than 0.05). Pretreatment ACE activity was significantly higher in the R group than in the NR group (p less than 0.05). Pressor response to A IIA showed a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater response after captopril administration in the R group. There were no significant differences in blood concentration of captopril between the R and NR groups. The present results suggest that bradykinin may be involved in the hypotensive action of captopril in the EHT subgroup, where the renin-angiotensin system appears to play an inert role for the elevation of blood pressure.", 
    "146": "We have investigated the effects of separate and combined s.c. and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, on isoproterenol-induced thirst. Whereas s.c. injections of captopril (0.5 mg/kg) increased drinking, combined s.c. and i.c.v. (20 micrograms) injections of captopril nearly abolished drinking to isoproterenol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.). This inhibition was not caused by general debility of the rats since the same treatment did not reduce drinking to 12h water deprivation. Intracerebroventricular injection of 20 micrograms captopril alone also greatly reduced isoproterenol-induced drinking, perhaps because it leaked into the circulation; captopril i.c.v. also reduced the pressor response to i.v. injection of hog renin (0.1 Goldblatt Unit) by about 65%. These results support the hypotheses that the renin-angiotensin system participates in the stimulation of drinking by isoproterenol and that the enhancement of drinking caused by inhibition of CE only in the circulation is the result of increased synthesis of angiotensin II in the brain.", 
    "147": "The development of hypertension in two-kidney, one clip renal hypertensive rats (2K, 1C RHR) was not altered by treatment with DOCA and saline solution as drinking fluid for two months of observation. However, the administration of DOCA and salt suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), the renal renin content (RRC) of the clipped kidney and the response to a single oral dose of captopril (10 mg/kg). The weight of the contralateral kidney was increased by the administration of DOCA-salt, while that of the ischaemic kidney was not changed. The withdrawal of DOCA-salt treatment restored the PRA and the effects of captopril to a similar degree to the non-treated group. The acute hypotensive effects of captopril were reduced on the 10th week compared with the 7th week after renal arterial constriction in 2K, 1C RHR. The fall in blood pressure induced by captopril significantly correlated with the initial PRA both in the 7th and 10th week after clipping. There was a significant correlation between PRA and RRC of the clipped kidney. Rats previously treated with DOC-salt had either removal of the contralateral kidney with removal of the clip from the ischaemic kidney, or removal of the ischaemic kidney. Blood pressure fell to normal levels in the unclipped group and in the nephrectomy group, but the fall in the latter group was transient and within two weeks had risen to significantly higher levels than in the unclipped group. It is concluded that structural vascular change following DOC-salt hypertension is insufficient to cause persisting hypertension except when it occurs in the renal circulation.", 
    "148": "Two cases of hypertension following renal trauma are reported. In both cases, blood pressure was controlled with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Mechanisms of hypertension following renal trauma are reviewed and the place of medical or surgical management discussed.", 
    "149": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (Lopril) were studied in a 53 year old woman with acute exacerbation of scleroderma. In addition to her chronic symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome, the patient presented with severe hypertension, cardiac failure and oligoanuria. Right heart catheterisation with a Swan-Ganz catheter confirmed the systemic hypertension with cardiac failure, and also demonstrated precapillary pulmonary hypertension with raised pulmonary arterial resistance. The organic renal failure was an indication for renal biopsy which showed segmental and focal fibrinoid necrosis with microthrombosis and chronic ischemic changes. Due to raised plasma renin activity, treatment with captopril was instituted, leading to a rapid normalisation of systemic and pulmonary hypertension, the regression of cardiac failure and a transient improvement in the Raynaud's syndrome. The renal failure did not improve and the patient had to undergo chronic hemodialysis. These spectacular initial results should be interpreted in the context of the poor prognosis of acute exacerbations of scleroderma despite the encouraging data published recently after well-controlled antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "150": "A living related kidney transplant recipient with normal renal function and severe hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis, was treated with captopril and developed reversible renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis. This complication of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, has been reported previously in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis with and without a kidney transplant. It is recommended that this drug be used with caution in this setting.", 
    "151": "The role of prostaglandins (PG), renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and calcium (Ca) in the control of renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in chronic hypercalcemia (serum Ca 12.8 mg%) was studied. Renal blood flow (RBF, 6.39 ml/min per gram kidney weight [gkw]) and GFR (0.52 ml/min per gkw) were significantly decreased in hypercalcemic rats when compared with normocalcemic rats (7.15, P < 0.001 and 0.74, P < 0.05, respectively). These changes in RBF and GFR occurred independent of any significant alterations in systemic hemodynamics, blood and plasma volume. Inhibition of the renal PG with indomethacin resulted in marked decrements in both RBF (6.39-4.12 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01) and GFR (0.52-0.19 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01) in hypercalcemic rats, whereas there was no significant alterations in normocalcemic rats. Inhibition of the RAS with captopril resulted in marked increments in both RBF (6.39-7.35 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05) and GFR (0.52-0.74 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05) in hypercalcemic rats. In fact, there was no significant difference from the RBF and GFR of similarly treated normocalcemic rats. Similar results were also obtained with the competitive angiotensin II (AII) antagonist (sarcosyl(1)-isoleucyl(5)-glycyl(8)) AII. Since both the renal PG and the RAS are involved in the control of RBF and GFR in hypercalcemia, the role of each is best revealed in the absence of the other. Hence, comparison of the RBF and GFR in the PG-inhibited hypercalcemic rats in the presence of AII (4.12 and 0.19 ml/min per gkw, respectively) and absence of AII (5.99 and 0.53 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01 for both) reveals the vasoconstrictive role for AII in hypercalcemia. On the other hand, comparison of the RBF and GFR in the AII-inhibited hypercalcemic rats in the presence of PG (7.35 and 0.74 ml/min per gkw, respectively) and absence of PG (5.99 and 0.53 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) reveals the vasodilatory role for PG in hypercalcemia. Finally, comparison of the RBF and GFR in both PG- and AII-inhibited hypercalcemic rats (5.99 and 0.53 ml/min per gkw, respectively) with similarly treated normocalcemic rats (7.30 and 0.94 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.001 and P < 0.005, respectively) reveals the vasoconstrictive role for Ca in chronic hypercalcemia. Our study therefore demonstrates that in chronic hypercalcemia the RBF and GFR are controlled by an active interplay of the vasoconstrictive effect of AII, the vasodilatory effect of renal PG, and the direct vasoconstrictive effect of Ca, independent of either AII or PG. The sum total of these forces produces a modest but significant decrease in RBF and GFR.", 
    "152": "Rat pleurisy was induced by intrapleural injection of lambda-carrageenin. The pleural exudate began to be accumulated 1-3 h after carrageenin administration and showed a peak at 19 h. The levels of prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight (HMW), but not low-molecular-weight (LMW), kininogen in the pleural fluid were markedly decreased when compared with those in plasma. Prekallikrein in rat plasma was activated by incubation with carrageenin in vitro. Captopril increased the plasma exudation significantly at 1-5 h. Depletion of prekallikrein and HMW kininogen in rat plasma by preadministration of bromelain caused marked inhibition of the plasma exudation at 1-24 h. The rest of the plasma exudation after bromelain was further decreased by simultaneous pretreatment of rats with both bromelain and aspirin. These results clearly indicate that plasma prekallikrein was activated in the pleural cavity and bradykinin released was responsible for plasma exudation during the entire course of this pleurisy.", 
    "153": "In a patient with severe renovascular hypertension, nonoliguric acute renal failure developed after she received captopril treatment. We believe this to be a previously unreported complication. Urine volume ranged from 1,640 to 2,260 mL/24 hr, and serum creatinine level rose from 2.3 to 8.3 mg/dL. There was no evidence of renal hypoperfusion or interstitial nephritis. Acute renal failure most likely was secondary to the nephrotoxic effect of captopril on chronically hypoperfused kidneys. Renal function improved rapidly after withdrawal of the drug therapy.", 
    "154": "The BP of four patients with severe hypertension could not be controlled by treatment with a variety of drugs including minoxidil and captopril. Satisfactory responses were obtained only when minoxidil and captopril were given in combination (along with diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents). The doses of minoxidil could be reduced by the addition of captopril and adverse effects were thus minimized. The state of the renin-angiotensin system prior to therapy was not a reliable predictor of the hypotensive response of the combination.", 
    "155": "To study the value of low-dose captopril (6.25 and 12.5 mg) and a diuretic combination, the blood pressure and heart rate of 17 patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension were monitored for 6 hours (hospital) or 3 hours (office) after the single low-dose or larger (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg) captopril dosage. All patients had preserved renal function and were taking an oral diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) for at least 4 weeks. The supine and upright acute blood pressure lowering with 6.25 mg was not different from the larger captopril doses; none produced persistent or profound hypotension. There was no deterioration of renal function, new or persistent increase in proteinuria, neutropenia or agranulocytosis acutely or during 17 +/- 2 weeks of follow-up. Low-dose captopril (6.25 or 12.5 mg three times daily) normalized the supine blood pressure of 35% of these patients acutely. We suggest that in hypertensive patients already taking a diuretic, a lower starting dose of captopril than the recommended 25 mg three times daily may be desirable.", 
    "156": "The contribution, if any, of various prostaglandins to the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is controversial. We studied the effect of the ACEI captopril (CAP) on the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF2 alpha (6-KF), the major metabolite of the vasodilatory prostaglandin, prostacyclin, and thromboxane B2 (TxB2), the stable metabolite of the vasoconstrictor TxA2, in 8 patients with essential hypertension after placebo, two weeks of CAP 25 mg t.i.d. alone, and the same dose of CAP in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50 mg/day. Mean 6-KF and TxB2 (nmol/8 hr post-dosing, respectively) did not differ significantly with any treatment; the mean ratio of 6-KF/TxB2 was also unchanged. Likewise, the excretion of these prostaglandins was also evaluated after placebo, the ACEI enalapril (ENA) (5 or 10 mg/day), and the combination of ENA and HCTZ in another group of 8 patients with essential hypertension. Mean 6-KF and TxB2 (nmol/24 hr post-dosing, respectively) showed no significant treatment-related differences; the mean ratio was again unchanged. No correlation existed between the magnitude of blood pressure responses with any treatment and either 6-KF or TxB2 excretion. Thus, the antihypertensive action of ACEI, alone or in combination with HCTZ, does not appear to involve alterations in these vasoactive prostaglandins.", 
    "157": "Twelve healthy male volunteers received single daily oral doses of enalapril (EN) 10 mg for 8 consecutive days. Serum samples for prolactin (PRL) assay were taken on day 0 (baseline) at 12.00 h and 16.00 h, and on days 1 and 8 at 08.00 h (pre-drug), 12.00 h and 16.00 h. The 08.00 h values on day 1 served as the pre-drug baseline. There were no significant changes from baseline in serum PRL levels on days 1 and 8. All mean serum PRL levels on day 8 were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than the upper limit of the normal range (2-15 ng/ml) found for healthy males in this laboratory. It is concluded that therapeutic doses of EN (10 mg/day, p.o.) for 8 consecutive days do not raise mean serum PRL levels above the normal range in healthy male volunteers.", 
    "158": "Thiorphan, N-[(R,S)-3-mercapto-2-benzylpropanoyl]glycine is a highly potent inhibitor (Ki = 3.5 nM) of \"enkephalinase,\" a metalloendopeptidase cleaving the Gly-Phe bond (positions 3 and 4) of enkephalins in brain tissue. In accordance with this property, thiorphan displays antinociceptive activity after systemic administration. However, thiorphan also inhibits to a lesser extent (Ki = 140 nM) the widely distributed angiotensin-converting enzyme, a carboxydipeptidase implicated in blood pressure regulation. Therefore, in view of an eventual clinical use of enkephalinase inhibitors, it was very important to develop fully specific compounds. Such derivatives were obtained taking into account that N-methylation of the ultimate amide bond of dipeptides strongly decreases enkephalinase affinity without affecting angiotension-converting enzyme recognition, whereas retro-inversion of the amide bond leads to the inverse effect. Thus, the retro-inverso dipeptide (R)-H2N-CH(CH2 phi)-NHCO-CH2-CO2H exhibits an inhibitory potency on enkephalinase (IC50 approximately equal to 12 muM) close to that of the natural dipeptide L-Phe-Gly (IC50 approximately equal to 3 muM). This result shows the topological analogy between the crucial components involved in enkephalinase recognition both in active dipeptides and structurally related retro-inverso isomers. Taking into account these observations, retro-thiorphan, (R,S)-HS-CH2-CH-(CH2 phi)-NHCO-CH2-COOH, was prepared. As compared to thiorphan, the retro isomer is 50% as potent (Ki = 6 nM) on enkephalinase but displays a drastic loss of potency on angiotension-converting enzyme (IC50 greater than 10,000 nM). This specificity was interpreted as a consequence of differences in the stereochemical constraints involving enzyme-inhibitor hydrogen bonding. This hypothesis is supported by reported crystallographic studies on related enzymes such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. As expected, retro-thiorphan exhibits about the same analgesic potency as thiorphan on the hot plate and writhing tests in mice. Therefore, the topological concept of retro-inverso isomers could be extended to other enkephalinase inhibitors, allowing the design of potent and highly selective compounds occurring as new classes of analgesic and psychoactive agents.", 
    "159": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assayed spectrophotometrically with hippuryl-histidyl-leucine as substrate. Postmortem tissues from 11 patients with various causes of death and pancreatic juice obtained during endoscopic cannulation of the pancreatic duct were assayed. Activity of most human tissues other than those of the gastrointestinal tract were found to be predominantly associated with the particulate fraction of the homogenates. Tissues with more than twice the ACE activity of lung included kidney, ileum, duodenum, and uterus; seven tissues with ACE activity approximately equal to that of lung included prostate, jejunum, lymph node, thyroid, colon, testis, and adrenal. Twelve other tissues had lower levels of activity with the heart consistently showing the least ACE activity. In the small intestine, the level of ACE activity increased with increasing distance from the pylorus. Inhibitors of ACE were detected in most tissues by assaying serial dilutions of the tissue homogenate; the presence of partial inhibitors did not significantly affect the relative activities of the various tissues. Lysis of hippuryl-histidyl-leucine by the pancreas and pancreatic juice resulted from an enzyme believed to be carboxypeptidase A which is present as a zymogen and activated by trypsin; this activity differed from ACE in that it had a smaller molecular weight (25,000) compared with ACE of serum (240,000), and it was not strongly inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or SQ 20881 (a specific ACE inhibitor). These studies show that human tissues vary in their content of ACE and suggest that ACE may serve a digestive or detoxifying role in the human small intestine and kidney, as well as functioning to activate angiotensin I.", 
    "160": "Thirty-one men with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were studied for 18 wk in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Those whose supine diastolic pressure was 90 to 104 mm Hg after 4 wk of placebo were randomly assigned to three groups. Group I (11 subjects) initially received one 10-mg enalapril capsule in the morning and one placebo capsule in the evening. Group II (10 subjects) received one 5-mg enalapril capsule twice daily. Group III (10 subjects) received one placebo capsule twice daily. Drug dosages were doubled and then quadrupled in all groups at wk 8 and 12. Metabolic, ophthalmologic, and audiometric studies were done on all subjects at wk 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Enalapril lowered diastolic pressure in the supine and upright positions in single and divided doses. Its antihypertensive effect was dose dependent, and it was greater in white patients than in black patients. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects and did not cause clinical or metabolic complications. It is concluded that enalapril is effective in lowering the arterial pressure in single and divided daily doses; its effect is dose dependent and is greater on the diastolic arterial pressure than on the systolic pressure; and it is well tolerated.", 
    "161": "Left ventricular (LV) coronary flow (CF) was determined by left atrial injection of microspheres in conscious rats during the development and after the reversal of LV hypertrophy in 2-kidney, 1-clip Goldblatt hypertension. Two groups of untreated renal hypertensive rats (RHR) were studied, the first (RHR1, n = 17) at 10 weeks and the second (RHR2, n = 9) at 24 weeks after clipping. Beginning 9 weeks after clipping, 2 other groups were treated either with captopril (40 to 60 mg/kg/day) in drinking water (RHR-C, n = 8) or left nephrectomy (RHR-N, n = 9) and followed for 15 weeks. Sham-operated animals followed for similar periods of time served as controls (Sham-1, n = 12, as a control for RHR1, and Sham-2, n = 11, as a control for RHR2). In all groups, LV mass increased or decreased in close correlation with changes in arterial blood pressure, and minimal total LV coronary resistance remained unchanged. The development of hypertrophy was associated with a tendency toward reduction in CF reserve (defined as maximal CF/unit mass); this flow reserve was restored with reversal of hypertrophy. The importance of the relation between pressure and LV mass as a determinant of CF reserve was investigated in a second study in which this relation was changed by altering the periods of captopril therapy; in these cases, CF reserve correlated significantly with the ratio of arterial pressure to LV mass (r = 0.76, n = 12, p less than 0.01). The results suggest that maintenance of CF reserve in LV hypertrophy depends on an appropriate balance between arterial pressure and LV mass, and might be disturbed by antihypertensive therapy that leaves LV hypertrophy unchanged.", 
    "162": "Absent reflex tachycardia with captopril therapy suggests blunting of circulatory reflexes, perhaps contributing to antihypertensive efficacy, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may alter sympathetic function. Captopril effects on autonomic function were investigated in five severe hypertensive patients. Mean blood pressure fell in all patients (from 141 +/- 6 to 119 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) without orthostatic blood pressure fall or increase in heart rate (both p greater than 0.1) on captopril. Captopril did not alter baroreflex sensitivity as tested by amyl nitrile hypotension or phenylephrine hypertension (both p greater than 0.1). Comparison of these severely hypertensive patients to age matched normotensive control subjects did reveal markedly blunted baroreflex sensitivity in both the amyl nitrite test (by 89%, p less than 0.01) and the phenylephrine test (by 83%, p less than 0.01), suggesting that baseline blunting of baroreflex function may in part account for absence of reflex tachycardia. Captopril diminished the cardioacceleration after cold stress (from 61 +/- 38 to 23 +/- 43 msec, p less than 0.05) as well as the blood pressure fall after alpha-adrenergic blockade (from 46 +/- 13 to 24 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), suggesting diminished sympathetic stimulation of resistance vessels and decreased sympathetic participation in blood pressure maintenance, possibly at the prejunctional synaptic level. Four biochemical indices of sympathetic activity did not change. Thus captopril-treated patients had blunted reflex tachycardia, commensurate with blunted baroreflex function at baseline, and physiologic and pharmacologic evidence of diminished sympathetic activity was obtained with captopril therapy. Whether diminished sympathetic activity is involved in captopril's antihypertensive effect has not been determined.", 
    "163": "The lung is thought to be the major site for conversion of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII), although a significant amount of AI conversion is also known to occur in the peripheral circulation. Reports suggest that pulmonary conversion of AI to AII is more sensitive to inhibition by specific kininase II inhibitors than extrapulmonary conversion. This latter observation prompted us to seek for a dose of SQ20881 and/or captopril that would suppress the conversion of AI to AII in the lung without affecting extrapulmonary conversion of AI and thereby peripheral pressor responses to intravenously administered AI. Experiments were performed on 15 pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs. The AII arterial-venous difference across the lung was measured during an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of AI which produced a steady-state rise in blood pressure of 20 mmHg. This protocol was repeated with the same dose of AI following three graded doses of either SQ20881, captopril or vehicle. Results showed that the systemic pressor response to AI cannot be dissociated from pulmonary AI conversion.", 
    "164": "Using an adsorption technique combined with high pressure liquid chromatography and a specific radioimmunoassay, the met5-enkephalin-arg6-phe7 (YGGFMRF) content was measured in human and rabbit plasma. This heptapeptide content was 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.20 +/- 0.05 pmol/10 ml plasma, for human and rabbit plasma, respectively. The degradation of YGGFMRF injected intravenously (rabbit) or that of the opioid heptapeptide added to rabbit plasma is rapid. The biological half life (T 1/2) of 125I-YGGFMRF in rabbit plasma was about 45 seconds (in vivo) and 1 minute and 8 seconds (in vitro). The metabolic clearance rate of YGGFMRF is slower than that of met5-enkephalin. The YGGFMRF content of rabbit plasma increased following inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase activity by an intravenous injection of captopril. The presence of met5-enkephalin-arg6-phe7 into circulation indicates that it may have some physiological role, however it is unknown whether circulating YGGFMRF originates from adrenal medulla, intermediate lobe of pituitary or some other site.", 
    "165": "Plasma aldosterone levels were measured as part of two suppression tests in 31 hypertensive patients on normal sodium diet and without recent treatment. Thirteen patients had essential hypertension, 6 had probable bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and 12 had confirmed Conn's adenoma. In the first test, aldosterone levels were measured in the supine patients, then after infusion of 2 litres of isotonic saline over 2 hours. In the second test, aldosterone levels were measured before and 3 hours after oral administration of Captopril 1 mg/kg. Plasma aldosterone values superior to 360 pmol.l-1 after sodium load or to 665 pmol.l-1 after Captopril were characteristic of primary hyperaldosteronism due to adenoma. The test using Captopril has the advantages of being rapid, of avoiding acute blood volume expansion and of being applicable to all forms of hypertension, including severe ones.", 
    "166": "[3H]Captopril binding to membrane fractions of rat tissues is saturable and reversible with a KD of 2.4 nM. [3H]Captopril binding and angiotensin converting enzyme measured with hippuryl-L-histidine-L-leucine are distributed in parallel between different tissues and brain regions, with highest levels in the choroid plexus, lung and corpus striatum. Captopril, N-(1(S)-carboxy-3-phenyl-propyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline, N-(1(S)-carboxy-3-phenyl-propyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline, teprotide, thiorphan and S-acetylcaptopril each have similar potencies for inhibition of [3H]captopril binding and of angiotensin converting enzyme. These data strongly indicate that [3H]captopril binds selectively to angiotensin converting enzyme. [3H]Captopril binding evaluation should help clarify the localization and function of angiotensin converting enzyme and assist in defining pharmacologic actions of captopril.", 
    "167": "The tissue distribution of captopril, an antihypertensive drug possessing a free sulfhydryl group, and its sulfur-conjugated metabolites was studied in rats by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at 15, 30 and 60 min following a single 10 mg/kg oral dose of captopril. It was found that tissue accumulation of captopril was rapid with both free and oxidized-forms already present at 15 min post-dose. A maximum concentration of captopril was achieved at 30 min in tissues studied, being substantially higher in kidney (14.2 micrograms/g), with lesser amounts occurring in liver, lung, heart, blood cells, spleen and plasma in that order. Oxidized disulfide forms of captopril were usually present in the same or slightly higher proportion than free captopril except for liver which only contained detectable disulfides at 15 min after oral dosing. S-methylcaptopril was also present at 30 min in all tissues examined with highest levels occurring in liver and kidney (1.05 micrograms/g) followed by plasma, lung, heart, spleen and blood cells.", 
    "168": "The presence of a methyltransferase enzyme in human red blood cells (RBCs) capable of S-methylation of captopril is described. The apparent Michaelis-Menten (Km) constant for captopril was 0.5 mM and the maximum velocity (Vmax) was 0.391 pmoles S-methylcaptopril (mg protein)-1 min-1. There is some evidence presented to show that S-methylcaptopril inhibited its own formation with a ki value of 5.81 mM. Captopril thiol methyltransferase activity was also examined in rat tissues and was found to be present in all tissue studied. Subcellular localisation studies in rat liver suggest that the enzyme was microsomal in origin. The order of activity was liver greater than heart greater than spleen greater than lung greater than kidney much greater than RBC (rat). This tissue distribution was quite different from previous studies using other thiol substrates and is consistent with more than one form of thiol methyltransferase enzyme in tissues.", 
    "169": "The proteolytic enzyme renin (EC3.4.99.19) cleaves the protein substrate angiotensinogen to yield angiotensin I, the decapeptide substrate transformed by converting enzyme into the pressor substance angiotensin II. Although the contribution of this pathway to the maintenance of normal blood pressure is unclear, it seems to be a major factor in various hypertensive states. Important progress in the control of hypertension has been achieved by development of the potent inhibitors SQ-14,225 (captopril) and MK-421 (enalapril maleate), which block the generation of angiotensin II by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. An attractive alternative to the inhibition of converting enzyme would be the blockade of the preceding step in the cascade, the renin reaction. We report here new highly potent (IC50 = 10(-9)-10(-8) M) competitive inhibitors of renin in which statine, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, is incorporated into analogues of the pig renin substrate (Fig. 1).", 
    "170": "Intravenous administration of captopril (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) to normotensive pithed rats, with or without unilateral nephrectomy, was followed by a sustained fall in arterial blood pressure. Concomitantly pressor responses to electrical stimulation of the spinal sympathetic outflow (T11-L3), ganglion stimulation with McNeil-A-343 (4-(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium chloride) or intravenous injection of noradrenaline were reduced. Attenuation by captopril (1 mg/kg) of pressor responses to McNeil-A-343 persisted after intravenous propranolol (1 mg/kg). Tachycardia caused by electrical stimulation of the spinal sympathetic nerves (C7-T2) was unchanged after 3.0 mg/kg captopril. After procedures reducing the activity of the renin angiotensin system, bilateral nephrectomy or induction of mineralocorticoid hypertension by unilateral nephrectomy and administration of desoxycorticosterone acetate, pressor responses to McNeil-A-343 or noradrenaline were unchanged after 1 mg/kg captopril. It is concluded that in the pithed rat, basal arterial blood pressure and the height of pressor responses to either postganglionic sympathetic nerve activation or intravenous noradrenaline depend on converting enzyme activity maintaining circulating angiotensin II levels.", 
    "171": "The hypotensive action of chronic oral captopril treatment (50 mg/kg per day) was examined in two groups of male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of the Okamoto strain, one group offered a choice of water and 0.9% saline as drinking fluid, the other offered water alone, a third group of SHR, offered a choice of water and 0.9% saline, were treated with vehicle (0.9% saline, 2 ml/kg per day). Captopril treatment, over ten days, significantly lowered blood pressure in the group drinking water only but failed to significantly alter the blood pressure of SHR drinking a choice of water and 0.9% saline. Vehicle treatment did not alter the blood pressure of SHR drinking a choice of saline and water. In an identical experiment using male, genetically hypertensive rats (GHR) of the Smirk strain, captopril lowered blood pressure to the same extent in GHR drinking either a choice of water and 0.9% saline or water alone. In conclusion, the reported exaggerated saline preference of the spontaneously hypertensive rat appears to antagonize the hypotensive action of captopril.", 
    "172": "To test a possible role of endogenous opioids in the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses to the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in man, nine normal subjects were given captopril (50 mg) or placebo with and without the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Treatments were given in random order and under double-blind conditions. BP and HR were measured supine and after a 5 min head-up tilt to 60 degrees before, 90, and 360 min after captopril. BP and HR responses to Valsalva's manoeuvre and isometric exercise (sustained hand grip) were also measured, as indirect tests of baroreceptor reflex function. After captopril alone, there was a significant decrease in supine diastolic and tilt systolic and diastolic BP at 90 min (7.8, s.d. = 6; 15.4, s.d. = 13; and 7.0, s.d. = 12 (s.d. = 9), 0 (s.d. = 15) and 3 (s.d. = 7) mmHg. The effect of naloxone on the changes in supine diastolic and tilt systolic BP were significant (P = 0.017, P = 0.030 respectively; analysis of variance). No significant effects of treatment on supine or tilt HR were seen. BP and HR changes during Valsalva's manoeuvre and isometric exercise were not altered by active treatment. These results suggest that the BP but not the HR responses to converting enzyme blockade are mediated by endogenous opioids.", 
    "173": "The fall in blood pressure observed in both early and chronic phase Goldblatt 2-kidney 1-clip hypertension produced by removing or unclipping the ischaemic kidney is due to a profound fall in peripheral resistance. The two procedures have an equal effect upon peripheral resistance and the lesser efficacy of nephrectomy in lowering blood pressure is due to a greater rise in stroke volume perhaps associated with a greater degree of sodium retention. Neither changes in sodium balance, in the renin-angiotensin system nor in vascular reactivity explain the fall in blood pressure. A reduction in renal sympathetic afferent activity and a medullary based vasoactive humoral system may play a role although the nature and extent of that role remain to be defined.", 
    "174": "Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on osmotically stimulated vasopressin secretion. During icv infusion of captopril (3.1 micrograms/kg . min), dogs were infused intravenously (iv) with either 2.5 or 0.15 M NaCl. Control groups received an osmotically equivalent mannitol solution icv with the 2.5 or 0.15 M NaCl iv infusion. As a result of the iv hypertonic saline infusion, plasma vasopressin concentrations increased progressively and in concert with the plasma osmolality; this response was not altered by icv captopril. Plasma vasopressin levels were unchanged during iv isotonic saline infusion, and, again, icv captopril was without effect. At the completion of the icv infusions, injection of angiotensin I icv (310 ng/kg) produced a markedly greater increase in plasma vasopressin levels in animals which had received mannitol icv, compared to those which had received captopril icv. On the basis of these findings, a role for an intrinsic brain renin-angiotensin system, if such a system exists, in the osmotic control of vasopressin secretion is seriously questioned, but not ruled out.", 
    "175": "Sixty-minute local intraarterial infusions of bradykinin (0.8, 5, or 10 micrograms base/min) produced transient forelimb vasodilation and dose-related increases in lymph flow, lymph total protein concentration, total protein transport, and weight in forelimbs perfused at a controlled flow rate. Mean aortic pressure was not affected by these infusion rates of bradykinin. Following pretreatment with captopril, the local intraarterial infusion of these same doses of bradykinin produced sustained systemic hypotension. The increase in protein efflux and edema formation produced by local infusions of bradykinin following pretreatment with captopril was markedly increased during the infusion of the low dose of bradykinin (0.8 micrograms base/min, ia), but was attenuated during the local infusion of the larger dose of bradykinin (5 micrograms base/min, ia). Following pretreatment with both captopril and propranolol, the increase in protein efflux and edema formation produced by this larger dose of bradykinin (5 micrograms base/min) was greater than that produced by infusions of this dose of bradykinin alone or after pretreatment with captopril. Moreover, the increase in protein efflux and edema formation was greater during the infusion of the higher dose of bradykinin than during the infusion of the low dose of this autacoid under these conditions. The 60-min infusion of a massive dose of bradykinin into the left ventricular chamber (280 micrograms base/min) produced sustained decreases in aortic and forelimb perfusion pressure, but little edema formation relative to that produced by local intraarterial infusions of this agent. In contrast, the 60-min intravenous infusion of only 5 micrograms base/min of bradykinin following pretreatment with both captopril and propranolol produced profound systemic hypotension and marked increases in protein efflux and edema formation in forelimbs perfused at a controlled flow rate comparable to that produced by the local intraarterial infusion of this dose of bradykinin alone. These data demonstrate that endogenous kininases and catecholamines may dramatically affect the increase in protein efflux and edema formation produced by either local or systemic infusions of bradykinin by modulating the magnitude of the increase in macromolecular permeability.", 
    "176": "We report the successful use of captopril for severe hypertension in three renal transplant recipients. Multiple drugs including minoxidil were ineffective in these patients. Bilateral nephrectomy also failed to control the hypertension in one patient. The addition of captopril resulted in excellent and sustained control of blood pressure without side-effects in all three patients.", 
    "177": "Captopril (30 mg/kg daily by gavage), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, reduced the intake of 0.15 M NaCl in rats treated with desoxycorticosterone acetate (2.5 mg/day S.C.). However, this is probably not a specific effect on salt appetite as captopril (30 or 60 mg/kg daily) did not reduce the intake of less palatable 0.5 M NaCl in desoxycorticosterone acetate-treated rats (1 or 2.5 mg daily). In contrast, captopril given alone (30 or 60 mg/kg daily) consistently caused a 3- to 5-fold increase in intake of 0.5 M NaCl that usually began on the 1st day and persisted until treatment stopped (1-3 weeks). Sodium intake and sodium excretion increased concomitantly, but the stimulation of salt appetite occurred even in the absence of sodium depletion. Also, the effect on salt appetite was specific; captopril did not increase the intake of 0.5 M KCl or 0.03 M sucrose. This potent and specific stimulation of sodium intake by oral treatment with an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system may be caused by a paradoxical increase in the synthesis of angiotensin II in the brain.", 
    "178": "The effect of two antihypertensive agents (captopril and prazosin) and of digoxin on the efficiency of Tc-99m binding to RBCs was evaluated in the rat. RBCs were labeled with Tc-99m in vivo in six groups of rats: I-normotensive controls Wistar rat (WR), II-prazosin treated WR, III-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), IV-prazosin-treated SHR, V-digoxin-treated WR, and VI-captopril-treated WR. The percentage of intravascular Tc-99m bound to RBC (%T) and the percentage of injected dose remaining intravascular 5 min after injection (%i.v.) were determined. Mean %T was 94.2, 83.8, 94.9, 86.1, 79.7, and 93.3 for groups I-VI respectively. Mean %I.V. was 96.4, 74.6, 94.9, 79.0, 74.4, and 87.4 for groups I-VI respectively. The findings demonstrate a significant reduction of RBC tagging with Tc-99m in rats treated with prazosin and digoxin but not with captopril. The data suggest a potential interference by patient medication with the performance of blood-pool studies.", 
    "179": "A 20-year-old woman presented with malignant hypertension, pulmonary edema, anemia, and azotemia. Blood pressure was adequately controlled only after progressively more intensive drug regimens, finally including minoxidil, nadolol, and furosemide. On these drugs, the patient developed progressive left and right heart failure, anasarca, and malnutrition. The control of hypertension, heart failure, and fluid retention, was accomplished by administration of captopril and furosemide. Captopril is a logical alternative to vasodilators in refractory hypertension complicated by congestive heart failure.", 
    "180": "Studies to assess the role of blood pressure rise in the growth of the collateral arterial supply following renal artery stenosis were performed in 70 rats. Assessment of the proliferative response was made by coded reading of endothelial cell turnover following tritiated thymidine administration, 5 days after renal artery stenosis. Stenosis induced the anticipated brisk increase in endothelial cell turnover in arterial collaterals and in the ipsilateral renal vein, and ureteric epithelium. Blood pressure elevation did not appear to play the dominant role, as the proliferative response did not parallel blood pressure changes; moreover, neither bilateral renal artery stenosis, designed to enhance the hypertension, nor hydralazine administration, to reduce the blood pressure, influenced endothelial cell turnover. A contribution of elevated blood pressure to the vasoproliferative response, however, was not ruled out definitively in this study. Captopril, also administered to assess the same question, resulted in an enhanced endothelial cell proliferative response, both in frequency and in degree, an observation that became the central thrust of our study. The mechanism by which converting enzyme inhibitor modified endothelial cell turnover is not clear, but may well provide insight into the responsible factors.", 
    "181": "Aldosterone responses to angiotensin II were evaluated in normal subjects in 3 conditions, (1) with suppression of neither ACTH secretion nor angiotensin II, (2) with suppression of ACTH by dexamethasone, and (3) with suppression of both ACTH and angiotensin II by combined administration of dexamethasone and captopril. Baseline levels of plasma aldosterone were significantly lowered by administration of either dexamethasone or both dexamethasone and captopril. Aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin-II was not altered by suppression of ACTH secretion. However, the responsiveness was significantly enhanced during suppression of both ACTH and angiotensin II. These results suggest that aldosterone response to angiotensin II in normal man is not dependent upon endogenous ACTH secretion, but to an action of angiotensin II on the pituitary gland to release ACTH. The combined administration of dexamethasone and captopril may be a useful maneuver to assess more precisely the reactivity of the adrenal cortex to angiotensin II in man.", 
    "182": "Enalapril maleate is an investigational oral prodrug whose hydrolyzed diacid metabolite is a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Fourteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were evaluated after receiving placebo, and two weeks of treatment with each of the following: enalapril maleate (20 mg b.i.d.), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg b.i.d.), and the two in combination. In comparison to placebo, the magnitudes of the blood pressure reduction after enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide alone were comparable. The reduction in blood pressure following enalapril was evident throughout the 12-hour dosing interval. The combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a marked further reduction in blood pressure that was greater than that predicted from the responses to the individual drugs (P less than 0.05). Biochemical parameters confirmed inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme during enalapril treatment; serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity proved an excellent monitor of compliance. Enalapril was generally well tolerated. Adverse effects included symptomatic hypotension in three patients when enalapril was first added to hydrochlorothiazide and hyperesthesia of the oral mucosa without a loss of taste in one patient on enalapril. Enalapril maleate alone and especially in combination with hydrochlorothiazide appears to be an effective, well-tolerated converting enzyme inhibitor with at least a 12-hour duration of action.", 
    "183": "Enalapril (MK-421) is a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor which effectively lowers elevated blood pressure and might also be useful in heart failure. Enalapril was infused into six awake dogs 2 hours after left circumflex coronary artery embolization (acute failure group) and into six other awake dogs two to six months after coronary embolization (chronic failure group). In the acute failure group 2 hours after embolization, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and reduced cardiac output remained unchanged during enalapril infusion. In the chronic failure group, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure also remained unchanged during enalapril infusion, but cardiac output, which had fallen to 131.8 +/- 11.9 (S.D.) from 165.8 +/- 17.9 ml/min/kg (P less than 0.01) by two to six months in this group rose during enalapril infusion to 154.5 +/- 27.7 ml/min/kg (P less than 0.05). Heart rate and blood pressure were not changed during enalapril in either group, but stroke volume rose (26.0 +/- 5.9 to 29.2 +/- 6.9 ml, P less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance fell (58.5 +/- 10.3 to 39.3 +/- 4.3 units, P less than 0.01) during enalapril only in the chronic failure group. Plasma renin activity after embolization was slightly but not significantly higher in the acute failure group. Thus, enalapril appears to be an arterial vasodilator in dogs with chronic but not acute left ventricular failure.", 
    "184": "Captopril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was administered to three patients in an active stage of sarcoidosis. The serum ACE level, aldosterone concentration in plasma and blood pressure decreased rapidly after administration, while plasma renin activity was not significantly changed. It is suggested that inhibition of ACE by captopril offers a possible therapeutic approach to the treatment of sarcoidosis.", 
    "185": "The role of endogenous brain angiotensin II (AII) in various thirst states was examined in the rat using the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) captopril (7 micrograms) significantly attenuated the dipsogenic response to centrally administered angiotensin I (AI) (200 ng) for up to 2 hours. The same dose of captopril significantly potentiated the dipsogenic response to ICV AII (100 ng) but failed to alter the dipsogenic response to ICV carbachol (200 pmoles). Central pretreatment with captopril (7 micrograms), for 30 minutes, failed to alter markedly the cumulative water intake of 24 hour water deprived rats. However, a small, significant 8% decrease in water intake was noted in ICV captopril treated rats 60 minutes following the return of water. The same dose of captopril, administered intraperitoneally, significantly potentiated the cumulative water intake of 24 hour water deprived rats. Central pretreatment with captopril (7 micrograms), for 30 minutes, failed to alter the cumulative water intake of rats treated intraperitoneally with hypertonic saline (0.75 M given at a dose of 1% of the body weight). From these studies it would appear that central angiotensin converting enzyme plays only a minor role in thirst induced by water deprivation.", 
    "186": "Converting-enzyme inhibition as a guide to the hypotensive response to be expected from surgery was evaluated in 27 hypertensive patients with renovascular disease. Blood pressure averaged 163 +/- 5/102 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) during converting-enzyme inhibition with captopril, 518 +/- 29 mg daily for 2.8 +/- 0.3 months, and stabilized at a similar level of 165 +/- 4/104 +/- 3 mm Hg during 5.0 +/- 0.6 months of postoperative follow-up, when no medication was administered. Postoperative pressure, both systolic (r = +0.53; p = 0.004) and diastolic (r = +0.55; p = 0.003), was correlated with blood pressure during converting-enzyme inhibition. In addition, multiple regression analysis identified systolic pressure during converting-enzyme inhibition as the only significant (p less than 0.01) predictor of postoperative systolic pressure. Diastolic pressure during converting-enzyme inhibition (p less than 0.05) in conjunction with circulating renin (p less than 0.05) and renin suppression from the contralateral kidney (p less than 0.01) explained up to 53% of the postoperative diastolic pressure. Therefore, blood pressure during long-term converting-enzyme inhibition may be useful as a predictor of the postoperative blood pressure in hypertensive patients with renovascular disease.", 
    "187": "The ductus arteriosus of the undisturbed fetal lamb was studied chronically by techniques that allowed direct serial measurements of the calibre of the fetal channel. When the direct actions were studied of vasoactive agents on the ductus arteriosus, prostaglandins did not dilate the vessel beyond its resting dimensions. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, was a potent vasoconstrictor with a plateau of the dose-effect relationship occurring at 0.2 mg/kg. Fetuses of 95--98 days gestational age were equally sensitive to indomethacin when compared to animals near term. Although the prostaglandins, PGE1, PGE2 PGF2 alpha, PGH2, PGI2 and PGG2, had no direct effect on the ductus arteriosus, PGE1, PGE2, PGH2 and PGI2 reversed the vasoconstrictor action of indomethacin. Autonomic nervous system mediators and blockers, i.e., acetylcholine, atropine, norepinephrine, propranolol, phentolamine and methoxamine, had neither direct effects on the ductus arteriosus nor any influence of indomethacin-induced vasoconstriction. The same was true of angiotensin 1, angiotensin 2, blockade of conversion of angiotensin 1 to 2, serotonin, methysergide, aminophylline, adenosine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Imidazole, a blocker of thromboxane synthase, had no direct effect on the ductus arteriosus, but reduced significantly the magnitude of the indomethacin constrictor action. The major finding of this investigation was the exquisite sensitivity of the ductus arteriosus to manipulations of the prostaglandin environment. The results suggest that both locally generated prostaglandins, as well as prostanoids in the circulation, may be involved in ductal patency and closure. A high degree of control is likely of the circulation of the ductus arteriosus and constriction of the fetal channel is probably the result of an active process.", 
    "188": "The present study compares the effects of short-term treatments with captopril and enalapril, administered in equipotent antihypertensive doses, on the regional vascular resistances and on the regional vascular responsiveness to vasopressor agents of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Three groups of animals were treated by gavage with captopril (100 mg/kg), enalapril (25 mg/kg), or distilled water for 8 days. Arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), plasma renin concentration (PRC), and plasma converting-enzyme activity (CEA) were measured. Cardiac index (CI), total peripheral resistance (PR), and organ flow distribution were determined using microspheres. Renal and mesenteric vascular responsiveness to vasopressor agents was evaluated by continuous measurement of renal and mesenteric blood flows with miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes. Data showed that in the anesthetized SHR the two drugs induced similar reductions in BP, PR, and HR, without affecting CI. They simultaneously produced a strong converting-enzyme inhibition as evidenced by the suppression of angiotensin I effects accompanied by a potentiation of angiotensin II responses, a reduction in CEA, and an increase in PRC. Organ flows were similarly and homogeneously increased, especially in the kidneys, in both treated groups. Norepinephrine (NE) vasoconstrictor responses were abolished in the mesenteric vascular bed by both drugs, but in the renal, NE responses although completely abolished by captopril were only partially reduced by enalapril. It thus appears that diminished vascular responsiveness to NE, especially in the case of captopril, is probably involved along with converting-enzyme inhibition in the antihypertensive action of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI), the mechanism of the difference between captopril and enalapril remaining still speculative.", 
    "189": "In congestive heart failure, acute administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril leads to a decrease in arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular filling pressure, and the end-diastolic volumes of both ventricles, as well as to an increase in cardiac index, stroke volume index, right and left ventricular ejection fractions. The mechanism of action appears not only attributable to a decrease in angiotensin II but, possibly, may also be accounted for by central and peripheral sympathicolytic effects diminished degradation of bradykinin and an increase in synthesis of vasoactive prostaglandins. During continued treatment with captopril over three months a further decrease in left ventricular filling pressure and an increase in cardiac output can be observed. While the exercise tolerance is not meaningfully affected at the beginning of treatment, a significant increase may be seen during long-term use. After three months of therapy an increase in the acutely-lowered mean arterial pressure can be noted. As compared with placebo-treated control patients, a more favorable clinical course was seen in those receiving captopril. There does not appear to be a relationship, however, between the initial hemodynamic effects and the clinical response. On combined use of captopril and hydralazine, as compared to treatment with captopril only, there is a greater increase in cardiac output and stroke volume without marked additional fall in pulmonary capillary pressure and a further decrease in systemic arterial pressure, incurred without symptomatic hypotension in the majority of patients. The adverse effect is hypotension which precludes long-term treatment in about 10% of patients. Proteinuria, neutropenia and renal insufficiency occur only rarely, usually in patients who are maintained on daily dosages above 300 mg or who have preexisting renal disease. Skin rashes and taste alterations are more common but are frequently well-tolerated and, generally, do not warrant discontinuation of treatment.", 
    "190": "The origin and regulation of angiotensinogen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was investigated in rats by measuring renin substrate in plasma and CSF under different experimental conditions. Nephrectomy (NX) increased the circulating and the central angiotensinogen levels. There was no correlation between the individual values of plasma and CSF. Adrenalectomy (ADX) diminished and hydrocortisone treatment augmented the angiotensinogen levels in plasma and CSF. The combination of ADX and NX caused a dissociation between peripheral and central angiotensinogen, since the values were elevated in plasma but unchanged in CSF. After the application of the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril a significant decrease of angiotensinogen was observed in plasma only. A specific radioimmunoassay for renin substrate of rat plasma also recognized CSF angiotensinogen. There was a linear correlation between the CSF substrate levels obtained by direct and indirect measurement. In conclusion, CSF angiotensinogen appears to be immunologically similar to the plasma molecule. The angiotensinogen levels in CSF and plasma may be affected in parallel but can nevertheless be dissociated from each other.", 
    "191": "Two cases of nephrotic syndrome and biopsy-proved membranous glomerulopathy (membranous glomerulonephritis) were encountered during captopril treatment of 53 hypertensive subjects in our institution. Both patients had impaired renal function before treatment and were treated with 600 mg per day. Discontinuation of captopril led to transient partial remission of proteinuria but was followed by a recurrent, fluctuating course over one year later. Repeat biopsies, eight and 12 months after discontinuation of the drug, demonstrated persistent subepithelial deposits in the glomerular basement membrane. There has been a decline in glomerular filtration rate since discontinuation of the drug, apparently due to arterionephrosclerosis. These studies suggest that glomerular basement membrane deposits in captopril-associated membranous glomerulonephritis are not readily reversible and may be associated with persistent proteinuria, contrary to some previous reports.", 
    "192": "There are few data to support the potential efficacy of combined vasodilator therapy for severe congestive heart failure. For documentation of the feasibility of such an approach, a short-term hemodynamic study utilizing captopril, an oral converting enzyme inhibitor, followed by the addition of nitroprusside infusion, was made of 11 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. Captopril alone resulted in reduction of mean arterial pressure (84 +/- 7 to 70 +/- 3 mm Hg), associated with increase of cardiac index and stroke index. There was also a significant reduction of systemic resistance and pulmonary wedge pressure. The initial hemodynamic response to captopril was correlated with initial plasma renin activity (all values at least p less than 0.05). The addition of nitroprusside to captopril resulted in further hemodynamic improvement. Reduction of mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary wedge pressure were all significant, as were increases of cardiac index and stroke index. The degree of hemodynamic improvement with this sequence of vasodilator therapy was linearly related to the reduction of mean arterial pressure. Therefore vasodilators with dissimilar mechanisms of action may have an additive effect. These data support the potential feasibility of combined, long-term oral vasodilator therapy in selected subgroups of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "193": "Captopril, 5 mg/kg, administered to pregnant rabbits caused a reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 106+/-2 to 87+/-2 mmHg (P<0.01) without change in cardiac output or renal blood flow. Uterine blood flow fell from 31.9+/-2.5 to 21.3+/-3.4 ml/min (P<0.01) as uterine vein prostaglandin E series level (PGE) decreased from 127+/-23 ng/ml to 26+/-8 ng/ml (P<0.01). Saralasin also caused a reduction in MAP from 110+/-5 to 92+/-4.3 (P<0.01), a reduction in uterine blood flow from 28.8+/-1.6 to 21.8+/-1.7 ml/min (P<0.01) as uterine vein PGE decreased from 121.3+/-14.4 to 63.5+/-14.2 ng/ml (P<0.01). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was higher in the uterine vein, 11+/-3 ng/ml per h, than peripheral vein, 6+/-1.6 ng/ml per h, (P<0.05), before Captopril and rose in the uterine vein to 90+/-19 ng/ml per h (P<0.01) as peripheral vein PRA rose to 62+/-15 ng/ml per h (P<0.05) after Captopril. After saralasin uterine vein PRA rose from 4.6+/-1.5 to 14.8+/-6.3 ng/ml per h (P<0.05) and peripheral vein PRA rose from 3.7+/-1 to 6.5+/-2.1 (P<0.05). Reducing MAP with MgSO(4) from 98+/-4 to 70+/-2 (P<0.01) caused a significant fall in cardiac output from 695+/-33 to 588+/-49 (P<0.01) without change in renal or uterine blood flow. Uterine vein PGE concentration also did not change significantly following MgSO(4); 80+/-22 ng/ml before and 60+/-27 ng/ml (NS) during the administration of MgSO(4). Chronic administration of Captopril in doses of either 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg per d from the 15th d of gestation caused an 86% fetal mortality at the lower and a 92% fetal mortality at the higher dose of the drug. These experiments point to the importance of uterine PGE synthesis in maintenance of uterine blood flow and fetal survival during pregnancy and suggest that uterine PGE synthesis is dependent upon angiotensin II. Synthesis of uterine renin and PGE may be necessary for maintenance of uterine blood flow and fetal survival during pregnancy.", 
    "194": "Serum ACE-activity was studied in 27 young patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. The possible importance of an increase in ACE for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension was evaluated by comparing the ACE levels to PRA, the plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and to the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril. Mean ACE-activity was slightly but significantly elevated in the hypertensive patients when compared to 28 normotensive control subjects. ACE-activity was not correlated to PRA, angiotensin II or the decrease in blood pressure following captopril. It is concluded that the increase in ACE-activity in essential hypertension is not of pathophysiological or clinical significance.", 
    "195": "We have assessed the influence of acute bilateral nephrectomy, of captopril and saralasin, on the hypotensive activity of neurotensin (NT) and of various hypotensive drugs in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The results show that the hypotensive activity of NT and of compound 48/80 (C48/80), in contrast to that of histamine, of 5-hydroxytryptamine and of hexamethonium, is markedly reduced, especially for NT, in nephrectomized as compared to sham operated rats. The pretreatment of rats with captopril (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) or with saralasin (20 micrograms kg-1 min-1, i.v.) was found to inhibit significantly the hypotensive activity of NT and of C48/80. Adrenalectomy restored partially the hypotensive activity of NT in nephrectomized rats. The potent vasopressin antagonist [d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP] did not alter the refractoriness of nephrectomized rats to the hypotensive activity of NT. Neither nephrectomy nor saralasin were found to interfere with the ability of NT or of C48/80 to evoke an increase of plasma histamine level or of the hematocrit. The results were interpreted as an indication that NT produces part of its hypotensive effect in anesthetized rats by reducing the activity of the renin angiotensin system. The results also suggest that part of the refractoriness of nephrectomized rats to the hypotensive activity of NT could be due to the release of catecholamines from adrenal glands by NT. Endogenous vasopressin does not appear to contribute to the refractoriness of nephrectomized rats to the hypotensive action of NT.", 
    "196": "Converting enzyme inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has proved a valuable therapeutic approach in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. In the present study, a new long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) was evaluated with acute single dose testing (10, 20 or 40 mg) in nine patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. Four hours after administration, there was a significant reduction of systemic vascular resistance (-19%) and pulmonary wedge pressure (-19%); in addition, there were related increases of cardiac index (+16%) and stroke index (+19%) (probability [p] less than or equal to 0.05 for all changes). This was associated with an increase of plasma renin activity (9 +/- 3 to 35 +/- 11 ng/ml per hour) and a decrease of plasma aldosterone (19 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 2 ng/100 ml) (p less than 0.02 for both). With long-term therapy (1 month), there was improvement of exercise tolerance time and lessening of symptoms based on the New York Heart Association classification. Hemodynamic improvement was maintained in most, but not all, patients. There was no orthostatic hypotension during head-up tilt and hemodynamic values in the upright position were associated with normalization of intracardiac pressures. Long-term converting enzyme inhibition was indicated by a persistent increase of plasma renin activity (16 +/- 2 ng/ml per hour) and a decrease of plasma aldosterone (8 +/- 3 ng/100 ml). In addition, relative angiotensin II receptor occupancy was decreased as judged by the pharmacodynamic response to infusion of the angiotensin II analog saralasin. In conclusion, the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, was effective in patients with chronic congestive heart failure; however, additional studies will be necessary to further delineate the optimal dose range and identify those patients who are most likely to respond to the drug.", 
    "197": "1. Blood pressure, renin concentration and angiotensin II were measured in unanaesthetized two-kidney one-clip hypertensive rats at 1 and 2 days, at weekly intervals up to 10 weeks and at 15 and 20 weeks after clipping. 2. Compared with values in sham-operated rats, renin and angiotensin II were initially increased at 1-2 days but were then suppressed between 2 and 4 weeks to levels similar to that found in sham-operated rats. Between 5 and 20 weeks renin and angiotensin II increased again to high levels. 3. There was a significant correlation between angiotensin II and blood pressure in acute rats 1-2 days after clipping (P less than 0.05) and in chronic rats 8-20 weeks after clipping (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the slope of the regression lines but the regression line for the chronic rats was shifted upwards in a parallel manner. 4. The acute hypotensive response (-20.3 +/- SD 24.9 mmHg) in 26 chronic rats given converting enzyme inhibitor was related to the basal renin and angiotensin II levels and followed the slope of the angiotensin II/blood pressure regression line for all chronic rats. Only one out of 26 rats reduced its blood pressure to normal levels. 5. In 12 rats at 4 weeks after clipping, when blood pressure was elevated but angiotensin II was suppressed, there was only a small fall in blood pressure (-7.1 +/- SD 7.2 mmHg). This also followed the angiotensin II/blood pressure regression line for chronic rats but at the lower end. Blood pressure again was not reduced to normal. 6. These results suggest that renin and angiotensin II are increased up to 20 weeks after clipping, that there is no change in the net vascular responsiveness to endogenous angiotensin II at any stage in this experimental model and that the acute effect of angiotensin II is determined solely by its position in the same dose-response curve. Also with the exception of 1-2 days immediately after clipping the acute effect of angiotensin II plays only a minor, though variable, role in the hypertension and that some other mechanism, as yet undetermined, is of greater importance and begins to have an effect as early as 2 weeks after clipping.", 
    "198": "One of the esteroproteinases present in the submandibular glands of female mice was purified and characterized. The enzyme, designated proteinase F in this report, had a pI value of 4.6 and a molecular weight of 27600, being comprised of two subunits of 10000 and 18000 daltons. The amino acid composition of proteinase F resembled that of the epidermal growth factor-binding protein, but antiserum against proteinase F only reacted weakly against the binding protein. Proteinase F had an optimum pH at around 9.0 and was strongly inhibited by Cu2+ and Hg2+ (42 and 76% inhibition, respectively, at a concentration of 4 x 10(-6) M). It was also inhibited by aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, iodoacetamide, leupeptin, antipain, and benzamidine but neither by trypsin inhibitors from pancrease, soybean, or ovomucoid, nor by TLCK, TPCK, and epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid. Although its actual physiological function has yet to be determined, these properties indicate that proteinase F is a new enzyme, being distinguished from known proteinases, kallikrein, plasmin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, tonin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, proteinase A (beta-nerve growth factor endopeptidase), proteinase D (epidermal growth factor-binding protein), P-esterase, renin A, and renin C. Proteinase F was present in the submandibular glands of female mice more abundantly than in those of males, but it increased in males following castration. Thus, proteinase F appears to be affected by male hormones in vivo.", 
    "199": "Captopril significantly diminished the basal diastolic blood pressure and the vasopressor response to electrical stimulation of the thoracic-lumbar spinal cord in pithed normotensive rats. The reduction of the hypertensive response to electrical stimulation was more pronounced after bilateral adrenalectomy. Captopril also diminished the vasopressor response to intravenously administered (-)-noradrenaline. Pretreatment of the animals with indomethacin had no effect on the vasopressor response to electrical stimulation and did not affect the sympathoinhibition of captopril. After bilateral nephrectomy, 18-24 h previously, the basal diastolic blood pressure and the vasopressor response to electrical stimulation were reduced and captopril had no additional inhibitory effect on these parameters. In indomethacin-pretreated animals with intact kidneys, restoration of the basal diastolic blood pressure with angiotensin II (AII) completely abolished the sympathodepressive effect of captopril. When the reduction in basal diastolic blood pressure with captopril was prevented by vasopressin, converting enzyme inhibition had no depressive effect on the hypertensive response to intravenously administered (-)-noradrenaline and did not influence sympathetic neurotransmission in animals with intact adrenals. However, a small, but significant reduction of the hypertensive response to electrical stimulation by captopril was still detectable in bilaterally adrenalectomized rats. The results suggest that endogenous AII facilitates sympathetic neurotransmission in vascular smooth muscle of pithed normotensive rats. However, the modulatory action of endogenous AII largely results from an effect on basal arteriolar smooth muscle tone and should, therefore, be considered as non-specific facilitation. Genuine prejunctional facilitation of the sympathetic neurotransmission in vascular smooth muscle can only be observed after bilateral adrenalectomy but this effect of endogenous AII appears of minor significance, at least in pithed normotensive rats.", 
    "200": "The components of the renin-angiotensin system exist in the brain but their physiological role is uncertain. The effects of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, MK 421 (or its diacid) and captopril, on brain ACE activity, as measured by inhibition of the pressor response to intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered angiotensin I (AI), and the potential contribution of the central nervous system to their antihypertensive activity were evaluated in the present series of experiments. The diacid of MK 421 (1 and 10 micrograms) and captopril (3 and 10 micrograms) given i.c.v. to conscious normotensive rats reduced the pressor response to i.c.v. AI indicating that they can inhibit brain ACE. Responses to AII were unaffected. Oral administration of maximal antihypertensive doses of MK 421 (10 mg/kg) and of captopril (30 mg/kg) to normotensive rats did not attenuate pressor responses to i.c.v. AI indicating that brain ACE was not inhibited under these circumstances. Intracerebroventricular administration of MK 421 diacid, (10 and 30 micrograms) and captopril (30 and 100 micrograms) did not lower baseline blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. These experiments indicate that MK 421 and captopril can inhibit brain ACE but that the central renin-angiotensin system probably does not contribute to their antihypertensive activity.", 
    "201": "The blood pressure response to the first dose of captopril (6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, or 25 mg) was measured in 65 treated, severely hypertensive patients. Mean supine blood pressure was 187/108 mm Hg immediately before captopril was given. Twenty one patients experienced a fall in supine systolic pressure greater than 50 mm Hg, including five whose pressure fell more than 100 mm Hg and two whose pressure fell more than 150 mm Hg. Six patients developed symptoms of acute hypotension, including dizziness, stupor, dysphasia, and hemiparesis. Percentage reductions in blood pressure were greatest in those with secondary hypertension (p less than 0.05), high pretreatment blood pressure (p less than 0.05), and high concentrations of plasma renin and angiotensin II (p less than 0.01). No significant correlation was found between fall in blood pressure and serum sodium concentration, age, renal function, and the dose of captopril given. A severe first dose effect cannot be consistently predicted in individual patients who have received other antihypertensive drugs for severe hypertension. Such patients should have close medical supervision for at least three hours after the first dose of captopril.", 
    "202": "This study evaluated the effects of single doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol, alone or in combination, on the blood pressure, heart rate and humoral responses to both isometric (handgrip) and dynamic (ergometric) exercise in normotensive and hypertensive men. Single oral doses of either placebo, captopril 50 mg, propranolol 80 mg, or the latter two in combination were administered to age-matched groups (n = 5) of normotensive and hypertensive men in a random, double-blind manner. Captopril alone was indistinguishable from placebo after both isometric and ergometric exercise. Propranolol suppressed heart rate after both types of exercise and tended to decrease systolic blood pressure only in the hypertensive group; combination with captopril did not alter these responses. These data suggest that in sodium-replete subjects undergoing short-term vigorous exercise, the renin-angiotensin system, as measured by captopril inhibition, is less important than the sympathoadrenal system, as measured by propranolol inhibition, in the reflex cardiovascular adjustments accompanying acute isometric and dynamic exercise in both normotensive and hypertensive men.", 
    "203": "The effects of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, on sinus rate and atrial contraction were investigated in 10 isolated dog atria and in 3 intact anesthetized donor dogs. Captopril (10-1,000 micrograms) caused an increase in heart rate and the development of atrial contractile tension when injected into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium perfused with arterial blood of the anesthetized dog. At extremely high doses (1-3 mg), captopril produced brief negative effects followed by positive ones. The positive effects were completely blocked by 10 micrograms of propranolol, after which the negative ones became more evident. The positive effects were also significantly suppressed by 30 micrograms of imipramine, whereas the negative ones were not influenced by treatment with atropine. In all 3 cases when captopril (0.3 mg/Kg) was administered intravenously to donor dogs, the blood pressure decreased and a slight tachycardia usually appeared. In contrast, no significant change was observed in sinus rate and contractile tension of isolated atria. Thus, it is concluded that only at extremely high doses does captopril cause a release of catecholamine by a tyramine-like action which may have a slight depressive action on the sinus node and contractility.", 
    "204": "We saw three cases of severe reversible azotemia secondary to captopril therapy in hypertension. All patients had extensive peripheral vascular disease involving the renal arteries, and two patients (patients 2 and 3) had high levels of peripheral plasma renin activity. The azotemia occurred approximately two weeks after exposure to captopril, and fever, a maculopapular pruritic cutaneous rash, and eosinophilia developed in two patients (patients 2 and 3). The cause of the azotemia in our patients is not clearly known, since renal biopsies were not performed. The most likely cause for the azotemia was volume contraction with reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, although a direct insult to the kidney could not be excluded.", 
    "205": "Mutants of Salmonella typhimurium deficient in dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase have been isolated by screening for clones unable to use N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine (AcAla3) as the sole nitrogen source. An insertion of the transposable element Tn10 near dcp (the locus coding for dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) has been isolated and used to map the locus in the interval between purB and trp, an otherwise genetically silent region of the S. typhimurium map. All dcp mutants could still grow using N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine (AcAla4) as the sole nitrogen source. Crude extracts from the dcp mutants failed to hydrolyze AcAla3 but retained approximately 80% of the wild-type activity toward AcAla4. Several lines of evidence indicate that hydrolysis of AcAla4 in the dcp mutant results from the action of a new peptidase distinct from dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. A mutant strain lacking dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase in addition to peptidases N, A, B, and D showed reduced protein breakdown during carbon starvation compared with a strain lacking only peptidases N, A, B, and D.", 
    "206": "The hemodynamic mechanism of blood pressure response to angiotensin blockade is well established in \"benign\" but not in human malignant hypertension. We studied the changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP), and in plasma volume (PV) induced by a single oral dose of captopril (150 mg) in 11 patients with malignant hypertension. Two hours after captopril, MAP fell from 178.5 +/- 5.8 to 151.8 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) (means +/- SEM) due to a fall in total peripheral resistance (TPR) (from 54.8 +/- 6.8 to 46.4 +/- 1.6 arbitrary units, p less than 0.001). However, there was a simultaneous increase in CI (from 3.29 +/- 0.13 to 3.70 +/- 0.15 liter/min/m2, p less than 0.001), and a decrease in PWP (from 15.3 +/- 3.5 to 11.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), while PV remained unchanged (from 4.02 +/- 0.26 to 4.12 +/- 0.12 liters, n.s.). Our data show that, in human malignant hypertension, blood pressure response to captopril is due to a decrease in TPR, but in contrast to benign hypertension, there is also a simultaneous increase in CI. Our results suggest that, in malignant hypertension, potentially high CI levels are artificially normalized by the increased TPR and may be fully disclosed by vasodilation.", 
    "207": "An assay of plasma prorenin was developed in which the conversion to renin occurred under apparently optimal conditions. Some characteristics of the assay were 1) prorenin was activated by Sepharose-bound trypsin at 4 degrees C; 2) the concentration of activator was not critical provided that incubation was prolonged until renin activity had reached a plateau; and 3) this plateau was stable and had the same height as after maximal activation with acid, pepsin, plasmin or urokinase. Maximal activity with Sepharose-bound trypsin at 4 degrees C was higher than with cryoactivation, and optimal conditions were more readily reproduced than with trypsin at 37 degrees C or with acid-activation. The assay was used for measurements in peripheral and renal vein plasma after captopril in hypertensive patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis. Peripheral renin rose within 30 minutes after a first dose of captopril, 50 mg orally, and it remained high with chronic treatment. In contrast, peripheral prorenin fell initially and rose after 4 hours. These changes in peripheral plasma were related to changes in the secretion rates of the two forms of renin from the affected kidney. Thus chronic, but not acute, stimulation of renin release was associated with an increased secretion rate of prorenin. The late rise in prorenin is probably an indication of enhanced synthesis in the kidney, so that more prorenin is available for conversion. The data suggest that prorenin is indeed a biosynthetic precursor of renin and that, at least under certain circumstances, a major proportion of circulating prorenin originates from the kidney.", 
    "208": "Diuretics have been particularly successful for treatment of low-renin hypertension (LRH), although they may cause metabolic complications such as hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Since the efficacy of diuretics is largely limited by reactive angiotensin II production, a combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor with a diuretic should be synergistic, particularly in LRH, where heightened aldosterone production in response to angiotensin II has been noted. Eighteen patients with LRH were treated initially with either captopril alone (450 mg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (up to 100 mg/day). Captopril alone only reduced average placebo standing blood pressure from 151/100 to 146/96 mm Hg. Combination of HCTZ with captopril reduced average standing blood pressure to 111/76 mm Hg at 3 months and 116/81 mm Hg at 1 year while allowing reductions in average captopril dosage to 100 mg/day and HCTZ dosage to 40 mg/day and reductions in supplemental potassium administration and in HCTZ-induced hyperglycemia. Captopril monotherapy did not increase urinary excretion of kallikrein, prostaglandin E2, or 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, a metabolite of prostacyclin, and did not reduce urinary aldosterone excretion chronically. Thus, a synergism of captopril with HCTZ may be advantageous in certain patients with LRH.", 
    "209": "The in vivo generation of angiotensin appears to be dependent on both plasma renin and angiotensinogen concentrations. Much less is known about the control of hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis and release, as compared to that of renin. In this study, we examined the feedback regulation of angiotensinogen synthesis and release by various components of the renin-angiotensin system, using an in vitro rat liver slice system. Livers were removed for study from rats which were subjected to various systemic infusions or physiological perturbations. Infusion of angiotensin II has been reported to increase angiotensinogen release rate. However, infusion of angiotensin I (with simultaneous suppression of plasma renin by antirenin antibody infusion and angiotensin II production by captopril administration) had no effect on the angiotensinogen release rate. Direct infusion of renin in rats treated with captopril resulted in further suppression of the angiotensinogen release rate, compared with those given captopril alone. We postulate that renin (or des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen) inhibits the angiotensinogen release rate, whereas angiotensin II stimulates it. Angiotensin I has no effect on angiotensinogen release rate. This hypothesis was evaluated further in rats with various physiological states. Indeed, when conditions were such that the renin-angiotensin system was completely suppressed, such as binephrectomy and antirenin antibody infusion, angiotensinogen release rate was markedly stimulated. When angiotensin II production was prevented by captopril treatment, angiotensinogen release rate declined. This appeared to be the case for all states of sodium balance. Thus, angiotensinogen release rate is subject to a complex feedback control by other components of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "210": "Five children with high-renin hypertension unresponsive to conventional medications were effectively treated with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, for six to 26 months. Age groups included children 6 to 13 years old and a 33-week gestation preterm infant with hypertension related to umbilical artery catheterization. Significant adverse reactions were limited to transient renal insufficiency in the preterm infant and increased azotemia in an older child with chronic renal failure.", 
    "211": "In order to clarify the influence of food on the clinical effect of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14,225, captopril), 25 mg of the drug was administered to patients with hypertension using in a two-way crossover study design. In the first study (study I), each subject received the drug 30 min after breakfast, and changes in blood pressure (BP), blood concentration of captopril (BCC), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA) and plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme activity (ACE-A) were determined for 3 hr. BP was recorded for 6 hr. Four days after study I, the same subjects received the drug 2 hr after breakfast, and each parameter was again determined (study II), similarly to study I. No significant difference in the hypotensive responses to captopril was observed between both studies during 6 hr of observation. Maximum hypotensive effects were found within 90 min of the treatments in study I and study II, and BP returned almost to baseline levels at 6 hr in both studies. Maximum BCC levels were found 60 and 90 min after the drug administration in studies I and II, respectively, and these approximated to half of each maximum level at 180 min. There were no statistically significant differences in the biological half-life (T1/2), maximum concentration (C max), maximum concentration time (T max), and area under the blood concentration curve [AUC]0(3) between both studies. The peak in PRA occurred at 60 and 90 min after the administration of the drug in studies I and II, respectively. In study I, a slightly greater reduction of PA levels was found, but there was no significant difference in the magnitude of the reduction between both studies. The present results indicate that food did not exert any significant influence on the clinical effect of captopril.", 
    "212": "The effect of treatment time and dose of captopril with regard to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in serum, lungs and kidneys of the rat were studied. Normotensive Wistar rats were treated with a constant dose of captopril (0.2 mg/ml) during various time periods. In a second study rats were treated with different captopril doses (6.25 micrograms, 12.5 micrograms, 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, and 200 micrograms/ml water) during three weeks. Serum ACE activity and pulmonary and kidney plasma membrane ACE concentrations were measured in both studies. Captopril treatment resulted in a rapid decrease of ACE in pulmonary and kidney plasma membranes and a simultaneously increase of serum ACE activity during the first day of treatment. This was followed by increased membrane concentrations of ACE in the lungs and return to normal ACE concentrations in membranes of kidneys, presumably due to increased ACE biosynthesis. Serum ACE activity continued to increase during the whole study. Serum ACE activity increased in a dose dependent manner during treatment with different captopril doses. Increased plasma membrane ACE concentrations were not observed in the rats treated with captopril at doses below 200 micrograms/ml water.", 
    "213": "1-(3-Mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl)indoline-2-carboxylic acids (7b) and related compounds were synthesized in order to examine their ability to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and to reduce the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). All four possible stereoisomers of the precursor 1-[3-(benzoylthio)-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl]indoline-2-carboxylic acid (6b) were characterized with absolute stereochemical assignment. The removal of the benzoyl group of the precursor to give 7b was conveniently carried out by treatment with 2-methoxyethylamine. Three of the four stereoisomers of the benzoyl derivative 6 showed in vitro ACE inhibitory activity in the following order: 6b(S,S) greater than 6b(S,R) greater than 6b(R,S). The stereoisomer having the R,R configuration was essentially inactive. The substitution at the C5 of the indoline nucleus with the Et or OMe group caused only marginal changes in the inhibitory activity. The mercaptan 7b(S,S) was the most active ACE inhibitor synthesized in this study, showing in vitro potency 3 times that of captopril. The augmentation of the potency may be due to the increased hydrophobicity of 7b(S,S) compared with captopril and suggests the presence of a hydrophobic pocket at the active site of ACE. When tested in spontaneously hypertensive rats, 7b(S,S) exhibited oral antihypertensive activity 27 times that of captopril. The corresponding benzoyl derivative 6b(S,S) was 24 times as potent as captopril. The thio lactone 10 obtained by cyclization of 7b(S,S) as a potential prodrug was less potent than the parent compound, 7b(S,S), in the ACE inhibitory and antihypertensive tests.", 
    "214": "A series of 1-[3-(acylthio)-3-aroylpropionyl]-L-proline derivatives was synthesized. A number of these compounds are potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that lowered blood pressure in aorta-coarcted renal hypertensive rats. The most active derivatives are 1-[3(R)-(acetylthio) -3-substituted-benzoyl)-2(S)-methyl-propionyl]-L-prolines with an in vivo activity equivalent to SQ 14,225 (captopril). Structure-activity relationships are discussed. Changes in the configuration of the alpha-methyl group and the S-acetyl group affect the ACE activity. Coupling of 3-(substituted-benzoyl)-2-methylpropionic acids to L-proline via enol lactones is described.", 
    "215": "By using aprotinin, a potent kallikrein inhibitor, the role of kinin formation in the cardiovascular and renal effects of captopril was assessed in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs previously undergoing hydrochlorothiazide treatment (2.5 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.) for 5 days. A fall in mean arterial pressure (MBP) from 117 +/- 8 to 94 +/- 6 mmHg followed i.v. administration of captopril, 1 mg/kg. A concomitant rise in renal blood flow (RBF) from 168 +/- 18 to 205 +/- 20 ml/min occurred without changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with cardiac output tending to decrease. Urine flow (V) tended to rise while Na+ and K+ excretion were variable. With i.v. infusion of aprotinin (900 KIU/min) the hypotensive response to captopril was unaffected (from 103 +/- 5 to 75 +/- 8 mmHg) suggesting that captopril decreases BP independent of kinin accumulation. However, aprotinin completely abolished the renal vasodilator response to captopril (from 163 +/- 25 to 143 +/- 22 ml/min). In addition, there was a concomitant fall in GFR, V and electrolyte excretion. In comparison, the cardiovascular and renal effects of saralasin (3 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) were not altered by aprotinin. It is, therefore, concluded that, in dogs with stimulated renin-angiotensin system, the plasma kinins do not contribute to the hypotensive action of captopril but play an important role in inducing renal vasodilatation and supporting kidney function.", 
    "216": "To examine the antihypertensive effects of captopril, when used in combination with diuretics, an oral dose of the agent (30 mg/kg) was given to spontaneously hypertensive rats pretreated for 1 week with trichlormethiazide (TCTZ), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), furosemide, or water. One-week treatment with diuretics did not lower blood pressure, but potentiated the anti-hypertensive action of captopril in magnitude as well as duration. The degree of potentiation was in the following order: furosemide greater than or equal to HCTZ greater than TCTZ. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) prior to the administration of captopril was highest in the furosemide group, followed by the HCTZ, TCTZ, and control groups, in this order. When data from four groups were taken together, the reduction of blood pressure following captopril administration was closely related to PRC before administration. These data suggest that repeated administration of diuretics renders the maintenance of blood pressure more dependent on the renin-angiotensin system without affecting blood pressure and that this situation underlies the potentiation of the antihypertensive action of captopril by combined use of diuretics. There was no qualitative difference between furosemide and thiazides in the potentiation of anti-hypertensive action of captopril.", 
    "217": "The compensatory response to moderately severe hemorrhage (30 ml/kg) was studied in chronically catheterized conscious dogs maintained on normal and low salt intake. Although the fall in blood pressure and the increase in heart rate were similar in the two salt states, the salt-restricted animals had significantly greater rises in plasma renin activity and plasma catecholamines following hemorrhage than did the normal salt dogs. To compare further the relative roles of the alpha-adrenergic system and the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure following hemorrhage, pharmacologic blockade with either phentolamine or converting enzyme inhibitor was performed 20 min after the completion of the hemorrhage. These latter experiments demonstrated that salt restriction resulted in a significantly greater role for the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, interruption of the renin-angiotensin system blunted the anticipated rise in catecholamines and heart rate during the additional hypotension induced by converting enzyme blockade after hemorrhage.", 
    "218": "The ability of two kininase II inhibitors, SQ 20881 and captopril, to inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and to potentiate the vascular responsiveness to exogenous bradykinin were compared in the mesenteric, renal, and external iliac vasculatures of the dog. Basal rate of angiotensin I-to-angiotensin II conversion was found to be lower in the renal vasculature, average conversion being 4.7%, than in the mesenteric and iliac vasculatures, in which the average conversion was 30.7 and 26.3%, respectively. Inhibition of angiotensin I conversion by both kininase II inhibitors was independent of the basal angiotensin I conversion rate; however, SQ 20881 was a more potent inhibitor of angiotensin I conversion than captopril in all vascular beds tested. In the presence of equal molar doses of SQ 20881 and captopril, only 20-30% of the control bradykinin doses was needed to produce the same vascular effects in the mesenteric and iliac vasculatures. In the kidney, 70% of the control bradykinin doses was needed to produce the same vascular effects in the presence of SQ 20881; in contrast to SQ 20881, neither an equimolar nor 20 times an equimolar dose of captopril produced any change in the renal vascular responsiveness to bradykinin. In conclusion, 1) SQ 20881 is a more potent inhibitor of angiotensin conversion than captopril, and 2) captopril, unlike SQ 20881, does not alter renal vascular responsiveness to bradykinin.", 
    "219": "During human and ovine pregnancy, systemic pressor responses to infused angiotensin II are decreased when compared to the nonpregnant state. An increased circulating level of angiotensin II has been proposed as one of the possible mechanisms responsible for this refractoriness. The present study was designed to determine if increased pressor responsiveness to exogenous angiotensin II occurs after circulating levels of angiotensin II in pregnant ewes are reduced. Pregnant (112 to 118 days' gestation) and nonpregnant sheep were instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery and vein. Dose-response curves to angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine were established prior to and during continuous short-term (2 to 3 hours' duration) and long-term (24 hours' duration) inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity by either captopril or enalapril. Short-term infusions of converting enzyme inhibitors blocked the formation of angiotensin II from exogenously administered angiotensin I but did not alter pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II or norepinephrine in pregnant and nonpregnant sheep. Long-term infusions of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril blocked responses to angiotensin I but did not alter pressor responses to norepinephrine in pregnant and nonpregnant sheep. In contrast, responses to angiotensin II were significantly potentiated in pregnant sheep but were not altered in nonpregnant sheep. These results suggest that increased circulating levels of angiotensin II in pregnant sheep are responsible for pregnancy-induced decreases in angiotensin II responsiveness.", 
    "220": "The effect on blood pressure and heart rate, following administration of the same intracerebroventricular (ivt) and intravenous (iv) doses of captopril, was compared in freely moving DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, with chronically implanted ivt, iv and intraarterial cannulae. Ivt captopril (500 micrograms) in DOCA-salt rats showed an initial pressor response followed by a long lasting hypotensive effect. The ivt effect was greater than that following iv administration. No effect was observed in normotensive controls either ivt or iv. ASA or naloxone pretreatments significantly lowered the captopril hypotensive effect, thus suggesting an involvement of prostaglandin and opioid systems in blood pressure elevation in \"non renin dependent\" hypertension.", 
    "221": "The long-term effect of treatment with captopril was observed in 7 hypertensive patients on maintenance hemodialysis who had been refractory to combined antihypertensive therapy with propranolol and hydralazine. Captopril showed a potent hypotensive effect in all the subjects throughout the study period of 6 months. The blood-pressure reduction during treatment with captopril was associated with a decrease in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac index increased significantly due to a significant increment in heart rate at the 6th month. Plasma renin activity increased significantly at the 3rd month, whereas it decreased at the 6th month. No significant correlation was observed between the blood-pressure response and the pre-treatment level of plasma renin activity.", 
    "222": "Eight adult Yucatan miniature swine were implanted with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) impregnated silicone strips (100 mg X kg-1). After 16 weeks of DOCA treatment mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased to 183 +/- 4 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa). In four normal animals arterial pressure was 126 +/- 8 mmHg. The increase in MAP in the DOCA animals was due to an elevated total peripheral resistance (TPR) with cardiac output remaining normal. In tests with conscious animals, phenoxybenzamine (1 mg X kg-1) significantly decreased arterial pressure via a selective decrease in TPR. Neither meclofenamate, metoprolol, nor captopril affected MAP in these DOCA hypertensive animals. Dose--response curves to exogenous norepinephrine and angiotensin II revealed that the DOCA animals had an increased pressor sensitivity to both of these agents. These data suggest that in the DOCA hypertensive Yucatan swine an increase in alpha adrenergic activity and (or) an increase in smooth muscle responsiveness to circulating catecholamines is responsible for the increase in blood pressure as a result of an increase in total peripheral resistance.", 
    "223": "The circulatory effects of captopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, and saralasin, a competitive angiotensin II antagonist, were studied during halothane anaesthesia in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Captopril decreased blood pressure significantly in unanaesthetized rats. Pretreatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, did not modify the antihypertensive action of captopril. During 1 MAC halothane anaesthesia, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in unmedicated SH control rats was maintained at a relatively high level (16.2 +/- 0.7 kPa, mean +/- s.e. mean), while in captopril-treated rats MAP decreased to 8.8 +/- 1.1 kPa. Indomethacin somewhat inhibited MAP decrease in the captopril-medicated group. Saralasin infusion in halothane-anaesthetized rats decreased MAP in the same way as captopril alone. The tolerance to haemorrhagic shock was markedly impaired in rats receiving captopril or saralasin, compared to untreated controls. During halothane anaesthesia, the plasma renin activities in the captopril, captopril + indomethacin, and saralasin groups were significantly higher than in untreated animals. Plasma kininogen was unaffected by any of the medications. The results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is important in maintaining blood pressure in halothane anaesthesia, and that the tolerance to haemorrhagic shock is particularly impaired by drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "224": "Captopril, an oral inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, has recently been described as causing a dramatic reversal of the renal crisis in scleroderma in 2 patients(1). We report here 2 patients with scleroderma, hypertension, and rapidly deteriorating renal function who were given captopril. Despite good blood pressure control, captopril had no effect on renal function, both patients requiring long-term haemodialysis.", 
    "225": "Two neuropeptides, bradykinin (BK) and angiotensin II (ANG II), produce an increase in blood pressure when injected into the brain ventricles. This study is an example of central peptide-peptide interaction and was carried out to determine if BK and ANG II share a common mechanism in the brain to control blood pressure and drinking in rats. Prior injection of saralasin [10 micrograms intraventricularly (ivt)] was found to enhance the pressor response to ivt BK (5 micrograms) by 44%. The same dose of saralasin attenuated the pressor response to ivt ANG II (200 ng) by 55%. 50 ng ANG II and 5 micrograms BK given together ivt did not significantly alter blood pressure or urine conductance compared to 50 ng ANG II alone. Drinking to ivt infusions of ANG II (14 ng/min) was significantly attenuated when combined with BK (0.7 micrograms or 2.8 micrograms/min). Pretreatment with 10 micrograms indomethacin ivt diminished the pressor response to 5 micrograms ivt BK. Prostaglandin E2 (1.4 micrograms/min), but not prostaglandin A2, inhibited drinking to 14 ng/min ivt infusions of ANG II. The results suggest that ANG II and BK share an interrelationship with respect to their central actions: ANG II inhibits the BK pressor response and BK acts to inhibit drinking induced by ANG II. Prostaglandins of the E series may mediate these central actions of bradykinins.", 
    "226": "The role of angiotensin II in the control of water intake following deprivation of water for varying lengths of time was studied. Male rats were deprived of water for 0, 12, 24, 36, or 48 h. Water intakes were measured with and without pretreatment with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (50 mg/kg, ip). Captopril had no significant effect on water intake following either 0 or 12 h of water deprivation. However, captopril significantly attenuated water intake following 24-48 h of water deprivation with the magnitude of the attenuation increasing as the length of the period of water deprivation increased. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased over control levels after 24-48 h of water deprivation but not after 12 h of water deprivation. Plasma renin activity tended to increase as the length of the water-deprivation period increased. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration were significantly increased over control levels following 12-48 h of water deprivation. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration failed to show any further increases with increasing length of water deprivation beyond the increases following 12 h of water deprivation. The data indicate that the water intake of water-deprived rats can be divided into an angiotensin II-dependent component and angiotensin II-independent component. The angiotensin II-independent component appears to be more important in the early stages of water deprivation whereas the angiotensin II-dependent component becomes more important as the length of the water-deprivation period increases.", 
    "227": "A radioimmunoassay was set up to measure plasma arginine vasopressin levels (AVP). Characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity to 0.25 pg, high specificity of the antibody, mean recovery of added unlabeled arginine vasopressin of 80%, and an interassay coefficient of variation of 7.6%. This assay was used to investigate the influence of various factors on plasma vasopressin levels in a total of 121 awake male rats. Blood samples obtained in Wistar rats via an indwelling arterial catheter yielded results similar to those following decapitation, i.e., 1.27 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.39 pg/ml. Forty-eight hour dehydration markedly increased plasma AVP to 21.8 +/- 2.39 pg/ml. AVP was less than 0.5 pg/ml in Brattleboro rats. Low and high sodium intake, angiotensin II infusion (10 and 30 ng/min), and converting enzyme inhibition by captopril (100 mg/kg) did not alter plasma AVP. During norepinephrine infusion (250 ng/min) plasma AVP rose to 5.28 +/- 1.29 pg/ml, whereas it tended to fall with isoproterenol infusion (10 ng/min). Plasma AVP was slightly higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto controls.", 
    "228": "The pressor response to lysine vasopressin was tested in groups of male Wistar, Brattleboro, Wistar-Kyoto, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Moreover, the influence of sodium intake, angiotensin II, saralasin, captopril, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol on vasopressin pressor responses was evaluated. The right iliac artery and one or both femoral veins of the animals were catheterized under light ether anesthesia. The experiments were carried out following a 2-h stabilization period with the rats awake and semirestrained. Pressor responsiveness was evaluated acutely on the basis of dose-response curves (0.5-4 mU). In the Wistar rats, angiotensin II (10 and 30 ng/min) and isoproterenol (10 ng/min) markedly decreased the response to vasopressin, whereas variations in sodium intake and blood pressure per se did not seem to exert any influence. Norepinephrine (250 ng/min) slightly enhanced the pressor responsiveness to the smaller doses of lysine-vasopressin. Brattleboro rats with congenital diabetes insipidus were less sensitive to vasopressin than the other animals, and neither angiotensin II nor isoproterenol induced any change. In conclusion, the pressor responsiveness to vasopressin can vary considerably depending on several factors. These must be taken into account when evaluating the possible pressor role of vasopressin in experimental and clinical settings.", 
    "229": "The renal and adrenal responses to a continuous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril were studied in 27 chronically catheterized sheep fetuses (less than 120 days gestation, n = 15, and greater than 130 days gestation, n = 12; term being 145 days) and in 12 newborn lambs between 8 and 21 days of age. Total renal blood flow did not change during ACE inhibition. However, the renal vascular resistance decreased significantly in newborn lambs (-21.8 +/- 5.7%) and in fetuses greater than 130 days (-21.7 +/- 4.7%) but not in fetuses less than 120 days. A significant decrease in filtration fraction (-19.2 +/- 6.5%) was observed in newborn lambs. No changes in urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin excretion rate were observed during ACE inhibition in any group of animals. ACE inhibition produced similar declines in blood pressure in both groups of fetuses (-10.2 +/- 3% in fetuses less than 120 days and -9.5 +/- 4.6% in fetuses greater than 130 days) and in newborn lambs (-13.4 +/- 2.1%). The percent changes in plasma renin activity were similar in all groups of animals. However, a significant decline in plasma aldosterone concentration was observed only in newborn lambs (from 130 +/- 31 to 64 +/- 9 pg/ml). These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system might have physiological significance during maturation, but that this role seems to be more important in near-term fetuses (greater than 130 days) and postnatally than early in gestation.", 
    "230": "Since one mechanism by which converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) increases renin is removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on the juxtaglomerular cell, we studied the time course of changes in active and inactive renin after CEI. After equilibration on a 25 meq/day sodium diet, captopril was given as a single 50-mg oral dose (acute phase), and then was administered as 50 mg every 6 h for 3 days to seven normal volunteers (chronic phase). In the acute phase, supine blood pressure fell 12 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.02). Active renin acutely increased 12.5 +/- 0.9 times the baseline value, peaking at 3-4 h. Inactive renin, measured by acid activation of trypsin activation, decreased in all subjects to 10% or less of control from 2 to as long as 6 h post-CEI and then returned to baseline levels by 8 h (P less than 0.01). With chronic CEI, active renin was elevated to 10.8 +/- 2.4 times the baseline level, and after 48 h inactive renin levels rose to 4.0 +/- 0.6 times the baseline (P less than 0.02). To determine whether the acute changes in inactive and active renin occurred because of captopril's effect on renin in the circulation or kidney, a single dose of captopril was administered to three subjects with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. In contrast to normal subjects, these patients had no change in active and inactive renin levels when given captopril, suggesting that changes observed in the normals were renal mediated rather than a plasma phenomenon. We conclude that CEI 1) acutely increases active renin while reciprocally reducing the inactive form, and 2) chronically increases both active and inactive renin. These studies support the hypothesis that inactive renin may be a precursor of circulating active renin.", 
    "231": "The nature of the clinical problem posed by hypertension has been changed fundamentally by 30 years of successful drug therapy. Cardiovascular pathology directly related to the high pressure is no longer the main problem. Complications of atheroma, particularly in the coronary arteries, are the main cause of hypertension-related deaths. Most patients now starting treatment have mild hypertension and the benefits, although significant, are small (two deaths prevented per 1000 patient-years of treatment). These two considerations dictate that new drugs must have a very low incidence of toxicity, a low incidence of symptomatic side effects, and preferably, a favorable effect on morbidity and mortality from ischemic heart disease. Several possible approaches have promise: 1) reduction of ischemic heart disease mortality by beta-adrenergic blockade; 2) use of calcium entry blocking drugs, which may combine vasodilation with antiarrhythmic effects; 3) non-thiol-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may have a particularly low incidence of side effects; 4) prostanoid derivatives that may combine vasodilatation with an antiplatelet action.", 
    "232": "Enalapril maleate (MK-421), an ethyl ester, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor from a novel series of substituted N-carboxymethyldipeptides. The parent diacid (MK-422) N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro of MK-421 inhibited hog plasma ACE with an I50 of 1.2 nM. Because deesterification occurs slowly or not at all in vitro, the in vitro I50 for enalapril was 1200 nM. However, both enalapril and MK-422 were potent inhibitors of ACE by the i.v. and oral routes in rats and dogs. In rats with experimental hypertension, enalapril was most potent in those models in which the renin-angiotensin system plays a dominant role (salt restriction, two-kidney Grollman) and in models rendered renin dependent by diuretics, although blood pressure reduction did occur in low or normal renin models such as spontaneously hypertensive rats, in which inhibition of ACE as measured by the blockade of angiotensin I pressor responses bore little temporal relationship to the later fall in blood pressure after enalapril.", 
    "233": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with saralasin or with SQ 20,881 was used to examine a possible interaction between endogenous angiotensin II and antidiuretic hormone in renal water excretion. In sodium-depleted anesthetized rats undergoing water diuresis, neither saralasin nor SQ 20,881 had any significant effect on water excretion. Both drugs, however, markedly potentiated the antidiuretic response to arginine vasopressin. A similarly enhanced antidiuresis was also observed when the renal response to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin was investigated in the presence or absence of saralasin. There were no significant changes in sodium or potassium excretion or in glomerular filtration rate in any of the groups studied. Neither was there any interaction of the drugs with relation to blood pressure. These results seem to indicate that endogenous angiotensin II is capable of antagonizing the hydroosmotic effect of antidiuretic hormone.", 
    "234": "The extent to which the vasopressor action of angiotensin II (AII) in birds depends upon the sympathetic nervous system in not known. Therefore, we have tested whether the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) mediates the residual vasopressor response to AII in adrenalectomized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) inhibited by up to 100% the pressor effect of exogenous AII in anesthetized adrenalectomized ducks. After high doses of AII, a transient drop in blood pressure (BP) often preceded or supplanted the pressor response. Systolic BP responses to injections of tyramine also were decreased by 6-OHDA, but responses to NE were increased (diastolic BP) or not affected significantly (systolic BP). Inhibition with SQ20881 of converting enzyme, to decrease endogenous production of AII, reduced pressor responses to AI, but did not affect either baseline BP or responses to AII. Thus, the diminished responsiveness to AII in these catecholamine-depleted ducks was not due to competition from endogeneous AII. Furthermore, the increases in plasma NE and E concentrations that normally follow AII injection were abolished by adrenalectomy and 6-OHDA treatment. The coincident extinction of both cathecholamine and vasopressor responses comprises new evidence that AII raises BP in the Pekin duck by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. The vasopressor response is mediated by extraadrenal as well as adrenal sources of NE.", 
    "235": "Role of neurohumoral factors in borderline hypertension was evaluated in comparison to those in established hypertension. Although there was no significant difference in urinary noradrenaline between the 2 groups, urinary adrenaline was significantly higher in borderline hypertension than in established hypertension. During head-up tilt and Schellong's test a significant increase of diastolic blood pressure was demonstrated in borderline hypertension, whereas a significant decrease of systolic blood pressure was observed without any significant change of diastolic pressure in established hypertension. There was no significant difference in blood pressure response to cold pressor test, plasma volume, total body potassium and plasma renin activity (PRA) between the 2 groups. Blood pressure did not change after administration of captopril in normal subjects but it decreased significantly after captopril in patients with borderline hypertension even when blood pressure became normotensive during hospitalization. Blood pressure decreased significantly after captopril in patients with established hypertension. However, no significant relationship between the pretreatment PRA and the reduction of mean blood pressure was observed in both groups. It can be concluded from the present study that borderline hypertension is intermediate between normal subjects and established hypertension and that both the renin-angiotensin system and the kinin-prostaglandin system play some role in the maintenance of blood pressure in borderline hypertension.", 
    "236": "Homogenous human angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) cleaves dipeptides from the C-terminus of substrates containing a free carboxyl group. In this study we demonstrate that peptides containing a C-terminal nitrobenzylamine are also cleaved by the enzyme. The hydrolysis of these substrates is inhibited by the specific converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and MK421 as well as by anti-converting enzyme antibody. Sodium chloride accelerates the rate of hydrolysis forty-fold. The product of the reaction, an amino acid nitrobenzylamide, was identified by thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that the carboxyl group is not an absolute requirement for substrate hydrolysis.", 
    "237": "Various agents that have been reported to reduce the enzymatic degradation of the enkephalins have been tested for their ability to potentiate the activity of [Met5]enkephalin in three in vitro assay tissues. The greatest effect was obtained with the combination of bestatin (10 microM or 30 microM), captopril (10 microM), thiorphan (0.3 microM) and L-Leucyl-L-leucine (2 mM) which increased the potency of [Met5]enkephalin 18-fold in the guinea-pig myenteric plexus, 13-fold in the mouse vas deferens and 200-fold in the rat vas deferens. The increased potency is attributed to inhibition of the peptidases since the mixture of inhibitors did not change the activity of either normorphine or the metabolically stable synthetic opioid peptides. The potencies of the hexa-, hepta- and octapeptide C-terminus extensions of [Met5]enkephalin and [Leu5]enkephalin were increased by the peptidase inhibitors in all three preparations; the greatest effects were found in the rat vas deferens. No significant changes in the potencies of fragments of beta-endorphin longer than beta-endorphin-(1-19) were obtained. It may now be possible to inhibit enzymatic degradation of opioid peptides sufficiently to measure their release from neurones activated by electrical field stimulation.", 
    "238": "Three experiments are described using new substrate analogue inhibitors of renin. The first experiment shows that introduction of a reduced isostere in the scissile peptide bond of an analogue greatly increases its ability to inhibit renin of a particular species. However, different species of renin substrate have different amino acids in their scissile bond and variation here also greatly influences the affinity of renin and substrate and hence of renin and substrate analogues. Finally, substitution of amino acids in the C-terminal adjacent to the scissile bond influences the affinity and efficacy of substrate analogues as inhibitors. In our second experiment a peptide inhibitor of dog renin, H.77, was used in an affinity column to produce a one-stage, 2000-fold, and complete purification of human renin. In our third experiment infusion of H.77 was used to lower circulating concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in conscious sodium-deplete dogs. Captopril was then given in addition to H.77 but blood pressure did not fall further, suggesting that captopril lowers blood pressure wholly or partly by reducing angiotensin II within the circulation and in extravascular sites.", 
    "239": "10 patients suffering from refractory heart failure were treated with an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The etiology of heart failure in 9 patients was related to ischemic heart disease, and to valvular heart disease in 1 patient. All patients experienced subjective improvement and feeling of well-being. The functional capacity improved to class II-IIB. Serial chest X-ray films showed improvement in pulmonary congestion. The time course of the hemodynamic effect appeared to 0.5-1.5 h after intake, and tended to disappear about 6 h later. The optimal dose of the drug achieving maximal hemodynamic benefit without excessive hypotension was 50 mg. Some of the patients exhibited a triphasic response. The cardiac index increased from 1.99 +/- 0.1 to 2.69 +/- 0.151/min/m (p less than 0.001), while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 25.3 +/- 5.86 to 13.67 +/- 4.14 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Mean peripheral arterial blood pressure decreased from 90.06 +/- 3.7 to 71.4 +/- 2.7 mm Hg. The total peripheral resistance decreased from 1,942 +/- 169 to 1,170 +/- 109 dyn X s X cm-5. The total pulmonary resistance decreased from 272.6 +/- 42.9 to 142.34 +/- 13.76 dyn X s X cm-5. Heart rate decreased from 83.4 +/- 10.9 to 70.8 +/- 10.14 bpm (p less than 0.01). During a 6-month follow-up period the beneficial clinical effects of captopril were sustained, without late vasodilator tolerance. 1 death, unrelated to captopril, occurred. 2 patients developed transient rash, and 1 experienced transient dysgeusia.", 
    "240": "Hemodynamic and hormonal responses to captopril were measured in 10 patients with severe chronic heart failure poorly controlled by digitalis and diuretics. After administration of a 25-mg dose, stroke volume (SV) increased from 53 +/- 7 to 63 +/- 9 ml (p less than 0.05), while pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The hemodynamic changes were associated with increases in plasma renin activity (PRA; p less than 0.05) and in plasma levels of a novel bicyclo-prostaglandin E2 metabolite (bicyclo-PGE-m; p less than 0.01), whereas norepinephrine (NE) showed a falling tendency. In general, basal hemodynamic and basal hormonal levels did not correlate. Captopril-induced changes in mean artery pressure (MAP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were positively correlated to pre-captopril PRA (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01; r = 0.64, p less than 0.05) and to changes in PRA (r = 0.85, p less than 0.01; r = 0.80, p less than 0.01) with a similar trend for angiotensin II (AII); decreases of systemic vascular resistance were more pronounced in patients with higher control NE levels (r = 0.62, p less than 0.05), the reduction of NE levels being highest in patients with higher basal concentrations (p less than 0.001); the captopril-induced decreases of mPAP and PWP were inversely related to basal bicyclo-PGE-m levels (r = 0.60, p less than 0.05; r = 0.61, p less than 0.05), and changes in mPAP were closely related to basal ratios of AII/bicyclo-PGE-m (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01). Thus, captopril exerts its acute beneficial hemodynamic effect by inhibiting the generation of AII, associated with toning down of sympathetic stimulation and increased production of vasodilating prostaglandins, such as PGE2. The relation between AII and PGE2-counteracting substances-might determine the hemodynamic response to captopril in the patients.", 
    "241": "Twenty-five patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to treatment with either captopril or atenolol. There were 15 males and 10 females and their mean age was 53 years, range 32-66 years. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced by atenolol 50-100 mg once daily. Captopril 25-50 mg 3 times daily caused a significant decrease in supine diastolic but not in systolic blood pressure. After the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg) to those who did not become normotensive (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg) on captopril or atenolol alone, blood pressure was further reduced. Captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced both supine and standing blood pressure by 31/17 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 33/18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) respectively. Atenolol combined with hydrochlorothiazide caused a significant decrease of both recumbent and standing blood pressure by 21/10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 23/13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05 systolic, p less than 0.001 diastolic). The reduction of systolic blood pressure was significantly better with the captopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, while there was no difference between the groups as regards diastolic blood pressure reduction. Thus, hydrochlorothiazide potentiates the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril more than of atenolol. This could be due to a synergistic interaction between captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "242": "Groups of 15 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were treated for 24 weeks with zinc sulphate, trien, captopril, clozic in two doses or a combination of D-penicillamine and hydroxychloroquine. Serum histidine levels were monitored along with measures of disease activity including C-reactive protein, plasma viscosity, articular index, grip strength and early morning stiffness. Zinc sulphate and trien were found to be ineffective while the other drugs all showed evidence of second-line action. Serum histidine was found to improve during successful therapy. The possible cause of low serum histidine and its response to therapy is discussed.", 
    "243": "Captopril was administered prior to renal vein renin sampling in an attempt to select patients amenable to surgical treatment for renin dependent hypertension. Renal venous blood for plasma renin activity was taken only after captopril stimulation. Sampling from the antecubital vein before and after this provocation showed a marked rise in renin, thereby confirming the efficacy of the test. Elimination of the initial selective renal vein sampling shortens the catheterization period without affecting the accuracy and dependability of the procedure.", 
    "244": "We investigated the effect of captopril on plasma norepinephrine concentration and blood pressure in two groups of hypertensive patients. One group consisted of five severely hypertensive patients rendered hypernoradrenergic by administration of a minoxidil-propranolol-diuretic regimen. The other group was ten untreated mildly hypertensive patients. Two hours after 12.5mg of captopril, blood pressure was lowered (p less than .05) in four of the five hypernoradrenergic patients from 180 +/- 8/102 +/- 8 to 132 +/- 7/77 +/- 8 mmHg. Chronic administration of 100-150mg of captopril tid caused no further blood pressure reduction. Precaptopril plasma norepinephrine concentration was 925 +/- 206 and two hours after the 12.5mg dose was 807 +/- 80 pg/ml. Three months later having advanced the dose to 300-450 mg/day it was lower (p less than .05) at 752 pg/ml. The acute blood pressure response correlated (r = -0.72, p less than .001) with the precaptopril plasma norepinephrine. Precaptopril blood pressure in the mild hypertensive patients was 146 +/- 4/98 +/- 1, after a 25-100mg dose it was 137 +/- 6/91 +/- 2 (diastolic p less than .05) and at two months with the same captopril dose bid it was 141 +/- 8/88 +/- 4 mmHg (diastolic p less than .01). Corresponding initial PNE was 425 +/- 72, two hours after captopril 405 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 63 pg/ml (p less than .05) with chronic administration. Thus, captopril lowers blood pressure in both hypernoradrenergic and eunoradrenergic hypertensive patients without increasing plasma norepinephrine suggesting some unique dampening effect of this drug on the sympathetic nervous system. Also, addition of captopril to triple therapy lowered blood pressure in proportion to plasma norepinephrine levels suggesting importance to its action on this sympathetic nervous system effector.", 
    "245": "It was examined what mechanism involved in an increase of met-enkephalin (met-EK)-like peptide content in the pulp induced by noxious stimuli. The increased content of the peptides by cavity formation as noxious stimulation was not influenced by cycloheximide, but attenuated by FOY-305 [N,N-dimethyl carbamoyl-methyl 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenyl acetate methanesulfonate], a trypsin-like enzyme inhibitor, and enhanced by captopril, and attenuated by infusion of saline in the pulp cavity. From these results, it was suggested that noxious stimuli on the pulp led to activation of trypsin-like enzymes followed by an increased content of met-EK-like peptides, and thereafter, the peptides, such as met-EK, might be degraded by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study demonstrated that met-EK-like immunoreactivity (met-EK-IR) of cells in the rat incisor pulp was clearly increased following tryptic digestion of the pulp section, supporting a suggestion mentioned above.", 
    "246": "We evaluated nine captopril-treated patients with transplant renal artery stenosis. Captopril treatment always resulted in a dramatic decrease in renal function; in two patients complete anuria developed. Only in two patients with a stenosis in one out of two renal arteries was a satisfactory fall in blood pressure achieved. The mechanisms which may lead to these remarkable results will be discussed.", 
    "247": "The mechanism of captopril-induced alterations in arterial pressure (AP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) was studied in pentobarbital anesthetized sodium-restricted dogs. In 7 dogs, captopril caused decreases in AP (16 +/- 3%) and RVR (46 +/- 5%), as well as increases in RBF (62 +/- 12%) and sodium excretion (399 +/- 73%). These responses were reversed by angiotensin II infusion at a rate sufficient to restore RBF to control levels. The captopril-induced increase in GFR (29 +/- 8%) was partially reversed by the intravenous angiotensin II infusion to a level not significantly different from control. In 5 dogs, indomethacin increased AP (10 +/- 2%) and RVR (38 +/- 8%); the slight decreases in RBF and GFR were not statistically significant. Subsequent captopril treatment decreased AP (20 +/- 3%) and RVR (42 +/- 4%), while RBF and GFR increased by 45 +/- 8% and 32 +/- 10%, respectively. These observations suggest that the renal response to captopril in sodium-restricted dogs is not dependent upon alterations in prostaglandin synthesis but, instead, is primarily due to diminished angiotensin II activity.", 
    "248": "The vascular effects of the injection of angiotensin I (AI), des-Asp1-angiotensin I (des-Asp1-AI), angiotensin II (AII), des-Asp1-angiotensin II ( (2-8)AII) and des-Asp1-Arg2-angiotensin II ( (3-8)AII) have been investigated in an isolated perfused rat kidney model, using a closed circuit system. The apparent half-life of these peptides was measured by AI and AII radioimmunoassays. Des-Asp1-AI is less potent than AI and has a shorter duration of action on perfusion pressure and renal flow. Up to 7.6% of circulating AI and 12.4% of circulating des-Asp1-AI are converted by the kidney to AII, (2-8)AII and other AII immunoreactive materials. This intrarenal conversion entirely explains the vasoconstrictor effects of these two peptides. The vasoconstrictor effects of (2-8)AII is similar to that of AII, but (2-8)AII has a shorter duration of action. At the doses injected, renin secretion is completely inhibited by AII and (2-8)AII, it is partially inhibited by AI, an effect which disappears when converting enzyme is inhibited. Des-Asp1-AI is a less potent inhibitor of renin secretion than AI, and (3-8)AII is devoid of any action on renin secretion. The apparent half-life of AI is 24.3 +/- 1.1 minutes, des-Asp1-AI: 20 to 23 minutes, AII: 19.6 +/- 1.8 minutes, (2-8)AII: 12 to 14.5 minutes and (3-8)AII: 12.5 to 13.5 minutes. Differences in the metabolism of these peptides may contribute to the differences of magnitude and duration of their vascular effects.", 
    "249": "Several interventions known to alter plasma renin substrate in rats such as nephrectomy (NX), adrenalectomy (ADX) and glucocorticoid treatment changed the angiotensinogen content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the same direction. However, peripheral and central angiotensinogen could be dissociated from each other by ADX and NX in combination, as well as by chronic converting enzyme blockade. The regulation of brain angiotensinogen was further investigated in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-sp) in comparison with normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. The angiotensinogen levels of the anterior hypothalamus and of the septal area showed strain and age-related differences. Chronic converting enzyme blockade, which kept SHR-sp normotensive, stimulated angiotensinogen in the anterior hypothalamus of both SHR-sp and WKY rats, but suppressed plasma renin substrate. A specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for renin substrate of rat plasma also recognized the CSF angiotensinogen, and a linear correlation existed between direct and indirect measurements. In conclusion, angiotensinogen in the central nervous system appears to be immunologically similar to plasma angiotensinogen. Its regulation is not directly related, however, to circulating renin substrate, although adrenal steroids stimulate both central and peripheral angiotensinogen. A differential regulation of angiotensinogen in the brain of SHR-sp as compared to WKY is evident and could be linked to blood pressure control.", 
    "250": "Captopril was used in 21 patients with various forms of stable and malignant hypertension. In symptomatic hypertension the drug had a good antihypertensive effect. When applied in patients with essential hypertension caused by chronic diffuse glomerulonephritis or chronic pyelonephritis captopril neither increased pathological changes in the urine, nor inhibited renal function.", 
    "251": "The value of the orally active converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in managing hypertensive crisis was tested in 9 untreated patients admitted to the emergency room, who were in need of rapid blood pressure reduction because of signs and symptoms of neurological and/or cardiac complications. During the 30 min following administration of captopril 25 mg the blood pressure decreased from 239/134 +/- 12/4 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) to 204/118 +/- 8/4 mmHg (p less than 0.05). From that time on, captopril 200 to 300 mg/day was continued for 2 to 5 days. In 5 patients furosemide in a total dose of 40 to 160 mg i.v. or p.o. had also to be given in order to control the blood pressure. 12 and 24 h after admission blood pressure averaged 140/93 and 139/86 mmHg respectively, in the patients treated with captopril alone, and 166/107 and 153/91 mmHg in those treated both with captopril and furosemide. The pronounced fall in blood pressure produced by blockade of the renin system was well tolerated and did not cause tachycardia. It appears, therefore, that captopril given alone or in association with a diuretic makes it possible to treat the hypertensive crisis without the need for monitoring in an intensive care unit.", 
    "252": "The authors report three cases of Captopril induced lichenoid eruption, already unmentionned, as far as they know. This cutaneous adverse reaction seemed to be dose related. Late onset was possible, even after six months of therapy. Violaceous papules or plaques were localized (two cases) or disseminated (one case) on the skin. The oral cavity was spared, but mucous membrane may be involved (localisation on the glans penis in one case). Histopathology was suggestive of lichen, but cellular dermal infiltrate was rather sparse. Immunofluorescent study in one case showed anti-IgM and C4 deposits on dermal colloid bodies. Captopril withdrawal was followed by improvement. Reviewing the literature, the authors are questionning about the fact that chemical structures of Penicillamine, Pyritinol and Captopril are strikingly similar and perhaps causative.", 
    "253": "The diagnosis of primary tumoral hyperaldosteronism is based on a series of hormonal parameters, measured under resting conditions and after stimulation. The results of the administration of a single dose of a converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril (1 mg/kg body weight per os), can support this diagnosis. In contrast to essential hypertension and hyperaldosteronism due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, plasma aldosterone levels remain unchanged in tumoral hyperaldosteronism after administrating Captopril. This is a simple test which can be performed in a morning which clearly differentiated 8 cases of primary tumoral hyperaldosteronism from 6 cases of adrenal hyperplasia.", 
    "254": "Plasma aldosterone levels were measured during two tests of inhibition in 31 hypertensive patients (13 essential hypertension, 6 bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and 12 documented Conn adenomas) on normal salt diets after withdrawal of all therapy: 1--before and after intravenous infusion of 2 I normal saline in two hours; 2--before and three hours after administration of 1 mg/kg of Captopril. Plasma aldosterone levels greater than 360 pmol/I after salt loading, or greater than 748 pmol/I after Captopril is characteristic of primary tumoral hyperaldosteronism. Apart from the rapidity of the test, Captopril is well-tolerated, does not require acute volume expansion and can be carried out in all forms of hypertension, even in severe cases.", 
    "255": "We report 5 cases of acute reversible renal failure coinciding with the onset of treatment with captopril in patients with severe drug-resistant hypertension. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for an immunologic or toxic insult, although in 1 patient we found a transient leukocyturia and mild proteinuria. A mere hypoperfusion of the kidney does not seem sufficient to account for all 5 observations: in 3 of them changes in blood pressure did not parallel changes in renal function. We propose that, in addition to hyperperfusion, captopril alters renal function by an additional intrarenal hemodynamic effect. The 5 patients had severe renovascular disease which might thus represent a significant risk factor in the development of captopril-induced acute renal failure.", 
    "256": "We have investigated 36 patients with accelerated or malignant hypertension (diastolic greater than 130 mm Hg and fundi at stage III or IV). The acute administration of Captopril 50 mg per os decreases the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 20 p. cent during the 3 following hours. 30 patients have been treated from 1 to 9 months with Captopril (mean daily dose during first month = 212 mg) associated with Furosemide (mean daily dose = 80 mg) +/- beta blockers (11/30). The mean blood pressure in supine position under heavy conventional treatment was 205/121 mm Hg just before starting Captopril and was reduced to 156/90 mm Hg at the end of the first month of treatment. We observed a clear cut regression of fundi stages (III-IV to I-II) and cardiac or cerebral involvement, and a clearcut stabilization of the rapidly progressive chronic renal failure.", 
    "257": "A case of postpartum renal failure and malignant hypertension in a 24-year-old woman is reported. The condition occurred three weeks after caesarian section following a normotensive pregnancy. Treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, for one year normalized the blood pressure, with concurrent reduction of plasma angiotension II concentration and markedly improved glomerular filtration rate. It is suggested that activation of the renin-angiotensin system may cause the hypertension and impairment of renal function in postpartum renal failure, and that use of drugs blocking the renin system may be of particular clinical value in this situation.", 
    "258": "Idiopathic edema is a condition characterized by diurnal weight gain and intermittent swelling, affecting adult females without evidence of any other condition known to cause sodium retention. It has been suggested that an alteration in the aldosterone response to upright posture plays a pathogenetic role in orthostatic sodium and water retention peculiar to this syndrome. To test this hypothesis, the effect of captopril was evaluated in 4 women with idiopathic edema. The therapeutic response was impressive in all. In summary, we noted a remarkable decrease in morning to evening weight difference, an increase in both diuresis and natriuresis, and a definite symptomatic improvement. It is therefore possible to speculate that captopril, by reversing the basic abnormality acting in idiopathic edema, may prove of benefit in most patients with this peculiar syndrome.", 
    "259": "The renin-dependent hypertension of uraemic patients on regular dialysis treatment (RDT), resistant to conventional therapy, is a major problem. In these cases, bilateral nephrectomy is effective but carries operative risks and also the possibility of worsening the patients' anaemia. Five uraemic patients on RDT, with severe renin-dependent hypertension resistant to medical therapy were treated with the oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril for 3 to 6 months and the effects of the drug were studied. The pretreatment blood pressure was lowered from 227 +/- 5.7/127 +/- 4.47 mmHg to 146 +/- 13.42/86 +/- 4.18 mmHg within a month of treatment with captopril and that result was maintained throughout the study. A transient loss of taste was seen in two cases, but no other serious side effects of the drug were observed. In conclusion, captopril is a very effective drug in treating the severe renin-dependent hypertensive uraemic patients on RDT.", 
    "260": "Acute and chronic effects of captopril (C) were studied in 14 patients (12 males, 2 females; mean age 56 +/- 15 years) with chronic congestive heart failure (CCHF) refractory to digitalis and diuretics. All patients underwent hemodynamic evaluation before and after increasing doses of C (6.25-100 mg). Nine patients were evaluated during long term therapy by means of clinical examination, exercise testing, chest-X-ray and echocardiography. After C the following acute haemodynamic changes were observed. Mean right atrial pressure: -25% (p less than 0.01), left ventricular filling pressure: -22% (p less than 0.01), mean systemic arterial pressure: -15% (p less than 0.01), systemic vascular resistance: -31% (p less than 0.01), cardiac index: +36% (p less than 0.01). Of the 9 patients who were evaluated during long term C treatment, 7 (group A, mean follow up 6.4 +/- 4.2 months) improved in 1 or 2 NYHA functional classes and showed an increased exercise tolerance during the first 3-6 months of therapy. In this period, however, two sudden deaths and one drop-out were observed. Moreover, after the seventh month two patients of this group deteriorated clinically. Two patients (group B) developed a progressively weight gain during the first 15 days of C treatment. In the majority of our patients with refractory CCHF, captopril improves cardiac performance in the acute phase and in the first 3-6 months of therapy. Controlled studies and longer follow up are needed to understand better the long term effects of C in CCHF patients.", 
    "261": "A case of necrotizing blepharitis due to a side-effect of captopril medication is described. Blepharitis was the first clinical sign of drug-induced agranulocytosis. The history of drug intake as part of the anamnesis was the most important diagnostic tool for the ophthalmologist since the course of agranulocytotic blepharitis depends on the elimination of the drug.", 
    "262": "The effects on blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and the kallikrein-kinin systems were investigated in 32 patients with primary hypertension WHO stage I-II treated with captopril. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if needed to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg. A placebo control group (n=8) was treated similarly. Supine mean arterial pressure fell from 133 +/- 10 on placebo to 114 +/- 12 mmHg after 4 weeks on captopril. At the same time plasma aldosterone decreased from 263 +/- 188 to 164 +/- 101 pmol . 1(-1), 24 h urinary excretion of aldosterone from 18 +/- 12 to 12 +/- 10 nmol and kallikrein from 9.0 +/- 6.7 to 6.2 +/- 4.1 nkat. Plasma angiotensin II was significantly reduced after two weeks treatment from 23.2 +/- 8.6 to 17.0 +/- 6.7 pmol . 1(-1). Before, but not during captopril, 24 h urinary kallikrein excretion correlated with plasma aldosterone levels and 24 h urinary aldosterone excretion (r=0.44 p, less than 0.05 and r=0.53, p less than 0.01, respectively). Mean arterial pressure reduction on captopril correlated with pretreatment PRA (r=0.44, p less than 0.05) but not with other measured hormone levels or changes therein. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide caused a further fall in blood pressure, but increased plasma aldosterone and 24 h urinary kallikrein excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide alone increased only 24 h urinary aldosterone excretion significantly. These findings indicate that, besides aldosterone secretion and renal arterial pressure, further mechanisms regulating the release of and activity of the renal kallikrein-kinin system exist.", 
    "263": "The postural hypotensive (PH) response to various antihypertensive agents was examined as an independent pharmacologic activity in conscious normotensive rats. Full PH dose-response curves for standard antihypertensive drugs were explored and were compared to their hypotensive dose-response curves. In untreated control rats, only a negligible change in blood pressure occurred in response to a 2 min 90 degrees head-up tilt. However, treatment with an agent acting on the nervous system, pentolinium, resulted in a profound and dose-dependent drop of blood pressure in response to tilt. A comparable hypotensive effect was also induced. Alpha blockers (e.g., prazosin) induced only moderate dose-dependent PH effects while producing profound hypotensive effects. Direct vasodilators (e.g., minoxidil), calcium antagonists (e.g., nifedipine) and a converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were virtually free of PH effects despite moderate or profound hypotensive effects. Clonidine exhibited greater PH than hypotensive effects. Propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not exhibit PH effects and did not lower blood pressure. With the exception of clonidine, these findings are generally in agreement with human data. It is suggested that the normotensive rat may be a useful model for gaining an insight into a drug's potential for producing postural hypotension in man and that the full PH dose-response curve should be explored.", 
    "264": "3 patients with Bartter's syndrome were studied under metabolic ward conditions before and during administration of captopril 25 mg t.i.d. The drug induced an immediate and sustained reduction of blood pressure (by 14 and 18% after 1 h and 3 days, respectively) with no change in heart rate. During treatment renal plasma flow increased by 29%, but the glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. Renal vascular resistance decreased by 41%. There was an increase in urinary sodium excretion with a corresponding reduction of body weight. The potassium balance was not affected. The concentration of angiotensin II became normal but the plasma renin concentration rose tenfold. Plasma renin substrate, initially rather low, was further reduced. The blood pressure responsiveness to angiotensin II increased without being completely normalized. An abnormal production of vasodilating prostaglandins is thought to be an important feature of Bartter's syndrome. Our findings, notably the marked renal vasodilatation, may reflect the effect of these prostaglandins when unopposed by an increased angiotensin II production.", 
    "265": "To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertension due to coarctation of the aorta (COA), upright mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (Aldo) were determined before and 90 minutes after a single oral dose of captopril (25 mg) in eight patients with COA and in fourteen with essential hypertension (EH). There was no significant difference in MAP, PRA or Aldo values between the two groups in baseline conditions. After captopril administration, MAP and Aldo decreased significantly in both groups (p less than 0.01), whereas PRA showed a marked increase in patients with COA (p less than 0.001) and no significant changes in EH patients (from 1.5 +/- 2.2 to 49.7 +/- 9.8 and from 5.6 +/- 0.9 to 8 +/- 1.5 ng/ml/3h respectively).", 
    "266": "1) MAP reduction and marked renin increase after captopril in COA patients support the view that systemic hypertension in COA is, at least in part, renin mediated and 2) the evaluation of PRA after captopril could be helpful in the decision to proceed with more invasive procedures in patients with suspicious clinical features of COA or with residual post-coarctectomy hypertension.", 
    "267": "The changes in active and inactive renin after oral administration of captopril (SQ 14225) were studied in 29 hypertensive patients. Inactive renin was calculated as plasma renin activity (PRA) after cold storage (total renin) minus PRA before cold storage (active renin). The patients were divided into 2 groups, responders and non-responders, according to the response of active renin to captopril. In 9 responders, the active renin increased markedly, while the inactive renin decreased. On the other hand, in 20 non-responders, both renin activities increased only slightly. Total renin increased markedly in responders; it increased in much smaller degree but significantly in non-responders. These data suggest that captopril promotes the conversion of inactive renin to active one and augments the renin release as a whole.", 
    "268": "Head-up tilt is associated with rapid increases in total peripheral and renal resistance and falls in the urinary excretion of water and sodium. The influence of the acute oral administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg) on the consequences 60 degrees head-up tilt were assessed in 6 normal subjects on unrestricted sodium intake. Captopril did not modify the responses of arterial pressure and heart rate to tilt, although a significant decrease in supine mean arterial pressure was induced by captopril. In addition, the agent blunted by 50-60% all the changes in renal hemodynamics and urinary excretion of water and electrolytes except for that of the fractional excretion of sodium. Urinary kallikrein activity which markedly fell and plasma aldosterone concentration which increased during tilt before captopril were not affected after administration of the drug. These studies indicate that angiotensin might mediate at least in part the renal hemodynamic and functional responses to tilt in normal man and is the primary determinant of the aldosterone stimulating effect of tilt.", 
    "269": "In a double-blind cross-over trial 15 captopril (daily dose 600 mg) treated patients, received in addition to the converting-enzyme inhibitor, placebo or bendrofluazide (7.5 mg). Bendrofluazide lowered blood pressure, while body weight decreased slightly. During captopril-bendrofluazide treatment, the plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, while no effect on the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha was found.", 
    "270": "Vasodilator therapy is useful adjunctive therapy in the management of both acute and chronic heart failure. Arteriolar dilators, such as hydralazine, increase cardiac output by decreasing the elevated peripheral vascular resistance that occurs in heart failure. Venodilators, such as nitrates, decrease ventricular filling pressures by redistributing blood so that more is pooled in peripheral veins. Vasodilators that produce both effects (nitro-prusside, prazosin, captopril, for example) are usually helpful in short-term improvement of hemodynamics. Long-term treatment with nonparenteral vasodilators often reduces symptoms and increases exercise tolerance, although there is inconclusive evidence regarding the effects of these agents on mortality. In acute myocardial infarction, intravenous vasodilators frequently improve cardiac performance. Evidence regarding their beneficial effects on infarct size and immediate mortality is encouraging but inconclusive. There is little evidence that they prolong life in patients who survive cardiogenic shock and leave the hospital. Thus, vasodilators can improve hemodynamics and lessen symptoms, but more evidence is needed regarding their long-term effects on survival.", 
    "271": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was given to 19 patients with severe heart failure. Seven patients had acute myocardial infarction and the remainder had chronic myocardial damage caused by ischaemia or valvular disease. Cardiac filling pressures were raised in all, the pulmonary capillary \"wedge\" pressure being 17 mmHg or more. Captopril, 50 mg orally, raised stroke volume and cardiac output, and reduced heart rate, cardiac filling pressures, systemic arterial pressure, and the plasma concentrations of aldosterone and noradrenaline. These changes were attended by clinical improvement. Decrements in cardiac filling pressures, systemic arterial pressure, and total peripheral resistance were positively correlated with pretreatment plasma renin. Long-term treatment with captopril was offered to 14 patients. Four patients with severe coronary disease died suddenly after initial clinical improvement. In nine patients haemodynamic measurements were repeated after three months. The results showed sustained effects on cardiac output and filling pressures but there was no loss of body weight. The haemodynamic effects were at least as good as with previous vasodilators. The fall in systemic arterial pressure, however, was greater with captopril. Captopril may become a valuable adjunct to the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, but more information about its effect on coronary blood flow is required.", 
    "272": "The hemodynamic effects of oral captopril and intravenous nitroprusside were compared in 15 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. At doses of both drugs titrated so as to produce similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance in each patient, nitroprusside produced substantially greater increases in cardiac index (+0.67 versus +0.31 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.01) but smaller decreases in mean arterial pressure (-18.4 versus -11.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than did captopril. This finding was due to a significant decrease in heart rate with captopril (-7 beats/min, p less than 0.01) which was not seen with nitroprusside, since changes in stroke volume index with both drugs were similar. Nitroprusside produced a decrease in pulmonary arteriolar resistance quantitatively similar to the decrease in systemic vascular resistance, but the decrease in pulmonary arteriolar resistance with captopril was not significant. Despite similar decreases in systemic resistance, captopril produced a greater decrease in left ventricular filling pressure (-10.2 versus -6.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but a smaller decrease in mean right atrial pressure (-3.1 versus -5.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than did nitroprusside. Thus, captopril has actions independent of its systemic vasodilator effects which account for the quantitative differences observed in its hemodynamic responses compared with those of nitroprusside in patients with severe chronic heart failure. These differences support experimental evidence that angiotensin, in addition to its direct systemic arterial vasoconstrictor actions, exerts positive chronotropic effects and alters ventricular compliance but has minimal direct effects on the limb venous circulation and on the pulmonary vasculature.", 
    "273": "Hemodynamic variables were measured and plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone, and bradykinin assays performed in 21 hypertensive men on regular diet and thiazide diuretics before and 60 to 90 minutes after 25 mg oral captopril. Heart rate, right and left ventricular filling pressures, mean cardiac index (CI), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remained unchanged. The mean intra-arterial pressure (MAP) fell from 140 +/- 5 to 116 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) correlating with reduction of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001), control PRA (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01), and All levels (r = 0.72, p less than 0.005) but not with control bradykinin or its postcaptopril rise (p less than 0.01). The fall in SVR correlated with reduction in plasma All (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and aldosterone concentrations (r = 0.53, p less than 0.05). Of four patients (19%) with precipitous fall in MAP after captopril, three needed volume expansion for circulatory support. We conclude: (1) All reduction by captpril and not bradykinin potentiation explains most of the agent's hemodynamic response in hypertensive circulation, (2) endogenous All may have a supportive role for SVR and possibly for CI but not for PVR, and (3) extra precaution is warranted while captopril is being started in patients taking diuretics.", 
    "274": "Captopril (Capoten) and minoxidil (Loniten) have recently become generally available for treatment of hypertension, and calcium channel blockers, although not yet officially approved for this indication, clearly have potential as antihypertensive agents. Captopril, the only available inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is particularly effective in patients with severe, high-renin hypertension. Minoxidil, a potent direct-acting vasodilator, is particularly effective in severely hypertensive patients with concomitant renal insufficiency. Because serious side effects have been noted with both drugs, their use probably should not be considered until other agents have failed. Of the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine (Procardia) seems to have greatest promise as an antihypertensive agent.", 
    "275": "Seven women with primary pulmonary hypertension underwent hemodynamic evaluation, at rest and during exercise, before and after the oral administration of captopril. Dose-response curves were generated for the 25-, 50- and 100-mg doses. Captopril significantly reduced systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance; these effects persisted at submaximal levels of exercise. Captopril did not alter pulmonary artery pressure or resistance, cardiac output or stroke volume at rest or during exercise. Exercise tolerance did not improve. Four of the patients also received captopril chronically for 12 weeks at doses of 75 and 100 mg every 8 hours. Resting and exercise hemodynamic evaluation was repeated at the end of the 12-week period. Except for a persistent reduction in mean systemic blood pressure at rest, chronic captopril administration did not elicit hemodynamic changes. Measured exercise duration did not change during continuous captopril treatment, although one patient reported mild subjective improvement in activity tolerance. In primary pulmonary hypertension, captopril exerts its major effect on systemic vasculature, with little or no effect on the pulmonary circuit. While an occasional patient may experience some clinical improvement with captopril therapy, the majority of adult patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension will not benefit from its chronic administration.", 
    "276": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors represent a new class of agents which were designed to retain only that unique property. Because of this inhibition, administration of these agents results in the significant reduction of elevated blood pressure of various etiologies and in the amelioration of symptoms associated with congestive heart failure resistant to digitalis glycosides and diuretics. The mechanism(s) of action is not entirely certain but almost certainly resides in the inhibition of ACE. Certainly, the future will see still further advances made in this therapeutic area as well as with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "277": "Three distinct peptidyldipeptidases (exopeptidases releasing carboxyl terminal dipeptide residues) can be solubilized from nerve terminal membrane fractions from whole rat brain or striatum, and separated by ion exchange chromatography. Brain angiotensin-converting enzyme (PDP-1) cleaves Hip-His-Leu, but not 80 nM [3H-Tyr1, Leu5]-enkephalin, and is markedly inhibited by several specific inhibitors such as captopril, teprotide, and MK-422. Enkephalinase (PDP-2) cleaves 80 nM [3H-Tyr1, Leu5]-enkephalin, but not Hip-His-Leu; it is not inhibited by any of the standard competitive inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (all analogs of carboxyl-terminal peptide sequences Phe-Ala-Pro or Ala-Pro), but is strongly inhibited by captopril analogs such as thiorphan (Phe-Gly analog). A third peptidyldipeptidase (PDP-3) cleaves Hip-His-Leu, but not 80 nM [3H-Tyr1, Leu5]-enkephalin; it is inhibited by dipeptide analog inhibitors such as captopril and thiorphan, but not by longer peptides such as teprotide or tripeptide analog inhibitors such as MK-422. Both PDP-2 (enkephalinase) and PDP-3 are apparently present in nerve terminal membranes predominantly as inactive proenzyme precursors, which elute from DEAE-cellulose at high salt concentration, and are activated very slowly by a process involving one or more trypsin-like enzymes. Rechromatography of activated PDP-2 and PDP-3 achieves a nearly complete separation of the two enzymes, both markedly purified, since each is much less acidic than its proenzyme precursor. Purified enkephalinase does not appear to have any significant endopeptidase activity. It cleaves Hip-Phe-Arg 200 times more effectively than Hip-Phe-Arg-NH2, and appears to be quite selective for cleaving the terminal dipeptide residue, Phe-Arg, from bradykinin, with no release of the second dipeptide and no cleavage of the Gly4-Phe5 interior peptide bond.", 
    "278": "Over fifty mercaptopropanoyl amino acids and related derivatives were synthesized to define the steric, electronic and stereochemical requirements for binding to the active site of enkephalinase (ENKASE), and also for their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In this way the character of ENKASE and ACE active sites were compared.", 
    "279": "The effects of captopril and propranolol on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline, renin and aldosterone, and on the responses to changes in posture and to isometric exercise were measured in patients with essential hypertension. During placebo administration blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline rose on standing and during isometric exercise. The rise in diastolic blood pressure during isometric exercise correlated significantly with the rise in plasma noradrenaline. During captopril treatment blood pressure was significantly lower than during placebo administration when the patients were lying, standing or sitting, but the reduction during isometric exercise was not significant. Plasma renin increased, but heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and plasma aldosterone remained unchanged. The acute changes in blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline produced by standing and isometric exercise during captopril treatment were similar to those during placebo administration. During propranolol treatment diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower than during placebo administration when the patients were lying, standing or sitting and during isometric exercise. Heart rate also fell. Plasma noradrenaline during standing, sitting and isometric exercise was significantly greater than during placebo administration. The changes in plasma noradrenaline measured during propranolol treatment with the patients supine were negatively correlated with noradrenaline values obtained during placebo administration: plasma noradrenaline fell in patients with higher, and increased in those with lower, initial concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "280": "The effects of enalapril were assessed in a double-blind study versus propranolol. Twenty-two patients with essential hypertension were titrated with either enalapril (5, 10 and 20 mg twice daily) or propranolol (40, 80 and 120 mg twice daily). With propranolol blood pressure decreased from 154/101 +/- 4/1 to 146/98 +/- 5/2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM); with enalapril it decreased from 151/103 +/- 3/1 to 134/92 +/- 4/2 mmHg, both after 12 weeks of therapy. Effective renal plasma flow remained unchanged in the propranolol group whereas it increased from 413 +/- 19 to 445 +/- 27 ml/min (p less than 0.05) with enalapril. Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged at either medication. Enalapril is an effective anti-hypertensive agent with a favourable effect on renal haemodynamics.", 
    "281": "A permeability-increasing pentapeptide, termed peptide 6A, derived from plasmin-degraded human fibrinogen and known to potentiate the increase in microvascular permeability caused by bradykinin was investigated concerning its angiotensin converting enzyme (A.C.E.) related effects. When applied to a rat skin model together with a specific inhibitor of this enzyme, peptide 6A showed a potentiated effect after 30 min. but not after 5 min. The same was also true for bradykinin. These findings suggest that the degradation rate of these peptides is decreased with resulting prolongation of the period of leakage, when the action of A.C.E. is opposed. It is deduced that peptide 6A may act as a partial antagonist of this enzyme in the rat skin model. Addition of peptide 6A to a mixture of bradykinin together with inhibitors of the enzymes degrading bradykinin before application to the rat skin, significantly augmented the extravasation of 125I-albumin. These findings are consistent with data indicating that peptide 6A is a prostacyclin-releaser able to induce vasodilation. This effect of peptide 6A on the microcirculation seems to be separate from its angiotensin converting enzyme-related effects.", 
    "282": "Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) are efficient antihypertensive medications. The acute and chronic effects of captopril (SQ) on renal function and electrolyte balance are analyzed in the present paper. Acute administration of SQ was associated with renal vasodilatation in the patients with essential hypertension (EH) but had no effect in normal subjects with similar renin levels thus suggesting an enhanced renal vascular response to CEI in EH. A variable effect of CEI on renal function was observed in renovascular hypertension; GFR fell when blood pressure decreased by more than 25 mmHg. Three cases of striking recovery of GFR during chronic SQ in young patients with malignant nephrosclerosis maintained on hemodialysis are reported. Such an improvement in GFR never occurred in patients with primary renal disease. When systemic and renal responses to acute isotonic saline loading were assessed, captopril blunted the exaggerated natriuretic response to saline loading observed in EH and unmasked the volume-dependence of arterial pressure. A case of hyperkalemia during treatment with SQ is reported in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis who developed moderate renal failure during treatment. This was associated with high plasma aldosterone whilst fractional excretion of K+ was inappropriately low for the level of serum creatinine thus suggesting that tubular unresponsiveness to aldosterone may have developed during SQ.", 
    "283": "Captopril, given for 5 days to normotensive healthy subjects caused a significant fall in blood pressure. The fall in mean supine blood pressure was greater on a low sodium diet (10 mmols/day) - 19.6% and was less on a high sodium diet (350 mmols/day) - 11% compared to the normal sodium intake (120 mmols/day) when the fall in blood pressure was 16.5%. Patients with essential hypertension who were studied on their normal diet had a similar fall in blood pressure for a given plasma renin activity. It seems likely that the predominant mechanism whereby captopril lowers blood pressure is through the inhibition of the formation of angiotensin II. If this is so, our results suggest that the renin system is an important control of both normal and high blood pressure when on a normal sodium intake.", 
    "284": "Chronic blockade of the renin angiotensin system became possible when orally active inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, the enzyme which catalyzes the transformation of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, were synthetized. Two compounds, captopril and enalapril, have been investigated in clinical studies. The decrease of the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I and of the circulating levels of angiotensin II following administration of these inhibitors has been demonstrated to be directly related to the degree of suppression of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. These inhibitors have been shown to normalize blood pressure alone in some hypertensive patients whereas in many others, satisfactory blood pressure control can be achieved only after the addition of a diuretic. Captopril and enalapril also markedly improve cardiac function of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Chronic blockade of the renin angiotensin system has therefore provided an interesting new approach to the treatment of clinical hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "285": "The antihypertensive mechanism of CEI cannot be solely explained by an inhibition of the plasma RAS with reduced vasoconstrictor action of circulating ANG II. Inhibition of Kininase II with an increase of endogenous bradykinin does not appear to play a major role. Within the dose range used therapeutically, captopril and other CEI inhibit the facilitatory action of ANG II on neurogenic vasoconstriction, leading to a reduced sympathetic tone. CEI may also interfere with sympathetic reflexes. Doses above the therapeutic range seem to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system through mechanisms unrelated to CE inhibition. A reduced local generation of ANG II within tissues such as vascular wall, kidney or brain appears to contribute sympathetic tone. The type of hypertension (e.g. with or without stimulated plasma RAS or sympathetic tone) and the chemical characteristics of the CEI used (e.g. lipid solubility governing penetration into tissues) may determine the relative importance of the different mechanisms and sites of action for the reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "286": "The inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), captopril and enalapril, were found to increase ACE concentration in cultured human endothelial cells from cord artery as measured with a novel ACE assay employing MK 351A, an inhibitor of ACE, and with immunofluorescense labeling using anti-human lung ACE antibody. Dexamethasone (10 nM) also increased ACE and potentiated the increase of cellular ACE caused by captopril. Similar effects of ACE inhibitors were seen in cultured human macrophages, particularly after prestimulation with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. In Wistar Kyoto rats, captopril caused a 3-fold increase of serum ACE, while dexamethasone (40 ug/day, 14 days) did not increase serum ACE. Combined treatment with captopril and dexamethasone caused a 5-fold increase of ACE in purified lung plasma membranes. ACE inhibitors induce increased ACE biosynthesis in endothelial cells, and in macrophages. The rise of cellular ACE with ACE inhibitors is potentiated by glucocorticoid.", 
    "287": "Evidence has accumulated that systemic administration of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) such as captopril, MK 421 or SA 446 not only produces an inhibition of the plasma renin angiotensin system (RAS), but also of the RAS in various target organs which are relevant for blood pressure (BP) regulation. A potential target organ is the brain, where a local CE inhibition could contribute to the BP lowering action of CEI. CE in the brain can be inhibited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CEI as evidenced by an inhibition of the pressor and drinking responses to i.c.v. angiotensin I (ANG I) or renin and by potentiation of the pressor responses to i.c.v. bradykinin. Site of the inhibition is not only the cerebrospinal fluid but also periventricular brain tissue such as the hypothalamus. I.c.v. injection of captopril at doses which inhibit brain CE but do not leak into the peripheral blood were shown to lower BP in conscious stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), but not in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls. Acute peripheral administration of CEI can produce an inhibition of brain CE. This was shown by an attenuation of the drinking responses to i.c.v. ANG I and renin and by direct measurements of CE activity in brain tissue. Chronic oral treatment with CEI produces changes of brain RAS parameters which suggest an inhibition of ANG II formation in the brain.", 
    "288": "The unstimulated rat submandibular gland releases kallikrein into the circulation. This release is greatly increased by sympathetic nervous stimulation of the gland. We studied the effect of an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) on blood flow of the unstimulated submandibular gland, and the effect of the ACE inhibitor on blood kinins and blood pressure of rats with prior sympathetic stimulation of the gland. To minimize the effects mediated by inhibition of angiotensin II formation, all rats were nephrectomized 48 hours before the studies. Administration of the ACE inhibitor caused a 2.4-fold increase in the blood flow of the unstimulated gland (p less than 0.001). Pretreatment with kinin antibodies diminished this increase by 86% (p less than 0.001). After sympathetic stimulation, blood flow to the gland increased five times, and kinin output in the venous effluent increased from 19 +/- 13 to 14,400 +/- 8,800 pg/min (p less than 0.001). Despite this conspicuous increase, arterial blood kinins did not change. Administration of the ACE inhibitor after stimulation of the gland resulted in a 10-fold increase in arterial blood kinins and in a pronounced decrease in blood pressure from 100 +/- 5 to 58 +/- 6 mmHg. This decrease was almost completely blocked by antibodies to either kallikrein or kinin. We concluded that the glandular kallikrein-kinin system may participate in the regulation of local blood flow in organs rich in glandular kallikrein such as the rat submandibular gland.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "289": "A detailed investigation of the catalytic mechanism of angiotensin converting enzyme was undertaken in order to establish a molecular basis for its mode of action. These studies include the characterization of the kinetic properties of the enzyme. In particular, a mechanism for the anion activation, a characteristic feature of angiotensin converting enzyme, has been established. The active site of the enzyme contains a catalytically essential zinc atom which appears to be directly involved in the hydrolytic step of catalysis. Further components of the active site are the carboxyl group of an aspartyl or glutamyl residue, tyrosyl, arginyl and lysyl residues. The latter one is involved in mediating the anion activation. These results have enabled us to compare the active site of angiotensin converting enzyme with those of two other zinc peptidases and, thereby, deduce a mechanism for its mode of action. These investigations have confirmed a hypothetical model of the active site of angiotensin converting enzyme which has served to construct potent inhibitors of the enzyme now being used as antihypertensive agents.", 
    "290": "The inhibitory effects of SQ14225 and MK421 injected into the lateral brain ventricle (i.c.v.) and intravenously (i.v.) on pressor responses to intravenous (i.v.) angiotensin I(AI, 400 ng/kg i.v.) were compared in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both the i.c.v. and i.v. inhibitors suppressed the increase in blood pressure produced by intravenous injections of AI in a dose dependent manner. The inhibition of pressor responses to i.v. AI were rapid in onset and decayed with time following i.v. captopril and MK421, while the effects of i.c.v. inhibitors were slower in onset and were maintained for a longer time. The activity of MK421, either i.v. or i.c.v. persisted for longer compared to that of SQ14225 in conscious SHR. It was concluded that SQ14225 and MK421 readily leaked from the brain ventricles to the peripheral circulation and this observation suggested that the central hypotensive effects of these inhibitors might be partly attributed to peripheral blockade of angiotensin I conversion in conscious SHR.", 
    "291": "This presentation is a summary of our recent clinical studies on the therapeutic use of a new potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride, and a converting enzyme inhibitor, MK-421, in preventing hypokalemia associated with primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. These drugs are quite different in their physiologic action but they both may be effective in preventing the potassium depletion associated with increased aldosterone production. Amiloride, which blocks the sodium channels in distal renal tubular cells, was administered to 10 patients with primary hyperaldosteronism and five patients with Bartter's syndrome (secondary hyperaldosteronism). Amiloride, at doses of 10-40 mg/day, increased mean plasma potassium levels in both primary hyperaldosteronism (3.2-4.5 mEq/L) and, to a lesser extent, in Bartter's syndrome (2.5-3.6 mEq/L). The blood pressure fell slightly but significantly in primary hyperaldosteronism (171/112 vs 150/97 mm Hg) and remained unchanged in Bartter's syndrome (116/80 vs 117/71 mm Hg). The plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone rose in primary aldosteronism (PRA 0.39-2.21 ng A1/m1/h and PA 28.4-54.3 ng/d1); but in Bartter's syndrome, the PRA declined (25.3-11.9 ng A1/m1/h) and the PA rose (19.5-38.0 ng/d1). The discrepancy in the PRA between primary aldosteronism and Bartter's syndrome may be due to the effects of potassium repletion on suppressing renin and stimulating aldosterone; while in primary aldosteronism, a mild diuretic effect could explain the rise in PRA. In both of these disorders, despite the rise in plasma potassium levels, amiloride produced a counter-therapeutic rise in PA which could potentiate further potassium losses. Therefore, we undertook a study to evaluate the prevention of diuretic-induced hypokalemia and secondary hyperaldosteronism using a new converting enzyme inhibitor, MK-421. Eighteen normal subjects were randomized into three groups receiving either (1) hydrochlorothiazide alone (50 mg/day), (2) MK-421 alone (10 mg/day), or (3) hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) plus MK-421 (10 mg/day). Although MK-421 did not prevent diuretic-induced hypokalemia or hyperaldosteronism in the first week, after that time hypokalemia was reversed and ASR returned to normal. In these studies, it therefore appears that while potassium-sparing diuretics may remain the medical mainstay in treating primary aldosteronism, new converting enzyme inhibitors such as MK-421 may be more effective in treating secondary hyperaldosteronism, since potassium levels can be normalized without increasing aldosterone secretion.", 
    "292": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) was demonstrated in the tissue of human renal cell carcinoma and its cultured cells by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry using a specific rabbit antibody to human kidney ACE. The biochemical properties of the partially purified enzyme from the tumor tissue were identical with the pure enzyme from normal kidney with respect to Km, optimal pH, chloride ion activation and heat sensitivity. Catalytic activities of tumor and normal kidney enzymes were similarly inhibited by an ACE inhibitor, captopril, and by the antibody to human kidney ACE. However, double immunodiffusion analysis showed spur-forming immunoprecipitin bands between the tumor and normal kidney enzyme. These data suggest that human renal cell carcinomas have a new isozyme of ACE differing in part immunologically from the enzyme of normal kidney.", 
    "293": "We studied the hemodynamic, echocardiographic, phonomechanographic and hormonal changes during acute (25 mg) and chronic (6 months--75 to 225 mg/day) treatment of 10 patients with congestive cardiac failure due to cardiomyopathy with dilatation with SQ 14 225 (Captopril). The following changes were observed after the single dose: an increase in cardiac output (p less than 0,001), in stroke volume (p less than 0,01), a reduction in heart rate (p less than 0,01), in peripheral resistance (p less than 0,001) and pulmonary capillary pressure (p less than 0,001). There were no significant changes in end systolic or end diastolic left ventricular internal diameter. Plasma renin activity increased (p less than 0,001); there was a concurrent fall in serum aldosterone (NS): the plasma concentration of converting enzyme decreased (p less than 0,001). There was a correlation between the increase in peripheral resistance under basal conditions and the basal plasma renin activity (R = 0,72, p less than 0,02). The decrease in peripheral resistance after captopril also correlated with basal plasma renin activity (R = 0,89, p less than 0,01). After six months continuous therapy, the hemodynamic effect was sustained and was accompanied by a significant symptomatic improvement. Left ventricular internal end systolic and end diastolic diameters decreased (p less than 0,01 and p less than 0,01 respectively). The pre-ejectional period decreased (p less than 0,05). Serum aldosterone fell significantly (p less than 0,001) as did plasma renin activity (p less than 0,01); the serum level of converting enzyme remained low with respect to its initial value. These results show that captopril may be useful in severe cardiac failure without tolerance during long-term administration. No renal or hematological toxicity was observed in this group of patients.", 
    "294": "Studies using a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II (saralasin) or converting enzyme inhibitors (teprotide, captopril, enalapril) have established that the renin-angiotensin system participates in the control of vascular tone in congestive heart failure both in experimental settings and in patients. In man, the marked decrease in left ventricular filling pressure and the variable increase in stroke volume induced by renin-angiotensin blockade suggests that angiotensin II actively constricts venous as well as arteriolar vascular beds. Captopril, in doses of 25 to 150 mg p.o. TID, maintains its efficacy during chronic administration with persistent clinical and hemodynamic improvement as well as increased exercise tolerance. In our experience, enalapril, 10 mg p.o., improves cardiac function within 4 to 6 h as reflected by a 30% decrease in left ventricular filling pressure, a 28% increase in stroke volume in the face of unchanged heart rate. Clinical improvement, enhanced exercise tolerance and characteristic hormonal responses suggest that enalapril also maintains its efficacy during long-term treatment. Chronic angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibition appears to be a major advance in the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure, refractory to digitalis and diuretics.", 
    "295": "Animal studies (particularly in dogs) on enalapril maleate have served to predict the patterns of absorption and elimination observed in man. Enalapril is more readily absorbed in man than the active inhibitor form MK-422. Estimates of minimum absorption of enalapril are of the order of 60-70%, based on urinary recovery. Metabolism of enalapril to MK-422 appears to be largely a postabsorptive process. From urinary recovery data, a minimum of 43% of a 10-mg dose of enalapril is available as MK-422. Excretion of enalapril and MK-422 is principally renal. The excellent mass balance obtained in human studies precludes extensive metabolism beyond hydrolysis to MK-422. Data in hand suggest that any metabolism other than to MK-422 is of a trace nature.", 
    "296": "Captopril (SQ 14,225) was acutely administered to control mice and to mice which had developed hypertension as a result of being caged in a manner which facilitates social interactions and competition. Systolic blood pressure was measured four hours after captopril administration, and blood was taken for measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) several days later. Captopril produced no effect on normotensive control mice living in isolation nor did it reduce the blood pressure of the hypertensive mice on days 1, 7, and 14 following their placement in the special caging, despite the fact that their PRA was significantly elevated at these times. In contrast, by 1.5 months after placement in the cages and continuing for the next 5.5 months, captopril abolished the hypertension; PRA was normal during this period. We conclude that the increased PRA existing during the early stage of this psychosocial model of hypertension is not a significant direct contributor to the hypertension, whereas the renin-angiotensin system may be essential for the maintenance of the hypertension beyond the early stage.", 
    "297": "New carboxyalkyl compounds derived from Phe-Leu and Phe-Ala were synthesized and checked as inhibitors of \"enkephalinase\", a metalloendopeptidase cleaving the Gly3-Phe4 bond of enkephalins from mouse striatal membranes. Differential recognition of both brain enkephalinase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalytic sites by these carboxylalkyl compounds lead to potent (KI approximately 0.5 microM), competitive and selective inhibitors of the enkephalin-degrading enzyme. The most interesting compound, N-[(RS)-2-carboxy-3-phenylpropanoyl]-L-leucine (3, KI = 0.34 microM), is 10000 times more potent on enkephalinase than on ACE activities. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of 3 in mice leads to a high potentiation of the analgesic effect of the exogenously administered D-Ala2-Met-enkephalin, evidencing the in vivo inhibition of enkephalinase. Moreover, icv administration of 3 alone induces a dose-dependent analgesia in mice measured on both hot-plate and writhing tests. In the former assay, the ED50 was approximately 10 micrograms per animal, slightly higher than that of thiorphan. All the antinociceptive effects were antagonized by naloxone, demonstrating the involvement of enkephalins in analgesia and their in vivo protection from enkephalinase by 3. The described compounds can be considered as first examples of a new series of analgesics and potentially psychoactive agents.", 
    "298": "An amino analogue of N-benzoyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-proline, a tripeptide inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was synthesized. The analogue (III) has the phenylalanyl-glycine amide linkage of N-benzoyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-proline reduced to a methylene amine. Compound III was tested as an inhibitor of porcine plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme and has an I50 of 620 microM compared with an I50 of 9.6 microM for its parent tripeptide. These results are explained in terms of a proposed model of the converting-enzyme active site.", 
    "299": "CE was purified from human lung, and antisera were raised in rabbits. Antisera inhibited the activity of the purified enzyme from lung and kidney and the plasma CE of normal persons and sarcoid patients. With antisera at a titer of 1:100,000, a sensitive, direct RIA was developed. CE purified from lung or kidney and CE present in normal and in sarcoid plasma gave parallel logit-log displacement lines, suggesting immunological identity. The level of CE in normal human plasma was 400 +/- 131 ng/ml. In untreated sarcoid patients, the enzyme level and activity increased in parallel. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.81) between enzyme level and diffusing capacity of the lung for CO in sarcoid patients. Synthetic inhibitors such as captopril or MK 421 did not interfere with the RIA, permitting enzyme levels to be monitored in patients undergoing acute inhibitor therapy. During administration of MK 421, CE activity was negligible and plasma levels of CE did not change. In contrast, renin activity increased eightfold during the inhibitor therapy.", 
    "300": "Using equal or lower than manufacturer's recommended doses of Captopril in 10 hypertensive patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min severe side-effects were observed in four cases. The adverse reactions continued after stopping the drug. One case developed symptomatic thrombocytopenia; one other, a lethal infected exfoliative dermatitis and an irreversible deterioration of her renal function. The other two cases demonstrated severe aggravation of their CRF, one requiring dialysis. The protective effect of dialysis against these side-effects is obvious in this series and dialysis may also accelerate the resolution of the complications. Suggestions for the management of this kind of patient with Captopril are made.", 
    "301": "With an informatized sample of 123 patients taking Captopril and treated for a total duration of 1,321 month/patients, the frequency of the dermatological symptoms induced by the drug is related. Pruritus is found in 10,5 p. 100 and rashes in 2,4 p. 100 of cases. The results are compared with those of preceeding reports, although some authors have found a higher percentage because of highin doses of the drug. The clinical features of the rashes and the proposed mechanisms are also reported.",

    "303": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits both a compensated phase of cardiac hypertrophy in which forward output is maintained despite persistently elevated systemic arterial pressures and a decompensated phase in which cardiac performance has deteriorated in spite of further hypertrophic growth. To determine whether chronic antihypertensive therapy prevents the development of heart failure and the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR with advanced hypertension, captopril (2 g/l of drinking water), a converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to 14 month old female SHR and normotensive American Wistar rats (NWR) for 10 months. The severe left ventricular hypertrophy of the 24 month old untreated SHR (4.37 +/- 0.2 mg/g v. 2.50 +/- 0.06 mg/g, untreated NWR) was markedly reduced (P less than 0.02) by captopril (3.01 +/- 0.1 mg/g). Chronic therapy prevented the reduction of both baseline and maximal cardiac indices in SHR, but did not alter blood flow in NWR. Left ventricular dilatation was present in 24 month old SHR and, as peak stroke volume index was diminished, the ejection fraction index of the SHR was reduced. Captopril restored this index in SHR to normal. The relation of ejection fraction index and afterload (peak systolic wall stress) was depressed in untreated SHR, but was normal in treated SHR. Thus, chronic therapy with captopril prevented the development of severe cardiac dysfunction and produced a marked regression of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR with advanced hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "304": "Captopril is the first angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for oral administration. In combination with continued digitalis and diuretic therapy it has been demonstrated to be effective in the management of severe heart failure refractory to optimal digitalis, diuretic and, in many patients, vasodilator treatment. Most studies to date have been open trials of several weeks or months duration, but a number of patients have received continued treatment, with sustained benefit, for up to 1 year or more. A placebo-controlled trial in a limited number of patients with less severe heart failure has confirmed the results of open trials. Captopril administration improves cardiac performance as a result of a reduction in systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and the various determinants of left ventricular filling pressure (preload). Improvements in exercise tolerance and functional classification, with associated reduction of clinical symptomatology, occur with simultaneous decreases in myocardial oxygen consumption. At present, captopril is worthy of a trial in patients refractory to more traditional medical management. Whether it should be considered a 'first-line' agent after failure of optimal digitalis and diuretic therapy, and before instituting other vasodilator therapy, is less clear. In patients with severe or resistant heart failure, a response to captopril is usually accompanied by a general improvement in the quality of life. The effect of captopril treatment on 1- and 2-year survival rates in patients with severe heart failure appears similar to that reported for other vasodilators. Most patients tolerate captopril treatment well, but hypotension, reduced renal function, skin rash, dysgeusia, and neutropenia have been reported.", 
    "305": "Captopril, an oral active dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase inhibitor with antihypertensive properties, has been reported to have the following cutaneous side effects: macular and papular skin eruptions, urticaria, angioedema, mouth ulcers, pemphigus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruptions. Here, to the best of our knowledge, is the first case in which a pityriasis rosea-like eruption evolved into a lichenoid drug eruption. Also discussed is the remarkable similarity in the side effects of captopril, gold compounds, d-penicillamine, and organic mercurials.", 
    "306": "In the pithed rat preparation captopril, enalapril, teprotide and saralasin given intravenously attenuated pressor responses to both spinal sympathetic nerve stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline, indicating that angiotensin has a potent adrenergic facilitating action. Bi-lateral nephrectomy abolished the effects of captopril on nerve stimulation but responses to noradrenaline were still inhibited following nephrectomy, indicating that part of the post-junctional actions of captopril might not be angiotensin dependent. Both phenylephrine and clonidine are also inhibited by captopril in the pithed rat. It is thus not clear whether captopril is interacting with post-junctional alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation are greater in SHR than WKY and captopril is more effective at inhibiting responses in the SHR than it is in WKY. These interactions between captopril and the sympathetic nervous system could explain the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors as antihypertensive agents.", 
    "307": "The effects of an antiserum against human kidney renin and of H-142, a peptide inhibitor of human renin, were studied in the primate Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). In severely volume-depleted (low-salt diet and repetitive injections of furosemide), conscious marmosets, the antiserum reduced blood pressure to the same extent as the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (-31 +/- 7 SEM mmHg and -30 +/- 5 mmHg). In mildly volume-depleted (normal salt diet and single injection of furosemide), conscious marmosets, H-142 and teprotide induced a similar fall in blood pressure (-14 +/- 4 mmHg and -15 +/- 2 mmHg). When H-142 was infused after the injection of teprotide, it had no further effect on blood pressure. Conversely, teprotide was ineffective when injected during the infusion of H-142. These results show that in marmosets blood pressure can be lowered by specific inhibitors of human renin. A converting-enzyme inhibitor has similar effects. Hence the renin-angiotensin system appears to contribute significantly to the maintenance of blood pressure in conscious, volume-depleted marmosets.", 
    "308": "Congestive heart failure is frequently associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance. Lowering resistance can improve cardiac performance and alleviate symptoms. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offer a new way to lower resistance and have certain advantages, including the inhibition of compensatory mechanisms. However, skillful use of these compounds demands a thorough understanding of their pharmacologic properties and of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure.", 
    "309": "The hypotheses that glandular kallikrein (KK) potentiate the conversion of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII) was tested on isolated mesenteric artery from rabbit. Cumulative additions of A1 in concentrations 10(-8), 5 X 10(-8) and 10(-7) M gave dose-related contractions of the artery. Due to tachyphylaxis second dose-response run was used for comparison. KK, 0.4 U/ml, potentiated these contractions. Addition of captopril (C, 10(-5) M) to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) reduced the AI responses markedly and tachyphylaxis almost completely. The responses of the KK induced potentiation of AI was the same regardless of the presence of captopril. KK, 0.01 U/ml or 0.4 U/ml, produced the same effects. Saralasin (S, 10(-5) M), an AII receptor antagonist, completely abolished the responses following C+KK+AI. Thus, these results indicate that the KK induced potentiation of the AI response is due to a conversion to AII. Bradykinin (BK, 10(-7), 10(-5) M) did not mimic the KK potentiation of AI. Three different kallikrein inhibitors, S-2441 (H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-NH-heptyl X 2HCl), Trasylol and amiloride, reduced the KK potentiation of AI. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist added for inhibition of AII adrenergic facilitation, also reduced the KK induced potentiation of AI. In conclusion, these results indicate that KK potentiate the conversion of AI to AII and thereby induces vasopressor effects.", 
    "310": "To evaluate the difference of the blood pressure regulating mechanisms of chronic (12-14 weeks) one-kidney, one-clip (1K-1C) and chronic two-kidney, one-clip (2K-1C) hypertensive rats, we administered captopril, captopril plus indomethacin, and indomethacin to the rats. Pretreatment values of plasma renin concentration, plasma aldosterone concentration and urinary kallikrein excretion were significantly higher in 2K-1C than in 1K-1C hypertensive rats. Captopril-induced blood pressure reduction was greater in 2K-1C than in 1K-1C hypertensive rats. When captopril was administered to the rats treated with indomethacin, captopril-induced blood pressure reduction was attenuated only in 2K-1C hypertensive rats. Indomethacin produced renal impairment and further raised the blood pressure in 1K-1C hypertensive rats, but did not in 2K-1C hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system functions to maintain high blood pressure more predominantly in chronic 2K-1C than in 1K-1C hypertensive rats. The renal kallikrein-kinin system is suppressed in chronic 1K-1C hypertensive rats but not in 2K-1C hypertensive rats. The renal prostaglandin system is more important for regulating the renal circulation in chronic 1K-1C than in 2K-1C hypertensive rats.", 
    "311": "1. Administration of SQ20881 diminished pressor responses to intravenous (i.v.) injections of angiotensin I (AI), but not those to injections of angiotensin II (AII), in Pekin ducks, indicating the occurrence of a mechanism similar to the mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme reaction. 2. Pressor responses to AII were enhanced by general anaesthesia with phenobarbital, pentobarbital, or a combination of both phenobarbital and pentobarbital. 3. Ganglionic blockade with mecamylamine enhanced the pressor responses to AII and NE, but not those to tyramine, in anaesthetized ducks. 4. It is proposed that the potentiating effects of general anaesthesia and ganglionic blockade on pressor responses were due both to a lowering of baseline blood pressure (BP) and an inhibition of the neural reflexes which normally buffer BP. Furthermore, it is suggested that the augmented responsiveness of anaesthetized, ganglion-blocked ducks shows that the pressor effect of AII is predominantly of peripheral, rather than central nervous system (CNS), origin.", 
    "312": "Chronic sodium depletion in the rat is associated with decreased nephron filtration rate (SNGFR), nephron plasma flow (rpf), and a reduction in the glomerular permeability coefficient (LpA). This study was designed to determine whether the reduction in LpA could be acutely reversed with volume repletion and whether administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor will restore LpA to normal values in the sodium-depleted rat. Measurements were performed in Munich-Wistar rats employing micropuncture techniques to assess the effects of acute volume repletion, 3-5 days of oral converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (30 mg . kg body wt-1 . day-1), and longer term (13-18 days) treatment with CEI begun just before or after initial volume depletion. Volume repletion in chronic sodium-depleted rats restored LpA to normal control values within a 60-min period, and values for glomerular dynamics were not different from a group of normal NaCl-intake rats to which the same treatment was applied. Both short-term and long-term CEI treatment during sodium depletion resulted in restoration of rpf to values not different from those with normal NaCl intake. However, only long-term but not short-term CEI treatment restored LpA to normal values. These studies suggest that intrarenal angiotensin II may mediate this reduction in LpA during chronic sodium depletion, but an effect of adrenergic nerve activity has not been excluded.", 
    "313": "Research over the last 25 years established the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's important role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of hypertension for which renin suppressive drugs, angiotensin antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors provided selective pharmacological tools. Pharmacological interference with the renin-angiotensin axis in addition to reducing angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction reduces angiotensin's effect on aldosterone, alpha-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction and central activation of sympathetic nerve activity. Renin measurements serve as an endocrine marker for the activity and reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system reflecting a beta-adrenoceptor mediated response which tends to decrease with older age. Therefore, as younger the patient and as higher pretreatment renin as better the antihypertensive response to converting enzyme inhibitors and betablockers is. As lower renin and as older the age diuretic agents and calcium antagonists are more effective, the hyporesponsive renin being a co-determinant of pressure response in these patients.", 
    "314": "14 patients with refractory hypertension did not respond either to captopril, an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, combined with a diuretic, a beta-blocker and hydralazine or minoxidil, a potent vasodilator, but they did respond to the combination of captopril, minoxidil, furosemide and a beta-blocker. There were no disturbing side effects from this combination. There may be a synergistic effect between captopril and minoxidil in the treatment of refractory hypertension. The combination is an interesting and novel method of treating patients with refractory hypertension.", 
    "315": "Ten patients with severe hypertension and unsatisfactory blood pressure control during combined therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, diuretics, and vasodilators were treated with gradually increasing doses of captopril. Vasodilators were discontinued 24 hours prior to captopril administration. Six patients had essential, two renal, and two renovascular hypertension. Mild renal impairment was observed in four patients. Captopril effectively decreased blood pressure for 3 hours in all patients after the first dose. The antihypertensive effect appeared to be triphasic and was sustained in all but one patient during 12 months of observation. Captopril doses of 25-75 mg t.i.d. were sufficient to achieve acceptable blood pressure control (RR less than or equal to 160/100 mmHg) when given in the above mentioned combination. Side-effects were few and tolerable and discontinuation of captopril was not required.", 
    "316": "This study was designed to investigate the possible role of angiotensin and vasopressin in the maintenance of arterial blood pressure during acute blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Two groups of eight dogs each were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and autonomic ganglia were blocked with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg). Thirty minutes later group 1 received the vasopressin antagonist 1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid),2-(O-methyl)tyrosine arginine vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg) followed after a 30-min interval by captopril (1 mg/kg). Group 2 received the same drugs, except the order of administration of vasopressin antagonist and captopril was reversed. Vasopressin antagonist during ganglionic blockade (group 2) produced a greater fall in blood pressure than did captopril during ganglionic blockade (group 1). These data indicate that vasopressin plays a greater pressor role than angiotensin in the acute response to ganglionic blockade. Additional studies were performed to determine if the autonomic nervous system alone can support the resting blood pressure in the anesthetized dog. Combined blockade of angiotensin and vasopressin without autonomic blockade produced a significant decrease in blood pressure, suggesting that the autonomic nervous system alone is not able to support the control blood pressure in the anesthetized dog.", 
    "317": "New carboxylalkyl compounds derived from Phe-Leu and corresponding to the general formula C6H5-CH2-CH(R)CO-L.Leu with R = -COOH, 3, R = -CH2-COOH, 4, R = -NH-CH2-COOH, 5, R = -NH-(CH2)2-COOH, 6, have been found to inhibit the breakdown of the Gly3-Phe4 bond of [3H] Leu-enkephalin or [3H]D.Ala2-Leu-enkephalin resulting from the action of the mouse striatal metallopeptidases: \"enkephalinase\" or angiotensin-converting enzyme (A.C.E.). The carboxyl coordinating ability of the Zn atom seems to be significantly higher in ACE than in \"enkephalinase\". Moreover, IC50 values against \"enkephalinase\" were found in the same range whatever the length of the chain bearing the carboxyl group whereas a well-defined position of this group with respect to the Zn atom is required for strong ACE inhibition. These features suggest a larger degree of freedom of the carboxyalkyl moieties within the active site of \"enkephalinase\". Therefore the differential recognition of active sites of both peptidases leads to: i) N-(carboxymethyl)-L-Phe-L-Leu, 5, a competitive inhibitor of \"enkephalinase\" (KI = 0.7 microM) and ACE (KI = 1.2 microM) which could be used as mixed inhibitor for both enzymes; ii) N-[(R,S)-2-carboxy, 3-benzylpropanoyl]-L-Leucine, 3, a full competitive inhibitor of \"enkephalinase\" (KI = 0.34 microM) which does not interact with ACE (IC50 greater than 10,000 microM). This compound can be considered as the first example of a new series of highly potent and specific \"enkephalinase\" inhibitors.", 
    "318": "Cathepsin G, an Mr = 26,000-29,000 cationic human neutrophil lysosomal serine protease, releases angiotensin II from angiotensinogen and was, therefore, examined for angiotensin I-converting activity. Cathepsin G-dependent angiotensin I conversion was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography assay which permitted independent quantitation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and detection of angiotensin degradation products. 1.8-5.0 X 10(-9) M cathepsin G converted angiotensin I (3.3 X 10(-4) M) to angiotensin II without further degradation of angiotensin II. The pH optimum for cathepsin G-catalyzed angiotensin I conversion was pH 7.0-7.5, and the Km and Kcat were 2.2 X 10(-4) M and 3.4 s-1, respectively. In contrast to dipeptidyl hydrolase-converting enzyme, cathepsin G did not inactivate bradykinin, did not cleave hippuryl-His-Leu, and was not inhibited by 10(-4) M Captopril or SQ 20881. Purified human neutrophils stimulated with 2.5 X 10(-6) M-10(-10) M fMet-Leu-Phe released angiotensin-converting activity with a Km of 3.3 X 10(-4) M. That the angiotensin-converting activity released from neutrophils was attributable to cathepsin G was indicated by similar susceptibility to inhibitors and adsorption by goat antibody to cathepsin G. The granulocyte-angiotensin system provides a mechanism for the local generation of angiotensin II at sites of neutrophil accumulation and may be of significance in regulation of blood flow in tissue microvasculature.", 
    "319": "We have studied inhibition of purified canine angiotensin converting enzyme by substance P and its nonapeptide derivative using Hip-His-Leu as the substrate. Kinetic studies indicated that both substance P and its nonapeptide derivative inhibited the hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu at different concentrations. The mode of inhibition was competitive with a Ki of 1.15 microM for substance P. These results indicate that substance P is a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme in vitro.", 
    "320": "Angiotensin II-sensitive neurons in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-sp) and of Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril were investigated for possible differences at receptor sites. Furthermore, the concentrations of angiotensinogen and renin were measured in different brain regions of these animals by biochemical assay. The higher receptor sensitivity of septal neurons to angiotensin II which existed in SHR-sp as compared to WKY was diminished by Captopril. Angiotensinogen concentrations were lower in the anterior hypothalamus but not in the septum of SHR-sp as compared to WKY. Captopril increased the level in both strains. Renin concentrations did not differ in SHR-sp and WKY. Chronic treatment with Captopril induced an increase of about 20% in septum and hypothalamic regions of SHR-sp and WKY rats. Whether these changes are causally linked to the hypertension in SHR-sp remains to be investigated.", 
    "321": "Enalapril maleate (MK421), a new inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, in single daily doses of 1.25-40 mg was assessed in five patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis. Only small falls in plasma angiotensin II concentrations were seen at doses less than 10 mg; even with 10 and 20 mg, angiotensin II concentrations had risen again 24 hours from the last dose. During long-term treatment with 10-40 mg daily all patients achieved good blood-pressure control. No significant changes of body sodium or potassium values were seen. The drug was well tolerated with no serious side effects. These findings are evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of enalapril in the medical management of hypertension with renal artery stenosis.", 
    "322": "8 of 16 patients with nephrotic syndrome had normal or low plasma renin activity while spontaneously retaining sodium. The other 8 patients had a high plasma renin activity which may have caused the sodium retention. Oral captopril and albumin infusion given separately both suppressed the renin system in these patients. Despite this, urinary sodium excretion remained less than sodium intake and patients continued to retain sodium and gain weight. These results suggest that, even in patients with nephrotic syndrome who do have stimulation of the renin angiotensin system, some other overriding mechanism is responsible for sodium retention. Therefore it seems unlikely that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "323": "Various doses (5 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg) of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14,255, captopril) were administered to 8 patients with essential hypertension on a three-crossover study design, and the time course of mean blood pressure (MBP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE-A), plasma cortisol (PC) and plasma aldosterone (PA) were determined following administration of the drug. MBP fell in a dose dependent manner, and PRA showed a minor but significant increases in cases receiving 5 and 12.5 mg of the drug. A large and significant increase in PRA was observed following 25 mg of captopril. ACE-A was also reduced in a dose dependent manner. There was no difference between changes in PC at any of the three dose levels. The serum potassium concentration was determined before and 3 hr after 25 mg of captopril treatment and no significant change was observed. In spite of the dose dependent and theoretical changes in the above parameters, lowered responses of PA to each dose of the drug were shown in reverse order against an increasing dose. That is to say, the grade of fall in PA following 25 of captopril was smaller than that following the other doses of the drug, and 5 mg induced a greater decrease in PA than 12.5 mg. Based on these findings, the relatively high dose of captopril in the present study was apparently more effective in increasing some factors which suppressed reduction of PA by a fall in angiotensin II than a low dose of the drug.", 
    "324": "1 The effect of captopril on autonomic reflex functions has been investigated in fifteen patients with essential hypertension by examining their responses to tests of baroreceptor function (Valsalva's manoeuvre and upright posture), sympathetic nervous system reactivity (cold pressor and mental stress tests) and parasympathetic reactivity (diving test) before and after 3 weeks' treatment with captopril. 2 Captopril significantly reduced arterial blood pressure and resting heart rate but did not affect cardiovascular responses to Valsalva's manoeuvre, upright posture, cold pressor and mental stress tests. 3 The bradycardia associated with the diving reflex test was significantly enhanced by captopril (P less than 0.01). 4 These results indicate that treatment with captopril is associated with increased parasympathetic tone but without inhibition of baroreceptor or sympathetic reflexes.", 
    "325": "The treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension is unsatisfactory. Since, in animals, experimental pulmonary vasoconstriction may be mediated in part by angiotensin II, we treated five primary pulmonary hypertensive patients with captopril for four days. To ensure accuracy of haemodynamic and hormone data, the patients were studied under conditions of constant body posture, regulated dietary sodium and potassium intake, and unchanged diuretic therapy. Captopril reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure in parallel with plasma angiotensin II levels. Right ventricular ejection fraction recordings increased considerably in three of four patients. Systemic arterial pressure fell, but there was no change in right atrial pressure, cardiac output, or heart rate. The decline in plasma (and urine) aldosterone levels presumably contributed to the positive cumulative potassium balance and the rise in plasma potassium (mean 0.7 mmol/1). These encouraging results suggest that converting enzyme inhibitors warrant a formal trial with prolonged follow up in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "326": "This study was designed to determine whether the prostaglandins mediate the renal effects of captopril in the conscious sodium-replete dog. In a group of control animals (n = 9), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased from 185 +/- 15 to 230 +/- 12 ml/min and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 0.64 +/- 0.15 to 12.9 +/- 1.1 ng ANG I . ml-1 . h-1 after captopril (10 mg/kg bolus plus 10 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 i.v.) administration. Glomerular filtration rate (GRF) and sodium excretion (UnaV) were also increased significantly following captopril treatment, whereas urine volume (V), potassium excretion (UkV), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged throughout the experiment. When the same dose of captopril was given to indomethacin-pretreated dogs (5 mg/kg bolus plus 2 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 i.v.), ERPF increased from 170 +/- 8 to 265 +/- 18 ml/min and PRA increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 14.6 +/- 3.0 ng ANG I . ml-1 . h-1 after the captopril, while UnaV, UkV, and V remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that the prostaglandins do not mediate the ability of captopril to increase PRA or effective renal plasma flow in this experimental model.", 
    "327": "The role of angiotensin II in the stimulation of aldosterone biosynthesis by sodium sequestration in potassium-deficient rats was assessed by experiments involving 1-day angiotensin II infusion, converting enzyme inhibition, and bilateral nephrectomy. In intact rats, only an extremely high dose of exogenous angiotensin II imitated the stimulatory effects of polyethylene glycol-induced edema on the conversions of deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone. Treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril as well as bilateral nephrectomy blocked the aldosterone-stimulating action of edema. This inhibition was prevented by the simultaneous infusion of angiotensin II in captopril-treated rats but not in nephrectomized animals. According to these results, angiotensin II is an essential mediator in the stimulation of aldosterone biosynthesis by sodium sequestration. However, the role of the kidneys appears to be twofold. First, they act through the secretion of renin. In addition, a second yet unknown kidney factor is necessary for a full response of the zona glomerulosa to the stimulatory action of angiotensin II.", 
    "328": "We investigated the kinetics of 25 mg captopril by mouth in 12 patients with congestive heart failure and correlated them with the hormonal and hemodynamic changes associated with the drug. Observations were made after a single dose (25 mg orally), and after short-term therapy (25 mg t.i.d. for 3 days). Captopril kinetics were as previously reported in normal subjects, with the exception that time to maximum concentration (tmax) to free captopril was slightly higher and the half-life (t1/2) was slightly shorter than in normal subjects. Total captopril t1/2 was longer than normal, suggesting cumulation. Urinary excretion was slower than normal. Differences between captopril kinetics on days 1 and 5 were that the tmax developed somewhat sooner, with a shorter t1/2 on day 5 and total captopril blood levels were higher on day 5 than on day 1. Urinary excretion was greater on day 5 than on day 1. Hemodynamic improvement after a single oral dose of captopril was significant and correlated with baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). The onset of converting-enzyme inhibition, as determined by PRA and hemodynamic improvement correlated with captopril blood levels.", 
    "329": "Carrageenan-induced edema of rat paw was greatly potentiated by orally or locally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (CE, identical with kininase II) inhibitor, (4R)-3-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl]-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (YS980). The potentiative effect of YS980 was observed by the administration not only prior to but also 3 hr after the carrageenan injection. The vascular permeability test showed the same potentiative effect of YS980 in the inflamed tissue of carrageenan edema. Bradykinin potentiating peptide-B (BPP-B) and 1,10-phenanthroline also potentiated the edema and the effects of these compounds were in order of YS980 greater than BPP-B greater than 1,10-phenanthroline. The order was in accordance with that of inhibitory potencies against kininase II activity of rat serum in vitro. However, the activity of kininase I was not affected by YS980 and BPP-B. In addition, among various experimental models of acute paw edema, the potentiative effects of YS980 were restricted to the inflammations mediated by kinins such as carrageenan, cellulose sulfate, kaolin and bradykinin-induced edema. These results suggest that the potentiative effect of YS980 on carrageenan edema is mainly based on its inhibitory effect on kininase II in the inflamed site.", 
    "330": "We examined the effect of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (SQ 14,225) on pulmonary hemodynamics and on accumulation of extravascular lung water after microembolization in dogs. Pulmonary microembolization, induced with glass beads (200 microns diam), increased the mean pulmonary arterial pressure to approximately 40 Torr in both control and captopril-treated animals. The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in control animals was sustained during the 75 min of study and was associated with an increase in the extravascular lung water content-to-bloodless dry lung weight ratio (W/D) from a normal value of 2.84 +/- 0.22 to 4.53 +/- 0.24 ml/g (P less than 0.01) after embolization. In the captopril-treated group, the PVR increased gradually, such that the value at 75 min postembolization was greater than in controls (P less than 0.05). The W/D in the captopril-treated group of 4.62 +/- 0.19 ml/g was greater than the value of 2.83 +/- 0.10 ml/g in nonembolized captopril-treated animals, but the degrees of edema in the control and captopril-treated animals were not different. A similar degree of embolization induced during infusion of 5 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1 of bradykinin also did not enhance the pulmonary edema, and there was also a greater increase in PVR than in control animals after embolization. These findings suggest that bradykinin does not contribute to the degree of pulmonary edema after microembolization.", 
    "331": "The acute hemodynamic and metabolic effects of captopril therapy were studied in 12 patients with severe heart failure during maximal exercise performed on an upright bicycle ergometer. During the control period, exhaustion occurred after 4.2 +/- 2.7 minutes of exercise. Cardiac index increased from 1.54 +/- 0.36 l/min/m2 at rest to 3.39 +/- 1.54 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.001) at exhaustion; systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference increased from 8.8 +/- 2.1 to 12.8 +/0 2.4 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.001) and oxygen uptake from 3.4 +/- 0.5 to 10.8 +/- 3.0 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.001). Pulmonary arterial oxygen content decreased from 7.3 +/- 1.3 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.001) and femoral vein oxygen content from 5.0 +/- 1.7 to 2.5 +/- 1.2 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.001). During captopril therapy, cardiac index significantly increased both at rest (1.83 +/- 0.54 vs 1.54 +/- 0.36 l/min/m2, p less than 0.01) and during maximal exercise (3.67 +/- 1.51 vs 3.39 +/- 1.54 l/min/m2, p less than 0.01). Systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference decreased significantly at rest, from 8.8 +/- 2.1 to 7.7 +/- 2.1 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.01) and during maximal exercise from 12.8 +/- 2.4 to 12.3 +/- 2.2 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.01). Pulmonary arterial oxygen content at exhaustion was significantly higher during captopril therapy than during the control period (4.1 +/- 1.1 vs 3.7 +/- 1.5 ml/100 ml, p less than 0.05), while femoral venous blood content was unchanged. Captopril therapy did not significantly increase maximal oxygen uptake or exercise duration. Thus, the acute administration of captopril to patients with severe heart failure does not increase exercise capacity despite improved cardiac performance. Moreover, captopril therapy does not acutely result in metabolic benefits to the skeletal muscles during exercise.", 
    "332": "Tetrahydroaldosterone (THA) is the principal metabolite and generally a good index of aldosterone secretion. This study undertakes the evaluation of the aldosterone secretion rate (ASR) and excretion of THA during pharmacological blockade and activation of the renin-aldosterone system. THA was measured by a simplified RIA and compared to ASR over a period of 28 days in 18 normotensive volunteers receiving either 1) a diuretic [hydrochlorthiazide (HCTZ), 50 mg/day], 2) an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (MK-421, 10 mg/day), or 3) combined therapy [HCTZ (50 md/day) plus MK-421 (10 mg/day)] in a metabolic unit on a controlled diet. Results of this study at 28 days indicate that 1) HCTZ, while producing secondary hyperaldosteronism, lowered the fractional THA excretion (defined as THA/ASR) (from 0.51 to 0.33; P less than 0.05); 2) MK-421 produced hypoaldosteronism and a slight increase in the THA/ASR (from 0.43 to 0.53; 0.05 less than P less than 0.01); 3) combined HCTZ and MK-421 resulted in a normalization of both aldosterone secretion and THA/ASR (from 0.51 to 0.50). In conclusion, HCTZ decreases the THA/ASR whereas MK-421 tends to increase it. Combined administration of HCTZ and MK-421 restores the THS/ASR to normal. Therefore, the determination of THA excretion can be an inaccurate index of aldosterone secretion when measured during either pharmacological blockade or activation of the renin-aldosterone system.", 
    "333": "The present study was performed to evaluate superficial nephron responses of the nonclipped kidney to angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (SQ 20,881, 3 mg . kg-1 . h-1) in two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive (GH) rats. Late proximal and early distal tubule collections were obtained before and during CEI. Significant increases in glomerular filtration rate, urine flow, sodium excretion, proximal and distal tubule flow rates, and single nephron glomerular filtration rate (from 24.6 +/- 1.7 to 27.5 +/- 1.6 nl/min) occurred despite reductions in arterial blood pressure (from 160 +/- 5 to 137 +/- 6 mmHg) during CEI. Proximal tubule absolute and fractional reabsorption of fluid, chloride, and total solute decreased significantly. In the nephron segment between the two collection sites, there were increases in absolute but decreases in fractional reabsorption. At the distal tubule level, fractional reabsorption but not absolute reabsorption decreased significantly. Proximal and distal tubule hydrostatic pressures increased significantly while peritubular capillary pressure decreased slightly. Responses following inhibition of angiotensin II formation suggest that there exists an angiotensin II-mediated enhancement in tubular reabsorption in the nonclipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats.", 
    "334": "Acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was produced in 21 conscious, chronically instrumented dogs. Forty minutes after coronary occlusion, nine dogs were given i.v. teprotide, 25 micrograms/kg/min, followed by oral doses of captopril, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 24 hours. The remaining 12 dogs served as saline-infused controls. In all dogs, acute coronary occlusion increased plasma renin activity and peripheral vascular resistance and reduced cardiac output, but did not change mean aortic blood pressure significantly. Teprotide significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased peripheral vascular resistance (from 3804 +/- 1158 to 2876 +/- 816 dy-sec-cm-5) (+/- SD) and mean aortic pressure (from 117 +/- 12 to 107 +/- 15 mm Hg), and increased cardiac output (from 2.63 +/- 0.67 to 3.12 +/- 0.74 l/min). Teprotide also produced a relative increase in flow to the renal and splanchnic circulations compared with the saline-treated controls. There were, however, no differences in segmental systolic shortening, blood flow in the normal or ischemic myocardium, or infarct size. These results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in dogs with acute coronary occlusion and that blockade of this system lowers systemic blood pressure and improves cardiac output. However, direct effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade on the myocardium are lacking; there were no changes in myocardial blood flow, myocardial mechanics or infarct size.", 
    "335": "Captopril was administered (50 mg orally) to 88 untreated hypertensive patients (70 with essential hypertension, eight with renal arterial disease, 10 with renal parenchymal disease) and to 25 hypertensive patients treated with sympatholytic or beta-blocking agent (20 with essential hypertension, five with renal arterial disease). In the former group, captopril caused a decrease in heart rate (HR) in 18 patients and an increase in only two. As a whole, captopril caused significant decreases in blood pressure without increase in HR. Significant negative correlation was observed between change in HR and plasma renin activity obtained before captopril administration (n = 79, r = -0.425, p less than 0.0001). Hypotensive and chronotropic effects of captopril were almost identical in untreated and treated patients. Hypotensive effects caused by captopril and nifedipine (20 mg orally) were almost identical. Nifedipine caused reflex tachycardia, while captopril caused slight bradycardia. Absence of compensatory tachycardia appears to be related to reduction of endogenous angiotensin II by captopril.U"
