    "1": "A retrospective analysis of the AIRE study was made, using previously published data from the clinical trial combined with local Spanish resource and cost data. A typical rehospitalisation for a heart failure episode would last an average of 11.6 days with an average cost of 350.80 per day. The incremental cost of ramipril per life-year gained in the baseline case was 1550.10 after 3.8 years of follow-up. Sensitivity analysis showed that the basic conclusions were robust in spite of extreme variations in the values of the key parameters of the model.", 
    "2": "The use of ramipril in addition to conventional treatment in heart failure patients after myocardial infarction is cost-effective both according to currently accepted international standards of what constitutes a cost-effective intervention and also indirectly by comparing the results with similar pharmaceutical products financed under the Spanish National Health System.", 
    "3": "In previous beta-blocker trials, post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients were essentially treated with a beta-blocker or placebo. In the CAPRICORN trial, patients were selected on the basis of a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) <40% following the index MI and randomised to carvedilol or placebo, in addition to modern secondary prophylaxis with ACE inhibitors, aspirin and statins. In 1959 patients with a mean LVEF of 33%, treatment with carvedilol over a mean follow-up period of 15 months reduced total mortality from 15.3% with placebo to 11.9% with carvedilol [relative risk reduction (RRR) =23%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) =3.4%]. The incidence of recurrent MI was reduced from 5.8 to 2.3% (RRR 41%, ARR 2.3%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death was 28 for the entire study period and 43 for 1 year of treatment. The results of the CAPRICORN trial are compared with three previous beta-blocker post-MI trials: the Gothenburg metoprolol trial (GMT), the Norwegian timolol trial (NTT) and the beta-blocker heart attack trial (BHAT). The RRRs for total mortality were 36% in the GMT and NTT, and 27% in BHAT. The respective NNTs for total mortality were 32, 18 and 38. NNT for 1 year of treatment was 25 in NTT and 80 in BHAT. The RRR for recurrent MIs were 28% in NTT and 16% in BHAT. The reduction of mortality and recurrent MIs in CAPRICORN is within the range of previous post-MI beta-blocker studies. In post-MI patients with LVEF<40%, add-on treatment with a beta-blocker should be given >48 h after initiation with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and then with a slow dose escalation as applied in CAPRICORN.", 
    "4": "Secondary amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis) is a well known cause of nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Several studies in patients with nephrotic syndrome have suggested a beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Angiotensin II (ATII) receptor antagonists effect on the long term is not known. In this study, we intended to study the effect of losartan, as an ATII receptor antagonist, on proteinuria and renal functions in patients with normotensive secondary amyloidosis. In total 44 patients with biopsy proven AA amyloidosis associated with nephrotic proteinuria were included. The first group of patients (n=22) was treated with losartan 50 mg/day. The second group of patients (n=22) did not receive any specific antiproteinuric treatment. Urinary protein loss was effectively lowered by losartan from 4.38 +/- 1.0 to 2.8 +/- 0.61 g/day (p<0.0001), whereas the control group showed a slight fall in proteinuria as 4.21 +/- 1.06 to 4.12 +/- 1.07 g/day (p = 0.176). Hypoalbuminemia improved significantly from 2.52 +/- 0.69 to 2.78 +/- 0.46 g/dl (p = 0.004), in the losartan group, whereas serum albumin had fallen in the control group from 2.44 +/- 0.57 to 2.27 +/- 0.41 (p = 0.041). Serum creatinine increased in the control group from 1.52 +/- 0.42 to 2.39 +/- 0.51 mg/dl (p<0.0001), and in the losartan group from 1.59 +/- 0.50 to 1.84 +/- 0.6 mg/dl (p<0.001), after 24 months of treatment. The ATII receptor blocker losartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to AA amyloidosis. Symptomatic treatment of proteinuria with losartan is therefore to be considered, especially with severe proteinuria even in normotensive patients.",

    "6": "Polyoma virus (PV) is a double-stranded DNA virus, member of the Papovaviridae family. BKV and JCV are the most studied in human pathology, whereas simian virus 40 (SV40) is pathogenic in the monkey and has been implicated in human carcinogenesis. PV is associated with renal and urinary tract pathology. The initial infection by PV occurs in childhood, probably by airways, and is usually asymptomatic. Subsequently, it remains latent in kidneys, tonsils and CNS and may reactivate in concomitance with significant T-cell dysfunction. Infection in immunocompromised patients can be clinically relevant. However, asymptomatic viruria may be detected in 0.3 % of individuals without a known history of immunodeficiency.", 
    "7": "We describe the case of a male patient, aged 31, admitted to our Unit for arterial hypertension and urinary abnormalities. He had a history of hemorrhagic cystitis in 1996 and persistent microscopic hematuria thereafter. Renal function was normal, arterial pressure well controlled with an ACE-inhibitor; urine culture was negative and most of the immunologic and rheumatologic tests were normal, with the exception of slightly reduced levels of C3 and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Serology for HCV, HBV, HIV and screening for tumor markers were negative. Renal ultrasonography displayed an increased reflectivity, as seen in medical nephropathies; no nephrolithiasis was found. Urinary cytology showed \"decoy cells\", as typically found in PV infection, whose presence was confirmed by n-PCR. Diagnosis at discharge from the hospital was primary arterial hypertension and urinary JCV infection. Currently, no treatment of proven efficacy against PV is available.", 
    "8": "We think that there is an increasing amount of evidence to include screening for PV in the diagnosis of urinary tract abnormalities of unknown origin, even in apparently immunocompetent patients. Urinary cytology, in experienced hands, may be a useful and relatively inexpensive first step diagnostic tool.", 
    "9": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of end-stage renal disease and is often associated with other macrovascular complications such as ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIR) have both been shown to have a protective effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy and have thus become the first choice for treatment of hypertension and/or renal involvement in patients with diabetes. However, most of these patients, especially those with type 2 diabetes, require two of more medications in order to reduce their blood pressure to the levels, which have been proposed in recently published consensus papers. These target blood pressure levels are 130/80 mm Hg in diabetic subjects with proteinuria of up to 1 g/day and 125/75 mm Hg in those with proteinuria in excess of 1 g/day. Combinations of different medications may have a synergistic effect. Some of the early studies using a combination of either a nondihydropyridine or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with ACE-I demonstrated a synergistic effect on proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, these studies have not been substantiated, but calcium channel blockers, with their proven ability to reduce blood pressure, play an important role in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. The combination of ACE-I with AIIR may have several theoretical advantages. Many studies using this combination have been performed in animal models of diabetes and in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease. Some of these studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of the combination on proteinuria or hypertension, but the results have not been consistent in all studies. It may be concluded that, until additional studies provide more convincing evidence, this combination could be used in patients whose proteinuria or hypertension has not responded to either one of the agents as monotherapy or to a combination of other medications.", 
    "10": "Thyroid hormone has unique actions that make it a novel and possibly useful agent for treatment of heart failure. Because of potential adverse effects of thyroid hormone, however, there has been interest in developing analogues with fewer undesirable side effects. Screening of compounds structurally related to levothyroxine identified 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) as an analogue with inotropic selectivity and low metabolic activity in hypothyroid rats. When DITPA was administered alone or in combination with captopril in rat and rabbit postinfarction models of heart failure, cardiac output was increased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LV EDP) was decreased without increasing heart rate. A pilot clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DITPA. In a dose-ranging study in 7 normal volunteers the drug was well tolerated. A double-blind comparison then was made of DITPA versus placebo in a group of 19 patients with moderately severe heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.875 mg/kg of DITPA or placebo daily. After 2 weeks the drug was increased to 3.75 mg/kg daily for an additional 2 weeks. In heart failure patients receiving the drug for 4 weeks, cardiac index was increased (p = 0.04) and systemic vascular resistance index was decreased (p = 0.02). Total serum cholesterol (p = 0.013) and triglycerides (p = 0.005) also were decreased significantly. These results indicate that DITPA is well tolerated and could represent a useful new agent for treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "11": "We have developed two enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods for determining enalapril and enalaprilat in plasma. In this study, 48 healthy subjects received an oral dose of either 10 or 20 mg of enalapril and plasma concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined by their specific ELISA methods. These plasma concentrations and blood pressure measurements were applied to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of both enalapril and enalaprilat. The enalapril values for the area under the curve (AUC(0)--> infinity ) were 480 +/- 216 and 832 +/- 325 ngh/mL, maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) were 310 +/- 187 and 481 +/- 185 ng/mL, and times required to reach the maximum concentration t(max) were 1.13 +/- 0.22 and 1.09 +/- 0.33 h for 10 and 20 mg doses, respectively. The enalaprilat values for AUC(0)--> infinity were 256 +/- 122 and 383 +/- 158 ngh/mL, C(max) values were 57 +/- 29 and 72.9 +/- 33.6 ng/mL and t(max) values were 4.28 +/- 1.45 and 4.05 +/- 01.22 h for 10 and 20 mg doses, respectively. The C(max) values of enalapril were approximately 10 times higher than those in the literature, which were determined by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition assays following alkaline hydrolysis, but similar to those of enalaprilat. The PD profiles revealed a significant correlation between enalaprilat concentrations in plasma and the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (r = -0.95 with P < 0.001 and r = -0.95 with P < 0.001), respectively, following a single oral dose of enalapril. These ELISA methods have the advantage of being simple, accurate, sensitive, and do not depend on enalaprilat binding to ACE. Such methods can be used for analysis and kinetic testing of enalapril and enalaprilat in biological fluids.", 
    "12": "The antiproteinuric effect of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist losartan was compared to that of the optimal antiproteinuric doses of monotherapy.", 
    "13": "To this purpose, lisinopril and losartan were studied in 9 nondiabetic renal patients with median proteinuria 4.5 g/day (95% CI, 3.5, 6.4), creatinine clearance of 80 mL/min (95% CI, 66, 96), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 102 mm Hg (95% CI, 93, 112). First, in two protocols with six-week treatment periods per dose, the optimal antiproteinuric dose of each drug was established in each patient. Losartan and lisinopril were used in randomized order, each preceded by a baseline period without medication. The doses of losartan (mg/day) were 50, 100, 150, and again 50. The lisinopril doses were 10, 20, 40, and again 10. After the second protocol, patients were treated with a combination, using the optimal antiproteinuric doses established for the individual drugs.", 
    "14": "The antiproteinuric response by losartan was optimal at 100 mg (-46%; 95% CI, -60, -24%), being larger than at the 50 mg dose (-27%; 95% CI, -42, -4%, P < 0.05), but not different from the 150 mg dose (-46%; 95% CI, -58; -20%). Proteinuria decreased further at each up-titration step of lisinopril to -75% (95% CI, -85, -43%) at the 40 mg dose. Combination therapy reduced proteinuria more effectively (-85%; 95% CI, -96, -58) than monotherapy with losartan, and to a lesser extent than with lisinopril. Optimal blood pressure responses were obtained at similar doses.", 
    "15": "Dose-titration with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, followed by add-on therapy is highly effective in order to reduce proteinuria. The safety of this regimen needs to be addressed in future studies.", 
    "16": "Despite the accumulating evidence of their efficacy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) still provide imperfect renoprotection. Up-titration above conventional doses and combined therapy with other antiproteinuric agents may serve to achieve renoprotection in patients at risk of rapid disease progression.", 
    "17": "The effect of maximum tolerated ACEi doses (ramipril 15 mg/day, range 5 to 20) alone or combined with indomethacin (75 mg x 2/day) on urinary protein excretion (UPE) and glomerular barrier size-selective function was evaluated in 19 patients with chronic non-diabetic nephropathies and persistent proteinuria.", 
    "18": "Maximum ramipril doses decreased UPE more effectively than non-ACEi therapy. Proteinuria reduction was associated with significant reduction (>50%) of the non-selective glomerular membrane shunt, but did not correlate with concomitant changes in arterial pressure and renal hemodynamics, nor was it influenced by treatment duration. The reduction in UPE and sieving coefficient of the largest neutral dextrans exceeded by twofold the reduction achieved by conventional ACEi doses in historical controls with similar renal dysfunction and proteinuria, previously studied under identical experimental conditions. Indomethacin did not influence renal effects of maximum ramipril doses and was prematurely withdrawn in six patients because of reversible side effects. Serum potassium significantly increased only in combination with indomethacin and never required treatment withdrawal.", 
    "19": "Up-titration to maximally tolerated doses safely increases ACEi antiproteinuric effect and may serve to achieve maximum renoprotection in the long-term. Combination with indomethacin is poorly tolerated and ineffective. Innovative approaches are needed to use ACEi more effectively.", 
    "20": "Normalization of proteinuria and even regression of glomerulosclerosis seem to occur in progressive renal disease upon blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Here we quantified the effect of a combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist on renal function and structure in spontaneous overt nephropathy in male Munich Wistar Fromter (MWF) rats.", 
    "21": "Three groups of MWF rats were used: group 1 was studied at 25 weeks to provide baseline renal function and structure; group 2 was followed until 40 weeks of age; group 3 was treated with lisinopril (40 mg/L) and valsartan (180 mg/L) in drinking water from 25 to 40 weeks. A group of untreated Wistar rats (group 4, 40 weeks) was used as the control. At the end of the study renal hemodynamics, kidney tissue morphology, accumulation of type III collagen and evaluation of interstitial inflammatory cells were performed.", 
    "22": "MWF rats spontaneously developed hypertension, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial volume expansion and protein cast accumulation. Combined treatment completely reversed protein excretion and ameliorated renal plasma flow and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. The combined therapy was effective in halting progressive glomerulosclerosis, particularly in glomeruli with mild sclerotic lesions, and reduced interstitial volume expansion. Type III collagen accumulation and protein cast also were reversed. Infiltrating cells were massively present in the interstitium already at 25 weeks, and augmented at 40 weeks in untreated rats. Combined treatment reduced infiltrating cells to values comparable to normal controls.", 
    "23": "These data indicate that in animals with spontaneous overt nephropathy, Ang II antagonism normalized proteinuria, eliminated inflammatory cell infiltration, and ameliorated glomerular and tubular structural changes.", 
    "24": "A new flow injection chemiluminescence method is described for the determination of captopril. It is based on the enhancing effect of captopril on the chemiluminescence reaction of luminol with potassium ferricyanide in alkaline solution in the presence of potassium ferrocyanide. The method allows the determination of captopril over 0.1-40 microg/mL range, with a relative standard deviation (SD) of 1.0% for the determination of 0.5 microg/mL captopril solution in 11 repeated measurements. The method was satisfactorily applied to the determination of captopril in commercial captopril tablets. The possible reaction mechanism is also discussed briefly.", 
    "25": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the progression of various fibrotic renal diseases both in humans and in animal models. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is an animal model of accelerated renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis that is attenuated by ACE inhibition. Although ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin concentrations in addition to their effect on angiotensin II formation, the role of bradykinin in renal fibrosis has not been studied. We show here that genetic ablation (B2(-/-) mice) or pharmacological blockade of the bradykinin B2 receptor increases UUO-induced interstitial fibrosis in mice, whereas transgenic rats expressing increased endogenous bradykinin show reduced UUO-induced interstitial fibrosis. The increased interstitial fibrosis in B2(-/-) mice was accompanied by a decreased activity of plasminogen activators (PAs) and metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), enzymes involved in ECM degradation, suggesting that the protective effects of bradykinin involve activation of a B2 receptor/PA/MMP-2 cascade. This ability of bradykinin to increase PA activity was confirmed in primary culture proximal tubular cells. Thus, in both mice and rats, bradykinin B2 receptor activation reduces renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in vivo, most likely by increasing ECM degradation.", 
    "26": "1 In previous studies on the renal targeting of the ACE inhibitor captopril, we demonstrated that a 6 fold increased concentration of this drug could be obtained in the kidney after conjugation to the low-molecular-weight protein lysozyme. In this study, we investigated in unrestrained rats whether systemic administration of captopril-lysozyme also results in an enhanced effect on renal parameters, relative to the systemic effects. 2 Renal effects: intravenous infusion of captopril-lysozyme for 6 h resulted in a more pronounced increment of renal blood flow (31+/-2% vs 17+/-4% at 0.5 mg kg(-1) 6h(-1), P<0.01) and an approximately 5 fold enhanced natriuresis (167+/-17% vs 36+/-7% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001) in comparison with equimolar amounts of captopril as a free drug. In correspondence with these findings, renal ACE inhibition was potentiated approximately 5 fold (-50+/-4% vs -22+/-3% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001). 3 Systemic effects: conjugated captopril did not affect blood pressure in dosages up to 5 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1). This effect coincided with a less pronounced inhibition of the pressor response to intravenously administered angiotensin I (-12+/-3% vs -66+/-5% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001), and a markedly attenuated plasma ACE inhibition (-19+/-2% vs -37+/-3% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001) compared to an equivalent dose of free captopril. 4 An experiment of continued intravenous administration of captopril-lysozyme for 7 days in nephrotic syndrome demonstrated that the conjugate is also active in renal disease: the antiproteinuric response was substantially augmented (-67+/-5% vs -15+/-7% at 4 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1), P<0.001) compared to the free drug, in the absence of blood pressure reduction. 5 These data demonstrate that intravenous administration of a captopril-lysozyme conjugate leads to more selective renal ACE inhibition and enhanced renal effects as well as less systemic effects compared to captopril itself.", 
    "27": "Effects of beraprost sodium, a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, on renal dysfunction in an experimental rat model of glomerulonephritis were investigated. Beraprost sodium (30, 100 and 300 microg/kg) was orally given twice daily from the late stage of nephritis in which renal dysfunction was already developed. Beraprost sodium treatment inhibited the increase in urinary protein, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and the decrease in creatinine clearance. The elevation of serum creatinine was also inhibited by predonisolone (1 mg/kg). However, captopril (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) and dipyridamole (20 and 60 mg/kg) failed to inhibit the elevation of serum creatinine. In the beraprost sodium-treated nephritic rats, the increase in mRNA levels for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and collagen in the kidney was inhibited. These results suggest that beraprost sodium ameliorates developed renal dysfunction and is possibly an effective agent for the treatment of human glomerulonephritis.", 
    "28": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) effectively interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and exert various beneficial actions on cardiac and vascular structure and function, beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function, cardiac and vascular remodeling, retard the anatomic progression of atherosclerosis, and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Therefore, these agents are recommended in the treatment of a wide range of patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including those with coronary disease, prior stroke, peripheral arterial disease, high-risk diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure. ARBs are effective blood pressure- lowering and renoprotective agents and can be used in heart failure in patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors. The role of ARBs in the prevention of atherosclerosis and its sequelae is currently under investigation. The use of combined ACE inhibitor plus ARB therapy offers theoretical advantages over the use of each of these agents alone and is also under investigation in large, randomized clinical trials.", 
    "29": "Despite widespread use to treat childhood hypertension, enalapril has never been studied systematically to determine effectiveness, dose response, and safety in a pediatric population. This study was conducted prospectively in 110 hypertensive children ages 6 to 16 years in two sequential phases. The primary outcome variable for both phases of the study was trough (24-h postdose) sitting diastolic blood pressure. The primary objective of the first phase of the study was to determine whether enalapril lowered blood pressure in children in a dose-dependent manner. During a 2-week, double-blind, randomized, dose-response period, patients were stratified by weight (< 50 kg or > or = 50 kg), then assigned to one of three dosing groups: low(0.625 or 1.25 mg), middle (2.5 or 5 mg), or high dose (20 or 40 mg). Reduction in blood pressure was examined as a function of dose ratio (1:4:32) and on a weight-adjusted basis. On completion of the dose-response phase of the study, patients entered a 2-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal to either enalapril or placebo. Antihypertensive effectiveness, defined as the difference in sitting diastolic blood pressure between the placebo and enalapril groups, was determined. Adverse events were carefully recorded throughout the study. The dose-response relationship for enalapril had a negative slope and was linear over the chosen dosing range, suggesting that larger doses of enalapril were associated with a greater reduction in blood pressure. Randomized withdrawal to active drug orplacebo confirmed the antihypertensive effectiveness of enalapril in the middle- and high-dose groups. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was maintained across age, gender, race, and Tanner stage. Enalapril appears to be an effective and generally well-tolerated antihypertensive agent in children ages 6 to 16 years. An initial dose of 2.5 mg in children weighing < 50 kg and 5 mg in children weighing > 50 kg (mean = 0.08 mg/kg) administered once daily effectively lowered blood pressure within 2 weeks in most patients. Blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion, with larger doses resulting in a greater reduction.", 
    "30": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or kininase II is a dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and inactivates bradykinin in the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Angiotensin converting enzyme-like activity (ACELA) has been demonstrated in a wide range of vertebrates, and only in lampreys is a lack of ACELA still suggested. Though long controversial, a lamprey RAS has recently been identified by isolation and sequencing of lamprey Ang I and the measurement of circulating plasma angiotensins. We therefore re-investigated the presence of ACE in tissues from the river lamprey or lampern, Lampetra fluviatilis, using a highly sensitive fluorimetric assay. Significant detection of ACELA was found in a wide range of lamprey tissues (brain, gill, gonad, gut, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, skin, kidney, and plasma). The mammalian ACE inhibitor captopril at 10(-5)M was an effective, but variable inhibitor of the ACELA found in most lamprey tissues. The brain contained the highest ACELA, while kidney (including urinary duct), skin, gonads, and heart only contained very low ACELA. In most tissues, ACELA was similar in lampreys acclimated to freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW). However, gut ACELA was significantly higher in lampreys acclimated to SW than in FW-acclimated lampreys. Liver, skin, and gonad ACELA was significantly lower in lampreys acclimated to SW than in FW lampreys. Male and female lampreys acclimated to FW showed similar ACELA in all tissues except the kidney (including the urinary duct), where ACELA was significantly higher in male than in female lampreys. These results indicate that ACELA, a component of the RAS and KKS, is present in tissues from one of the earliest evolved groups of vertebrates.", 
    "31": "The effect of aminoguanidine (AG) against toxicity of paraquat (PQ), an oxidative-stress inducing substance, in mice was investigated. A single dose of PQ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) induced lung-toxicity, manifested by significant decrease of the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in lung tissue indicating pulmonary capillary endothelial cell damage. Lung toxicity was further evidenced by significant decrease of total sulfhydryl (-SH) content and significant increase in lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) in lung tissues. Oral pretreatment of mice with AG (50 mg/kg) in drinking water, starting 5 days before PQ injection and continuing during the experimental period, ameliorated the lung toxicity induced by PQ. This was evidenced by a significant increase in the levels of ACE activity, a significant decrease in lung MDA content and a significant increase in the total sulfhydryl content 24 h after PQ administration. Moreover, pretreatment of mice with AG leads to an increase of the LD(50) value of paraquat. These results indicate that AG is an efficient cytoprotective agent against PQ-induced lung toxicity.", 
    "32": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of losartan on blood pressure (BP), creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and to assess metabolic parameters in comparison with ACEI. Thirty-three type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty patients were randomized to receive 50 mg/day losartan and 13 patients to 10 mg/day fosinopril. Patients were studied at baseline and after 1 and 6 months. BP was significantly decreased in both groups at the end of the 1st and 6th month to a similar extent. Ccr had fallen in both groups at the end of 1st and 6th months. The effect of each drug on Ccr was similar (64.2+/-70.6 and 42.8+/-53.8 ml/min, respectively, NS). In the subgroup with microalbuminuria at baseline, UAE rate was lower in both groups at the end of the 1st and 6th months. However, when compared with the end of 1st month, the antiproteinuric effect of losartan was slightly decreased at the end of 6th month. Metabolic parameters did not change with either drug. Both drugs were well tolerated. Thus the antihypertensive effects of the two drugs were comparable. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of losartan as an antihypertensive drug in diabetic patients.",

    "34": "Human PBM were allowed to differentiate to macrophages for 0-7 days and ACE amount was measured during differentiation. Experiments with TNF-alpha were performed after 2 days of differentiation. Cell cultures were incubated with TNF-alpha (0.5-10ng/ml) without or with SB 202190 (5microM), or PD 98059 (40microM). ACE amounts were measured by an inhibitor binding assay (IBA) and ACE mRNA levels by RNase protection assay (RPA). Activated p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases were measured by Western Blot analysis using phospho-p44/42 and -p38 MAPK antibodies.", 
    "35": "ACE amount increased by 40-fold along with macrophage differentiation. TNF-alpha caused dose dependent suppression of the amount of ACE and decreased levels of ACE mRNA. TNF-alpha activated p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases, which was inhibited by the specific inhibitors of these kinases, PD98059 or SB202190, respectively. Pretreatment of the cells with SB 202190, or PD 98059 both partly reversed TNF-alpha induced ACE suppression.", 
    "36": "TNF-alpha downregulated ACE, which effect was probably mediated by both p44/42 and p38 MAPK pathways. Local downregulation of ACE by TNF-alpha may be a counterbalancing mechanism in inflammatory processes.", 
    "37": "We investigated the effect of endogenous bradykinin on adrenaline-induced pulmonary edema (PE) by blocking bradykinin receptors. In preliminary experiments, a bolus injection of adrenaline (ADR; 10 microg/kg) solution (10 microg/ml) was determined to be an edematogenic dose for inducing PE. The lung body weight index (LBI) and incidence of PE (IPE) were determined. The IPE and LBI of the group pretreated with Des-Arg9-[Leu8]-Bradykinin (DA-BK, 50 microg/kg, 50 microg/ml) increased significantly compared with those of the control group (p<0.05). On the other hand, there were no remarkable changes in IPE and LBI in the groups pretreated with Hoe140 (D-Arginyl-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-Bradykinin (100 microg/kg, 100 microg/ml), captopril (20 mg/kg, 20 mg/ml) or L-NAME (1 mg/kg, 1 mg/ml). Moreover, the IPE and LBI of the group co-treated with L-NAME and DA-BK decreased compared with the DA-BK group (p<0.05). Thus, bradykinin aggravates adrenaline-induced PE through activation of the B2 receptor by the kallikreins as a result of the ADR administration, although the precise mechanism is not known.", 
    "38": "The association between change in glucose metabolism and change in skeletal muscle magnesium (Mg) concentration induced by antihypertensive treatment was evaluated in 37 patients with essential hypertension randomly treated with either lisinopril or bendrofluazide. Before and after 6 months of treatment, skeletal muscle biopsies were performed, glucose tolerance was determined by oral (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT), and insulin sensitivity was assessed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. An inverse relationship was found between the treatment-induced change in fasting plasma glucose concentration and change in skeletal muscle Mg concentration (r = -0.39, P < .05). However, there was no significant correlation between skeletal muscle Mg content and either insulin sensitivity measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test or glucose tolerance evaluated by IVGTT and OGTT. In conclusion, an increased circulating glucose concentration was correlated with a decreased Mg concentration in skeletal muscle during antihypertensive treatment. However, the Mg concentration in skeletal muscle did not significantly predict the insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance.",

Various effects of these substances on drinking behavior were observed. PPC of A-I became a dipsogenic agent as compared with the native one. Moreover, PPC of A-II facilitated selectively learned and not natural forms of drinking behavior. It's suggested that PPC of angiotensins play a specific role in endogenous mechanisms of thirst.

    "45": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is almost always associated with high arterial blood pressure. Adequate control of hypertension slows down the progression of the disease, Inhibitors of angiotenzin-converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors) have proved to be very efficacious in decreasing high blood pressure. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of ACE inhibitor enalapril on the progression of CRF in patients with diabetic nephropathy and nephropathies of other origin. During 1998 and 1999 thirty patients (20 males and 10 females, aged 525 +/- 1.3) have been followed-up at the Department of Nephrology, Clinical Centre of Serbia. On regular monthly controls serum creatinine, urea, calcium and protein levels, creatinine clearance, and blood pressure, were measured. All patients were suggested a low protein diet. Progression of the disease was expressed by the slope of the regression line showing reciprocal serum creatinine values. Proteinaemia was significantly higher in diabetic patients after 12 months (p < 0.35), but in the next 12 months the difference between groups disappeared. The same patients had significantly lower serum urea (p < 0.05) after 24 months and creatinine values (p < 0.05) during the whole study. Other variables changed in the same manner and with similar progression in both groups. The direction of slope lines suggested recovery of kidney function in both examined groups. However, a smaller slope in patients with diabetic nephropathy together with other results showed that enalapril had better influence on slowing down the progression of CRF in this group of patients.",

The recent experimental and clinical studies especially emphasized the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the regulation of hypertension and slowing down of CRF progression, but there are still issues for discussion and disagreement [2-14]. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of captopril on clinical, biochemical and morphological changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy.",

Rats were killed at weeks 6, 12 or 18 after the second adriamycin injection, when the kidneys were removed and fixed in neutral buffered formalin (10%). Paraffin embedded tissue sections 4 microns thick were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS), Thrichrom Masson and Silver methanamin (Jones) for light microscopic study. A semiquantitative score was used to evaluate glomerular, vascular and tubulointerstitial changes. A minimum of 60 glomeruli for each kidney were examined, and the severity of the lesions was graduated according to the percentage of glomerular sclerosis from 0 to 10 (0--0%; 2--20%; 5--20-50%; 10--100%) [16]. Vascular changes were graduated from 0 to 3 according to hyalinosis in the walls of the artenoles (1--0%; 2--< 50%; 3--50-100%; 4--100%) [17].

    "49": "Captopril decreased systemic blood pressure in ADR SHR significantly, but failed to prevent proteinuria (Fig. 1). Urea and creatinine in serum progressively increased in all studied groups, but faster in ADR SHR groups than in controls (Table 1). Creatinine clearance decreased faster in ADR group than in ADR-C group, but without statistical significance (Table 1). Among sixty nine analysed rats at the beginning of the study, sixteen died during the study. The other animals (Table 1) were killed at weeks 6, 12 and 18; pathohistological changes of their kidneys with glomerular, vascular and tubulomterstial indexes are presented in Table 2. In control group of rats minimal glomerular and interstitial changes could be seen in week 18, mild tubular changes were present in weeks 12 and 18, and marked changes in blood vessels were manifested in week 12, as well as in week 18 (Fig. 2, Table 2), when their statistical significance was higher than in rats treated with adriamycin. Glomerular, tubular and interstitial changes were mostly pronounced in adriamycin treated rats and became more expressive during the experiment (Table 2, Fig. 3). In ADR-C group of rats captopril slowed down glomerular changes, but significantly in week 18 only (Table 2). The same was with interstitial changes (Table 2, Figs. 3-c, 4-c). Tubular and vascular changes were less in week 6 in ADR-C group than in ADR group, what was leveled off later in the study (weeks 12 and 18) (Table 2).", 
    "50": "Although Richard Bright was probably the first person to notice that severe renal diseases were associated with changes of the cardiovascular system, Volhard and Farhr first described that high blood pressure was the major cause of progressive loss of renal function in chronic renal diseases [1]. Subsequently, many authors in their experimental and clinical studies described the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on regulation of blood pressure and slowing down of CRF progression. Various experimental models were used in their studies [8, 19-21]. With discovery of ACE inhibitors and first studies which pointed that this group of drugs effectively slowed down CRF progression, many authors studied their effects on systemic blood pressure regulation, reduction of glomerular hypertension and slowing down of CRF progression. Anderson, Rennke and Brenner studied the effects of \"triple therapy\" (reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorotiazide) and ACE inhibitor enalapril in rats with subtotal nephrectomy [3]. Enalapril decreased systemic blood pressure, glomerular hypertension, proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis [9, 22-24], while \"triple therapy\" reduced only systemic hypertension with no effect on glomerular hypertension and glomerular damage [25]. The same was described in uninephrectomised DOCA rats [26]. Raij and colleagues also described better effects of enalapril in relation to \"triple therapy\": enalapril reduced mesangial expansion and proteinuria [27]. Our study [8] as well as that of other authors [3, 25, 26] agree that ACE inhibitor captopril was better in comparison with hydralazine in slowing down glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion inspite of good regulation of blood pressure with both drugs. In ADR SHR, ACE inhibitors reduced proteinuria [6, 10, 20, 25], regulated systemic blood pressure (Fig. 1-a), decreased glomerular hypertension and glomerular sclerosis [7, 10, 25, 28, 29] which were also found in our experimental study (Fig. 1, Table 2). These were confirmed in clinical studies too: first, in patients with diabetic nephropathy [30] and later in patients with nondiabetic kidney diseases [6, 30-34]. In SHRs blood pressure increased from week 4 to 10, and after week 12 blood pressure was stabilized on a constantly higher level [36]. Our studied rats were 24 weeks old at the beginning of the study and they had stable hypertension in that period (Fig. 1-a). With the age in SHRs renal function aggravated very slowly, with little changes in glomeruli, higher in tubuloniterstitium [19] and the highest in blood vessels. SHRs developed glomerular changes very late inspite of hypertension, because glomeruli were protected with preglomerular vasoconstriction [37]. These mild changes described by various authors could be also seen in our study (Fig. 2, Table 2). Pathohistological changes in rat kidneys caused with anthracycline were first described by Stenberg and Phillips in 1967 [41]. Adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) induced syndrome nephroticum. Light microscopic study revealed no changes at the beginning of the study, but later (7-9 months) glomerular sclerosis, tubular dilatation and interstitial fibrosis developed which led to chronic renal failure [42, 43], (Fig. 3). Therapy with ACE inhibitor, captopril, in rats with adriamycin nephropathy lowered glomerular sclerosis [7, 12, 25, 28, 29], and mesangial expansion was very rare. In our earlier studies, captopril was found to decrease glomerular sclerosis in the early phase of adriamycin nephropathy in SHRs [8, 29], what was also confirmed in this study: captopril decreased glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes in weeks 6, 12 and 18 after second adriamycin injection, but had no effect on vascular changes (Fig. 4, Table 2). Favorable effects of captopril on tubulointerstiatial changes (especially interstitial) are very important because many authors have described recently better correlation between tubulointerstitial changes and CRF progression [17, 44-46], in comparison to glomerular changes and CRF. Besides, some authors have confirmed better effects of ACE inhibitors when they were given earlier before glomeruli were damaged [47].",

    "52": "We have reported that an increased intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activity may be responsible for the reduction in renal plasma flow (RPF) in apparently healthy blacks in comparison to healthy whites during high salt balance. To ascertain whether these differences only exist in the high salt state, we performed the following study, concentrating on the manipulation of the renin system during low salt intake. We measured in 19 healthy blacks and 22 healthy whites para-aminohippurate and inulin clearances as an indication of RPF and glomerular filtration rate, respectively, on both high (200 mmol/d) and low (10 mmol/d) salt balance in random order. A subset of 11 blacks and 12 whites additionally received an angiotensin II infusion while in low salt balance (3 ng/kg per minute for 45 minutes) and captopril to assess differences in RPF response to a converting enzyme inhibitor. The 19 whites had significantly higher RPF when compared with blacks (P=0.033) when studied on high salt. However, during low salt balance, the RPFs were comparable in the 2 groups. Plasma renin activity was similar in the 2 groups on both diets. In the subset that received angiotensin II and captopril while in low salt balance, the renal vascular response was not different in whites and blacks. These data provide additional support for the concept that the intrarenal tissue renin system is more active in blacks than whites on a typical (high salt) diet and that the difference reflects primarily incomplete tissue renin suppression with an increase in salt intake. The mechanism involved may contribute to the increased susceptibility to renal injury in blacks.", 
    "53": "The possible role of calcineurin in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor was investigated in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. The effect of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 was also studied. DS rats progressively developed severe hypertension when fed a diet containing 8% NaCl from 7 weeks of age. In addition, marked cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were apparent and the activity of calcineurin and its mRNA expression in the myocardium was increased in these animals at 12 weeks in comparison with age-matched Dahl salt-resistant rats. The abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNAs was also increased in the hearts of DS rats at 12 weeks. Treatment of DS rats with a non-antihypertensive dose of the selective AT1 receptor blocker candesartan (1 mg/kg per day) or FK506 (0.1 mg/kg per day) from 7 to 12 weeks attenuated both calcineurin activity and its mRNA expression in the heart, as well as the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, without affecting cardiac function. Treatment with candesartan, but not FK506, prevented the upregulation of ACE and TGF-beta1 gene expression. Both candesartan and FK506 prevented the load-induced induction of fetal-type cardiac genes. These results demonstrate that AT1 receptor blockade attenuates the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as well as the activation of calcineurin, without an antihypertensive effect, in rats with salt-sensitive hypertension. Calcineurin may be downstream from TGF-beta1 in AT1 receptor-mediated angiotensin II signaling in vivo.", 
    "54": "N-Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is a specific substrate for the N-terminal site of ACE and increases 5-fold during ACE inhibitor therapy. It is known to inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and has also recently been reported to inhibit the growth of cardiac fibroblasts. We investigated its mode of action in cardiac fibroblasts by assessing its influence on transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta1)-mediated Smad signaling. AcSDKP inhibited the proliferation of isolated cardiac fibroblasts (P<0.05) but significantly stimulated the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Flow cytometry of rat cardiac fibroblasts treated with AcSDKP showed significant inhibition of the progression of cells from G0/G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle. In cardiac fibroblasts transfected with a Smad-sensitive luciferase reporter construct, AcSDKP decreased luciferase activity by 55+/-9.7% (P=0.01). Moreover, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 was decreased in cardiac fibroblasts treated with AcSDKP. To conclude, AcSDKP inhibits the growth of cardiac fibroblasts and also inhibits TGFbeta1-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2. Because AcSDKP increases substantially during ACE inhibitor therapy, this suggests a novel pathway independent of angiotensin II, by which ACE inhibitors can inhibit cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "55": "The efficacy and tolerability of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, was assessed when added to existing antihypertensive therapy with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Hypertensive patients (n=341) whose blood pressure (BP) was not controlled despite ACE inhibitor or ARB were randomized (double-blind) to receive 50 mg eplerenone (increasing to 100 mg if required) once daily or placebo for 8 weeks. Diastolic and systolic BP and adverse events were recorded. By study end (week 8), mean seated diastolic BP was significantly reduced from week 0 among patients receiving eplerenone/ARB (-12.7+/-0.81 mm Hg) compared with those receiving placebo/ARB (-9.3+/-0.83 mm Hg). The change in mean seated diastolic BP was -9.9+/-0.88 mm Hg in eplerenone/ACE inhibitor patients and -8.0+/-0.86 mm Hg in placebo/ACE inhibitor patients (P=NS). Systolic BP levels were also significantly lower at week 8 for eplerenone/ACE inhibitor (-13.4+/-1.35 mm Hg) and eplerenone/ARB (-16.0+/-1.37 mm Hg) patients, respectively, compared with placebo/ACE inhibitor (-7.5+/-1.31 mm Hg) and placebo/ARB patients (-9.2+/-1.41 mm Hg). Adverse events were generally nonsevere and not significantly different between eplerenone and placebo. This study demonstrated that in patients whose BP was not controlled with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, the addition of eplerenone over an 8-week period significantly lowered systolic BP in both groups and diastolic BP in ARB patients. Selective aldosterone blockade with eplerenone, therefore, may be useful add-on therapy in hypertensive patients inadequately controlled on ACE inhibitor or ARB alone.", 
    "56": "ACE inhibition protects the heart against ischemic injury by reducing angiotensin II and promoting bradykinin (BK) accumulation. Since neutral endopeptidase (NEP) metabolizes BK, we determined its activity after induction of myocardial infarction (MI) and examined whether it is influenced by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor blocker. Rats were studied 6 days and 3 wk after coronary occlusion. Starting 48 h after MI induction, additional animals were treated with the ACE inhibitor quinapril (2 mg x kg(-1) x day-1) or the AT1 blocker irbesartan (50 mg x kg(-1) x day-1). Animals were hemodynamically characterized. Finally, NEP-specific activity and BK concentrations were detected in homogenates of heart compartments. Quinapril and irbesartan treatment improved left ventricular function 6 days and 3 wk after MI induction, and NEP activity was elevated only in the infarcted area of untreated compared with sham-operated rats. After 6 days, irbesartan reversed this increase by 80% and quinapril by 35%. Quinapril had no effect after 3 wk, whereas irbesartan almost completely blocked the increased NEP activity in the infarcted area and concomitantly induced a further rise in the BK concentrations. These results indicate mechanisms of NEP regulation influenced by the AT1 receptor. Our data suggest that NEP is more decisive than ACE in mediating BK degradation and may indicate BK involvement in the cardioprotective effects of AT1 antagonists.",

Amadori-albumin levels at baseline were associated with C-reactive protein and fibrinogen (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0001, respectively). C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were also associated with albumin excretion rates (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively) and retinopathy status (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0006, respectively). Adjustment for these inflammatory markers did not markedly attenuate the association between Amadori-albumin and the albumin excretion rate, while adjustment for fibrinogen, but not C-reactive protein, abolished the association between Amadori-albumin and retinopathy. Lisinopril had no impact on the association between the levels of Amadori-albumin and albumin excretion rates or retinopathy.",

    "61": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US is rising at an alarming rate, with the largest increase among African-American populations. The key risk factors for kidney disease are hypertension and diabetes, which are both becoming more prevalent in the US, and particularly in African Americans. Although African Americans make up 12.6% of the US population, the incidence of diabetes-related ESRD is four times higher than for whites, and the prevalence of ESRD due to hypertension is twice that of white patients. Approximately 30 to 40% of all patients with diabetes will develop nephropathy and many will progress to ESRD, necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation. Recent studies in patients with type 2 diabetes indicate a significant delay in progression or development of diabetic nephropathy following blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the use of angiotensin receptor antagonists. Early intervention in patients with hypertension is necessary to prevent kidney damage, and data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in this population. Although African-American patients receiving hemodialysis appear to have increased survival compared with whites, racial factors and poor access to medical care contribute to the increased risk of kidney disease in minorities. A concerted effort is necessary to raise awareness in minority populations and provide strategies for prevention and early treatment thereby attenuating the increasing prevalence of kidney failure in these groups.", 
    "62": "The complex hypotensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) results not only from inhibition of converting not active angiotensin I to strong vasoconstrictor-angiotensin II but also from diminution of inactivation of potent vasodilator-bradykinin. Bradykinin promotes generation by endothelium such substances as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, prostacyclin and nitric oxide. Simultaneous therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, which inhibits synthesis of prostanoids, and ACEI may block one of potent hypotensive mechanisms of ACEI. This study indicates that concomitant therapy with 150 mg of aspirin per day does not reduce hypotensive efficacy of enalapril.", 
    "63": "Essential hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Its pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggests that deformability and aggregation of red blood cells may play an important role in the regulation of blood rheology in hypertension. Simultaneously there are reports suggesting that antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) could be counteracted by high doses of aspirin. We postulate that these effects could be related to the changes in blood rheology. Accordingly we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low or high dose of aspirin on deformability and aggregability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Deformability and aggregability of red blood cells were measured by laser diffractometer (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and computerized automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on deformability and aggregation of red blood cells were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (group I: 10 patients receiving placebo, group II: 23 patients receiving 75 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days, and group III: 23 patients receiving 300 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive agents consisting of: one of ACEI (enalapril or perindopril), one of beta-antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and diuretic agent (indapamid). In patients receiving high dose of aspirin (300 mg/day) we observed that erythrocyte aggregability was 25% higher than in the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs MEA = 20.6 +/- 3 SD, p < 0.05). Aspirin had no effects on deformability of erythrocytes or on arterial blood pressure. High doses of aspirin or possibly also other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy can directly affect rheological properties of the blood due to the activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased aggregation of red blood cells during antihypertensive therapy may be an important indicator of the worsening of organ perfusion.", 
    "64": "Nephropathy is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Type 1 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria is the best marker of the consequent risk for its development in adults. In the paediatric population, puberty has long been recognised as a major risk period for the development of microangiopathic complications, although it is not necessarily associated with the progression to frank proteinuria. In fact, as many as 50% of subjects might revert to normoalbuminuria. Hypertension is a further risk factor and accelerates the progression of micro and macrovascular complications. There is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce renal damage by one or more mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects and they are the drug class of choice for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. However, as angiotensin II receptor antagonists are more specific they might become the obvious treatment choice in the near future. There is no consensus on who should be treated with reno-protective drugs in the paediatric population, and when this should occur, due to the lack of a clear definition of the natural history of microalbuminuria in this age group. In this review controversial aspects of this issue are presented and discussed.", 
    "65": "The pharmacological treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina, non-ST- and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) is dynamic and continues to evolve. Expert guidelines based on the results of clinical trials for the management of different types of ACS have been published. In both ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin/clopidogrel, heparin/low molecular weight heparin/direct thrombin inhibitors, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are part of the routine regimens. In patients with ST-segment elevation MI, eligibility for thrombolytic therapy needs to be determined and utilised as soon as possible. In patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI, the risks of thrombolytic therapy outweigh the benefits. The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has become increasingly important. The use of antihyperlipidaemic agents for the prevention of secondary events in both types of patients continue to be essential and the early aggressive use of lipid-lowering therapy also plays a role in improving endothelial function and stabilising atherosclerotic plaques.", 
    "66": "Pharmacological and clinical studies on the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors support the idea of a central role played Angiotensin II which is able to cause cardiovascular and renal diseases also independently of its blood pressure elevating effects. The present investigation was aimed at evaluating the effect(s) of three different pharmacological regimens on both blood pressure and sympathetic drive in uncomplicated essential hypertension, by means of blood pressure laboratory measurements and ambulatory monitoring, 24-h heart rate variability and plasma noradrenaline levels. Thus, an ACE-inhibitor monotherapy (trandolapril, 2 mg/day), an AT(1)-receptor antagonist monotherapy (irbesartan, 300 mg/day), their low-dose combination (0.5 mg/day plus 150 mg/day, respectively) and placebo were given, in a randomised, single-blind, crossover fashion for a period of 3 weeks each to 12 mild essential hypertensives. Power spectral analysis (short recordings) and noradrenaline measurements were also performed in the supine position and after a postural challenge (60 degrees head-up tilting test: HUT). The low-dose combination therapy induced the greatest reduction in LF component and in LF/HF ratio, both in the resting and tilted positions, as well as in blood pressure. However, the physiological autonomic response to HUT was maintained. Noradrenaline plasma levels were lower after the combined therapy than after each drug alone. Our data demonstrate that in mild and uncomplicated essential hypertension, the chronic low-dose combination therapy with an ACE-inhibitor and an AT(1)-antagonist is more effective than the recommended full-dose monotherapy with either drug in influencing the autonomic regulation of the heart, suggesting a relative reduction in sympathetic drive both at cardiac and systemic levels.",

Medical records of 2416 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were prescribed initial antihypertensive monotherapy by general practitioners in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were evaluated. Comparisons were made among the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA) irbesartan, all other antihypertensive classes (including AIIRAs other than irbesartan), and the AIIRA losartan. Patients initiated on the AIIRA irbesartan scored highest with a persistence rate of 60.8%, followed by patients who received all other AIIRA agents with a persistence rate of 51.3%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and losartan were associated with comparable persistence rates, between 42.0% and 49.7%. Patients who received diuretics scored lowest with a persistence rate of 34.4%. Persistence has emerged as an essential factor for blood pressure control. Prescribing an antihypertensive agent that provides a favourable efficacy and tolerability profile may provide greater persistence with therapy and hence a higher level of blood pressure control.",

Furthermore, the effect of treatment with the ACE inhibitor, quinapril, on levels of endothelial dysfunction markers were studied. The levels of adhesion molecules (intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], E-selectin, P-selectin), von Willebrand factor (vWf) and endothelin-1 were measured in patients with hypertension without any other risk factors of atherosclerosis before and after treatment with quinapril (n = 22) and in normotensive controls (n = 22). Compared with normotensive subjects, the hypertensive patients had significantly higher levels of ICAM-1 (238 vs 208 ng/ml, P = 0.02), vWf (119 vs 105 IU/dl, P < 0.05) and endothelin-1 (5.76 vs 5.14 fmol/ml, P < 0.05). Three-month treatment of hypertensive patients with quinapril led to a significant decrease in the levels of endothelin-1 (5.76 vs 5.28 fmol/ml, P < 0.01). We did not observe significant changes in the levels of adhesion molecules and vWf after ACE inhibitor treatment, although a trend toward a decrease was apparent with all these parameters. Patients with uncomplicated hypertension with no other risk factors of atherosclerosis had significantly elevated levels of ICAM-1, vWf, and endothelin-1. Our data suggest that these factors may serve as markers of endothelial damage even in uncomplicated hypertension. In hypertensive patients, treatment with the ACE inhibitor quinapril resulted in a significant decrease in endothelin-1 levels. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients.", 
    "69": "The prevalence of RAAS in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients ranges from 17 to 44%. The prevalence increases exponentially in the presence of several risk factors such as severe arterial hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, macroangiopathy, smoking, and insulin requirement. In diabetic patients, RAAS should be investigated in patients with severe arterial hypertension, repeated pulmonary oedemas, and renal insufficiency without any clear etiology associated with a mild proteinuria and/or with a renal insufficiency secondary to the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptors antagonists. Asymmetrical size of the kidneys should also prompt the physician with a suspicion of RAAS. There are several specific criteria, that may confirm the suspicion of a RAAS. Renal arteriography is still the goal standard for diagnosing renal artery stenosis.",

    "71": "Administration of L-NAME increased plasma markers of thrombin generation, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and soluble glycoprotein V, measured by specific ELISA. Thrombin generation in vivo was associated with ex vivo platelet desensitization to adenosine 5'-diphosphate and collagen-induced aggregation. In the aortic layers and renal arterioles, tissue factor mRNA (semi-quantitative RT-PCR) and activity (coagulation assay) were increased. In contrast, tissue factor activity was not modified in glomeruli. In parallel, an impairment of the fibrinolytic system was demonstrated by an increase in plasma levels and arterial secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In the arterial wall, plasminogen activator inhibtor-1 mRNA was significantly increased. Moreover, antifibrinolytic activity, studied by fibrin reverse zymography, was increased whereas all tissue-plasminogen activator activity secreted by the hypertensive arterial wall was detected as complexes with its specific inhibitor. In animals treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Zofenil, all of these parameters remained at control levels.",

    "73": "Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of thromboembolic events in hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on blood coagulation in subjects with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and Factor VII were determined in plasma at rest and after a mental stress test following placebo for 6 weeks, or ramipril for 6 weeks or 6 months. Ramipril reduced resting TAT, and tended to reduce fibrinogen; Factor VII remained unchanged. Mental stress increased fibrinogen, but did not alter TAT or Factor VII activity. The reduced thrombin generation in patients taking ramipril may explain in part why angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce thromboembolic complications in patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "74": "At least four independent studies in different clinical settings showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) such as enalapril effectively decrease plasma levels of circulating adhesion molecules (cAMs). To examine whether this effect may be mediated by the decreased action of angiotensin, we compared the effects of enalapril with the direct angiotensin-II antagonist, losartan, on plasma levels of cAMs, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In a randomized trial, we recruited 32 untreated patients (19 male, aged 59+/-13 years) with hypertension, who received either enalapril (mean dose 17 mg/day) or losartan (mean dose 77 mg/day) at equipotent doses. Enalapril decreased plasma levels of all cAMs after 8 weeks of treatment: cE-selectin levels decreased by 13% (P=0.007), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cICAM-1) by 15% (P=0.002) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) by 19% (P=0.003). Similarly, enalapril decreased plasma levels of MCP-1 by 13% (P<0.001). Losartan did not significantly change cAM or MCP-1 plasma concentrations after 8 weeks of treatment: cE-selectin levels decreased by 3%, cICAM-1 by 5%, cVCAM-1 by 8%, whereas MCP-1 increased by 2% (all P=NS; not significant). The enalapril effect on percentage changes of cVCAM-1 was significantly different from losartan (P=0.0429). Eight weeks of antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not losartan, significantly decreased plasma levels of cAMs and MCP-1 in hypertensive patients. The beneficial effects of ACE-Is on cAMs may have implications for atherogenesis and the reduction of cardiovascular events, which cannot be fully explained by their antihypertensive effects alone.", 
    "75": "The elderly patient may show normal physiological changes of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that accompany aging, as well as features of intrinsic cardiac disease. The latter include: a past history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease; history of congestive cardiac failure; angina; arterial hypertension (BP >140/90mm Hg); and conduction disorders. A key aspect to the safe and effective anaesthetic management of the elderly patient with cardiac disease is a careful preoperative assessment and optimisation of pre-existing drug therapies. All cardiac medications should be continued up to and including the morning of surgery with the exception of anticoagulation involving warfarin, and perhaps large doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists in patients with hypertension or heart failure. Anaesthetic techniques used in these patients should avoid episodes of excessive hypotension after induction of anaesthesia or large blood loss, or the combination of hypertension and tachycardia after noxious stimulation. The latter physiological disturbances are pivotal for the development of myocardial ischaemia. Both premedication (if used) and anaesthesia should avoid excessive sedation and respiratory depression. The choice of anaesthetic technique may vary between: a balanced technique involving an opiate and a volatile agent; an intravenous technique utilising infusions of propofol; or regional anaesthesia with or without additional sedation. There are no good data to suggest any one technique is better than the rest. The occurrence of ischaemia in the perioperative period may precede the postoperative development of significant cardiac morbidity and mortality (including myocardial infarction or unstable angina, congestive cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and severe arrhythmias). A number of strategies have been examined to reduce these adverse outcomes. The effect of acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade in treatment-naive patients is associated with reduction in the haemodynamic response to noxious stimuli and decreased ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia, as well as a reduction in the number of cardiac adverse events. Other drugs (calcium channel antagonists, alpha(2)-agonists and adenosine modulators) have a less predictable influence on both myocardial ischaemia and hard cardiac outcomes. There is inadequate evidence at present to define the optimal time course for acute beta-blockade, or the groups of patients in whom preoperative beta-blockade should be initiated in the absence of contraindications. Nevertheless, addition of beta-blockers to the preoperative regimen should be considered in patients with evidence of or at risk for coronary disease undergoing major surgery. There is also evidence that long-term beta-adrenoceptor or calcium channel blockade or nitrate therapy for the high-risk cardiac patient offers little protection against silent myocardial ischaemia, nonfatal infarction, cardiac failure and cardiac death.", 
    "76": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce blood pressure and slow the progression of renal diseases. However, a substantial interindividual variability in treatment response also has been noted. The activity of ACE is partially dependent on the presence or absence of a 287-bp element in intron 16, and this insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism accounts for 47% of the total phenotypic variance in plasma ACE; DD subjects have the highest; ID subjects, intermediate; and II individuals, the lowest concentrations. Data suggest that genotype also determines tissue enzyme activity, and, at least under certain conditions, ACE activity is a rate-limiting step for angiotensin II formation. It therefore has been speculated that the ACE polymorphism also might affect therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors. Unfortunately, clinical studies performed to date do not allow us to draw definite conclusions. Nonetheless, the rapidly evolving area of pharmacogenomics soon will also affect therapeutic decisions in the field of nephrology and hypertension.", 
    "77": "ACE inhibitors are standard therapy for treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. However, recent clinical trials have shown that beta blockers further reduce mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors. However, the evidence in support of adding beta blockers to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is less certain. The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may exert benefit in patients with heart failure are discussed, and studies assessing the association of beta blockade with outcome in patients with mild heart failure receiving ACE inhibitor therapy are reviewed. (c)2000 by CHF, Inc.", 
    "78": "The lack of benefit and the potential negative side effects of beta blockers are overstated, especially in the elderly. This emphasis has led to recommendations by some investigators that these agents not be used in the management of hypertension in this age group. There are numerous reasons why these recommendations should not be followed. The use of beta blockers in the elderly hypertensive has resulted in a reduction in strokes and congestive heart failure. In addition, it should be emphasized that elderly patients are more likely to have silent coronary artery disease or sustain myocardial infarctions. There is abundant evidence that beta blockers are effective therapy in reducing mortality once a myocardial infarction has occurred. In fact, there is a clear reduction in sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, national statistics document that elderly patients have a prevalence of congestive heart failure that varies from 6%-10%. Multiple studies have now documented that beta blockers are additive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality for congestive heart failure. Thus, elderly hypertensive patients may benefit from the use of beta blockers, especially if there is evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.", 
    "79": "A large proportion of patients have both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, two of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Statins are the most widely used drugs for the treatment of plasma lipid abnormalities and have been reported to interact with elevated blood pressure. A reduction in blood pressure associated with the use of these agents has been reported in patients with untreated hypertension and in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. This effect on blood pressure control has also been observed in diabetic patients. The mechanism responsible for the hypotensive effect seems to be largely independent of the effect of statins on plasma cholesterol, and probably is related to the interaction of the medications with endothelial function or angiotensin II receptors. The capacity of statins to improve blood pressure control may represent a useful tool for improvement in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "80": "Little is known about essential hypertension in Hispanic Americans, despite the fact that they are the fastest-growing minority in the United States and have a disproportionate degree of hypertensive target organ damage. The authors studied 89 Caribbean Hispanic hypertensive patients who participated in six double-blind, randomized trials of antihypertensive agents. Demographics, laboratory data, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide were obtained after 3-4 weeks on placebo. Blood pressure responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and fixed combinations of ACE inhibitors and HCTZ, were compared to the placebo values after 8-12 weeks of treatment. Patients had a multiple risk factor profile (obesity and diabetes) and a wide spectrum of blood pressure elevation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive renal damage. Urine sodium excretion rates indicated inability to comply with salt restriction in 65% of patients. Plasma renin activity was lower than that of Hispanic normotensive controls, and 62% of patients had low-renin essential hypertension by renin profiling to sodium excretion. On analysis of variance, blood pressure reductions by calcium channel blockers, HCTZ, and ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combinations were significantly greater than that with placebo, while those of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers as monotherapy were not. The authors conclude that essential hypertension of Caribbean Hispanics is associated with multiple risk factors and is largely of the low-renin type. Responses to therapy are consistent with those observed in other populations with the low-renin phenotype and suggest salt-sensitivity of blood pressure in this population. Confirmation of the latter has implications for prevention and treatment of essential hypertension in Hispanics.", 
    "81": "A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial compared telmisartan and valsartan for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Efficacy for 24-hour control of blood pressure was assessed using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Mean changes in diastolic blood pressure for the last 6 hours before dosing and the nighttime period were significantly greater with telmisartan than with valsartan (p<0.01 for the last 6 hours before dosing; p<0.05 for the nighttime period). Mean changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures for the 24-hour interval, the morning, and the daytime periods were significantly greater with telmisartan than with valsartan (p<0.01). The incidence of all adverse events and the most common adverse events were comparable for patients receiving telmisartan and patients receiving valsartan. Neither treatment was associated with cough. These data suggest greater efficacy for telmisartan than valsartan in controlling blood pressure throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, including the last 6 hours before dosing, and the two agents were similarly well tolerated.", 
    "82": "Three separate randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week trials compared telmisartan with enalapril, lisinopril, and amlodipine for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Telmisartan 80 mg was associated with a significantly greater mean decrease in trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure than enalapril 20 mg (p<0.05). Mean decreases in trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure with telmisartan (40, 80, and 160 mg) and lisinopril (10, 20, and 40 mg) were similar. Telmisartan (40, 80, and 120 mg) provided greater decreases in mean hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, including the last 4 hours of the dosing period, than amlodipine (5 and 10 mg). Telmisartan was associated with a lower incidence of treatment-related cough than lisinopril and enalapril and less treatment-related angioedema than amlodipine. These data suggest that for treating mild to moderate hypertension, telmisartan has efficacy similar to lisinopril, greater efficacy than enalapril and amlodipine throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, and better tolerability than these angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and amlodipine.",

In DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-(IL)-1alpha, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 was significantly inhibited by captopril. In contrast, angiotensin II treatment resulted in a significant increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 protein biosynthesis by DCs. In addition, we have studied the global expression of 2400 genes in DCs from two donors. Here, we demonstrated the specific down-regulation of the ACE gene expression in captopril-treated DCs. Our finding indicates the possible activation of NF-kappaB through the up-regulation of expressions of MEFV gene (encoding PYRIN protein) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R in DCs. This is the first study on the modulation of cytokine and gene expression by angiotensin II and captopril in DCs.",

Use of GpIIb-IIIa inhibitors should also be strongly considered, especially in an early invasive approach. However, there is no substitute for a good physician who has the big picture and knows the individual patient in totality.

We performed the present study to determine whether angiotensin II play a role in causing an increase in the expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V2 and AQP2 mRNA in the kidney of the cardiomyopathic hamster. The expression of AVP V2 and AQP2 mRNA in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) was measured by competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) before and after treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. Our results showed that the expression of AVP V2 (0.53 +/- 0.05 v 1.03 +/- 0.15 amol/microg of total RNA, P <.01) and AQP2 mRNA (0.027 +/- 0.002 v 0.036 +/- 0.002 amol/microg of total RNA, P <.05) in the IMCD of the cardiomyopathic hamster is upregulated. Treating the cardiomyopathic hamster with enalapril for 7 days negated the changes. In situ hybridization experiments confirmed the intensity of the signals for both AVP V2 and AQP2 mRNA was more intense in the IMCD of the cardiomyopathic hamster. Enalapril treatment reduced the signal intensity to a level comparable to the normal hamster. These results suggested that the increases in the expression of AVP V2 and AQP2 mRNA are mediated by angiotensin II.", 
    "96": "BACKGROUND: Two separate cohorts of consecutive patients admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of heart failure were studied, the first in 1986 in Rochdale, and the second in 1995 in Brighton. METHODS: We observed the clinical profile, treatment and mortality during hospital admission and reviewed their status at 6 months. There were 132 patients in the Rochdale cohort and 223 in the Brighton cohort. RESULTS: The Rochdale cohort was characterised by a lower mean age and longer hospital stay. Significant differences were also observed in co-morbidity and the use of ACE inhibitors, but hospital mortality was almost identical (25% in Rochdale and 24% in Brighton). A low systolic blood pressure, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and a raised blood urea at presentation were independent adverse prognostic factors. In contrast, prior treatment with ACE inhibitors in patients with congestive cardiac failure led to a more favourable hospital outcome. Age, gender and co-morbidity did not affect mortality apart from patients with acute myocardial infarction. Follow-up of these cohorts showed that mortality of the two groups remained high at 180 days after admission (40% in Rochdale and 39% in Brighton). There were marked differences in the use of ACE inhibitors in survivors, but target doses of ACE inhibitors (enalapril 20 mg/day or equivalent) were only achieved in 31%, despite direct communication between the hospital and primary care physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical and treatment profiles differed between the two periods studied, the hospital and 6-month mortality of patients with heart failure remained high. More emphasis needs to be given to optimising ACE inhibitor use in primary care.", 
    "97": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), may be partially mediated by the kinins' paracrine influence. Their actions may be exerted through nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)) synthesis stimulation. The aim of our study was to determine whether the antihypertensive effect of Enalapril correlated with the increment in the plasmatic levels of NO and PGI(2) in essential moderate hypertensive patients. Normalization of blood pressure was observed in 20 patients, four on the 28th day, 15 on the 42th day and one on the 56th day. Enalapril-respondent subjects showed increased nitrate/nitrite levels on the 14th day (30% increment), on the 28th day (64%), on the 42th day (93.5%) and on the 56th day (96.2%) compared with basal levels, but they did not modify the circulating 6-keto PGF(1 alpha) levels. Four non-respondent patients showed a diminution in nitrate/nitrite and 6-keto PGF(1 alpha) circulating levels along the treatment. We conclude that the administration of 5-30 mg of Enalapril increases circulating NO metabolites in respondent-essential hypertensive subjects. The lack of responsiveness to the treatment may be related to the presence of risk factors such as those linked to an increase of oxidative stress. Finally, we consider that the evaluation of circulating NO may represent a predictive of the response to Enalapril in essential hypertensive patients.",

METHODS; We assessed 355 competitive athletes with ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) on a 24-h ambulatory (Holter) ECG that was obtained because of either palpitations, the presence of > or = 3 premature ventricular depolarizations (PVDs) on resting 12-lead ECG, or both.",

Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 26 of the 355 study subjects (7%) and were significantly more common in Group A (21/71, 30%) than in Group B (5/153, 3%) or Group C athletes (0/131, 0% p < 0.001). Only the 71 athletes in Group A were excluded from competition. During follow-up (mean, 8 years), 70 of 71 athletes in Group A and each of the 284 athletes in Groups B and C have survived without cardiovascular events. The remaining Group A athlete died suddenly of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy while participating in a field hockey game against medical advice. Frequent and complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias are common in trained athletes and are usually unassociated with underlying cardiovascular abnormalities. Such VAs (when unassociated with cardiovascular abnormalities) do not convey adverse clinical significance, appear to be an expression of \"athlete's heart syndrome,\" and probably do not per se justify a disqualification from competitive sports.",

    "122": "Large-scale trials with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blockers have clearly shown that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system reduces the deterioration in renal function associated with diabetes. AT(1)-receptor blockers represent a more rational approach to blockade of this system than ACE inhibitors, due to the presence of non-ACE pathways of angiotensin II formation. Studies in healthy volunteers maintained on a low-salt diet indicate that such pathways account for approximately 30-40% of total angiotensin II formation, and this figure increases to 60-70% in individuals maintained on a high-salt diet (resembling the situation in most human populations). Activation of the renin-angiotensin system is increased in diabetic patients, and comparison of the renal vascular responses to captopril and candesartan shows a strong correlation between the effects of ACE inhibition and AT(1)-receptor blockade, indicating that the deleterious effects of renin-angiotensin system activation in diabetes are mediated largely through angiotensin II. The presence of multiple risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, hyperglycaemia, obesity and tissue damage, places diabetic patients at high risk of disease related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Effective and early blockade of this system is therefore an important aspect of management.", 
    "123": "In the 1970s and 1980s it became evident that progression of renal disease and blood pressure are correlated. Subsequently, it was shown that antihypertensive treatment, especially with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), could slow the progression of diabetic renal disease. Several studies, particularly with RAS blockers, have confirmed beneficial effects on urinary albumin excretion in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria or proteinuria. There are good reasons to explore dual blockade of the RAS with an AT(1)-receptor blocker and an ACE inhibitor. Receptor blockers may block the effects of angiotensin II more effectively than ACE inhibitors; moreover, ACE inhibitors increase bradykinins which may have positive effects on blood pressure and renal function. Such combination treatment has been found to be well tolerated and more effective in reducing blood pressure than either monotherapy. Positive effects on microalbuminuria or proteinuria have also been noted. Studies have shown that treatment with AT(1)-receptor blockers postpones end-stage renal disease and reduces the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Moreover, albuminuria was reduced to a greater extent with AT(1)-receptor blockers than with conventional antihypertensive therapy producing the same blood pressure reductions. In summary, AT(1)-receptor blockers are effective in all stages of diabetic renal disease, and have an excellent tolerability profile. Usually the side-effect profile is comparable with placebo. In certain situations, there may be a slight, readily reversible, increase in serum potassium. There may also be a slight reduction in GFR, reflecting a decrease in glomerular filtration pressure.", 
    "124": "Retinopathy is the most common complication of diabetes, and a leading cause of blindness in people of working age. Optimal blood pressure and metabolic control can reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, but are difficult to achieve in clinical practice. In the EUCLID Study, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril reduced the risk of progression of retinopathy by approximately 50%, and also significantly reduced the risk of progression to proliferative retinopathy. These findings are consistent with extensive evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is expressed in the eye, and that adverse effects of angiotensin II on retinal angiogenesis and function can be inhibited by ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers. However, in the EUCLID Study retinopathy was not a primary end-point and the study was not sufficiently powered for the eye-related outcomes. Hence, the Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) programme has been established to determine whether AT(1)-receptor blockade with candesartan can prevent the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. This programme comprises three studies, involving a total of 4500 patients recruited from about 300 centres worldwide. The patients are normotensive or treated hypertensive individuals, and so the DIRECT programme should assess the potential of an AT(1)-receptor blocker to protect against the pathological changes in the eye following diabetes.", 
    "125": "The renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis both by increasing blood pressure and by direct effects on all phases of the atherogenic process. Genetic determinants of renin-angiotensin system activation, notably the DD genotype of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, as is increased plasma renin activity. In addition, angiotensin II has been shown to increase the uptake and oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by macrophages and endothelial cells. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of interleukin 6 and activates the pro-inflammatory factor nuclear factor kappa(B), leading to expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, and increases the production of pro-coagulatory factors. In animal experiments, treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin AT(1)-receptor blockers has been shown to have anti-atherogenic effects. Studies with candesartan have shown that this agent produces a dose-dependent reduction in uptake of oxidised LDL by mouse macrophages in vitro, and reduces cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis development in the aorta of Watanabe rabbits. These effects were independent of changes in blood pressure. Such findings suggest that AT(1)-receptor blockers may be beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity resulting from atherosclerotic disease, and are consistent with the findings from large outcome trials with ACE inhibitors in patients at risk of cardiovascular events.",

    "131": "The present study was performed to clarify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of lisinopril on chronic glomerulonephritis. Chronic glomerulonephritis was induced by a single injection of E30 monoclonal antibody (E30) recognizing Thy-1.1 antigen to unilaterally nephrectomized rats. E30 injection resulted in persistent massive proteinuria with a decrease in anionic charge sites on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) at 8 weeks. Also, renal tissue from rats treated with E30 showed typical glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Lisinopril exerted a potent antiproteinuric effect and suppressed the progression of both glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Lisinopril recovered the reduced number of anionic charge sites on GBM, accounting for the positive action against massive proteinuria. Immunostaining for desmin revealed that lisinopril treatment prevented the injury of glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) occurring in the chronic nephritic stage. Also, the level of gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the renal cortex were reduced, suggesting that lisinopril improved extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism. These results indicated that proteinuria in Thy-1.1 antibody-induced chronic nephritis is associated with a decrease in anionic charge sites on GBM, and that the antiproteinuric effect of lisinopril is attributable to protection against GEC damage. Suppression of TGF-beta and PAI-1 expression contributed to the preventive effect of lisinopril on ECM deposition in renal tissue.",

METHODS 131 cases with IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy were randomly divided into two groups: ACEI group (benazepril 10 mg/d) and non-ACEI group as control. The pathological changes in the kidney were analyzed using Lee SMK. RESULTS After 1 month treatment of ACEI, the levels of proteinuria and serum cholesterol decreased significantly, meanwhile those of serum albumin and total protein increased obviously in patients with IgAN(P < 0.05). The proteinuria level at the 3rd month after treatment was lower than that at the 1st month, but was same as that at the 18th month. While in the control group the proteinuria level increased and the clearance of creatinine decreased continuously during the observation (P < 0.05). The effects correlated positively with mesangial proliferation and negatively with course of the disease glomerular sclerosis in glomerulus and changes of small arterioles in the kidney. Normal blood pressare normal renal function I approximately II degree of Lee SMK I degee of interstitial changes minimal changes of small arterioles and mild glomerular sclerosis predicted better response to ACEI treatment than hypertension renal insufficiency V degree of Lee SMK IV degee of interstitial changes severe changes of small arterioles and massive glomerular sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS It is suggested that benezepril could definitely reduce the excretion of urinary protein and protect renal function of patients with IgAN and should be used as earlier as possible.

    "137": "Acetazolamide (Ace) is a putative inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the equilibration of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid and plays a key role in HCO(3)(-) and water reabsorption and acid secretion. Aquaporins (AQPs) are channel-forming membrane glycoproteins that mediate water reabsorption by the renal tubules and other organs of mammals. AQP1 and CAII or CAIV share many common biological properties. Previous studies have shown that AQP1 and CA are located at the same sites in cells of the male reproductive tract. In the present study, Ace at a dose of 40 mg/kg/d x 14, administered per os, suppressed AQP1 gene expression and inhibited CA activity in rat testis. On day 7 of treatment the epididymal sperm motility was significantly reduced, while on day 14 a decrease in sperm count occurred. Ace caused a marked downregulation of AQP1 gene expression; significant suppression occurred on days 7 and 14. Moreover, CA activity was totally blocked throughout the treatment period. The present findings suggest that the reduction of rat sperm motility and count by Ace can be attributed to its capacity to downregulate AQP1 water channel gene expression.",

Ventricular arrhythmias are important causes of sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure. The risks of antiarrhythmic drugs are increased in patients with heart failure. Therefore, in the absence of a clear indication, antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be avoided. A number of recent randomized trials have provided evidence that beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARB) significantly reduces the risk of sudden death in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.

Studies in non-diabetic patients have shown that beta-blockers improve HRV parameters known to reflect parasympathetic function.

Atrial myocardium of control patients without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy and heart failure patients without or with ACE inhibitor therapy undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery was studied. Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) expression and endothelin-1 peptide level was upregulated in myocardium of heart failure patients without ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitor therapy prevented upregulation of ECE-1 and endothelin-1 in failing myocardium. Prepro-endothelin-1 and endothelin receptor A expression were not affected by heart failure. Endothelin receptor B was downregulated in heart failure patients. Our data demonstrate an upregulation of ECE-1 mRNA expression in failing human myocardium. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by ACE inhibitor treatment prevents upregulation of ECE-1, suggesting that angiotensin II regulates ECE-1 expression in vivo.", 
    "148": "The mechanism and treatment of hypertensive systolic heart failure are not well defined. We compared the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril, 10 mg/kg), an angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan, 3 mg/kg), a calcium channel blocker (benidipine, 1, 3 or 6 mg/kg), and the same calcium channel blocker combined with renin-angiotensin blockers on systolic heart failure in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. DS rats were fed an 8% Na diet from 6 weeks of age and then subjected to the above drug treatments. Benidipine (1 mg/kg), cilazapril, and candesartan had compatible hypotensive effects and similar beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy, gene expression, and survival rate. The combination of benidipine with cilazapril or candesartan was found to have no additional beneficial effects on the above parameters, with the exception of a reduction in atrial natriuretic polypeptide gene expression. On the other hand, candesartan normalized serum creatinine, but serum creatinine was unaffected by either benidipine at 1 or 3 mg/kg or cilazapril. Further, the combined use of benidipine and either candesartan or cilazapril resulted in an additional reduction of urinary albumin excretion in DS rats. Thus systolic heart failure in DS rats is mainly mediated by hypertension, while renal dysfunction of DS rats is due to both hypertension and the AT1 receptor itself. These findings suggest that the combination of a calcium channel blocker with an AT1 receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor may be more effective in treating the renal dysfunction associated with systolic heart failure than monotherapy with either agent alone. However, further studies will be needed before reaching any definitive conclusion on the efficacy of this combination therapy in patients with heart failure.", 
    "149": "To investigate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and other antihypertensive agents on the nitric oxide (NO) release during hypertension, seven- and fourteen-week-old SHR and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats were treated with hydralazine, manidipine (Ca antagonist) or quinapril (ACE-I) for 3 weeks to lower blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail cuff method once each week. Endothelial cells (ECs) derived from the descending aorta of the treated rats were cultured and NOx levels in culture media were measured with an NO analyzer based on the Griess reaction. In both SHR and DOCA-salt rats, antihypertensive therapy lowered SBP to levels similar to those of control rats. The only exception was quinapril treatment of DOCA-salt rats. Although NOx release by ECs derived from hypertensive rats was improved by antihypertensive therapy, the effect was most pronounced in SHR treated with quinapril. In addition, restoration of NOx release was much more remarkable in younger SHR. NOx release was significantly higher in DOCA-salt rats treated with quinapril than in control rats without reduction of SBP. These results suggest that lowering blood pressure improves release of NO by ECs during hypertension and that the time at which antihypertensive therapy is started is also important to preserve endothelial function. Furthermore, ACE-I is suggested to protect endothelial function by increasing NO production in addition to lowering blood pressure.", 
    "150": "To assess the renal benefits of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and calcium antagonism, we studied the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of temocapril (TMP) alone or in combination with azelnidipine (AZN) in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure. Male 5/6-nephrectomized SHR/Izumo rats were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (control group), TMP (TMP group; 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), AZN (AZN group; 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), or both (TMP+AZN group) orally for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary excretion of albumin (UalbV) were measured every 2 weeks. At the end of the experiment, serum creatinine (Scr), heart weight (HW), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured and the remnant kidneys were examined to determine the index of glomerular sclerosis (IGS). SBP and UalbV in the control group increased progressively throughout the experimental period. TMP, AZN, and TMP+AZN blocked the development of hypertension. TMP+AZN did not enhance the antihypertensive effects of either TMP or AZN used singly. TMP, AZN, and TMP+AZN all significantly decreased the UalbV, Scr, BUN, and HW/body weight (BW) ratio. The level of UalbV and the HW/BW ratio in the TMP+AZN group were significantly lower than those in the TMP and AZN groups, and the level of Scr in the TMP+AZN group was significantly lower than that in the TMP group. TMP, AZN, and TMP+AZN all significantly protected against an increase in the IGS. The IGS in the TMP+AZN group was significantly lower than that in the TMP and AZN groups. These results indicate that both TMP and AZN have antihypertensive and renoprotective effects in this model. They also suggest that simultaneous administration of TMP and AZN provides greater renoprotective effects than TMP alone.",

The effects of antihypertensive agents on endothelial function have not been fully evaluated in human hypertension and data on the forearm circulation of humans are controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a calcium antagonist improves endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients and whether the mechanism involved could be related to antioxidant activity. Endothelial function was estimated using venous occlusion plethysmography in 18 hypertensive patients and 11 healthy volunteers. The patients in the hypertension group were treated with enalapril or amlodipine. The change of forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured during acetylcholine infusion through the brachial artery and also during intra-arterial vitamin C infusion to explore the effects of vitamin C on responses to acetylcholine. FBF response to acetylcholine was significantly enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of vitamin C in the hypertensive group before antihypertensive treatment. Co-infusion of L-NMMA(N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, blunted forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine. After antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or amlodipine for 2 months in the hypertensive group, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (vasodilatory response to acetylcholine) was significantly improved. Even though the mechanisms leading to depressed endothelial function in essential hypertension remain to be elucidated, our study shows that treatment with an ACE inhibitor or a calcium antagonist resulted in demonstrable improvement by a mechanism that is probably related to antioxidant activity.",

We performed 24-h Holter electrocardiography and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring simultaneously, and examined blood samples during the baseline, temocapril and amlodipine treatment periods. The ambulatory BP was lower in the amlodipine period than in the temocapril period. However, the number of VEB was significantly increased in the amlodipine period compared to that in the baseline period (11.9 vs. 7.4/day, p<0.05). In the temocapril period, the number of VEB was not significantly increased compared to that in the baseline period (8.6 vs. 7.4/day, p=0.30). Ambulatory heart rate (HR) was significantly increased in the amlodipine period compared to that in the baseline period (24-h HR: 70 vs. 66 bpm, p<0.001; daytime HR: 75 vs. 71 bpm, p<0.001; nocturnal HR: 60 vs. 58 bpm, p<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) also was significantly increased in the amlodipine period compared to that in the baseline period (457 vs. 369 pg/ml, p<0.001). However, when patients receiving amlodipine were divided into a high dose group (8.6 +/- 1.2 mg/day) and a low dose group (4.6 +/- 1.2 mg/day), increases in HR and plasma NE levels were found only in the high dose group. These results indicate that amlodipine is effective at lowering BP in older hypertensives, although it may increase VEB, especially when given at a high dose.", 
    "153": "The contraction of muscle enhances the release of bradykinin (BK) and improves glucose uptake by the muscle. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) slows the breakdown of BK, thus the effect of BK is augmented in the presence of ACEI. The present study investigated whether the combination of exercise (increased production of BK) and ACEI (delay in breakdown of BK) might further improve insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients with insulin resistance (HOMA-R>1.8). Patients were assigned either to increased walking distance (Walking group) or taking 2 mg temocapril, an ACEI, daily (ACEI group) for 8 weeks. Then both interventions were given to all patients for 8 weeks (ACEI+Walking group). Blood concentrations of triglycerides were slightly lower in the ACEI+Walking group than at baseline, although there were no significant differences in total cholesterol or high density lipoprotein-cholesterol among the 2 groups. Blood glucose was not significantly different with each treatment, but blood concentrations of insulin and HOMA-R were significantly lower in the Walking and ACEI groups compared with the Control group. The combination of walking and ACEI further lowered blood concentrations of insulin and HOMA-R, which suggests that this treatment is beneficial for hypertensive patients with insulin resistance.", 
    "154": "ACE-inhibitors and AT, receptor antagonists play an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. The criteria of evidence-based medicine indicate that ACE-inhibitors (in appropriate combinations with other cardiovascular agents) continue to represent the treatment of first choice in chronic heart failure, post-myocardial infarction with compromised ventricular function, high cardiovascular risk, and diabetic (type 1) nephropathy. It is here that the AT1 antagonists should be used--in particular when ACE-inhibitors are not tolerated. The AT1 antagonists, Irbesartan and Losartan, are applied, at appropriately high doses, primarily in hypertensives with diabetic (type 2) nephropathy. With the current exception of chronic heart failure, no confirmed data are yet available on the value of combination treatment. The LIFE study has shown that an AT1 antagonist is superior to an established beta blocker in hypertensives with an increased risk (left-ventricular hypertrophy), in particular when diabetes mellitus is impending or already present.", 
    "155": "Endothelium; effective in vascular tonus, blood tension, blood flow and coagulation system is the biggest endocrine organ with 1800 gr. weight in human body. The endothelium releases nitric oxide, which maintains vascular integrity. In endothelial dysfunction the balance between releasing vasodilatatory and vasoconstrictory factors is changed. In the presence of essential hypertension defection in endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increasing sensitivity to vasoconstrictors could increase vascular resistance. Although some beneficial results with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, carvedilol, angiotensin-II and endothelin receptor antagonists were reported in patients with endothelial dysfunction the effectiveness of these drugs is still debate. Also the decreasing of arterial pressure was not always shown to be parallel to the restoration of endothelial dysfunction. In the future according to genetic studies, the increased use of nitric oxide releasing genes therapy will have a more effective role in regression of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "156": "To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.", 
    "157": "Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "158": "The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (>or=25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean +/- standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 +/- 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.", 
    "159": "Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of >or=124 micromol/L or >or=1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR <30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine>1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.", 
    "160": "The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine>1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level >or=5.6 mmol/L) develops.", 
    "161": "To determine whether the prostacyclin-inhibiting properties of aspirin counteracts the bradykinin-induced prostacyclin-stimulating effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thereby attenuating the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients.", 
    "162": "Most heart failure patients are older adults. Heart failure is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis of older Americans. The renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, and ACE inhibitors play a pivotal role in the management of heart failure. Large-scale double-blind randomized trials have demonstrated the survival benefits of using ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In addition to inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors also decrease the breakdown of bradykinin. Bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, acts by stimulating formation of vasodilatory prostaglandins such as prostacyclin, whereas aspirin or acetyl salicylic acid inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which in turn decreases the production of the prostaglandins. Coronary artery disease and hypertension are the two major underlying causes of heart failure. Most heart failure patients are also on aspirin. There is evidence that aspirin at a daily dose of 80 to 100 mg prevents the synthesis of thromboxane A2 by platelets while relatively sparing the synthesis of prostacyclin in the vascular endothelium. Aspirin at a daily dose of 325 mg has significant inhibitory effects on the vasodilatory prostacyclin synthesis. Studies have demonstrated that, in heart failure patients, low-dose aspirin has no adverse effect on hemodynamic, neurohumoral, or renal functions. Whether the prostacyclin-inhibiting effects of aspirin attenuate some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors mediated by prostacyclin stimulation in heart failure patients is currently unknown.", 
    "163": "Data from large clinical trials investigating the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors were analyzed to determine the effect of aspirin on the vasodilatory actions of ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients, and the results were analyzed on the basis of theoretical and laboratory findings. The studies included are the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) (N=6,797), the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) (N=6,090), the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS) (N=296), and another study involving 317 subjects. The data from these clinical trials investigating the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors included 13,470 subjects. Most of the subjects received aspirin. In the SOLVD study, subjects received aspirin or dipyridamole. Subjects were followed up for an average of about 6 years.", 
    "164": "In the SOLVD study, subjects were followed up for 41.1 months in the treatment trial and 37.4 months in the prevention trial. Patients who received aspirin or dipyridamole at baseline did not receive the survival benefits of enalapril, whereas patients who received enalapril did not receive the survival benefits of aspirin. In a rather small study of 317 subjects with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <35%) who were followed up for a relatively longer period of time (5.7 years), the favorable long-term prognosis of patients receiving aspirin was independent of receipt of an ACE inhibitor. A retrospective subgroup analysis of data from the CONSENSUS II study demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) who received enalapril and aspirin was higher than the combined mortality rates of patients receiving enalapril or aspirin alone. This strong interaction between aspirin and the ACE inhibitor enalapril suggests that the survival benefit of enalapril was significantly lower in patients also taking aspirin than in those taking enalapril alone. This interaction was not associated with other nonfatal major events. In the CATS study, use of low-dose aspirin (80 or 100 mg) did not attenuate beneficial effects of captopril (immediate and 1-year follow up) after acute MI.", 
    "165": "There is a theoretical possibility that the negative interaction between ACE inhibitors and aspirin may reduce the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure, but the information obtained from the existing databases is limited by the retrospective nature of the analyses and does not establish the association definitively.

Flow cytometric analysis of platelets surface antigens (P-selectin, GP53, thrombospondin) was performed as a measure for intravasal platelet activation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ACE inhibitors and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists on clinic and ambulatory HR in patients with essential hypertension. We selected 292 hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors and 198 hypertensive patients treated with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Groups were balanced for age, gender, body mass index, baseline blood pressure (BP) and HR, treatment duration and occupation. Patients had been submitted to clinic evaluation and noninvasive monitoring of BP and HR at baseline and during chronic therapy. Clinic and ambulatory BP were significantly and similarly reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. Globally, clinic and 24-h HR were significantly reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and remained unchanged in those treated with calcium antagonists. When patients were grouped according to baseline clinic HR (< 65 beats/min, 65-74 beats/min, 75-84 beats/min, and >85 beats/min), ACE inhibitors did not significantly change HR in subjects with baseline clinic HR <74 beats/min but significantly reduced clinic, 24-h, daytime and nighttime HR in those with baseline HR >75 beats/min and particularly in those with baseline HR >85 beats/min. Calcium antagonists did not significantly change clinic, 24-h, daytime and nighttime HR in various subgroups. Our study shows that ACE inhibitors reduce both clinic and ambulatory HR in hypertensive patients with faster HR, who seem to be at higher risk, and that long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists do not induce significant changes in HR during chronic treatment (neither decrease nor increase). Whether this aspect is associated with a better prognostic impact of ACE inhibitors in essential hypertension should be determined in prospective studies.", 
    "178": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors seem to have clinical benefits beyond those predicted by their lipid-lowering action. The objective was to evaluate the vascular effect of long-term treatment with statins on isolated rat aorta and their ability to prevent the acute toxicity of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Four groups of Wistar rats were treated for 5 weeks. Group 1 received pravastatin 20 mg/kg/d orally; group 2 received atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/d; group 3 received ciprofibrate 25 mg/kg/d; and group 4 served as control. Total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels were not altered, except in group 3, in which both parameters were decreased. The inhibitory effect of the endothelium on serotonin-induced contractions was significantly increased in group 1. A significant leftward shift of the concentration-response curves to acetylcholine (1 nM-0.1 mM) was observed in group 1 but the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was similar in the four groups. In contrast, in the presence of human Cu2+-oxLDL (300 microg/ml, 30 min of preincubation), the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly decreased (p < 0.02) in groups 3 and 4 versus that of groups 1 and 2. No difference in superoxide accumulation was observed by the chemiluminescence technique. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), measured by enzyme immunoassay in aortic tissues, was increased in group 1 in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was not altered (Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In aortas isolated from a fifth group of rats treated with an ACE inhibitor (ramipril 10 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks), similar results to those of group 1 were observed except that the eNOS abundance was significantly enhanced. Thus, long-term statin treatment upregulates the eNOS pathway and attenuates the acute toxicity of human oxLDL. In contrast to chronic ACE inhibition, the eNOS abundance is not increased.",

    "188": "We recently reported that in the ischemic human heart, locally formed angiotensin II activates angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors on sympathetic nerve terminals, promoting reversal of the norepinephrine transporter in an outward direction (i.e., carrier-mediated norepinephrine release). The purpose of this study was to assess whether cardiac sympathetic nerve endings contribute to local angiotensin II formation, in addition to being a target of angiotensin II. To this end, we isolated sympathetic nerve endings (cardiac synaptosomes) from surgical specimens of human right atrium and incubated them in ischemic conditions (95% N(2,) sodium dithionite, and no glucose for 70 min). These synaptosomes released large amounts of endogenous norepinephrine via a carrier-mediated mechanism, as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of desipramine on this process. Norepinephrine release was further enhanced by preincubation of synaptosomes with angiotensinogen and was prevented by two renin inhibitors, pepstatin-A and BILA 2157BS, as well as by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and the AT(1) receptor antagonist EXP 3174 [2-N-butyl-4-chloro-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl] methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid]. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of renin in cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals; renin abundance increased ~3-fold during ischemia. Thus, renin is rapidly activated during ischemia in cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals, and this process eventually culminates in angiotensin II formation, stimulation of AT(1) receptors, and carrier-mediated norepinephrine release. Our findings uncover a novel autocrine/paracrine mechanism whereby angiotensin II, formed at adrenergic nerve endings in myocardial ischemia, elicits carrier-mediated norepinephrine release by activating adjacent AT(1) receptors.",

Reductions in blood pressure after 8 weeks of treatment were as follows: moxonidine, from 166.2 +/- 15.5/101.3 +/- 4.0 to 141.2 +/- 15.7/88.1 +/- 7.7mmHg; enalapril, from 165.4 +/- 14.3/101.1 +/- 4.4 to 143.5 +/- 12.7/89.2 +/- 7.4 mmHg; and placebo, from 162.5 +/- 14.4/99.9 +/- 3.9 to 161.3 +/- 17.9/97.6 +/- 6.6 mmHg. Both moxonidine and enalapril produced sustained reductions in blood pressure during 24-h recording (p < 0.01 for overall effect of either drug vs placebo).

It is the first cause of acute renal failure (ARF) in children and is less frequently observed in adults. We report the case of a 50 years old woman who was first admitted in the surgery department for intestinal occlusion. Haematological and renal disorders were not recognised initially. Specific treatment with plasma exchanges was beneficial. This case was idiopathic but in 50% of HUS in adults, an aetiology can be found and sometimes treated: drugs, pregnancy, systemic diseases, hypertension or cancer. Although still debated, treatment is based on fresh frozen plasma infusion, associated or not to plasma exchanges. Some other therapies can be added: steroids, polyvalent immunoglobulin infusion, vincristin or splenectomy. In all cases, blood pressure control must be obtained, especially with ACE inhibitors. Response to treatment is often excellent, but chronic renal failure persists in about 25% of cases in adults. Recurrences are rare and occur mainly in patients with an hereditary factor H deficiency. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be diagnosed and treated immediately.",

At the same time they examined a control group of 24 patients untreated with ACEI and AIIB. All the patients received combined antituberculous therapy. Cardiac glycosides and diuctics were given in some cases. During 1-2 months, the patients from the experimental group additionally took captopril, 12.5-25.0 mg, twice a day or prestarium, 2.0-4.0 mg, once a day, or cossar, 50 mg, once a day.

Blood pressure was manipulated with aggressive antihypertensive treatment combining low dietary salt and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Successive cycles of 2 wk on, 2 wk off treatment led to rapid, reversible changes in left ventricular (LV) mass (30% change in <10 days). Despite changes in LV mass, specific activities of bioenergetic (cytochrome-c oxidase, citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (total cellular superoxide dismutase) enzymes were actively maintained within relatively narrow ranges regardless of treatment duration, organismal age, or transmural region. Although enalapril led to parallel declines in mitochondrial enzyme content and ventricular mass, total ventricular mtDNA content was unaffected. Altered enzymatic content occurred without significant changes in relevant mRNA and protein levels. Transcript levels of gene products involved in mtDNA maintenance (Tfam), mitochondrial protein degradation (LON protease), fusion (fuzzy onion homolog), and fission (dynamin-like protein, synaptojanin-2alpha) were also unchanged. In contrast, enalapril-mediated ventricular and mitochondrial remodeling was accompanied by a twofold increase in specific activity of catalase, an indicator of oxidative stress, suggesting that rapid cardiac adaptation is accompanied by tight regulation of mitochondrial enzyme activities and increased ROS production.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was reported to enhance endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. This study was carried out to investigate whether temocapril, a novel non-sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, reduces the severity of myocarditis via redox regulation mechanisms involving TRX.",

In rats with experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM), the severity of myocarditis and the protein carbonyl contents were less increased in temocapril treatment (10 mg/kg/day, orally) from day 1 to day 21, but not in temocapril treatment from day 15 to day 21. An immunohistochemical study showed that TRX stain was enhanced in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in damaged myocytes. Considering the characteristics of this model that myocardial inflammation begins around day 15 and increases until day 21, temocapril treatment for 3 weeks might be thought of as a preconditioning treatment.", 
    "207": "The results suggest that TRX and the redox state modified by TRX may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of EAM.

    "208": "The detection and characterization of epistasis or non-additive gene-gene interactions remains a statistical challenge in genetic epidemiology. The recently developed combinatorial partitioning method (CPM) may overcome some of the limitations of linear regression for the exploratory analysis of non-additive epistatic effects. The goal of this study was to compare CPM with linear regression analysis for the exploratory analysis of non-additive interactive effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G polymorphisms on plasma PAI-1 levels in a sample of 50 unrelated African Americans and 117 unrelated Caucasians. Using linear regression, we documented the additive effects of the ACE and PAI-1 genes on plasma PAI-1 levels in African American females (R(2) = 0.10), African American males (R(2) = 0.16), Caucasian females (R(2) = 0.11), and Caucasian males (R2 = 0.09). Using CPM, we found evidence for non-additive effects of the ACE and PAI-1 genes in both African American females (R(2) = 0.22) and African American males (R(2) = 0.24) but not in Caucasian females (R(2) = 0.10) or Caucasian males (R(2) = 0.11). The results of this exploratory data analysis support previous experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies that have proposed as a working hypothesis that the ACE gene mediates interaction effects of the fibrinolytic and renin-angiotensin systems on plasma levels of PAI-1.",

There is accumulating evidence that plasma levels of t-PA and PAI-1 may be influenced by an interaction between the fibrinolytic and renin-angiotensin systems. The goal of this study was to conduct an exploratory data analysis to determine whether there is evidence that the relationship (i.e. correlation) between plasma t-PA and PAI-1 is influenced by interactive effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G polymorphisms in a sample of 50 unrelated African Americans and 117 unrelated Caucasians. In a single-locus analysis, no evidence for heterogeneity of plasma t-PA and PAI-1 correlations among either ACE I/D or PAI-1 4G/5G genotypes was detected. However, using the combinatorial partitioning method for exploratory data analysis, we identified evidence that is suggestive of heterogeneity of plasma t-PA and PAI-1 correlations among multilocus ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G genotypes in African American females, Caucasian females, Caucasian males, but not African American males. From these results, we propose as a working hypothesis that the correlation between plasma t-PA and PAI-1 may be dependent on epistatic effects of the ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms. This study supports the idea that interactions between the fibrinolytic and renin-angiotensin systems play an important role in the genetic architecture of plasma t-PA and PAI-1.", 
    "210": "This article has three purposes: 1) to summarize recent findings of the Syst-Eur Trial; 2) to provide a short overview of the large trials in hypertension that have compared older with newer drug classes; and 3) to update the results of a meta-regression analysis that addressed the question of: to what extent blood pressure (BP) lowering can explain the findings of recent outcome trials in hypertensive patients or high-risk patients with normotension or hypertension. The Syst-Eur trial showed that in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, drug treatment starting with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker reduced the risk of stroke and of all cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, this treatment regimen improved the prognosis of diabetic patients; reduced the incidence of proteinuria; and prevented dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease. The pooled evidence from nine recently published actively controlled outcome trials involving 62,605 hypertensive patients proved that calcium channel blockers have the same long-term efficacy and safety as the older drug classes. Compared with diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers may offer greater protection against stroke and less protection against myocardial infarction, resulting in similar overall cardiovascular benefit. A meta-regression analysis including 30 trials and 149,407 hypertensive or high-risk patients showed that BP gradients largely accounted for most-if not all-of the differences in outcome. These findings emphasize the desirability of tight BP control. The hypothesis that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or alpha-blockers might influence outcome beyond their BP lowering-effects was not confirmed.", 
    "211": "Cardiovascular disease is a growing global health threat due in part to demographic shifts, in particular the growing elderly population in which cardiovascular disease is highly likely to develop. Older individuals have numerous coexisting conditions that contribute to increased risk for morbidity and mortality. In the past, physicians primarily used diastolic blood pressure (BP) as the indicator for measuring relative risk. However, since the early 1970s observational studies have found that systolic BP rather than diastolic BP is a better predictor of cardiovascular events, particularly in the older population. The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) recommended specific goals for the treatment of hypertensive patients. Specifically, JNC-VI reinforced the notion of more aggressive BP goals for patients at the greatest risk for an event. The approach to patients who are not at goal is different from earlier guidelines. Therapy is now aimed at building therapeutic regimens. Currently, there are five classes of agents that have been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin receptor blockers. If a patient is not at goal and there is no response to an agent from one of these classes or troublesome side effects develop, then and only then should that drug be stopped and a different one used. Otherwise, a multidrug regimen is constructed and additional agents added in logical fashion. A majority of patients with higher risk can attain control at the specified BP goal safely and effectively by using a combination of agents.", 
    "212": "Resistant hypertension, secondary hypertension, and hypertensive crises are uncommon but potentially dangerous forms of hypertension that are associated with an increased risk of complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and renal failure. Appropriate diagnostic screening and selective drug or surgical management can reduce the risk of these complications dramatically. In compliant patients, resistant hypertension occurs most often in obese patients receiving inadequate diuretic therapy. In patients with clinical clues to the diagnosis, the best current screening test for renovascular hypertension is probably the ACE-inhibitor renal scintiscan. Angioplasty is considerably more successful in younger patients with fibrous dysplasia than in older patients with the atherosclerotic variety. Hypertensive crises are divided into BP urgencies and emergencies. In both settings, the reduction in BP should generally be gradual rather than abrupt, with no intent to acutely normalize the BP.",

The patients were then randomized and scheduled for electrical cardioversion. Two groups of patients were compared: Group I was treated with amiodarone, and group II was treated with amiodarone plus irbesartan. The primary end point was the length of time to a first recurrence of atrial fibrillation. From a total of 186 patients assessed in the study, 154 were analyzed with the use of intention-to-treat analysis. Seventy-five patients were randomly allocated to group I and 79 to group II. After 2 months of follow-up in the intention-to-treat analysis, the group treated with irbesartan had fewer patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (Kaplan-Meier analysis, 84.79% versus 63.16%, P=0.008). The Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first recurrence during the follow-up period (median time, 254 days [range, 60 to 710]) also showed that patients treated with irbesartan had a greater probability of remaining free of atrial fibrillation (79.52% versus 55.91%, P=0.007).",

    "220": "Evidence suggests that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentially reduces the risk of cancer, though the mechanism is unclear. To clarify a potential involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling in cancer risk, we have examined the effect of Ang II receptor deficiency on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon tumorigenesis. Male Ang II type 2 receptor gene-disrupted (AT(2)-null) mice with a 129/Ola and C57BL/6J genetic background, AT(2)-null mice with an SWR/J genetic background, and their corresponding control wild type mice were treated once a week with AOM (10 mg/kg, i.p., 4 consecutive weeks) or saline vehicle. All mice were killed 23-26 weeks after the initial injection of AOM, and tumor burdens were examined. AOM treatment caused the development of colon tumors in all wild type control mice regardless of genetic background (100% tumor prevalence), but only one tumor was present in AT(2)-null mice with a 129/Ola and C57BL/6J genetic background (11.1% tumor prevalence). Although the introduction of the AOMsusceptible SWR/J genetic background induced AOM susceptibility in AT(2) null mice, the tumor multiplicity (6.3) and tumor size (19.8 +/- 3.0 mm(3)) were significantly smaller than those in wild type mice (multiplicity, 12.0 and size, 36.8 +/- 3.2 mm(3)). AOM efficiently downregulated cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in the liver of wild type mice significantly more than in AT(2)-null mice. The levels of DNA methyl adducts formed in wild type mouse colon epithelium by AOM treatment were also significantly higher than in AT(2)-null mice. These results imply that the AT(2) receptor functions to augment AOM-induced downregulation of CYP2E1 expression in the liver, and thus increases AOM-induced tumorigenesis in the colon. The AT(2) receptor function in the liver may be a potential determinant of tumor susceptibility in chemical carcinogen-induced colon tumorigenesis.", 
    "221": "The attainment of adequate renal protection requires strict blood pressure control and a diminution of proteinuria or microalbuminuria to values as near from normalcy as possible. It has been considered that by getting the first, the second could be attained at the same price. Recent data have confirmed that renal protection in hypertensive patients, diabetics or not, requires combination therapy that has to include an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. A calcium channel blocker can be added to this without renal compromise. A diuretic will also be needed in most cases. Proteinuria will diminish with this combination in particular if up-titration of the drug blocking the effects of angiotensin II is performed. The control of other associated risk factors is also required, in particular smoking and lipids.", 
    "222": "Heart failure is a substantial cause of increased morbidity and mortality in the African-American population, with poorer prognosis versus white patients. Systolic heart failure is predominantly caused by poorly controlled hypertension in African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans remain underrepresented in morbidity and mortality heart failure trials, and further data are needed to confirm the potential benefit of present therapies and newer approaches to heart failure in African-Americans. Intensive blood pressure control and control of other risk factors, along with the appropriate application of evidence-based therapies including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and approved beta-blockers, are required to decrease racial disparities. Although some data suggest that contemporary treatment with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be less effective in African-Americans in terms of reducing heart failure morbidity and mortality, there is not adequate evidence to support a unique strategy for this population. The use of evidence-based therapies should be equally applied to African-Americans as well as to other ethnic groups while awaiting further studies.", 
    "223": "Clinical trials provide average effects of interventions but are not powered to identify differences in subgroup responses. African-Americans have been under-represented in most previous trials in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, physiologic differences have been demonstrated between African-Americans and whites in the mechanisms and response to therapy in hypertension. Review of previous heart failure trials reveals that African-Americans exhibit less benefit than whites from ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and at least one b-blocker. In contrast, black patients experienced a greater benefit than white patients from the combination of nitrate and hydralazine. These data emphasize the need for trials in black patients to identify effective therapy. The first such trial, African-American Heart Failure Trial, is currently underway.", 
    "224": "Both basic and experimental data indicate that the renin-angiotensin system through angiotensin II mediates its classic hemodynamic role, but also has a significant deleterious role in a number of cardiac, vascular, and renal disorders. Indeed, evidence indicates that angiotensin II negatively impacts endothelial function, cardiac remodeling, vessel wall hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and progressive renal disease. Newer data point to a significant role for angiotensin II in inflammation and in inducing plasminogen activator inhibitor. This widespread negative effect can be countered by newer antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Both small and large clinical trials suggest a large benefit of such drugs on not only organ-specific endpoints such as renal disease or proteinuria, but on global cardiovascular events. It does appear that when blood pressure is significantly elevated, lowering blood pressure does indeed provide protection for larger endpoints such as stroke. However, at lower blood pressure levels, a hemodynamically independent effect is likely to be contributing to the positive effects. We should embrace these effects and champion them for our patients.", 
    "225": "African-American patients constitute a significant and important group who are at high risk for developing hypertension-related complications. The proportion of African-American patients succumbing to or suffering from cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic sequelae is unacceptably high. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for this vital subset of our society. The renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension-related diseases, and therefore drugs that block this system, ie, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may have a special indication for African-American patients. Although these drugs may not be the most efficacious agents in terms of blood pressure reduction, they have a major benefit in offering target organ protection and arresting disease progression in the African-Americans. Hence, contrary to the old notions, drugs blocking the renin-angiotension system have an important place in the management of hypertension and related disorders in African-American patients.",

An attempt was made to assay the induced synthesis of angiotensin II (AII) in the isolated mesenteric rat bed, as well as the reactivity of vessels to AII and norepinephrine used before and after infusion of angiotensin receptor blocker. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), used in infusion, induced slight increase in perfusion pressure only in mesenteric vessels of cadmium poisoned rats. In this group, AII given during ACE infusion induced slightly stronger vasoconstriction than in other groups of rats, and losartan, used in infusion totally eliminated the pressor effect of AII. Therefore, the share of endothelial renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of vessel resistance was greater than in mesenteric bed of lead-poisoned rats or controls.

    "253": "We have reviewed the role of salt intake in kidney diseases, particularly in relation to renal hemodynamics, renal excretion of proteins, renal morphological changes and progression of chronic renal failure. High salt intake may have detrimental effects on glomerular hemodynamics, inducing hyperfiltration and increasing the filtration fraction and glomerular pressure. This may be particularly important in elderly, obese, diabetic or black patients, who have a high prevalence of salt-sensitivity. Changes in salt intake may influence urinary excretion of proteins in patients with essential hypertension, or diabetic and non diabetic nephropathies. Moreover, high sodium intake may blunt the antiproteinuric effect of various drugs, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists. Experimental studies show a direct tissue effect of salt on the kidney, independent of its ability to increase blood pressure, inducing hypertrophy, fibrosis and a decrease in glomerular basement membrane anionic sites. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between salt consumption and progression of chronic renal failure, because most information comes from conflicting, small, retrospective, observational studies. In conclusion, it would appear that restriction of sodium intake is an important preventive and therapeutic measure in patients with chronic renal diseases of various origin, or at risk of renal damage, such as hypertensive or diabetic patients.",

In the in vitro microperfused mTAL, basolateral but not apical Ang II induced a transient increase in cytosolic [Ca2+].",

VEGF mRNA and protein expressions increased with CsA and became significantly reduced with Ang II blockade. Flt-1 expression was similar in all groups; it decreased early and remained low. On the other hand, KDR/Flk-1 mRNA expression was higher at seven days in all groups, except in the +E and +L groups where it was significantly lower, and then became further down-regulated at 28 days.", 
    "267": "The increased VEGF expression in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity seems to be related to up-regulation of Ang II. In addition, VEGF probably exerted its effect via the KDR/Flk-1 receptor.

    "268": "The beneficial effects of therapeutic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment against the worsening of glomerulosclerosis during the course of diabetic nephropathy have been widely documented. ACE inhibitors inhibit both angiotensin II formation and bradykinin (BK) degradation, thereby reducing angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor activity and favoring B2-kinin receptor (B2 receptor) activation.

In contrast, in MCs and IG pretreated with BK, the IGF-I-induced Erk 1 and 2 activation was dose-dependently reduced. The inhibitory effect of BK on IGF-I-induced activation of Erk 1 and 2 was completely abolished by addition of a B2 antagonist, by chelation of intracellular calcium and by tyrosine phosphatase inhibition. Additionally, BK reduced MC proliferation induced by IGF-I.", 
    "271": "A new inhibitory pathway of the early steps of IGF-I signaling by the B2 receptor is found both in cultured MCs and in IG, which involves a calcium-dependent tyrosine phosphatase activity. Recruitment of this mechanism may account for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor treatment on glomerulosclerosis associated with diabetic nephropathies.", 
    "272": "This study examined the proposition that kinins are involved in the renal hemodynamic effect of an ACE inhibitor in Goldblatt (GB) hypertension. The effects of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat were compared in two groups of anesthetized two-kidney one-clip GB rabbits. One group (n = 11) was given enalaprilat (10 mg/kg, i.v.) while a second group (n = 10) received the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant (2.5-5 microg/kg/min, i.v.) prior to enalaprilat. Enalaprilat caused a 40% rise in renal blood flow and 11 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure in the untreated, but no significant renal effect in the icatibant-treated group. Blood pressure was reduced to the same degree in both groups. The results indicate that kinins play a major role in the renal hemodynamic, but not the blood pressure effect of ACE inhibition in the GB rabbit.",

Many studies have emphasized that an abnormal neuroendocrine activation precedes the development of clinically recognized heart failure and plays an important pathogenetic role in progression of this disease. In patients with CHF, moreover, circulating levels of some neurohormonal factors have an independent negative prognostic value. More recently immunological and molecular biology studies have also demonstrated the negative effects exerted by some cytokines and by apoptosis. Correction of neurohormonal disorder is the rationale of therapeutical approach to patients with CHF and appears the only way to significantly decrease mortality. In this review the role of neuroendocrine activation in the pathophysiology of CHF is analyzed.",

The level of LV dysfunction seems to be related to the degree of myocardial fibrosis. Prognosis of hypertensive patients who have LVH regression appears to be improved. Therefore, LVH regression is an important antihypertensive treatment goal. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is implicated in LVH development and myocardial fibrosis in essential arterial hypertension. Early studies in the 80s and 90s have led expectations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could induce greater LVH regression than other antihypertensive drugs at similar blood pressure reduction. In the late 90s, the double-blind randomized controlled PRESERVE trial (Prospective Randomize Enalapril Study Evaluating Reversal of Ventricular Enlargement) has been designed to evaluate whether the ACE inhibitor enalapril was more effective than nifedipine GITS in regressing LVH and improving LV diastolic dysfunction. The PRESERVE study demonstrated a mildly higher antihypertensive effect of nifedipine GITS than enalapril, which required more frequently association with hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure. However, at similar level of blood pressure reduction achieved with enalapril and long-acting nifedipine in association with hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol, both antihypertensive treatments showed similar efficacy in LVH regression and LV diastolic filling improvement.",

Treatment with enalapril was also associated with a comparable reduction in the risk of the development of HF requiring medical therapy and the composite end point of death or development of HF in black and white patients. Black as compared with white patients with ALVD were at increased risk of the development of symptomatic HF (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.51, 2.17, p < 0.001) despite adjustment for available measures of disease severity.",

Diabetic animals received treatment with perindopril (4 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) or no treatment for 20 weeks. Nondiabetic apoE-deficient mice were used as controls. Induction of diabetes was associated with a 4-fold increase in plaque area compared with nondiabetic animals. This accelerated atherosclerosis was associated with a significant increase in aortic ACE expression and activity and connective tissue growth factor and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. Perindopril treatment inhibited the development of atherosclerotic lesions and diabetes-induced ACE, connective tissue growth factor, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 overexpression in the aorta.",

Patients were divided into those with target organ damage (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage. Plasma levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-sel), a marker of platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction (both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the rheological indices fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, platelet, and white cell count were measured. In 53 patients, variables were further measured after 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk management. Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus 125 (SD 33) IU/dL (P=0.002,) and a greater proportion of smokers, 31% versus 16% (P=0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, or sP-sel between the 2 subgroups. In multivariate analysis, vWF was a significant independent predictor for TOD. After 6 months of intensified management in 53 patients who entered the trial, there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, hematocrit, plasma viscosity, sP-sel, and vWF (all P<0.01) but no significant change in fibrinogen. In conclusion, there is a relationship between TOD and endothelial damage/dysfunction in hypertension. Intensified management results in improvements in hemorheology, endothelial and platelet function.", 
    "312": "The present study was undertaken to clarify the role of intrarenal angiotensin (Ang) II and its generating pathways in clipped and nonclipped kidneys of 4-week unilateral renal artery stenosis in anesthetized dogs. After 4 weeks, renal plasma flow (RPF) decreased in clipped and nonclipped kidneys (baseline, 59+/-3; clipped, 16+/-1; nonclipped, 44+/-2 mL/min; P<0.01, n=22). Renal Ang I levels increased only in clipped, whereas intrarenal Ang II contents were elevated in both clipped (from 0.7+/-0.1 to 2.0+/-0.2 pg/mg tissue) and nonclipped kidneys (from 0.6+/-0.1 to 2.5+/-0.3 pg/mg tissue). Intrarenal ACE activity was increased in nonclipped kidneys but was unaltered in clipped kidneys. An angiotensin receptor antagonist (olmesartan medoxomil) given into the renal artery markedly restored RPF, and dilated both afferent and efferent arterioles (using intravital videomicroscopy). Furthermore, in clipped kidneys, the elevated Ang II was suppressed by a chymase inhibitor, chymostatin (from 2.1+/-0.6 to 0.8+/-0.1 pg/mg tissue; P<0.05), but not by cilazaprilat. In nonclipped kidneys, in contrast, cilazaprilat, but not chymostatin, potently inhibited the intrarenal Ang II generation (from 2.4+/-0.3 to 1.5+/-0.2 pg/mg tissue; P<0.05). Finally, [Pro11-D-Ala12]Ang I (an inactive precursor that yields Ang II by chymase but not by ACE; 1 to 50 nmol/kg) markedly elevated intrarenal Ang II in clipped, but not in nonclipped, kidneys. In conclusion, renal Ang II contents were elevated in both clipped and nonclipped kidneys, which contributed to the altered renal hemodynamics and microvascular tone. Furthermore, the mechanisms for intrarenal Ang II generation differ, and chymase activity is enhanced in clipped kidneys, whereas ACE-mediated Ang II generation is possibly responsible for elevated Ang II contents in nonclipped kidneys.",

An AT1A (candesartan, 1 mg/kg per day PO) was administered in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats from 4 weeks of age for 34 weeks. PAC was significantly decreased during the first 4 weeks but showed aldosterone breakthrough after 8 weeks of AT1A administration. Plasma angiotensin II concentration was significantly elevated, whereas no change was seen in plasma ACTH or serum potassium. The mechanism(s) of aldosterone breakthrough were investigated by giving high doses of candesartan (3 mg/kg per day PO), dexamethasone (200 microg/kg per day IP), or the AT2 antagonist (PD123319, 10 mg/kg per day SC) during the last week of the 24-week AT1A treatment period. Dexamethasone and AT2 antagonist but not high-dose AT1A produced a significant decrease in PAC, with a larger decrease produced by the AT2 antagonist. To clarify the effects of the residual aldosterone, effects of coadministration of low-dose spironolactone (10 mg/kg per day SC), an aldosterone antagonist, on left ventricular hypertrophy and expression of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA were determined. Low-dose spironolactone further improved left ventricular hypertrophy and brain natriuretic peptide mRNA expression despite no additional depressor effect. These results suggest that aldosterone breakthrough occurs during long-term AT1A therapy, mainly by an AT2-dependent mechanism. Residual aldosterone may attenuate the cardioprotective effects of AT1A.",

Coronary blood flow (29 +/- 2 to 44 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min) and the cardiac level of nitric oxide (NO) (7.8 +/- 1.9 to 17.5 +/- 3.2 microm) also increased, with these changes being attenuated by either N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or HOE140. RNH-6270 alone caused a modest increase in CBF (34 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min), with no increase in the cardiac NO or bradykinin levels. Both temocaprilat and RNH-6270 caused a further increase in both CBF (51 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min) and cardiac NO levels, without increasing the bradykinin level, and these changes were inhibited by HOE140. In the nonischemic heart, RNH-6270 augmented bradykinin-induced increases in CBF.",

A 43-year-old man with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) received a HLA identical transplant from his sister and 4 years later developed persistent nephrotic range proteinuria and morphological features most compatible with membranous lupus nephritis on biopsy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, although successful in reducing proteinuria, were associated on three occasions with acute allograft dysfunction. Sustained reduction of proteinuria and stable graft function were achieved using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF is emerging as a new therapy for primary renal disease in SLE.

Beta-blockers were introduced in 42 patients, and 2% had to discontinue. Of those continuing therapy 97% and 89% of the targeted dose was reached, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers, respectively. During the titration 52% of the patients receiving an ACE-inhibitor, and 57% of those receiving a beta-blocker, reported symptomatic improvement. In contrast to pharmaceutical studies, our patients were referred with no other selection than that applied by the patient's physician.

Then the influence of the combination of additives including antioxidants, anti-irritants and penetration enhancer on stability, skin irritation and penetration capacity of captopril in semisolid dosage form was investigated. In the stability study, the degradation of captopril followed the first-order kinetic. The chelating agent EDTA showed a potent stability effect and obviously increased the shelf-life up to 14-fold that of control gel. The anti-irritants such as clobetasol and diphenhydramine had potent inhibition irritation activity and the effect was not retarded by the addition of EDTA. Moreover, the captopril gel containing penetration enhancer, anti-irritants and chelating agent had a higher penetration capacity and the minimum therapeutic concentration could be obtained by applying about 13.24 cm(2) of administered area, indicating that the formulation can possibly be developed for a transdermal drug delivery system.",

    "336": "1. The present study compared the acute efficacies of vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat, nitroglycerin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction. Omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits both neutral endopeptidase and ACE. Whereas vasopeptidase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in hypertension and heart failure, their effects in myocardial ischaemia remain unclear. 2. Omapatrilat (0.3 mg/kg) was compared with vehicle (saline), an ACE inhibitor (fosinoprilat; 0.44 mg/kg) and nitroglycerin (8.0 microg/kg per min), in an established canine model of exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction induced by progressive closure of an ameroid constrictor placed about the proximal circumflex coronary artery. Maximal treadmill exercise tests, terminated when heart rate failed to increase with increasing workload or failure to continue exercise, were performed in chronically instrumented dogs. 3. During exercise, omapatrilat and nitroglycerin similarly increased ischaemic wall thickening (P< or = 0.0001, ANOVA, 12 d.f.), whereas fosinoprilat and vehicle were without effect. Ischaemic zone ST changes were decreased with nitroglycerin (P = 0.0006, ANOVA, 12 d.f.) and tended to decrease with omapatrilat (P = 0.07, ANOVA, 12 d.f.). Peak exercise capacity was increased with nitroglycerin (9.7 +/- 1.1 vs 11.2 +/- 1.0 kcal, control vs 4 h, respectively; n = 6) and omapatrilat (9.7 +/- 0.8 vs 11.4 +/- 0.6 kcal, control vs 4 h, respectively; n = 6) and was unchanged with ACE inhibition (9.0 +/- 1.2 vs 9.5 +/- 1.1 kcal, control vs 4 h, respectively; n = 7). Omapatrilat differentially increased double product during exercise (P = 0.001, ANOVA, 12 d.f.) compared with other treatments. 4. During exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction, acute ACE inhibition did not attenuate ischaemic changes and failed to improve exercise capacity. Increased exercise capacity with omapatrilat was accompanied by a differential increase in double product, consistent with increased oxygen supply and demand. Improvements in ischaemic function were comparable between omapatrilat and nitroglycerin, suggesting that omapatrilat may represent a novel therapy in demand-induced ischaemia.", 
    "337": "The beneficial effects of imidapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor were investigated on changes in myofibrillar ATPase as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) content and gene expression due to myocardial infarction (MI). Three weeks after occluding the left coronary artery, rats were treated with or without imidapril (1 mg/kg/day), for 4 weeks. The infarcted hearts exhibited depressed rates of left ventricular (LV) pressure development (57+/-2.4% reduction) and pressure decay (55.5+/-1.6% reduction). LV myofibrillar Ca(2+) ATPase activity, unlike that in the right ventricle (RV), was decreased in the infarcted animals compared with controls (6.8+/-0.4 vs 10.3+/-0.6 micromol Pi/mg/hr). MHC alpha-isoform contents were decreased by 47 and 41% whereas those of MHC beta-isoform were increased by 823 and 1200% in the LV and RV due to MI, respectively. MHC alpha-isoform mRNA levels were decreased by 55 and 35% whereas those for MHC beta-isoform were increased by 50 and 30% in the infarcted LV and RV, respectively. Imidapril treatment partially prevented the changes due to MI in LV function (rate of pressure development, 24+/-2.3% reduction and rate of pressure decay, 14+/-1.8% reduction), myofibrillar Ca(2+) ATPase activity (8.2+/-0.7 micromol Pi/mg/hr), MHC protein content (alpha-MHC, 24% reduction and beta-MHC, 525% increase) and MHC gene expression (alpha-MHC, 18% reduction and beta-MHC, 15% increase). The results suggest that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on the failing heart are associated with improvements in myofibrillar ATPase activities as well as prevention of changes in MHC isozyme protein contents and their gene expression.", 
    "338": "A generic macrocyclic peptide structure 2 was designed as a potential inhibitor of a range of proteinases, by using as a basis for the design the known structures of a series of enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The macrocyclic nature of the target 2 was chosen so as to reduce the entropic advantage in the hydrolytic enzymatic step, and thereby to inhibit the function of the enzyme. The nature of the linking group was identified as a benzoxazole by molecular modeling, so as to preserve the recognized conformation of the peptide chain. The specificity of the potential inhibitor was tuned by variation of the P(1) group (by incorporating phenylalanine, aspartic acid, or lysine), to allow recognition by different enzyme classes. The targets were prepared from the bis-amino acid derivative 5, itself prepared using the Pd-catalyzed coupling of an organozinc reagent with the iodobenzothiazole 7 and subsequent macrocyclization of the open-chain derivatives 22-24 using HATU. None of the macrocylic compounds 25, 28-30, and 32 inhibited their target enzymes. NMR and MS studies on the interaction of macrocycle 29 and chymotrypsin established that compound 29 was in fact a substrate of the enzyme. This result indicated that while the design had been partially successful in identifying a compound that bound, the reduction in entropic advantage due to its macrocyclic nature was not sufficient to allow 29 to act as an inhibitor.", 
    "339": "The coexistence of diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients doubles the number of cardiovascular events (relative risk: 1.73-2.77) and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk: 2.25-3.66). Therapeutic interventions concentrating on elevated blood glucose alone for prevention of late complications were not effective in essential reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. For that reason therapies, focussing on other macrovascular risk factors, did increase significantly in the last decade. Strategies for reduction of the macrovascular risk include the aggressive treatment of hypertension. In the now published hypertension intervention studies in diabetic patients many different objectives were studied. As we already know, lowering of blood pressure does reduce cardiovascular risk. The optimal blood pressure threshold is not known yet, but of major interest. To find the most effective antihypertensive agent and the most effective combination therapy for diabetic patients, the most frequently used antihypertensive agents were compared with each other. Very interesting are the special effects of some substances, which exceed the lowering of blood pressure, like effects on the endothelinn or on coagulation disturbances. These protective and antiatherosclerotic effects could possibly get relevance even in normotensive patients. Concerning this special question, ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are getting more and more in the focus of interest and seem to be superior compared to other substances. Concluding the existing evidence from hypertension studies the following recommendations can be deduced: Diabetic patients with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor should get an ACE-inhibitor in combination with other antihypertensive agents or as monotherapy. For combination therapy all the available antihypertensive agents are appropriate and can lower blood pressure adequately.",

During period 2, there was an increased use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, heparin, and intravenous nitroglycerin. On the other hand, there was a decreased use of thrombolytic agents, diuretic agents, digitalis, long-acting nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, and lidocaine. The hospital case-fatality rates were 9.4% during period 1 and 6.0% during period 2 (P =.01). The adjusted risk ratio for period 2 versus period 1 was 0.65, with 95% confidence limits of 0.45 to 0.94.

Use of metolazone was an independent predictor of total mortality (adjusted HR = 1.37, P =.016) but not of cause-specific mortality. Low angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor dose was an independent predictor of pump failure death (adjusted HR = 2.21, P =.0005).

Aqueous solutions of LN (4.5-27.2 x 10(-5) M) react with FDNB (in acetonitrile) at pH 8.2 (borate buffer) in dark at 60 degrees C for 45 min. After acidification with HCl to decolourize 2,4-dinitrophenolate (the alkaline hydrolysis product of FDNB), the LN-derivative is measured at 356.5 or 405.5 nm (only at 405.5 nm if HCT is present). The calibration curves are linear (r>0.996 at both wavelengths) with a between days precision of slopes of 1.8 and 2.3% at 405.5 and 356.5 nm, respectively. The quantification limit is 3.49 x 10(-5) M (0.014 mg) at 405.5 nm and 5.69 x 10(-5) M (0.023 mg) at 356.5 nm. The accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated with the analysis of synthetic mixtures (Er%: 0.30-0.60 and 0.27-1.00 at 405.5 and 356.5 nm, respectively; RSD%: 0.48-0.92 and 0.35-0.51 at 405.5 and 356.5 nm, correspondingly; recovery%: 99.2-100.4 at 405.5 nm and 97.9-104.3 at 356.5 nm).

    "349": "Heart failure is a common and disabling condition with a dismal prognosis. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven to be a valuable therapeutic strategy in this condition, with well-proven morbidity and mortality benefits. Nonetheless, ACE inhibitors provide incomplete blockade of the RAAS and also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin. Although increased levels of bradykinin may have haemodynamic advantages by contributing to vasodilatation, they may also be largely responsible for some of the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists offer more complete blockade of the RAAS without the potentiation of bradykinin, and it was therefore hoped that they would provide even greater benefits for patients with heart failure. So far, much of the initial promise of the Ang II receptor antagonists in heart failure has not been realised. There has been no conclusive demonstration of their superiority to ACE inhibitors in their effects on morbidity and mortality, and their equivalence to ACE inhibitors has not been proven. The Ang II receptor antagonists have, however, proven to be better tolerated than ACE inhibitors and they are therefore likely to be a reasonable alternative for those patients with heart failure who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition. Recent evidence has indicated that the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist valsartan is of value when used in patients already receiving either an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker, but has also suggested that giving all three drugs together is deleterious. Further evidence about the value of Ang II receptor antagonists in heart failure may be provided by further studies, of which several are currently ongoing.",

During follow-up 102 patients sustained one or more incidents of the combined primary end-point: cardiac death (n=11), recurrent infarction (n=55) or heart failure requiring hospitalization or treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic (n=52). Using Cox proportional hazards model, baseline Nt-proANP predicted these events (chi-square 25.3, P<0.0001), while baseline echo volumes and ejection fraction did not. During the subsequent 3-24 month period, 51 patients suffered a primary end-point: cardiac death (n=9), recurrent infarction (n=29), heart failure (n=21). An increase in left ventricular end-systolic volume was the strongest predictor for adverse events (chi-square 19.1, P<0.0001), especially for heart failure. Individual changes in Nt-proANP did not predict cardiac events, whereas both echocardiographic variables and Nt-proANP measured at 3 months had a prognostic impact on subsequent cardiac events (3-24 months).",

    "353": "The latent production of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors from tartary buckwheat (BW) was investigated, and the peptides responsible for ACE inhibition characterized. Intact buckwheat was found to exhibit ACE inhibitory activity having an IC50 value of 3.0 mg/ml. The activity of the protein fraction (IC50: 0.36 mg protein/ml) was not enhanced by pepsin treatment. Pepsin, followed by chymotrypsin and trypsin hydrolysis, resulted in a significant increase in the ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 0.14 mg protein/ml). The rutin contained in the buckwheat did not exhibit any ACE inhibition. A single oral administration of BW digest lowered the systolic blood pressure of a spontaneously hypertensive rat. Thus, BW proteins offer a potential resource for producing ACE inhibitory peptides during the digestion process. From the di-/tri-peptide fraction (DTPF) of the BW digest, inhibitory peptides were identified. The magnitude (%) of the total ACE inhibitory contribution of each identified peptide, relative to the overall inhibition of the DTPF, was about 41%.",

The comparative effects of ACEI and ARB on potassium handling have not been investigated. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in dynamic renal potassium handling between ACEI and ARB in response to an oral potassium challenge. This was a randomized crossover study of candesartan versus lisinopril titrated to control BP followed by an inpatient study of renal potassium handling in 24 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DMII) and preserved renal function. Following an oral potassium challenge (0.75 mmol/kg), differences in hourly serum K (mmol/L), rate of urinary potassium excretion (UkV, micromol/min), and fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) were assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA. Hourly UkV(p = .45) and FEK (p = .19) were similar for candesartan and lisinopril, although FEK at 2 hours for candesartan tended to exceed that for lisinopril (.34 [.04] vs. .26 [.03]) and approached significance (p = .096). UkVfor candesartan at hour 2 was 177 (26) and 121 (21) for lisinopril and also approached significance (p = .10). Serial serum potassium did not differ (p = .70).

An ankle-brachial index less than 0.90, consistent with PAD, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in addition to functional impairment. Drug therapy in PAD is directed at reducing the increased risk of cardiovascular events and improving walking impairment. Intensive atherosclerotic risk factor intervention and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended for reducing cardiovascular event rates in persons with PAD. Components of an effective exercise intervention and drug therapy to reduce claudication-related walking impairment in PAD are also reviewed.", 
    "357": "Increases in blood pressure (BP), particularly systolic BP, have traditionally been considered to be a normal or \"physiologic\" component of the aging process. However, it is now clear that elevated BP, particularly systolic BP, represents a pathophysiologic manifestation of altered cardiovascular physiology and structure, ultimately manifesting as increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (myocardial infarction, stroke, and total cardiovascular death rates). More than one half of the population aged 65 or older have hypertension, defined as BP > or = 140/90 mm Hg. Framingham data indicate that the risk of coronary heart disease increases with lower diastolic BP at any level of systolic BP > or = 120 mm Hg, thus further stressing the importance of pressure-induced arterial vascular compliance changes and introducing pulse pressure as an important predictor of cardiovascular risk. Geriatric hypertension is generally of a salt-sensitive nature and often associated with impaired baroreflex function. Reduction in sodium intake is important and effective in older patients, and should be initiated before or together with drug therapy. Encouraging data from clinical trials now strongly support the aggressive anti-hypertensive treatment of elderly patients. A recent meta-analysis of eight outcome trials evaluating the risks of treated and untreated isolated systolic hypertension has demonstrated a 30% reduction in combined fatal and nonfatal stroke, a 26% reduction in fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, and a 13% reduction in total mortality. Those drugs effective in younger patients also appear effective in the elderly; low-dose thiazides (alone or in combination with potassium sparing agents), beta blockers, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers all have demonstrated efficacy. In selecting an agent, it is important to consider comorbid disease states, and to recognize the potential of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whether conventional or cyclooxygenase-2 specific, to increase BP or interfere with other antihypertensive agents. In general, the elderly should be treated to target BP levels identical to those suggested for younger patients, although a more gradual reduction to target, perhaps with an intermediate BP goal of < 160 mm Hg, may be advisable.", 
    "358": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activation and the de novo production of angiotensin II contribute to cardiovascular disease through direct pathological tissue effects, including vascular remodeling and inflammation, as well as indirect action on nitric oxide bioavailability and its consequences. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in both vascular function and structure; thus, the predominant localization of ACE to the endothelium has implications for the pathobiology of vascular disease, such as coronary artery disease. Numerous experimental studies and clinical trials support the emerging realization that tissue ACE is a vital therapeutic target, and that its inhibition may restore endothelial function or prevent endothelial dysfunction. These effects exceed those attributable to blood pressure reduction alone; hence, ACE inhibitors may exert an important part of their effects through direct tissue action. Pharmacologic studies show that while ACE inhibitors may differ according to their binding affinity for tissue ACE the clinical significance remains to be determined.", 
    "359": "To clarify whether fosinopril monotherapy can improve left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) in young mildly hypertensives without hypertrophy, we studied 66 patients (pts) with diastolic blood pressure 90-100 mmHg, aged <45 years, with normal 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo), and impaired DF. Impaired DF was defined as a Doppler transmitral early (E) to atrial (A) filling velocity ratio (E/A ratio) <1. Thirty-eight pts were selected for fosinopril monotherapy. Mean age was 36 years. Duration of documented hypertension was 5.4 years. Mean daily dose of fosinopril was 20 mg. Twenty-eight controls were treated with hydrochlorothiazide and hydralazine combination. Sixty-six age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served to establish normal reference values of 2-D and Doppler echo measurements. All hypertensives were treated for 30 months and re-examined 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. The fosinopril-treated group showed improvements in transmitral E (52 +/- 8 cm/s, vs. 61 +/- 9 cm/s, p < 0.01), A (56 +/- 9 cm/s, vs. 47 +/- 6 cm/s, p < 0.05), and E/A ratio (0.93 +/- 0.16, vs. 1.29 +/- 0.18, p < 0.01). Moreover, the early to atrial velocity-time integral ratio (1.31 +/- 0.10, vs. 2.24 +/- 0.10, p < 0.001) improved. The pulmonary venous flow pattern normalized after fosinopril therapy. LV mass index, relative wall thickness, LV dimension, left atrial dimension, fractional shortening, heart rate, and body mass index did not change. The hydrochlorothiazide-hydralazine combination-treated group did not show an improved diastolic function. It is concluded that long-term fosinopril monotherapy leads to an improvement of impaired LVDF in young mildly hypertensives without hypertrophy.", 
    "360": "Sampatrilat is a dual inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which is under development by Pfizer and Shire (previously Roberts Pharmaceutical) for the potential treatment of hypertension. As of 1995, Pfizer had taken the compound into phase II clinical trials [179233]. In April 1997, Roberts Pharmaceutical, through its wholly owned subsidiary Roberts Laboratories Inc, received an exclusive license from Pfizer to develop and market sampatrilat for the treatment of essential hypertension and congestive heart failure. The agreement provided for transfer of data and the awarding of patent rights to Roberts [240809]. Although in June 2000, Shire confirmed it had discontinued all development of this drug [372652], by December 2000 it had recommenced studies with a reformulation of sampatrilat that achieved a 4-fold increase in oral bioavailability. A clinical trial with the new formulation was to be initiated in 2001, with results expected during the second quarter of 2001. The company also revealed that it was seeking a licensing partner at this time [394238]. In November 2001, Shire confirmed that while the project was undergoing further development with a view to outlicensing, it was unlikely to take this project into phase II alone [429562].", 
    "361": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), the most important component of the renin-angiotensin system, is usually associated with hypertension and renal failure. Through its pro-inflammatory actions, it also plays an important role in each step of the development of atherosclerotic plaques and plaque rupture. Ang II stimulates the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a transcription factor which regulates gene expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are dramatically increased in atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in monocytes at the fibrous cap. Thus, in multiple ways, Ang II is a critical factor in atherosclerotic plaque formation, inflammation and plaque stability. ACE inhibitors and AT1R inhibitors could therefore be appropriate therapeutic agents in the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "362": "The present investigation focused on the possible hepatoprotective potential of captopril on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Twenty-four hours after a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 (20 microl/Kg), hepatotoxicity was evidenced in the serum by elevated levels of aspartate transaminase (AST; EC: 2.6.1.1), alanine transaminase (ALT; EC: 2.6.1.2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC: 1.1.1.27) and in the liver by depleted level of reduced glutathione (GSH), enhanced activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; EC: 1I.11.1.9) and elevated level of lipid peroxides (LP). Captopril was given orally at three dose levels viz., 10, 25 and 50 mg/Kg/day for three consecutive days before subjecting the animals to the hepatotoxin. With the exception of the lowest dose namely, 10 mg/Kg/day, captopril afforded protection against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity to different extents. Thus, the elevated activities of the enzymes AST, ALT, LDH and GSH-Px as well as the enhanced lipid peroxidation were markedly reduced below those elicited by the hepatotoxin, reaching values closer to the control, though still statistically higher. Captopril, however, did not ameliorate the depletion of GSH produced by CCl4. The data reported herein reveal a protective potential of captopril against the acute hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 in mice. This hepatoprotection could be attributed, at least in part, to the free radical scavenging properties of the drug.",

With respect to the subacute character of our experiment (15 days), the following parameters have been recorded: diuresis, glycosuria, ketonuria and glycemia. In the diabetic rats treated with ACEI we haven noted slight, statistically insignificant improvements in glycosuria and glycemia, compared to the untreated diabetic subjects. Conversely, a statistically significant improvement of ketonuria has been noted in the diabetic rats receiving ACEI compared to the untreated ones. The short-term administration of ACEI in experimental diabetes mellitus acutely improves the glycemic profile, probably by the amelioration of the tissular sensitivity to insulin.", 
    "374": "The aim of study was to analyze the effect of captopril (C) on blood pressure in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during 1 year treatment. Patients less then 70 years old with systolic blood pressure (sBP) > or = 100 mm Hg were qualified to the study. Administration of C was started during the first 4 days of AMI (mean 21 +/- 24 h). 50 pts treated with C and control group of 43 pts were finally analyzed. Doses of C were gradually increased from 3.125 t.i.d. on the first day till 25 mg t.i.d. on the 4th day. Significant decrease of sBP after administration of C was observed at 60 and 120 min after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose on the first day, and after 30-120 min after first C dose on the 4th day. dBP decreased only at 60-120 min after the 1st dose on first day and at 90 min after the first dose on 4th day. Hypotension after 1st and 2nd dose of C on the first day caused exclusion of 3 pts (6%) from the study. In conclusion, hypotension seems to be quite often encountered during captopril therapy of early phase of AMI. It appears not only after the first but also after the following doses. The initial dose of 3.125 mg seems to be safe and sufficient to assess its hypotensive action.", 
    "375": "Hypertension is commonly associated with chronic renal disease in cats, and inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may contribute to the hypertensive state. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly administered when hypertension is present to decrease plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone, which cause vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, respectively. The study reported here was conducted over a 6-month period to assess the effects of two commonly prescribed ACE inhibitors, enalapril and benazepril, on the activity of the RAAS and blood pressure in 16 spontaneously hypertensive cats with chronic renal disease. Plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity were not significantly affected by ACE inhibitors in hypertensive cats, and systolic blood pressure did not decrease below 170 mm Hg with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in 14 of 16 cats. These results suggest that continued activation of the RAAS is present in hypertensive cats despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor, and ACE inhibitors should not be used as first-line antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive cats.", 
    "376": "Abnormalities of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen radical synthesis and of oxygen consumption have been described in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. NO plays a role in the regulation of renal oxygen consumption in normal kidney, so the response of renal cortical oxygen consumption to stimulators of NO production before and after the addition of the superoxide scavenging agent tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl) was studied. Baseline cortical oxygen consumption was similar in SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (SHR: 600 +/- 55 nmol O(2)/min per g, WKY: 611 +/- 51 nmol O(2)/min per g, P > 0.05). Addition of bradykinin, enalaprilat, and amlodipine decreased oxygen consumption significantly less in SHR than WKY (SHR: bradykinin -13.9 +/- 1.9%, enalaprilat -15.3 +/- 1.6%, amlodipine -11.9 +/- 0.7%; WKY: bradykinin -22.8 +/- 1.0%, enalaprilat -24.1 +/- 2.0%, amlodipine -20.7 +/- 2.3%; P < 0.05), consistent with less NO effect in SHR. Addition of tempol reversed the defects in responsiveness to enalaprilat and amlodipine, suggesting that inactivation of NO by superoxide contributes to decreased NO availability. The response to an NO donor was similar in both groups and was unaffected by the addition of tempol. These results demonstrate that NO availability in the kidney is decreased in SHR, resulting in increased oxygen consumption. This effect is due to enhanced production of superoxide in SHR. By lowering intrarenal oxygen levels, reduced NO may contribute to susceptibility to injury and renal fibrosis. Increasing NO production, decreasing oxidant stress, or both might prevent these changes by improving renal oxygenation.", 
    "377": "This study sought to investigate the cardiac and renal effects of rigorous versus standard BP control on autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). A prospective, randomized, 7-yr study was performed to examine the effect of rigorous (<120/80 mmHg) versus standard (135-140/85-90 mmHg) BP control on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and kidney function in 75 hypertensive ADPKD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at baseline and at 1 and 7 yr. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-h creatinine clearance every 6 mo for 3 yr, then annually for an additional 4 yr. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. During the study, average mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). The LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and by 35% in the rigorous group. A mixed model longitudinal data analysis revealed that rigorous BP control was significantly more effective in decreasing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor, was decreased to a significantly greater extent by rigorous than standard BP control. This finding has particular clinical importance because cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in ADPKD patients.",

In vitro tests revealed that the two milks contained competitive inhibitors of ACE in amounts comparable to what has been obtained in previously reported studies. The two milks were administered by gavage to spontaneously hypertensive rats that had had a permanent aortic catheter inserted through the left arteria carotis, and mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored from 4 to 8 h after administration. Unfermented milk and milk fermented with a lactococcal strain that does not produce inhibitors were used as controls. Highly significant blood pressure effects were observed; i.e., milk fermented with the two strains of L. helveticus gave a more pronounced drop in blood pressure than the controls. Significant differences in heart rate effects were detected with one of the strains.",

The mechanism of severe hyponatremia induced by ACE inhibitor is not clear.

The serum sodium level was 138 mmol/L before initiation of enalapril therapy and 127 mmol/L just before cardiac surgery. In the post-heart transplantation period, enalapril therapy was withdrawn for the perianesthesia period, and the serum sodium level increased from 127 to 140 mmol/L. One month later, viral myocarditis developed in the patient and enalapril was reintroduced at 20 mg daily. Two weeks later, natremia decreased. Enalapril was discontinued. Three days later the serum sodium level rose to 140 mmol/L. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone should be considered a rare but possible complication associated with ACE inhibitor therapy.",

Compared with captopril, S21402 increased levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (P <.05) and urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (P <.001); these increases were the result of inhibition of neutral endopeptidase activity (P <.001). The increase in plasma renin concentration related to ACE inhibition was less marked (P <.001) after S21402 than after captopril. S21402, but not captopril, increased urinary sodium excretion (P <.05), without modifying blood pressure and creatinine clearance, whereas blood pressure transiently fell after captopril administration (P <.05).",

The principle of differential pricing is that drug prices should vary according to some measure of affordability. How differential prices should be determined is, however, unclear. Here we describe a method whereby differential prices for essential drugs could be derived in countries of variable national wealth, and, using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide an example of how the process might work. Indicative prices for drugs can be derived by cost-effectiveness analysis that incorporates a measure of national wealth. Such prices could be used internationally as a basis of differential price negotiations.", 
    "386": "Angio-oedema is a rare but potentially life threatening side-effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment. Identification of individuals at risk of this adverse effect is not possible. Angio-oedema is associated with raised concentrations of bradykinin, which is mainly inactivated by ACE. We assessed the plasma activity of two other enzymes that catabolise bradykinin (aminopeptidase P and carboxypeptidase N) in 39 hypertensive patients with a history of angio-oedema during ACE inhibitor treatment and in 39 hypertensive patients who had never had ACE inhibitor associated side-effects. Patients with previous angio-oedema had a lower plasma activity of aminopeptidase P than did those who never presented with angio-oedema (p=0 003). Our data suggest that low plasma concentrations of aminopeptidase P could be a predisposing factor for development of angio-oedema in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "387": "The MEDV-13, molecular electronegativity distance vector based on 13 atomic types, has at best 91 descriptors. It is impossible to indirectly use multiple linear regression (MLR) to derive a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. Although principal component regression (PCR) or partial least-squares regression (PLSR) can be employed to develop a latent QSAR model, it is still difficult how to determine the principal components (PCs) and depict the physical meaning of the PCs. So, a genetic algorithm (GA) is first employed to select an optimal subset of the descriptors from original MEDV-13 descriptor set. Then MLR is utilized to build a QSAR model between the optimal subset and the biological activities of three sets of compounds. For 31 benchmark steroids, a 5-descriptor QSAR model (M1) between the corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) binding affinity of the steroids and 5-descriptor subset is developed. The root-mean-square error of estimations (RMSEE) and the correlation coefficient of estimations (r) between the CBG binding affinity (BA) observed and the BA estimated by M1 are 0.422 and 0.9182, respectively. The root-mean-square error of predictions (RMSEP) and the correlation coefficient of predictions (q) between the BA observed and the BA predicted by leave-one-out cross validations are 0.504 and 0.8818, respectively. For 58 dipeptides inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a 5-variable QSAR model (M2) between the pIC(50) of peptides and 5-descriptor subset is derived. The M2 has a high quality with RMSEE = 0.339 and r = 0.9398 and RMSEP = 0.370 and q = 0.9280. For 16 indomethacin amides and esters (ImAE) inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a 6-variable QSAR model (M3) with RMSEE = 0.079 and r = 0.9839 and RMSEP = 0.151 and q = 0.9413 is built.", 
    "388": "Effects of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist valsartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril were studied in streptozotocine (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats on the basis of microalbuminuria (Ma) and renal morphology. Five groups of Wistar rats were used, one group was the non-diabetic control, one group consisted of untreated STZ-diabetics and 3 groups of STZ-diabetics were treated with either enalapril and/or valsartan for 30 days. Blood glucose (BG) and Ma levels, body and kidney weight and glomerular size were measured. Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) antibody was performed as well. In STZ-diabetics, BG and Ma levels were significantly increased when compared with the non-diabetic group. Although Ma levels in the valsartan-treated group was found to be higher than those in the non-diabetics group after 15 days of treatment, in all treated diabetic groups Ma levels were significantly decreased as compared with STZ-diabetics at the end of the experiment. Thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes, increased mesangial matrix and glomerular size were found in the untreated diabetic group. All these changes were less in the treated groups. A significant increase in TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity was found in glomeruli of untreated STZ-diabetics as compared with non-diabetics. Again, TGF-beta1 expression was decreased in the treated groups as compared with untreated STZ-diabetics. We conclude that valsartan and enalapril have renoprotective effects in diabetic nephropathy. A combined therapy has an advantage because lower dosages of these drugs can be used. Their beneficial effects are related to a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a decrease in TGF-beta1 expression in glomeruli.",

Nevertheless, they remain a concern, and patient populations at risk for renal adverse effects from NSAIDs can be prospectively identified. Patients at risk include those with age-related declines in glomerular filtration rate; those with hypovolemia, particularly patients taking loop diuretics; and those with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. The following patient populations are at higher risk for increases in blood pressure with concomitant use of an NSAID and an antihypertensive: those with congestive heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease, and those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or diuretics. Nonselective NSAIDs and COX (cyclooxygenase)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) appear to have similar effects on renal function if dosed equivalently, and standard precautions to avoid renal toxicity with use of nonselective NSAIDs apply to coxibs.", 
    "390": "Heart failure is a common and often debilitating condition, but one for which there exists a variety of effective pharmacological therapies. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent one of the mainstays of the treatment of heart failure. In spite of a wealth of evidence regarding the efficacy of these agents in improving mortality and morbidity in heart failure, they are often under-utilised. Failure to prescribe or to prematurely withdraw ACE inhibitor therapy often stems from physicians perceptions regarding the likelihood of unwanted effects, in particular hypotension, renal impairment and cough. The evidence from clinical trials is that these unwanted effects are relatively uncommon. In routine clinical practice the rate of prescription of ACE inhibitor therapy is related to the expertise and motivation of the physician. There is a need for education of all health care professionals involved in the care of patients with heart failure with regard to the maximisation of ACE inhibitor therapy in heart failure.", 
    "391": "Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be activated in congestive heart failure (CHF). This activation is likely the result of the convergence of a number of factors, several of which could be attenuated with the use of an Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In order to assess this, rats had a myocardial infarction (MI) created by coronary artery ligation and were followed for 28 days without treatment to permit the development of CHF. At that time, the ACE inhibitor quinapril was started, or rats remained untreated and were followed a further 56 days for a total of 84 days. Half of the untreated rats had quinapril started 3 days prior to sacrifice, on day 81. Starting quinapril at either 28 or 81 days had little effect on cardiac hemodynamics, or ventricular remodeling. Quinapril did however attenuate the MI-induced rise in cardiac cytokine expression (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1beta, -5 and -6). Thus, in CHF, ACE inhibitors attenuate the rise in cardiac cytokine expression. This study helps to identify a new mechanism by which ACE inhibitors may exert their beneficial effects in CHF.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two different, renin-angiotensin blocking combinations, on blood pressure (BP), albuminuria and glycemic control. Its design was prospective, randomised, controlled, of parallel branches, and performed in one Endocrinology Department, in Spain. 77 type-II diabetic patients, with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day) were included. After a pre-inclusion time of 2 weeks, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5 mg/day. Duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin and plasmatic urea. Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6 +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values, by treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria significantly decreased from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day. Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +/- 1.3% to 7.14 +/- 1.2% in the VT group, and from 7.96 +/- 1.29% to 7.84 +/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +/- 12.7 to 40.5 +/- 11.1 mg/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +/- 12.0 mg/dL to 52.4 +/- 19.4 mg/dL in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The verapamil/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate metabolism than losartan/hydroclorothiazide.",

Higher doses were associated with greater increases in vasodilator and natriuretic peptides, in addition to ACE inhibition. After 12 weeks, omapatrilat 20 mg and 40 mg showed greater falls from baseline in PCWP (40 mg: 0 h to 12 h average change -7.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg) and SBP (40 mg: -11.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) than 2.5 mg (both p < 0.01 vs. 2.5 mg).

The contribution of cytotoxicity depends on the presence of Leu(32): VV-hemorphins, except VV-hemorphin-4, exhibit cytotoxicity significantly higher than respective LVV-hemorphins. Decrease of cell number induced by hemorphins depend on the extent of N- and C-terminal degradation of hemorphins: VV-hemorphins in most cases are more active than LVV-, V-hemorphins, and hemorphins. In the group of VV-hemorphins the activity of VV-hemorphin-5 (valorphin) is significantly higher than of VV-hemorphin-7, VV-hemorphin-6, and VV-hemorphin-4, meaning that the presence of C-terminal Gln is important for suppressing of cell number. The amino acid sequence VVYPWTQ corresponding to valorphin was identified as important for manifestation of the both cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects.",

Blood pressure was measured by a validated oscillometric device using a standardized protocol.",

Likewise, no differences were observed regarding the effect on systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure. The percentage of adverse reactions was low (6.3%). When effects on PP reduction and adverse reactions were pooled together, angiotensin receptor blockers emerged as the antihypertensive drug class with the best profile.",

Although PP is considered as an important prognostic factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, the present results do not strengthen its usefulness as a distinctive marker of antihypertensive drug classes.", 
    "403": "The pharmacotherapy currently recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for heart failure (HF) is a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and (usually) digitalis. This current treatment of HF may be improved by optimising the dose of ACEI used, as increasing the dose of lisinopril increases its benefits in HF. Selective angiotensin receptor-1 (AT(1)) antagonists are effective alternatives for those who cannot tolerate ACEIs. AT(1) antagonists may also be used in combination with ACEIs, as some studies have shown cumulative benefits for the combination. In addition to being used in Stage IV HF patients, in whom it has a marked benefit, spironolactone should be studied in less severe HF and in the presence of beta-blockers. The use of carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol and bisoprolol should be extended to severe HF patients as these agents have been shown to decrease mortality in this group. The ancillary properties of carvedilol, particularly antagonism at prejunctional beta -adrenoceptors, may give it additional benefits to selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists. Celiprolol and bucindolol are not the beta-blockers of choice in HF, as they do not decrease mortality. Although digitalis does not reduce mortality, it remains the only option for a long-term positive inotropic effect, as the long-term use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors is associated with increased mortality. The calcium sensitising drug levosimendan may be useful in the hospital treatment of decompensated HF to increase cardiac output and improve dyspnoea and fatigue. The antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone should probably be used in patients at high risk of arrhythmic or sudden death, although this treatment may soon be superseded by the more expensive implanted cardioverter defibrillators, which are probably more effective and have fewer side effects. The natriuretic peptide nesiritide has recently been introduced for the hospital treatment of decompensated HF. Novel drugs that may be beneficial in the treatment of HF include the vasopeptidase inhibitors and the selective endothelin-A receptor antagonists but these require much more investigation. However, disappointing results have been obtained in a large clinical trial of the tumour necrosis factor alpha antagonist etanercept, where no likelihood of a difference between placebo and etanercept was observed. Small clinical trials with recombinant growth hormone to thicken ventricles in dilated cardiomyopathy have given variable results.", 
    "404": "Due to the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases with the homologous transfusion of blood products, there has been an increased interest in measures to limit intraoperative blood loss and avoid the need for homologous transfusion during high-risk surgical procedures including spinal surgery. Controlled hypotension (also referred to as deliberate or induced hypotension), defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure to 80 to 90 mm Hg, a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 50 to 65 mm Hg or a 30% reduction of baseline MAP, is one technique that has been used to limit intraoperative blood loss. In the adult population, several agents have been used alone or in combination for controlled hypotension including the inhalational anesthetic agents, direct-acting vasodilators such as nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) and nitroprusside, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and calcium channel antagonists. Despite clinical studies that have clearly demonstrated a reduction in blood loss with controlled hypotension when compared with the normotensive state and despite potential theoretical issues with each agent, there are no definitive studies demonstrating the preferred pharmacologic agent. When considering the pediatric-aged patient, studies have reported the use of the inhalational agent sevoflurane, the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine as well as various vasodilators including sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, fenoldopam, and alprostadil for controlled hypotension. Sevoflurane offers the advantages of easy dosage titration, no need for an additional intravenous infusion as well as providing anesthesia in addition to controlled hypotension. Disadvantages include a slightly higher cost than some of the intravenous agents and the inability to monitor evoked potentials with high sevoflurane concentrations. Whereas sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine and fenoldopam all provide the desired level of hypotension in pediatric-aged patients, nitroglycerin was not effective in this age group of patients in one study. When comparing nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine offers the potential advantages of fewer episodes of excessive hypotension, less rebound tachycardia and, in one study, less blood loss. Although fenoldopam has been shown to be effective, cost issues may limit is widespread application for this technique. The pharmacologic profile of dexmedetomidine indicates that this drug has potential in controlled hypotension and clinical data are needed to define its role.", 
    "405": "Proteolytic digestion of dried bonito muscle with thermolysin produces a hydrolysate with strong angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity and is the basis of a dietary supplement with antihypertensive activity. A major portion of the ACE activity was shown previously to arise from the peptide Leu-Lys-Pro-Asn-Met (LKPNM). A straightforward method to quantify this peptide was developed using one-step C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by LC-MS/MS quantification. The SPE step resulted in a hydrolysate that was still crude, as illustrated by combined size-exclusion chromatography/multi-angle laser light scattering detection that showed that a major fraction of oligopeptides were in the 2-20 kDa range. This fraction has a weight-average molecular weight (M(w)) of approximately 5.0 kDa. Method validation for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and reproducibility showed that standard additions of synthetic LKPNM to bonito extract with SPE enrichment followed by LC-MS/MS is a suitably robust procedure for the determination of LKPNM content. The method was also successful for encapsulated powders in which the excipients used are insoluble in water and could be removed by centrifugation.",

The survey covers the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs. The lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy due to ethical considerations is discussed against the background of the pressing need to treat these women despite the possible deleterious effects of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "410": "This study was designed to examine changes of hemorheological parameters in essential arterial hypertension subjects following antihypertensive drug therapy. Eighty two female subjects were enrolled, and sub-divided into two groups based upon their high shear whole blood viscosity being lower (L) or higher (H) than normal controls. Equal numbers of L and H subjects were then treated for four weeks with one of four agents: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor, Spirapril - 6 mg/day); calcium antagonist (Isradipin - 5 mg/day); beta-1-blocker (Talinolol - 100 mg/day); diuretic (Indapamide - 1.5 mg/day). Both prior to and following drug treatment for six weeks, hemorheological measurements included plasma viscosity; high and low shear whole blood viscosity, hematocrit, fibrinogen and RBC aggregation. Treatment with each of the four drugs significantly (p<0.05) reduced blood pressure in both the L and H groups. However, the hemorheological effects of antihypertensive drug therapy differed markedly between groups: plasma and whole blood viscosity were significantly elevated in the L groups whereas these parameters were significantly decreased in the H groups. Fibrinogen levels and RBC aggregation decreased in both groups, whereas hematocrit was unaffected. These results thus suggest that the rheologic effects of antihypertensive drug therapy depend strongly on the initial, pre-treatment status of the subject, and that for some subjects, such therapy can result in adverse hemorheological alterations.", 
    "411": "A number of clinical studies have demonstrated significant positive correlation between the severity of arterial hypertension (AHT) and whole blood viscosity. Red blood cell aggregation has also been associated with AHT especially in the severe form of the disease. The main possible cause of increased red blood cell aggregation is fibrinogen which can be found in a significantly higher concentration in patients with AHT than in healthy controls. On the other hand, blood pressure reduction with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium-channel-blocking agents, beta or alpha-receptor blocking drugs leads to a significant improvement of blood rheology. It can be presumed that abnormal hemorheology and AHT are not directly linked but they share the same inductive genetic and/or environmental factors like obesity, chronic mental stress, physical inactivity and cigarette smoking. Regarding this hypothesis, the appropriate question is not whether hemorheological factors are causes or results of AHT but what their common origins are. Further studies are needed to clarify this hypothetical link between hemorheology and AHT.",

Patients were withdrawn from antihypertensive medications 1 to 2 weeks before enrollment, and systolic pressure was confirmed to be > or =160 mm Hg. With the use of calibrated tonometry and pulsed Doppler, pulsatile hemodynamics were assessed before randomization and at 12 weeks. Characteristic impedance (Z(c)), a direct measure of the stiffness of the central aorta, was calculated from the ratio of changes in carotid pressure and aortic flow in early systole. Omapatrilat compared with enalapril produced greater reductions in peripheral (-8.2+/-12.2 versus -4.0+/-12.2 mm Hg, P<0.05) and central (-10.2+/-16.2 versus -3.2+/-16.9 mm Hg, P<0.01) pulse pressures and Z(c) (237+/-83 to 208+/-70 versus 225+/-87 to 231+/-94 dyne x s/cm(5), P<0.001); the latter remained significant (P<0.05) after adjusting for change in mean pressure.",

    "442": "Albuminuria has been shown to identify patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, and in clinical studies ACE inhibitors reduce the urinary protein excretion. It was the primary aim of this intensified monitoring project to determine whether these results can be reproduced in a clinical practice setting. Micro- (2.7-22.6 mg albumin/mmol creatinine) or macroalbuminuria (>22.6 mg/mmol) was confirmed by a central laboratory in 598 out of 773 patients with hypertension who had albuminuria >50 mg/l on a Micral Test II performed by 147 general practitioners. Coronary heart disease (prevalence rates 15% in patients with normalbuminuria, 33% in patients with microalbuminuria, and 40% in patients with macroalbuminuria), heart failure (prevalence rates 19, 29, and 32%, respectively), left ventricular hypertrophy (prevalence rates 30, 42, and 38%, respectively), and peripheral vascular disease (prevalence rates 7, 15, and 20%, respectively) were significantly more common in patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion. 230 patients with microalbuminuria and 202 subjects with macroalbuminuria were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril for 6 months. The treatment significantly lowered mean arterial blood pressure (from a median value of 120 mm Hg, quartiles 113-125 mm Hg, to 103 mm Hg, quartiles 100-109 mm Hg) as well as urinary albumin excretion (from a median value of 18 mg/mmol creatinine, quartiles 7.2-54.6 mg/mmol creatinine, to 6.5 mg/mmol creatinine, quartiles 1.6-23.1 mg/mmol creatinine). The treatment efficacy was unaffected by age, body mass index, and smoking status. Patients with diabetes mellitus type II and heart failure also had a significant, although less pronounced reduction of albuminuria. In summary, we conclude that ramipril is able to reduce the urinary albumin excretion in a clinical practice setting, as has been shown in clinical studies. However, the treatment response is not completely uniform, as special patient populations seem to be more resistant to therapy.",

Earlier trials have shown that ACE inhibitors, when given to patients with low ejection fractions, have reduced the relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and other ischaemic events by 14 to 23%. Subsequently, the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study has shown that, in patients who are not known to have low ejection fraction or heart failure but are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular events, ramipril reduced the incidence of stroke, MI and death due to cardiovascular disease. Results from the HOPE study, in which 9297 patients were randomised to receive either ramipril 10 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 4.5 years, indicate that ramipril reduced the relative risk of the composite outcome of MI, stroke and cardiovascular death by 22%. The incidence of the composite outcome was significantly lower in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (14.0 vs 17.8%). Patients who received ramipril, compared with placebo recipients, had a significantly decreased incidence of stroke, MI or death due to cardiovascular disease (3.4 vs 4.9%, 9.9 vs 12.3% and 6.1 vs 8.1%, respectively). The relative risk of death from any cause was reduced among patients who received ramipril. In addition, treatment with ramipril reduced as the incidence of revascularisation procedures, and, among patients with diabetes mellitus, ramipril reduced the incidence of complications related to diabetes mellitus, including the development of overt nephropathy. Moreover, in patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, ramipril, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the development of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving ramipril had a reduced rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness.",

It inhibits the renin-angiotensin system by preventing both the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the degradation of bradykinin, thereby reducing the vasoconstriction and left ventricular remodelling characteristic of heart failure. Perindopril 4mg significantly improved a range of haemodynamic parameters in single-dose and long-term (8 weeks and 3 months) studies involving patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), with little or no effect on blood pressure or heart rate. In randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted over 3 months and a large noncomparative study (up to 30 months), perindopril 4mg once daily significantly increased exercise tolerance and reduced symptoms of heart failure in patients with mild to moderate CHF. Perindopril 4mg once daily is generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate CHF. In a large noncomparative study the most commonly reported adverse clinical event was cough, which led to 2.8% of patients discontinuing treatment. In short-term comparative trials there was a significantly lower incidence of first-dose hypotension following the recommended starting dose of perindopril 2mg than after the equivalent starting doses of captopril, enalapril and lisinopril.",

Compared to placebo and control groups over 6 weeks, both agents reduced left ventricular loading and limited overall remodeling in both reperfused and nonreperfused groups, but there were pertinent differences. Enalapril limited the increase in left ventricular asynergy in the reperfused group. Both enalapril and amlodipine limited infarct zone thinning in the nonreperfused groups but increased infarct zone thinning in the reperfused groups, despite preserved infarct zone collagen with amlodipine. Enalapril decreased left ventricular diastolic volume and mass more than amlodipine in the reperfused group and increased left ventricular ejection fraction in the nonreperfused group. Both agents limited regional and global shape deformation in reperfused and non-reperfused groups. Diastolic wall stress in the infarct zone decreased with amlodipine, and increased with enalapril and reperfusion.",

    "462": "The acute renal effects of hypoxemia and the ability of the co-administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindoprilat) and an adenosine receptor antagonist (theophylline) to prevent these effects were assessed in anesthetized and mechanically-ventilated rabbits. Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined by the clearances of para-aminohippuric acid and inulin, respectively. Each animal acted as its own control. In 8 untreated rabbits, hypoxemia induced a significant drop in mean blood pressure (-12 +/- 2%), GFR (-16 +/- 3%) and RBF (-12 +/- 3%) with a concomitant increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) (+ 18 +/- 5%), without changes in filtration fraction (FF) (-4 +/- 2%). These results suggest the occurrence of both pre- and postglomerular vasoconstriction during the hypoxemic stress. In 7 rabbits pretreated with intravenous perindoprilat (20 microg/kg), the hypoxemia-induced changes in RBF and RVR were prevented. FF decreased significantly (-18 +/- 2%), while the drop in GFR was partially blunted. These results could be explained by the inhibition of the angiotensin-mediated efferent vasoconstriction by perindoprilat. In 7 additional rabbits, co-administration of perindoprilat and theophylline (1 mg/kg) completely prevented the hypoxemia-induced changes in RBF (+ 11 +/- 3%) and GFR (+ 2 +/- 3%), while RVR decreased significantly (-14 +/- 3%). Since adenosine and angiotensin II were both shown to participate, at least in part, in the renal changes induced by hypoxemia, the beneficial effects of perindoprilat and theophylline in this model could be mediated by complementary actions of angiotensin II and adenosine on the renal vasculature.", 
    "463": "The contribution of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] to the antihypertensive actions of omapatrilat, a novel vasopeptidase inhibitor, was evaluated in 22 salt-sensitive, low renin, hypertensive subjects as a substudy of a multicenter randomized, double-blind, parallel study of 4 weeks duration. A total of 25 other subjects received lisinopril as the active control. Omapatrilat (40 mg) produced sustained control of blood pressure (BP) (as assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP measurements) that was significantly greater than that produced by 20 mg daily of lisinopril. The antihypertensive response to either drug was accompanied by similar sustained inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Plasma levels of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7) were not altered by treatment with either omapatrilat or lisinopril, even though both regimens produced a modest rise in plasma renin activity. In contrast, urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1-7) but not Ang II increased significantly throughout the dosing period of subjects who were given omapatrilat, whereas the smaller antihypertensive response produced by lisinopril had a smaller and transient effect on increasing urinary excretion rates of Ang-(1-7). Omapatrilat, being a single molecule inhibiting neutral endopeptidase and converting enzyme simultaneously, controlled salt-sensitive hypertension by a mechanism that was associated with sustained increases in urinary Ang-(1-7) excretion. We suggest that Ang-(1-7) may be a component of the mechanisms by which omapatrilat induces an antihypertensive response in salt sensitive hypertension.",

The second study investigated the correlation between changes in serum HGF concentration and clinical arterial stiffness or reactive hyperemia during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol. A total of 210 hypertensive patients were analyzed in the first study, and 25 patients with essential hypertension were evaluated in the second study. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), strain gauge plethysmography, and serum HGF concentration were measured in the first study. We also evaluated these factors before and after treatment with either cilazapril (2.0 mg/day) or atenolol (25 mg/day) for 6 months in the second study. Serum HGF concentration was negatively correlated to reactive hyperemia in overall (r = 0.434, P < .0001) and nontreatment (r = 0.452, P < .0001) hypertensive patients. Arterial stiffness was weakly related to serum HGF concentration (P < .05) after adjusting for age and mean blood pressure (BP). By multiple regression analysis, only serum HGF concentration showed a strong independent correlation with reactive hyperemia, age and mean BP with PWV. Moreover, a relationship between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and serum HGF concentration was observed during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol (r = 0.406, P < .005). These results suggest that in evaluation of serum HGF concentration, the forearm vasodilator response to reactive hyperemia and PWV might be useful for managing hypertension in patients who are receiving antihypertensive therapy.",

Thirty-four (41%) of the 82 patients who were in sinus rhythm after 1 month of amiodarone administration had their first recurrence, 70% of cases occurring within 1 year of initiation. The cumulative rates of maintenance of sinus rhythm were 0.68, 0.55, and 0.47 at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Amiodarone was more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal AF or flutter than in those with the persistent form (p<0.05). The cumulative rates for cases that remained in permanent AF were 0.04, 0.11, and 0.14 at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Apart from suppressing AF, the mean heart rate during Holter monitoring was significantly decreased with amiodarone therapy in cases of permanent AF. Adverse effects requiring the discontinuation of amiodarone therapy occurred in 16% of patients. Low-dose amiodarone therapy may prevent AF or flutter in Japanese patients with heart failure.", 
    "470": "The vascular endothelium is a dynamic endocrine organ that regulates vascular tone, local homeostasis, and the fibro-inflammatory-proliferative process. These responses are mediated by various substances released from the endothelium in response to physiologic stimuli, including prostacyclin, endothelin and, most importantly, nitric oxide (NO). NO mediates vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines for leukocytes, and oxidative stress. It also attenuates growth and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes and cigarette smoking, impair endothelial function, which leads to atherosclerosis and results in ischemic manifestations such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke. Thus, therapeutic intervention aimed at increasing NO bioavailability by statins or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might improve patient prognosis. Vascular endothelial function is an important and clinically relevant therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease.",

The therapeutic attempts of the last years did not fulfill the hopes pinned on them, and most of the patients live with blood pressure above the goal value. This is why there is a need for new, more efficient antihypertensive drugs. On the 1st of July, 2001 irbesartan (Aprovel) was introduced in practice in Hungary. The drug belongs to the family of the angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Several clinical studies were made with irbesartan in order to evaluate its efficiency, tolerability and safety. In other studies it was compared with other antihypertensive treatments and it was found that irbesartan decreases the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as effectively as other first line medicaments. The author summarizes the most important characteristics of irbesartan as well as the results of those clinical studies which show evidence that irbesartan deserves a special place among antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "472": "Silanols are best known as unstable precursors of siloxane (silicone) polymers, substances generally considered stable and inert, but have the potential to mimic a hydrated carbonyl and inhibit protease enzymes. While previous testing of simple silanediol and silanetriol species as inhibitors of hydrolase enzymes found them ineffective, this study reports polypeptide mimics with a central methylsilanol [SiMeOH] or silanediol [Si(OH)(2)] group and their assessment as effective transition state analogue inhibitors of the well-studied metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Central to the synthesis strategy, phenylsilanes were employed as acid-hydrolyzable precursors of the silanol group. The N-benzoyl Leu-[SiMeOH]-Gly benzyl amides proved to be stable and readily characterized. In contrast, the Leu-[Si(OH)(2)]-Gly structure was difficult to characterize, possibly because of self-association. Capping the silanediol with chlorotrimethylsilane gave a well-defined trisiloxane, demonstrating that the silanediol was monomeric. The Leu-[Si]-Gly structures were converted to Leu-[Si]-Ala analogues by enolate alkylation. Coupling of the silanol precursors with proline tert-butyl ester gave N-benzoyl Leu-[Si]-Gly-Pro and N-benzoyl Leu-[Si]-Ala-Pro tripeptide analogues. Treatment of these with triflic acid formed the corresponding methylsilanols and silanediols, all of which were monomeric. The silanediol tripeptide mimics inhibited ACE with IC(50) values as low as 14 nM. Methylsilanols, in contrast, were poor inhibitors, with IC(50) values above 3000 nM. These data, including comparisons with inhibition data from carbon analogues, are consistent with binding of the silanediols by chelation of the ACE active site zinc, whereas the methylsilanols ligate poorly.", 
    "473": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been reported to induce regression of hypertrophy in several models of hemodynamic pressure overload. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the ACE inhibitor captopril can reduce hypertrophy of the left ventricle induced by a chronic volume overload and modify collagen composition of the hypertrophied myocardium. Rabbits with four months lasting aortic insufficiency were divided into two groups: treated with captopril (20 mg/kg/day) for five weeks and treated with placebo. The respective control groups were represented by sham-operated animals. Aortic insufficiency induced a decrease of diastolic pressure, an increase of systolic and pulse pressure, hypertrophy of the left and right ventricle, and an increase of hydroxyproline content in the left ventricle without a change of hydroxyproline concentrations in either ventricle. Captopril treatment further enhanced pulse pressure by decreasing diastolic blood pressure. Hypertrophy of the left ventricle, hydroxyproline content and concentration in both ventricles were unaffected by captopril treatment. It is concluded that ACE inhibition did not reverse the left ventricular hypertrophy developed as a result of overload induced by aortic insufficiency. We suggest that mechanisms different from activation of the renin-angiotensin system may play a decisive role in the maintenance of hypertrophy in this particular model of volume hemodynamic overload.", 
    "474": "Impaired renal function occurs in about 50% of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal disease. Reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmHg is one of the most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCB) exert nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction. This has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the betablocker atenolol. Based on these data, demographics of the Swiss population, literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive regimen was based either on the ACEI lisinopril, or the ND-HP-CCB verapamil, or the betablocker atenolol. Under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced the number of patients to be treated. Nevertheless, due to the fact that patients reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with costs of 316 millions of Swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of Swiss francs, respectively. Thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.", 
    "475": "Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis may develop hypertension, recurrent pulmonary edema and chronic renal failure, but have a much higher risk of dying from stroke or myocardial infarction than of progressing to end-stage renal disease. Indeed, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis typically occurs in high risk patients with coexistent vascular disease elsewhere. Recent controlled trials comparing medication to revascularization have shown that only a minority of such patients can expect hypertension cure, whereas the results of trials designed to document the ability of revascularization to prevent progressive renal failure are not yet available. Revascularization should be undertaken in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and resistant hypertension or heart failure, and probably in those with rapidly deteriorating renal function or with an increase in plasma creatinine levels during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, especially if their renal resistance--index before revascularization is less than 80. With or without revascularization, medical therapy using antihypertensive agents, statins and aspirin is necessary in almost all cases.",

The record of renal biopsy revealed that 74 patients had IgA nephropathy, 16 had chronic glomerulonephritis, and 6 had membranous nephropathy, while 17, unbiopsied patients had underlying renal disease of unknown origin. Self BPM were made at regular intervals throughout the course of the study. All recorded blood pressures were included in a stepwise multiple regression analysis in which the decline in GFR per year was the dependent variable. Patients were primarily treated with a combination of amlodipine (5 to 20 mg daily), a calcium antagonist, and benazepril (2.5 to 5 mg daily), an ACE inhibitor in an effort to reduce their blood pressure at the office to < 130/85 mmHg. The simple correlation between blood pressures (i.e., office, home morning and home evening) and the decline in GFR were all statistically significant. The correlation coefficients of determination for this model were as follows: r = 0.64 for home morning SBP; 0.43 for office SBP; 0.39 for office DBP; and 0.38 for home morning DBP. The level of urinary protein excretion did not correlate with the decline in GFR. These data suggest that self BPM improves prognostic ability in hypertensive patients with CRI.",

Four groups of eight rats each were studied as follows: Control (C), L-NAME (L), L-NAME+Enalapril (L+E) and L-NAME+Verapamil (L+V). The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was weekly recorded. The cortex of the left kidneys was analysed according to the vertical section design. The volume-weighted mean glomerular volume (VWGV) was made through the \"point-sampled intercepts\" method. Enalapril and verapamil were efficient in reducing the SBP in rats submitted to NOs blockade. Glomeruli had considerable alterations in L group rats (glomerular hypertrophy or sclerosis) and tubular atrophy. The VWGV was 100% greater in L group rats than in the C group rats, while it was 30% smaller in L+E and L+V groups than in L group. The tubular volume was 30-50% greater, while the tubular length was 20-30% smaller in the L group than in the other groups. The renal cortical region showed glomerular sclerosis/hypertrophy and tubular remodelling in rats with NOs blockade that was efficiently prevented with the simultaneous treatment with enalapril or verapamil.", 
    "490": "The steady-state level of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) represents a balance between its biosynthesis from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the action of the beta- and gamma-secretases and its catabolism by a variety of proteolytic enzymes. Recent attention has focused on members of the neprilysin (NEP) family of zinc metalloproteinases in amyloid metabolism. NEP itself degrades both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in vitro and in vivo, and this metabolism is prevented by NEP inhibitors. Other NEP family members, for example endothelin-converting enzyme, may contribute to amyloid catabolism and may also play a role in neuroprotection. Another metalloproteinase, insulysin (insulin-degrading enzyme) has also been advocated as an amyloid-degrading enzyme and may contribute more generally to metabolism of amyloid-forming peptides. Other candidate enzymes proposed include angiotensin-converting enzyme, some matrix metalloproteinases, plasmin and, indirectly, thimet oligopeptidase (endopeptidase-24.15). This review critically evaluates the evidence relating to proteinases implicated in amyloid catabolism. Therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting A,beta degradation may provide a novel approach to the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "491": "A study was designed to elucidate the mechanism of anti-hypertensive effects of danshen in the two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt renovascular hypertensive model, which is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-dependent hypertensive model. We investigated the effects of water extracts of danshen on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and hormone levels in the plasma of 2K1C rats. ACE activity was inhibited by the addition of danshen extract in a dose-dependent manner. SBP was decreased significantly after administration of danshen extract in 2K1C, whereas plasma renin activity (PRA) was not changed. The plasma concentration of aldosterone (PAC) was decreased significantly in 2K1C group administered with Danshen extract, whereas the plasma concentration of ANP was increased by administration of danshen extract for three weeks. These results suggest that danshen has an anti-hypertensive effect through the inhibition of ACE, an essential regulatory enzyme of RAS.",

This was a retrospective chart review of 150 patients who were treated for coronary artery disease in primary care clinics. Appropriate treatment of hypercholesterolemia occurred in 96% of patients referred to a clinical pharmacy specialist, compared with 68% of those followed by primary care providers alone (p<0.0001). Eighty-five percent and 50%, respectively, achieved goal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values below 105 mg/dl (p<0.0001). Appropriate therapy with aspirin or other antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs was prescribed in 97% and 92%, respectively (p=0.146). As appropriate therapy with these agents was high in both groups, the ability to detect a difference between groups was limited. Among patients with an ejection fraction below 40%, appropriate therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or acceptable alternative was 89% and 69%, respectively (p<0.05). Twenty-seven cardiac events were documented in the clinical pharmacy group, versus 22 in the primary care group (p=0.475). Despite the relatively high percentage of patients reaching goal LDL in the primary care group, referral to clinical pharmacy specialists resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of patients appropriately treated for hypercholesterolemia and achieving goal LDL.",

One washout period of nine days was observed between the two periods. Multiple samples were collected over 96 hours post-dosing. Bioavailability was evaluated on the basis of plasma concentrations of enalapril and its main active metabolite, enalaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide. Plasma samples were assayed for enalapril, enalaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide using a selective and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS). The pharmacokinetic parameter values of Cmax and tmax were obtained directly from plasma data, k(e) was estimated by log-linear regression, and AUC was calculated by trapezoidal rule. Different statistical tests were performed on the basis of untransformed and log-transformed data and the overall residual variance from ANOVA. Assuming the accepted tolerance intervals, a beta-error of 20% and 90% confidence intervals (alpha = 0.10), all the generally accepted tests (Schuirmann test and Wilcoxon-Tukey and Hauschke nonparametric tests) showed that the formulations can be considered as bioequivalent with respect to the extent of absorption, given by the AUC(0-infinity) and with respect to rate of absorption as assessed by Cmax and tmax.", 
    "494": "The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus has critical homeostatic functions, including the regulation of fluid balance and sympathetic drive. It has been suggested that altered activity of this nucleus contributes to the progression of congestive heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that forebrain influences of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system augment the activity of PVN neurons in HF. The rate of PVN neurons (n = 68) from rats with ischemia-induced HF was higher than that of PVN neurons (n = 42) from sham-operated controls (8.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.3 spikes/s, P < 0.001, HF vs. SHAM). Forebrain-directed intracarotid artery injections of the angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone all significantly (P < 0.05) reduced PVN neuronal activity in HF rats. These findings demonstrate that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system drives PVN neuronal activity in HF, likely resulting in increased sympathetic drive and volume accumulation. This mechanism of neurohumoral excitation in HF is accessible to manipulation by blood-borne therapeutic agents.", 
    "495": "We examined the topology of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA expression, activity, and shedding in myocardial infarction-induced heart failure and sought to elucidate the source of the increased plasma ACE activity in this model. Three months after coronary ligature, lung, scar, and remaining viable left ventricular tissues were analyzed for ACE mRNA expression as well as tissue and solubilized ACE activity. ACE mRNA expression increased in the scar with respect to infarct severity, decreased in the lung, and remained unchanged in the left ventricle. ACE activity decreased in the lung and increased in the scar tissue and plasma. Shedding of ACE remained constant in the lung and increased in the scar. This study shows that ACE expression and activity is shifted from the pulmonary endothelium to the infarct scar tissue and that constancy of shedding in the lung and its increase in the scar are the source of the increased plasma ACE in congestive heart failure.", 
    "496": "Reperfusion through thrombolysis or percutananeous coronary angioplasty is standard treatment in impending acute myocardial infarction. Although restoration of blood flow to the jeopardised myocardial area is a perquisite for myocardial salvage, reperfusion itself may lead to accelerated and additional myocardial injury beyond that generated by ischemia alone. This is referred to as the \"reperfusion injury\". Since the reperfusion injury is initiated by the treatment of myocardial infarction, it is of importance to limit the extent of the injury. Several studies aimed at preventing reperfusion injury by means of pharmacological agents have therefore been conducted. The design of such studies is crucial for the results. Factors of importance are the timing of drug administration, animal species used, the degree of collateral flow and the duration of ischemia. A variety of pharmacological compounds have been investigated in different experimental models of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. These include oxygen free radical scavengers, antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of neutrophils, nitric oxide, adenosine-related agents, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin receptor antagonists, Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitors, and anti-apoptotic agents. All these groups of pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to protect from reperfusion injury determined as limitation of infarct size, improved myocardial and endothelial function, and reduced incidence of arrhythmias. The mechanism behind the protective effect may differ between different groups of compounds, but some compounds may exert cardioprotection via common pathways. Such a pathway may be via maintained bioavailability of nitric oxide.",

The method was based on the adsorptive accumulation of the drug at a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), followed by differential pulse voltammetry. The response was evaluated with respect to pre-concentration time, pH effect, accumulation potential, accumulation time and scan rate. The peak potential was -0.60 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The peak current was directly proportional to the concentration of cilazapril with a detection limit of 17.6 ng ml(-1) at an accumulation time of 10 s. The reduction process was irreversible and the wave showed adsorptive characteristics. The results were compared to those obtained using a HPLC procedure. A reversed-phase C18e column with aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 3.5; 0.125 M)-acetonitrile (67:33, v/v) mobile phase and benazapril as internal standard was used. UV detector was set at 254 nm.

The combination therapy was more effective in reducing type I and III collagen mRNA levels, MMP-2 zymographic activity and collagen accumulation in the surviving LV myocardium. Moreover, the increases in cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain and skeletal alpha-actin mRNAs, markers of hypertrophy or failure, were attenuated to a greater degree by the combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas right ventricular hypertrophy and ANF mRNA upregulation were significantly (P<0.01) prevented only by combined ET(A) and ACE inhibition.",

The signal cascade mechanism mediating the cardioprotective actions of bradykinin was evaluated by administering aspirin and methylene blue prior to lisinopril and 2-mercaptoethanol combined treatment. Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured by the TTC stain method. Serum free radical levels were estimated by the method developed by Yagi. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored throughout the experiment. With the combined inhibition of both the enzymes ACE and APP, a better cardioprotection was observed.

    "530": "Healthy vascular endothelium is a powerful generator of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and plasminogen activator (t-PA). These endothelial products protect vascular wall against aggression from activated blood platelets and leukocytes. In particular they protect against thrombosis, promote thrombolysis, maintain tissue perfusion, and inhibit remodeling of vascular and cardiac walls. Endothelial dysfunction appears on one hand as suppression in the release of the above mediators, and on the other as deleterious discharge of prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGH2, PGG2), superoxide anion O2-, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). Our data point to endothelial bradykinin (Bk) as a trigger for protective endothelial mechanisms. In cultured endothelial cells (CEC) Bk through kinin B2 receptors raised in a concentration-dependent manner (1pM-10 nM) free cytoplasmic calcium ions [Ca2+]i. This rise was accompanied by the release of NO as quantified by a porphyrinic sensor. Other endothelial agonists were weaker-stimulators of [Ca2+]i than Bk. In vivo we analyed the effects of exogenous Bk and of amplifiers of endogenous Bk, such as perindopril and quinapril (\"tissue type\" angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-I) on endothelial function using our original thrombolytic bioassay and EIA assays for 6-keto-PGF1alpha and t-PA antigen. A major difference found between exogenuous Bk and endogenous Bk (that rendered by \"tissue ACE-I\") was a) prolonged thrombolytic action (> 4h) of quinapril or perindopril. Moreover, only exogenous Bk evoked an immediate and profound hypotensive action. In vivo, Bk-induced thrombolysis was B2 kinin receptor-dependent, PGI2-mediated. The unexpected action of Bk came to light in CEC. Then appeared incubated for 4 h increased expression of mRNAs for haemoxygenase (HO-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E synthase (PGE-S), but hardly for nitric oxide synthase 2(NOS-2). We hypothesize that a network of interactions of Bk-induced enzymes may constitute a delayed phase of Bk effects in the endothelium, whereas the primary phase would be activation by BK of [Ca2+]i-dependent constitutive endothelial enzymes. In blood-perfused rat endotoxemic lungs, NO is the most eminent cytoprotective mediator. Summing up, in peripheral circulation endogenous Bk is the most efficient activator of protective endothelial function. Thrombolytic action of \"tissue-type\" ACE-Is relies on receptor B-2-mediated, [Ca2+]i-dependent release of PGI2. Bk also may act as a \"microcytokine\" by inducing mRNAs for HO-1, COX-2, or PGE-S. Activation of HO-1 may lead to a deficiency in intracellular heme required as a cofactor for both COX and NOS. This network of interactions triggered by Bk call for further studies.",

There are a number of side-effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, especially persistent dry cough. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (sartans) provide a more specific blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and are associated with fewer side-effects, including cough. Their long-term efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of patients with hypertension has, however, yet to be established.

Angioedema has been partly attributed to the nonapeptide bradykinin (BK), although its precise role has been poorly documented until now. The purposes of this report are 2-fold. First, we sought to define and characterize the in vitro kinin-forming capacity of rtPA when incubated with human plasma at a concentration within the therapeutic concentration range of rtPA attained in blood in vivo during fibrinolysis. Second, we sought to define the mechanism by which rtPA liberates BK from purified human single-chain high-molecular-weight kininogen, a key constituent of the contact system of plasma and the precursor of BK.", 
    "533": "When incubated with human plasma, in the presence of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, rtPA generates BK, which is further metabolized to des-Arg9-BK. The quantity of kinins generated by rtPA is similar to that observed during the activation of the contact system of plasma with a negatively charged surface, suggesting that it is physiologically relevant. The total amount of des-Arg9-BK liberated during the incubation period depends on the aminopeptidase P activity, its main degrading peptidase. Additionally, incubations using purified proteins of the fibrinolytic and the contact system pathways show that the rtPA kinin-forming capacity is mediated by plasmin.", 
    "534": "We conclude that rtPA used in vitro at a therapeutic concentration has the capacity to generate significant quantities of kinins from human plasma. This kinin-forming activity depends on the activation of the fibrinolytic pathway.

    "537": "The total number of deaths at the end of follow-up was 1026. Most subjects (1512) had creatinine <124 micromol/L. The mean calculated creatinine clearance was 54.8 mL/min (SD, 23 mL/min). Renal function indexes were analyzed by quartiles with Cox proportional-hazards model. Stroke survivors had higher calculated creatinine clearance and lower serum creatinine, urea, and ratios of urea to creatinine. Calculated creatinine clearance > or =51.27 mL/min significantly predicted better long-term survival in these stroke patients even after adjustment for confounders (age, neurological score, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, smoking, and diuretic use). Similarly, creatinine > or =119 micromol/L \"relative risk (RR), 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32 to 1.92\", urea 6.8 to 8.9 mmol/L (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.65) or > or =9 mmol/L (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.13), and ratio of urea to creatinine > or =0.08573 mmol/micromol (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.50) remained significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for confounders.", 
    "538": "After acute stroke, patients with reduced admission calculated creatinine clearance, raised serum creatinine and urea concentrations (even within conventional reference intervals), and raised ratio of urea to creatinine had a higher mortality risk. This finding may be used to stratify risk and target interventions, eg, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "539": "Enalaprilat is a typical angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and is very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to design and characterize poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanoparticles containing enalaprilat and to evaluate the potential of these colloidal carriers for the transport of drugs through the intestinal mucosa. Nanoparticle dispersions were prepared by the emulsification-diffusion method and characterized according to particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and physical stability. Effective permeabilities through rat jejunum of enalaprilat in solution and in enalaprilat-loaded nanoparticles were compared using side-by-side diffusion chambers. The solubility of enalaprilat is very low in many acceptable organic solvents, but in benzyl alcohol is sufficient to enable the production of nanoparticles by the emulsification-diffusion process. The diameters of drug-loaded PMMA and PLGA nanoparticles were 297 and 204 nm, respectively. The concentration of the stabilizer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in dispersion has an influence on particle size but not on drug entrapment. The type of polymer has a decisive influence on drug content--7 and 13% for PMMA and PLGA nanoparticles, respectively. In vitro release studies show a biphasic release of enalaprilat from nanoparticle dispersions-fast in the first step and very slow in the second. The apparent permeability coefficient across rat jejunum of enalaprilat entrapped in PLGA nanoparticles is not significantly improved compared with enalaprilat in solution.", 
    "540": "It was reported that angiotensin II stimulates angiogenesis in vivo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit angiogenesis. We found that an AT1-receptor (AT1-R) antagonist, TCV-116, inhibited tumor growth, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and metastasis in a murine model. Tumor growth of Sarcoma 180 (S-180) cells and of fibrosarcoma (NFSA) cells was strongly inhibited by administration of TCV-116 in the diet at a dose of approximately 100 mg/kg/day. This reduction was accompanied with a marked reduction in tumor-associated angiogenesis. The same treatment also reduced the lung metastasis of intravenously injected Lewis lung carcinoma cells. These effects of TCV-116 were equivalent to those of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. In S-180 and NFSA tumor tissues, ACE and AT1a receptor (AT1a-R) mRNAs were expressed when assessed with RT-PCR. AT1b receptor and AT2 receptor, however, were not detected. Immunoreactive AT1-R was detected mainly on the neovascularized vascular endothelial cells in which expression was reduced by TCV-116 and lisinopril. These results suggested that TCV-116 inhibits the angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of tumors highly dependent on AT1a-R blockade. Blockade of AT1a-R signaling may therefore become an effective novel strategy for tumor chemoprevention.", 
    "541": "In a survey including 2224 patients with essential hypertension we investigated efficacy and tolerability of the new ACE-inhibitor Imidapril. Mean blood pressure at baseline was 172 +/- 19/98 +/- 10 mmHg. Treatment with Imidapril 5-20 mg once daily caused a decrease in BP by 21 +/- 17/11 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.01/0.01). Systolic BP was reduced by > 15 mmHg in 71% diastolic BP by > 10 mmHg in 64% of patients. 29% of patients achieved the treatment goal of a blood pressure < or = 140/90 within an average of 26 days. Imidapril decreased pulse-pressure (one of the most important risk markers in hypertension) by 18% (74 +/- 17 to 61 +/- 11 mmHg, p < 0.01). ACE-inhibitor related adverse effects (cough, vertigo, headache, pruritus, tachycardia, orthostatic dysregulation or nausea) were observed in 38 patients (< 2%). Efficacy of treatment was graded by the physician in charge of the patient care by means of a questionnaire. Gradings were excellent or good in 96% of patients, moderate in 3% and poor in < 1%. In summary, the effects of Imidapril on blood pressure were comparable to those of other ACE-inhibitors. However, the frequency of adverse effects was low and similar to that of angiotensin-II-antagonists.",

Given the importance of inadequate penile arterial inflow as a cause of erectile dysfunction we determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats the impact of brief aggressive antihypertensive therapy on structurally based penile vascular resistance, erectile function and mean arterial pressure during and after treatment.", 
    "543": "Young (15-week-old) and aged (40-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 2 weeks (enalapril 30 mg./kg. daily plus a low salt diet). Mean arterial pressure was continuously monitored via radio telemetry. Erectile responses were assessed by administering apomorphine (80 microg./kg. subcutaneously) before, during and after treatment. Structurally based vascular resistance was determined in the isolated, perfused penile vasculature 2 weeks after stopping treatment in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats. Certain responses were determined, including resistance at maximum dilatation (lumen size) and at maximum constriction (medial bulk), and EC50 of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine.", 
    "544": "In the period after the cessation of drug treatment there was a persistent reduction in the level of arterial pressure (16%) and a doubling of erectile responses compared with pre- treatment. Cardiac and vascular structure regressed, as determined by the mean decrease plus or minus standard deviation in vascular resistance at maximum dilatation (21% +/- 4.5%) and mean reduction in left ventricle mass (10.4% +/- 3.7%). Furthermore, treatment induced a significant right shift in alpha1-adrenoceptor concentration response curve in treated versus control rats (mean EC50 1.09 +/- 0.111 versus 0.76 +/- 0.111).", 
    "545": "The improvement in erectile function after brief aggressive treatment may be related to improvement in structurally based vascular resistance within the penis and the decrease in responsiveness of alpha1-adrenoceptor mediated erectolytic signaling. These findings are suggestive of a new therapeutic strategy for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.",

We examined the clinical usefulness of CSB screening using the heart rate variability (HRV) data from the ambulatory electrocardiogram.", 
    "547": "We monitored ambulatory electrocardiograms and respiration simultaneously in 86 heart disease patients of both sexes, aged 57 +/- 1 years. HRV was analyzed by the maximum entropy method during the sleeping period (11 PM-5 AM). The 43 CHF patients underwent a 1-year follow-up study.", 
    "548": "In the power spectra of the HRV, peaks were observed within the CSB band (0.005 to 0.03 Hz). Statistically significant differences in HRV were observed between CSB patients and CSB-free patients in very low frequency (VLF) (P = 0.04), VLF/total frequency (TF) (P = 0.02), CSB (P = 0.01), CSB/TF (P = 0.003), and CSB/VLF (P < 0.0001). Cardiac events occurred in 23% of patients, including cardiac death in two, and rehospitalization for aggravated CHF in eight. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis in which age, sex, ejection fraction, NYHA functional class, beta blocker use, and basic heart disease were included, absence of ACE inhibitor use (RR 5.5, 95% CI 1.0-31) and CSB/VLF > or =80% (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1-17) remained significant predictors of cardiac events.",

    "550": "Advances in the treatment of heart failure may require manipulation of neurohumoral responses to cardiac impairment in addition to the established strategy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Importantly, since new treatments are likely to be used in conjunction with ACE inhibition therapy, the effects of the combination of agents need to be assessed. Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide with potent vasodilator and natriuretic actions. ADM and an ACE inhibitor (captopril) were administered for 3 h both separately and together in eight sheep with heart failure. Both ADM and captopril alone reduced arterial pressure, left atrial pressure (greater with captopril) and peripheral resistance, and increased cardiac output (greater with ADM). Compared with either treatment separately, combined ADM+captopril produced directionally similar but significantly greater changes in all haemodynamic variables (particularly falls in blood pressure). ADM increased renal sodium and creatinine excretion and creatinine clearance, and maintained urine output. Captopril and ADM+captopril reduced creatinine excretion and creatinine clearance, while urine volume and sodium excretion were not significantly altered. Plasma renin activity rose with all active treatments, whereas angiotensin II levels rose during ADM, but fell during captopril and ADM+captopril. Aldosterone was reduced by all active treatments. ADM+captopril reduced plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine). In conclusion, short-term co-treatment with ADM and an ACE inhibitor produced significantly greater decreases in ventricular filling pressures and cardiac afterload, and increases in cardiac output, compared with either treatment alone. Despite the greater falls in blood pressure (and presumably renal perfusion pressure), renal function was maintained at a level similar to that observed with captopril alone.",

    "552": "Despite years of investigation our fundamental and clinical knowledge of the major public health problem, obesity-hypertension, is relatively meager and certainly inadequate. We are at a loss to explain why the pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity and hypertension are so inextricably intertwined. Adding to this frustration is the inadequacy of the treatment for obesity. Hemodynamically, we recognize that the expanded plasma volume caused by obesity imparts a significant volume overload on the heart, thereby increasing cardiac output, while the hypertension compounds this ventricular stress by an associated pressure overload. Thus, the ventricle has an eccentric as well as a concentric adaptive hypertrophy. Associated with obesity is an increased burden of pressor (e.g., catecholamine, angiotensin II); peptide (e.g., endothelin, insulin, leptin, natriuretic); hormonal (e.g., growth, steroids, thyroid); and neural mechanisms. Further complicating these alterations are electrolytic, lipid, uric acid, and other metabolic factors. Both diseases (obesity and hypertension) are exacerbated by frequently encountered comorbid pathophysiological disorders including atherosclerosis, ventricular dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemias, and sleep apnea. To add to these issues, therapy for obesity-hypertension is suboptimal. Behavioral modification (of overweight and obesity) is commonly characterized by recidivism, and pharmacotherapy of obesity is woefully inadequate; the present agents either raise arterial pressure or are fraught with adverse effects. Fortunately, there are no contraindications imparted by obesity that complicate the drug treatment of the associated hypertension. Each of the lifestyle modifications and seven classes of antihypertensive therapy that is discussed herein is done in light of the coexistent hypertension and comorbid diseases.", 
    "553": "The effect of long-term intake of two fermented milk products on the development of hypertension was compared in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The products contained tripeptides isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) and valine-proline-proline (VPP), which have been shown to possess angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Six-week-old SHR were divided into four groups to receive orally ad libitum water, skim milk or two fermented milk poducts (fermented milk A or fermented milk B; the latter is commercially available in Japan with trade name Calpis) for 14 weeks. The calculated intake of IPP was 0.4 mg/d and 0.2 mg/d in the groups receiving fermented milk A and B, respectively, whereas the corresponding amounts for VPP were 0.6 mg/d and 0.3 mg/d. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly by tail-cuff method. The development of hypertension was significantly attenuated in both groups receiving fermented milk products, whereas skim milk did not affect blood pressure. The effect was detectable after 6 weeks of treatment. At the end of the experiment, the lowest blood pressure level was found in the group receiving fermented milk A: the SBP was 21 mm Hg lower than in the group receiving water and 10 mm Hg lower than in the group receiving fermented milk B. This difference could be explained by larger intake of ACE inhibitory tripeptides in the group receiving fermented milk A as compared with fermented milk B.", 
    "554": "To examine the mechanism of nephropathy in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a recently developed type II diabetic model, we compared the long-term effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (imidapril, 1 mg/kg/day), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine, 10 mg/kg/day), and insulin (5-10 U/kg/day) on nephropathy of OLETF rats. Both imidapril and amlodipine, but not insulin, significantly reduced blood pressure of OLETF rats. Imidapril treatment significantly decreased urinary albumin excretions and improved glomerulosclerosis of OLETF rats, while amlodipine failed to improve nephropathy of OLETF rats despite lowering of blood pressure. Insulin treatment, which significantly decreased HbA1c throughout the treatment period, did not ameliorate nephropathy of OLETF rats. Serum ACE activity in OLETF rats was significantly lower than that in genetic control nondiabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. However, glomerular and aortic ACE activities in OLETF rats were significantly higher than those in LETO rats, and were significantly decreased by treatment with imidapril. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of ACE in the kidney using specific antibodies indicated greater ACE immunostaining in the glomeruli and renal vessels of OLETF rats than in those of LETO rats. These observations demonstrate that ACE is involved in the development of nephropathy of OLETF rats and provide evidence that intrarenal ACE rather than circulating ACE may play an important role in nephropathy of this type II diabetic model.", 
    "555": "Inbred borderline-hypertensive Hiroshima rats (BHR) of the Wistar strain established in our laboratory are characterized by elevated plasma levels of vasopressin (Teranishi et al.: Jpn J Pharmacol 1999; 79: 251-255). To investigate the role of endogenous vasopressin in hypertension in BHR, we assessed the effect of a selective vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist (V1A) on regional hemodynamics using an electromagnetic flowmeter. The basal values of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and regional resistances of renal and hindquarter vascular beds in conscious BHR were significantly higher than those in normotensive control rats (NCR). Injection of V1A (10 microg/kg) did not appreciably affect the hemodynamics in either animal. Successive administration of V1A after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium bromide (C6; 25 mg/kg), however, significantly attenuated renal, mesenteric and hindquarter resistances in BHR but not in NCR. The hypotensive effect of V1A after sympathoinhibition was significantly greater in BHR than in both NCR and spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, the hypotensive effect induced by V1A was diminished only in BHR pretreated with a ganglionic blockade followed by injection of captopril (1 mg/kg). These findings indicate that BHR could be used as a new hypertensive model with an abnormality in endogenous vasopressin-mediated vasoconstriction appearing in the presence of angiotensin II after sympathoinhibition.", 
    "556": "We investigated the effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat, and an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, CV-11974, on myocardial metabolism during ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) imaging. Forty-five minutes of continuous normothermic global ischemia was carried out. Pravastatin, temocaprilat, CV-11974 or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME was administered from 60 min prior to the global ischemia. Japanese white rabbits were divided into the following experimental groups, a control group (n=7), a group treated with pravastatin (P group; n=7), a group treated with pravastatin and temocaprilat (P+T group; n=7), a group treated with pravastatin and CV-11974 (P+CV group; n=7), and a group treated with pravastatin and L-NAME (P+L-NAME group; n=7). During ischemia, P group, as well as either P+T group or P+CV group, showed a significant inhibition of the decreases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and intracellular pH (pHi) (p<0.01, respectively, at the end of ischemia compared to the control group as well as P+L-NAME group), and a significant inhibition of the increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) (p<0.01, respectively, compared with the control group as well as P+L-NAME group). These results suggest that pravastatin significantly improved myocardial energy metabolism during myocardial ischemia. This beneficial effect was dependent on NO synthase. However, this beneficial effect was not enhanced by either temocaprilat or CV-11974.", 
    "557": "Hypertension, a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and heart disease, often requires drug therapy. The First Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension were published in June 2000. In the present work, we surveyed 447 doctors who attended continuing medical education meetings between March and July 2001 to elucidate national antihypertensive treatment patterns. A minimum level of 150/95 mmHg was selected by 60% and 140/90 mmHg by 19% of respondents as thresholds for initiating drug treatment, while 130/85 mmHg was selected by 26% of respondents as the goal blood pressure in middle-aged uncomplicated male patients. Sixty-nine percent of respondents selected a calcium antagonist as their previous drug of the first choice and 22% selected an ACE inhibitor. For their future first choice, 55% would prescribe an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIA); 19% an ACE inhibitor; and 16% a calcium antagonist. Seventy-two percent selected a calcium antagonist + an ACE inhibitor and 17% selected a calcium antagonist + AIIA as their previous first-choice drug combinations. For their future drug combinations, 56% would select an AIIA + a calcium antagonist and 25% a calcium antagonist + an ACE inhibitor. Four weeks or less was selected by 69% of respondents as the period intended to reach the goal blood pressure. Eight weeks or more was selected by 28%. Overall, our data suggest that doctors in Japan are still cautious and conservative in controlling blood pressure levels but want rapid achievement of the goal blood pressure. Their first choice drug is shifting from calcium antagonists to AIIAs. These findings indicate the need for continued effort to evaluate the diversity of clinical practice and assess the appropriateness of continuing medical education.", 
    "558": "Large and small arteries are remodelled in hypertension - their structure, function and mechanics are altered. These changes contribute to elevated blood pressure and to the complications of hypertension. The present paper concentrates on small (resistance) artery changes in hypertension. In hypertension, these vessels exhibit a form of remodelling known as 'eutrophic' remodelling, in which smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, without true hypertrophy, particularly in milder forms of hypertension. Changes in these small arteries are the first manifestation of target organ damage in patients with hypertension. In more severe forms of hypertension and in secondary hypertension, hypertrophic remodelling has been reported. Stiffness of the vessel wall may be decreased initially; later, as hypertension becomes more severe, the wall of resistance vessels may become stiffer. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in a percentage of patients, similar to the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system may correct many of these abnormalities. The present report investigated the effects of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists on small arteries of hypertensive patients compared with the beta-blocker atenolol in different studies. Beta-blocker treatment did not modify either the structure or the function of small arteries in contrast to the AT1 antagonist losartan in a double-blind, randomized, one-year study. Patients previously treated with atenolol to lower blood pressure, but whose small artery structure and function did not improve, were examined. These hypertensive patients were switched to the AT1 antagonist irbesartan for one year. Gluteal subcutaneous biopsies showed that the structure and endothelial function of small arteries that had remained altered by atenolol treatment were corrected by irbesartan treatment, although blood pressure control with irbesartan was identical to that previously achieved with atenolol. Improved outcomes in clinical trials using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists may be a result of the vascular protective effects offered by these agents.", 
    "559": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were developed to better antagonize the effects of chronic overactivation of angiotensin II. In clinical studies, ARBs have consistently been shown to be more tolerable than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). Although many studies evaluating the benefits of ARBs in clinical practice are underway, relatively little information exists as to their benefits concerning cardiovascular events. In heart failure patients with ACEi intolerance, ARBs may improve survival. In patients who can tolerate an ACEi, ARBs reduce hospitalization. Due to a possible detrimental interaction when an ARB is added to the treatment of patients already taking an ACEi and a beta-blocker, the use of ARBs in such heart failure patients is not generally indicated. ARBs also preserve renal function and may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. However, there is no convincing evidence that ARBs improve the survival of these patients. Thus, ARBs should be used on their own merits and should not be used as substitutes for ACEis in this patient population. Studies to establish the status of ARBs in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases are ongoing, but until they are completed, care should be taken in extrapolating the effects of ARBs to those of ACEis.", 
    "560": "Diabetes has long been recognized as a risk factor for heart disease. Recent evidence has brought to light complex interactions that seem to influence both the renal and the vascular complications of diabetes. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to ameliorate renal and cardiac risks in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to a degree that is disproportionate to blood pressure-lowering effects. The judicious use of these agents can materially improve the prognosis for patients with diabetes.", 
    "561": "Despite advances in therapy, congestive heart failure is a major public health problem with a high mortality and morbidity. The benefits of beta blockers in slowing disease progression and decreasing mortality have recently been shown in large clinical trials. Oxidative stress contributes to disease progression in both post-myocardial reperfusion injury and dilated cardiomyopathy. Several medications are known to have antioxidant effects, including some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta blocker with antioxidant properties approved for use in congestive heart failure.", 
    "562": "Omapatrilat simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme, increasing levels of vasodilatory peptides while decreasing production of angiotensin II. This study evaluated the clinical effects of withdrawal of omapatrilat after a patient's hypertension had been controlled (seated diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) on omapatrilat for at least 6 months, with or without adjunctive antihypertensive medications. This double-blind study randomized 83 patients to receive either their established omapatrilat dose or placebo for 8 weeks; any concomitant antihypertensive medications were kept constant. Patients continuing on omapatrilat had no change in blood pressure. Patients whose chronic omapatrilat treatment was replaced by placebo had clinically important increases in both systolic (+16.5 mm Hg) and diastolic ((+9.6 mm Hg) blood pressures (both p<0.001). An increase in blood pressure was also seen in patients who were taking adjunctive antihypertensive medications prior to withdrawal of omapatrilat. This study demonstrates that when compared to withdrawal placebo, omapatrilat maintains clinically and statistically significant blood pressure reductions.",

Exercise capacity, quality of life, device parameters, and native heart function were monitored serially. One patient died from right heart failure at 3 months. The other patients were discharged from hospital between 3 and 8 weeks postoperatively and are currently New York Heart Association I or II. Follow-up lasted between 9 and 20 months.

    "566": "Recently, the presence of the chymase-dependent angiotensin (Ang) II-generating system in hamsters, dogs, monkeys, as well as human cardiovascular tissues has been identified. We have reported that the activation of cardiac chymase was more prominent than that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and that AT1 receptor antagonist treatment rather than ACE inhibitor treatment alone provided significant beneficial effects on cardiac function and survival after MI in hamsters. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this different effects between AT1 receptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor were due to the activation of cardiac chymase after MI in hamsters by using 4-[1-[[bis-(4-methyl-pheny)-methyl]-carbamoyl]-3-(2-ethoxy-benzyl)-4-oxo-azetidine-2-yloxy]-benzoic acid (BCEAB), a novel, orally active and specific chymase inhibitor. The ACE and chymase activities in the infarcted left ventricle were significantly increased 3 days after MI. BCEAB (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) treatment starting 3 days before MI significantly suppressed the cardiac chymase activity, while it did not affect the plasma and cardiac ACE activities 3 days after MI. A significant improvement in hemodynamics (maximal negative and positive rates of pressure development; left ventricular systolic pressure) was observed for the treatment with BCEAB 3 days after MI. BCEAB (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) treatment starting 3 days before MI significantly reduced the mortality rate during 14 days of observation following MI (vehicle, 61.1%, n = 18; BCEAB, 27.8%, n = 18; P < 0.05). These findings demonstrated for the first time that cardiac chymase participates directly in the pathophysiologic state after MI in hamsters.", 
    "567": "Antihypertensive therapy not only normalizes the elevated blood pressure but also restores the reduced baroreceptor reflex response associated with hypertension, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We assessed the hypothesis that a reversal of the enhanced basal Fos expression seen during hypertension in nucleus tractus solitarii, the terminal site of baroreceptor afferents, underlies the restoration of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity after antihypertensive treatment. Male adult spontaneously hypertensive or normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats received for 3 weeks captopril (100 mg/kg/day) added to their drinking water. Evaluated subsequently under pentobarbital anesthesia, captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibited significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and restoration of the sensitivity in baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate to levels comparable with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemical evaluation revealed concomitant down-regulation of basal expression in nucleus tractus solitarii of c-fos gene at both mRNA and protein levels. Captopril treatment, on the other hand, elicited no discernible effect on systolic blood pressure, cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity or basal expression of Fos protein at the nucleus tractus solitarii of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. From these findings we suggest that a down-regulation of basal Fos expression in nucleus tractus solitarii may contribute to the restoration of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats that received antihypertensive treatment such as captopril.",

End diastolic volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), index of LV myocardial mass were significantly less in group 1 than in group 2 (by 45.7, 81.6 and 31.2%, respectively). In group 1 ejection fraction (EF) and %delta S were higher by 35.3 and 35.7%, respectively. The hemodynamic effect of perindopril was higher in group 2. A month therapy resulted in a 8.7 and 14.8% reduction in group 2 EDV and ESV, respectively (p < 0.05). This entailed an increase in EF and %delta S by 18.3% (p < 0.05) and 19.8% (p < 0.05). Later, perindopril retained influence on central hemodynamics. Diastolic function to the end of therapy in both groups differed insignificantly.",

    "577": "Ninety-six individuals (left ventricular ejection fraction of 26+/-10%) were included in the study. Within 1 day blood samples of N-ANP, N-BNP, BNP and big endothelin-1 were obtained, and the 6-min walk test and LHFQ were measured. The predictive power of these variables - including renin-angiotensin system antagonist therapy - in respect of 1-year event-free survival were calculated with a Cox regression analysis. All investigated variables had the power to predict outcome in a univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that N-ANP (chi-square=58 P<0.0001), BNP (chi-square=8 P<0.01), the LHFQ (chi-square=6 P<0.02) and the renin-angiotensin system antagonist (chi-square=4 P<0.05), are independent predictors.", 
    "578": "We conclude that, in an open clinical cohort of patients with large differences in the progression of the disease, N-ANP, BNP and LHFQ are the most reliable predictors of worsening heart failure in the short term.

    "579": "Zofenopril calcium (CAS 81938-43-4) is a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which in addition to the typical activity of the class, proved to possess a specific cardioprotective effect due also to the presence of the sulfhydryl group. In this trial zofenopril calcium and enalapril maleate (CAS 76095-16-4) were given to 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes in repeated dose regiment at two dose levels: 30 mg and 60 mg zofenopril calcium and 10 mg and 20 mg enalapril maleate. The study was conducted according to a two-period, two-sequence, crossover design, with washout. ACE activity in serum and zofenopril, zofenoprilat, enalapril and enalaprilat plasma concentrations were determined during and on the last day of the two study periods. Both zofenopril and enalapril were extensively converted through hydrolysis to their active metabolites zofenoprilat and enalaprilat, respectively. Zofenopril exhibited a complete and a more rapid hydrolysis rate compared to enalapril, which is reflected by the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio of Cmax and AUCss, tau showed by this compound. Even though only two dose levels were investigated in this trial, the pharmacokinetics of both drugs seem to be linear. In line with previous trials, both compounds at both dose levels investigated produced complete or almost complete inhibition of ACE activity in serum, for a period lasting 6-8 h after administration, the inhibition being still relevant 24 h thereafter. The tolerability of the two drugs at both dose levels proved to be very good as demonstrated by subjective and objective symptoms, by the absence of relevant adverse events, and by laboratory biochemical parameters and vital signs evaluated before and after the trial. Blood pressure showed a fairly decreasing trend with both the drugs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values being however within normal range in all the subjects. In no case symptoms of hypotension were experienced. In conclusion, zofenopril calcium and enalapril maleate show very good tolerability and appear to exert similar activity on serum ACE. The main difference in the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds is the conversion from pro-drug to the active metabolite which is faster with zofenopril.",

    "581": "In this prospective, open intervention trial with blinded interpretation of selected end points, patients with CHF who did not improve on standard therapy, including digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics, were treated with oral carvedilol in a ramped dosing scheme. Clinical parameters (ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and modified Ross score) were assessed before initiation of treatment and monthly for 6 months. Pharmacokinetic profiles of carvedilol were determined over the first 12-hour period after the initial dose in study patients, and for comparison, in 9 healthy adult volunteers.", 
    "582": "Fifteen patients (aged 6 weeks to 19 years) were enrolled in the study, including 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 5 with CHF secondary to congenital heart disease. All 15 patients tolerated carvedilol for the duration of the trial, and all achieved maximum target dosing. After 6 months of carvedilol therapy, ejection fraction increased (36% vs 54%; P <.05) and modified Ross Score improved (5 +/- 2 vs 3 +/- 3; P <.05). Elimination half-life was about 50% shorter in pediatric CHF patients compared with healthy adult volunteers (2.9 vs 5.2 hours; P <.05).",

    "584": "Chronic cough is defined as persistence of the symptom for longer than one month. It is a common reason for consultation. A systematic diagnostic approach based on the history, clinical examination and a number of investigations (chest x-ray, lung function tests, oesophageal pH monitoring and sinus x-rays) reveals the cause in most cases. The main aetiologies are post-nasal drip, gastro-oesophageal reflex, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Nevertheless, in some cases, the cause is not found. In this situation it is necessary to search for less common pathologies where cough is just a symptom of systemic disease, such as connective tissue disorder (Sjogren's syndrome, atrophic polychondritis), vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis), Horton's syndrome (cluster headaches), amyloidosis and inflammatory bowel disease. It may also be a matter of local pathology of the tracheo-bronchial tree, such as tracheo-bronchomegaly, tracheopathia osteoplastica, rare or unrecognized infections (whooping cough, post-viral cough, bronchial tuberculosis), reactive bronchial dysfunction, eosinophilic bronchitis or radiologically occult bronchial carcinoma. Il is also necessary to consider vocal cord dysfunction and cough due to medication before accepting a diagnosis of psychogenic cough.", 
    "585": "How far should blood pressure (BP) be lowered to achieve the greatest reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease? Although a few trials have tried to answer this question, they failed to convincingly establish an optimal target BP level, in part because of poor reproducibility and the wide variability of conventional casual BP measurement they used. At the same time, in Japan, calcium antagonist (Ca-A) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) have been two major medications in initial therapy for hypertension, while angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), which has recently been introduced, is also now used widely as an initial therapy. However, no large-scale interventional trial has been conducted to show which of these three initial medications can give the greatest benefit in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in the Japanese hypertensive patient.", 
    "586": "The objectives of the study are, first, to determine an optimal target BP level, based on BP values self-measured at home (home BP). This way of measurement provides more reproducible and less variable BP values than conventional casual measurements. Secondly, we seek to determine the optimal initial antihypertensive medication for the Japanese hypertensive population.",

The study will include a total of 9000 untreated essential hypertensive patients aged 40 to 78 years with home BP values > or = 135/85 mmHg. Eligible patients are randomized to one of the two home BP target groups (systolic/diastolic home BP within the range of 134-125/84-80 mmHg, or > or = 125/80 mmHg), and to regimens based on one of three initial antihypertensive drugs (Ca-A or ACE-I or ARB). These randomizations, performed by our host computer, are transmitted to terminals at the outpatient clinic through the Internet. The patient measures BP at home with newly developed equipment (HEM-7471C-N; Omron, Japan) that records BP values, the date, and the time of each measurement. The data are downloaded to the outpatient terminal at every clinic visit then transmitted to the host computer via the Internet. Based on these home BP values, the host computer determines the necessity of additional therapy or dose increments in four further steps to reach the randomized target BP, and then transmits the information to the terminal at the outpatient clinic. The primary study outcome is a composite of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The scheduled average post-randomization duration of follow-up is 7 years.",

    "589": "Diabetic nephropathy may be effectively prevented and treated by controlling glycemia and administering angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, strict metabolic control can be difficult, and ACE inhibitors may be poorly tolerated and only partially effective, particularly in diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), warranting the search for ancillary treatment. Sulodexide is a glycosaminoglycan, a new class of drug that has demonstrated nephroprotective activity in experimental investigations. The Di.N.A.S. study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-range finding trial to evaluate the extent and duration of the hypoalbuminuric effect of oral sulodexide in diabetic patients. A total of 223 microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric DM1 and DM2 patients with serum creatinine < or =150 micromol/L and stable BP and metabolic control were recruited. They were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or 200 mg/d sulodexide daily or placebo for 4 mo (T0 to T4), with 4 mo of follow-up after drug suspension (T4 to T8). Treatment with 200 mg/d sulodexide for 4 mo significantly reduced log albumin excretion rate (logAER) from 5.25 +/- 0.18 at T0 to 3.98 +/- 0.11 at T4 (P < 0.05), which was maintained till T8 (4.11 +/- 0.13; P < 0.05 versus T0). Moreover, the sulodexide-induced percent reductions in AER at T4 were significantly different from the placebo value at T4 and approximately linear to dose increments (30% [confidence limits, 4 to 49%], P = 0.03; 49% [30 to 63%], P = 0.0001; and 74% [64 to 81%], P = 0.0001 in the sulodexide 50, 100, and 200 mg/d groups, respectively. At T8, the sulodexide 200 mg/d group maintained a 62% (45 to 73%) AER significant reduction versus placebo (P = 0.0001). Subanalysis by type of diabetes (DM1 versus DM2, microalbuminuric versus macroalbuminuric, or on concomitant ACE inhibitors versus not on ACE inhibitors) demonstrated similar findings. These effects were obtained without any significant variation in metabolic control and BP or serum creatinine. Very few adverse events were reported; none were serious. In conclusion, a 4-mo course of high doses of sulodexide significantly and dose-dependently improves albuminuria in DM1 and DM2 patients and micro- or macroalbuminuric patients with or without concomitant ACE inhibition. The effect on albuminuria is long-lasting and seemingly additive to the ACE inhibitory effect.",

Of 137 hospitalist cases, 129 (94%) had new or prior left ventricular ejection fraction testing results documented during the hospitalization compared with 165 (87%) of 189 nonhospitalist cases (P =.04). In cohorts of ideal candidates, performance rates for hospitalist and nonhospitalist cases were similar for prescriptions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with ejection fractions lower than 40% (97% vs 96%; P>.99) and warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation (60% vs 55%; P =.64). Rates of comprehensive discharge counseling was similar in the 2 groups. Multivariable modeling did not substantially alter these findings.

    "595": "Anaemia occurs earlier and is more severe in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in non-diabetic ESRD patients controlled for the same level of renal function. In contrast to non-diabetic patients, diabetic ESRD patients demonstrate an impaired physiological response to anaemia; endogenous serum erythropoietin levels are low in relation to the level of anaemia. The reasons for the anaemia are probably a combination of tubulointerstitial damage and autonomic neuropathy. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which has been reported to be associated with an inhibition of erythropoiesis, does not seem to have a clinically significant effect on haemoglobin levels. In order to address all the independent risk factors in diabetic ESRD, optimal management of these patients should involve interdisciplinary care (diabetologist and nephrologist) and consideration of correction of anaemia.", 
    "596": "The objective of this study was to investigate stay-on-therapy patterns over 3 years among patients prescribed different classes of antihypertensive drugs for the first time. A retrospective analysis of information recorded in the drugs database of the Local Health Unit of Ravenna (Italy) was carried out on 7312 subjects receiving a first prescription for diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists between 1 January and 31 December 1997. Patients were followed up for 3 years. All prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs filled during the follow-up periods were considered. The patients continuing or discontinuing the initial treatment, the duration of treatment, and the doses taken were all calculated, as well as main factors influencing the persistence rate. The drugs prescribed were predominantly ACE-inhibitors, followed by calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers and angiotensin II antagonists. A total of 57.9% of patients continued their initial treatment during the 3-year follow-up period, 34.5% discontinued the treatment, whilst 7.6% were restarted on a treatment in the third year. Persistence with treatment was influenced by: age of patient (persistence rate increasing proportionately with advancing years), type of drug first prescribed (persistence rate higher with angiotensin II antagonists, progressively lower with ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics), gender of patient (persistence was better in males), age of general practitioner (GP) (the younger the GP, the better the persistence rate) and gender of GP (better stay-on-therapy rate with male GP prescribing). In the case of patients treated continuously, mean daily dose increased progressively over the 3 years. With adequate markers, helpful data can be collected from prescription claims databases for the purpose of monitoring the persistence of patients in continuing their medication, and the quality of antihypertensive treatment in a general practice setting.", 
    "597": "Since coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases are the most common serious complications of long standing hypertension, there is a great potential for combining treatment with aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). However, the data regarding interaction of aspirin and ACE-I in relation to blood pressure control and survival benefits are controversial and inconclusive. We presumed that the appearance of dry cough in some of the patients following initiation of ACE-I treatment could be used as a marker for the presence of their influence, whereas ACE-I cough attenuation after addition of aspirin to treatment could be a sign of aspirin and ACE-I interaction on clinical level. The present study was aimed to use ACE-I induced cough as a clinical marker of ACE-I activity to determine whether dose-dependent aspirin and ACE-I interaction does exist. In a cohort of 750 consecutive ACE-I treated hypertensive and postinfarction outpatients we identified 78 (10.4%) non-smoking ACE-I related coughers. Out of them, 31 (21 men, 10 women; mean age 61 +/- 0.9 years) agreed to take part in the study, which was aimed to compare two regimens of combined ACE-I and aspirin treatment (self-matched control data): intermediate (500 mg daily) vs low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily). On each visit the life quality, cough severity (CS, 0-4) and frequency (CF, 0-10) scores were registered. Low doses of aspirin demonstrated an excellent safety profile and did not influence any life quality score and ACE-I induced cough. In contrast, intermediate doses completely abolished cough in 17 patients and reduced coughing in other 11 patients. Cough severity and cough frequency scores decreased, respectively, from 2.7 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 1.2 (P < 0.001) and from 7.1 +/- 2.3 to 2.0 +/- 2.2 (P < 0.0001). Overall, the cough frequency score method alone could identify a clear modification of cough in 26 (84%) patients, and cough severity score method alone in 24 (77%). Using the combined frequency/severity score method a modification of cough could be identified in 28 (90%) of the patients receiving intermediate dose of aspirin. Aspirin did not influence heart rate and blood pressure control either in hypertensives or in postinfarction patients. We conclude that using ACE-I induced cough as a clinical marker of ACE-I activity demonstrates that an interaction between ACE-I and aspirin at 500 mg/day does exist. We did not find any evidence supporting the presence of a clinically significant interaction between ACE-I and aspirin at 100 mg/day. Thus, combined treatment by low dose aspirin and ACE-I seems to be both safe and useful.",

    "602": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AAIIs) are the most specific inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There are two types of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors, the AT(1) receptor, which is responsible for all the classical physiological properties of Ang II, and the AT(2) receptor, whose function in humans remains unclear. The different AAIIs used in clinical practice vary depending on their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and, for some of them, depending on their metabolism in vivo into an active metabolite. AAIIs are relatively well tolerated, and, unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), do not induce cough. AAIIs are indicated in mild, moderate and severe essential hypertension, where their efficacy has been proven in many studies. The maximal antihypertensive effect is obtained in a few days or weeks, and is somewhat retarded when compared with ACEIs. Their effect is independent of age and sex, but does depend to a certain extent on ethnic origin, since Afro-American patients are less sensitive to AAIIs than Caucasians. In general, the antihypertensive and haemodynamic response to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system is potentiated in presence of a negative salt balance and attenuated in case of a positive salt balance. This means that AAII efficiency is improved by salt depletion induced by a salt-free diet or thiazide diuretics. AAIIs induce short-term improvement of haemodynamic parameters in cardiac insufficiency. Several ongoing clinical trials have been designed to compare their efficacy in cardiac insufficiency and myocardial infarction with those of reference treatments. Valsartan has been recently shown to improve morbimortality in patients with cardiac insufficiency and receiving a conventional treatment including an ACEI. It has been convincingly shown that blockade of the renin-aldosterone system by ACEIs decreases proteinuria and slows down the progression of renal insufficiency, especially in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Recent trials have shown that AAIIs share the same properties as ACEIs in these indications. It appears that the beneficial effect of AAIIs and ACEIs is not entirely explained by the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. AAII administration increases renin release and Ang II production, which may overcome Ang II blockade. On this basis, the combination of an AAII and an ACEI has been proposed to achieve a maximal renin-angiotensin system blockade. Several experimental studies in animals and preliminary clinical studies all indicate that the combination of the two drugs may be more beneficial than either drug used alone in hypertension, cardiac insufficiency and post-myocardial infarction. Clinical trials are necessary to further document the putative advantages of such a combined therapy. The future of AAIIs depends on the following: progress made in the understanding of the molecular and cellular activities of angiotensin (angiotensin receptor signalling, receptor dimerisation, presence of other angiotensin receptor subtypes, role of AT(2) receptor, etc.);a comprehensive view of the role of the local renin system in various organs (local generation and effect of Ang II on cellular proliferation, fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, etc.);predictability of the response to AAII treatment (genetic predisposition to AAII treatment, in conjunction with environmental factors); andresults of the ongoing clinical trials designed to assess the long-term effects of AAIIs in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, in comparison with reference treatments.", 
    "603": "The octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II), the potent effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is involved in the control of blood pressure, cardiac and vascular function as well as sodium and water homeostasis. Because Ang II has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases and renal failure, it has been of increasing interest to inhibit the RAAS at the level of its enzymes such as renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and receptors. At least two subtypes of angiotensin receptors have been identified: AT(1) and AT(2). The AT(1 )receptor mediates all of the known actions of Ang II in the cardiovascular system, such as vasoconstriction, increasing cardiac contractility and renal tubular sodium reabsorption, as well as vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, less is known regarding the function of the AT(2) receptor. Evidence suggests that the AT(2) receptor inhibits cell proliferation and induces differentiation, apoptosis and regeneration. The AT(2) receptor has been shown to reverse AT(1) receptor-mediated hypertrophy, suggesting that these receptors exert opposing effects in the cardiovascular system. While renin and ACE inhibitors block the RAAS at the enzymatic level, AT receptor antagonists specifically inhibit the RAAS at the receptor site. AT(1 )receptor antagonists induce a dose-dependent blockade of Ang II-induced effects, resulting in a reduction in blood pressure, cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. It is postulated that AT(1) receptor antagonists may provide end-organ protection by blocking Ang II via the AT(1) receptor, yet leaving the AT(2) receptor unopposed. These substances have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients with heart failure and renal disease associated with diabetes.", 
    "604": "The renin-angiotensin system exerts a cardinal role in the maintenance of blood pressure and in the regulation of water and sodium excretion through its multiple effects on the vasculature, the kidneys, the heart, the adrenal glands and the brain. Over the last 30 years, blockade of the renin-angiotensin cascade with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proved to be a major advance in the treatment of hypertension and the prevention of its cardiovascular complications. The recent development of specific, orally active angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists has provided further insights into the role of the various angiotensin receptor subtypes in the regulation of blood pressure. Even more importantly, these new specific antagonists have provided the opportunity to effectively block the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive patients with an efficacy comparable to that of other antihypertensive agents but with a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. Numerous clinical studies have now demonstrated the potential benefits of these agents in the management of essential hypertension. We now need to know whether these agents are capable of reducing the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. To this purpose, several large clinical trials are ongoing and we are eager to read their results.",

    "609": "Coronary blood flow regulation was studied in dogs with an intact or chronically decentralized intrinsic cardiac nervous system. We also examined the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) on coronary autoregulatory pressure-flow relations and distribution of blood flow since the renin-angiotensin system may play a critical role in vasoregulation. Myocardial oxygen demand was reduced in the chronic decentralized dogs compared to the control dogs. The lower pressure limit of the autoregulatory pressure-flow relation was similar for the control and chronic decentralized dogs (47+/-2 and 44+/-7 mm Hg, respectively; p = NS). After ACEI, the lower pressure limit shifted leftward to 40 mm Hg (p=0.001) in both groups. Concomitant blockade of cyclooxygenase, bradykinin catabolism and nitric oxide synthase had no further effect on the lower pressure limit. Total myocardial blood flow was lower (p=0.001) in the chronic decentralized dogs compared to the control dogs, while transmural distribution of blood flow was preserved in both groups. The results show that even though myocardial oxygen requirements are lower in the chronically decentralized heart compared to controls, coronary autoregulation is maintained at levels observed in normally innervated hearts. The present findings indicate that intrinsic cardiac neurons contribute to coronary autoregulatory control and myocardial blood flow distribution even in the absence of cardiac connections to the central nervous system. In addition, in the chronic decentralized dog, ACEI allows the heart to work at lower coronary perfusion pressures while myocardial blood flow distribution is preserved.", 
    "610": "Plasma aldosterone escape is found during long-term ACE inhibitor therapy of chronic heart failure. Evidence for aldosterone production in cardiovascular tissues raised the question of whether aldosterone escape occurs or not in these tissues. Rats with infarction-induced chronic heart failure were treated with enalapril (20 mg/kg/d) and losartan (15 mg/kg/d) for 20 weeks. Untreated chronic heart failure and sham-operated rats were used as positive and normal controls, respectively. Ex vivo mesenteric artery and heart perfusion, high performance liquid chromatography, and RIA for aldosterone were performed. Chronic heart failure due to myocardial infarction was associated with tissue-specific activation of cardiovascular aldosterone synthesis. In the mesenteric artery, enalapril significantly inhibited aldosterone production compared to untreated, chronic heart failure rats, and losartan lowered aldosterone production to that of sham rats. In myocardium, enalapril failed to significantly inhibit aldosterone production, and losartan significantly inhibited aldosterone production compared to untreated, chronic heart failure rats. These results provide the first evidence that long-term ACE inhibition therapy induces aldosterone escape in myocardium but not in mesenteric artery of chronic heart failure. The angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor blocker losartan tranquilized aldosterone levels in the cardiovascular tissues of chronic heart failure rats.", 
    "611": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Effective control of elevated blood pressure (BP) has been shown to reduce this risk. Early studies of risk reduction assumed that the mechanism by which BP was lowered had little impact on the benefit obtained. Recent evidence, however, suggests that agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system may be particularly beneficial. The results of the recent Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a greater impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than would be anticipated from their antihypertensive effects alone. Angiotensin receptor blockers, the other major class of antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, have not been widely tested in outcomes trials, but early results suggest that they are beneficial for controlling target organ damage that is related to hypertension. Furthermore, unlike ACE inhibitors, these agents have a side-effect profile that is similar to that of placebo. Based on their efficacy in controlling hypertension and their wider health benefits, together with minimal side effects, angiotensin II (A II) receptor blockers should be considered as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, particularly in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Preliminary evidence suggests that olmesartan, an A II receptor blocker currently being evaluated for approval for clinical use, may provide antihypertensive efficacy that is superior to other members of the class.", 
    "612": "During the past two decades great progress was achieved with regards to short-term kidney graft survival. However, long-term graft survival did not improve similarly. Many factors contribute to chronic graft nephropathy eventually resulting in late graft loss, among these arterial hypertension is of major importance. In patients with chronic renal disease of diabetic and non-diabetic origin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been convincingly shown to slow the progression of renal failure. The achieved nephroprotection correlates with the reduction of proteinuria by ACE inhibitor treatment. Also in renal transplant patients, ACE inhibitors have been shown unequivocally to reduce urinary protein excretion. The prevention of hyperfiltration, particular in the context of a reduced number of functional nephrons in patients with chronic graft nephropathy, could be important to prolong graft survival after renal transplantation. Moreover, ACE inhibitors may exert beneficial effects on immunologic processes contributing to chronic graft nephropathy. Many studies published in the last decade show convincingly that ACE inhibitors are safe and effective for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients. However, no data exist so far showing that ACE inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs in renal transplant patients and that they prolong graft survival. Studies investigating this issue are warranted. Apart from effects on the graft, ACE inhibitors may improve alterations of the cardiovascular system generally observed in renal transplant patients, such as structural alterations of large arteries, left ventricular hypertrophy, disturbed mechanical vessel wall properties and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors could reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant patients.", 
    "613": "Heart failure is a major concern to health care providers in Sweden due to its increasing prevalence and the rising health care costs. Heart failure affects more than 160000 Swedes, approximately 2% of the population. The costs for the management of heart failure have been calculated to be approximately SEK 2.500 million (Euro 275 million) which is 2% of the total health care budget. Most heart failure patients are managed by primary care physicians but hospitalisation is common and heart failure is the most common cause for hospitalisation in patients over 65 years of age. National diagnostic and treatment guidelines are not completely adhered to. Echocardiography is performed in a little more than 30% of patients in primary care probably due to poor access. In hospitals echocardiography is more easily available and routinely used for diagnosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to be under prescribed. Nurse-led heart failure clinics are being widely established in an attempt to curtail costs and improve management.",

Similar to other etiologies of left ventricular dysfunction, we found elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in this group of patients. In the present study we sought to evaluate the effects of pentoxifylline, a drug known to inhibit the production of TNF-alpha, on clinical status, left ventricular function, and circulating plasma levels of TNF-alpha, in patients with PPC. We followed prospectively 59 consecutive women with PPC. The first 29 patients (group 1) were treated with diuretics, digoxin, enalapril and carvedilol. The next 30 consecutive patients (group 2) received pentoxifylline 400 mg TID in addition to the previous therapy. Clinical evaluation, echocardiograms and TNF-alpha determinations were performed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Patients in the pentoxifylline group were older and had a higher E/A ratio. Nine patients died (eight in group 1, P = 0.009 between groups). A combined end-point of poor outcome defined as either death, failure to improve the left ventricular ejection fraction >10 absolute points or functional class III or IV at latest follow-up, occurred in 52% of patients in group 1 and 27% of patients in group 2 (P = 0.03). Treatment with pentoxifylline (P = 0.04) was the only independent predictor of outcome. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the addition of pentoxifylline to conventional treatment, improves outcome in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy.",

Non-diabetic rats were randomly selected to receive either (STZ) or citrate buffer. Diabetic rats were further randomly selected to receive either the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (6 mg/kg/day), or the vehicle only for 12 weeks.",

Increased transcript and immunostainable osteopontin were detected in tubular epithelial cells in association with extensive macrophage accumulation. Treatment with perindopril significantly ameliorated the overexpression of osteopontin in association with attenuation of macrophage accumulation.", 
    "622": "These findings suggest that osteopontin expression and macrophage accumulation may play a role in the tubulointerstitial injury in diabetic nephropathy, and that inhibition of osteopontin expression may be one of the mechanisms by which blockade of the renin-angiotensin system confers a renoprotective effect.", 
    "623": "Recent studies suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a role in the adipogenesis of murine preadipocytes. Here, we examined the role of Ang II for the differentiation of primary cultured human preadipocytes. Preadipocytes were isolated from human adipose tissue and stimulated to differentiate. Quantitation of gene expression during adipogenesis was performed for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes. The influence of the RAS on adipogenic differentiation was investigated by addition of either angiotensinogen (AGT), Ang II, or angiotensin receptor antagonists to the differentiation medium. We also examined the influence of adipocytes on adipogenesis by co-culture experiments. Expression of the RAS genes AGT, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and Ang II type 1 receptor increased during adipogenesis. Stimulation of the Ang II type 1 receptor by Ang II reduced adipose conversion, whereas blockade of this receptor markedly enhanced adipogenesis. Adipocytes were able to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation in the co-culture, and this effect was abolished by blockade of the Ang II type 1 receptor. This finding points to a functional role of the RAS in the differentiation of human adipose tissue. Because AGT secretion and Ang II generation are characteristic features of adipogenesis, we postulate a paracrine negative-feedback loop that inhibits further recruitment of preadipocytes by maturing adipocytes.",

    "628": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT (1)) receptor blockers improve ischemia-reperfusion induced arrhythmias and infarct size in several animal models. However, the effects of pretreatment with ACEIs or AT (1) receptor blockers on acute myocardial infarct size and arrhythmias are controversial. Thus, we sought to assess the comparative effects of pretreatment with ACEI captopril and AT (1)-receptor blocker losartan on myocardial infarct size and arrhythmias in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion. We randomly assigned 92 male Wistar rats for arrhythmias ( n= 60) and necrosis ( n= 32) experiments. To produce arrhythmia, the left main coronary artery was occluded for 7 min, followed by 7 min of reperfusion and to produce necrosis, the the left main coronary artery was occluded for 30 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Captopril (3 mg kg (-1)) and losartan (0.2 and 2 mg kg (-1)) were given intravenously 10 min before occlusion. Captopril reduced the incidences of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and mortality associated with irreversible VF, whereas the studied doses of losartan did not. Captopril also decreased the number of ventricular beats on reperfusion. Losartan 2 mg kg (-1) reduced both the number of ventricular premature beats and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) on reperfusion, while losartan at dose of 0.2 mg kg (-1) had no effect on these arrhythmias. Compared to the control group, both captopril and losartan reduced myocardial infarct size in the rat model of ischemia-reperfusion, but this was statistically significant for captopril only. In this experimental model, although captopril did not reduce the incidence of reperfusion-induced VT, it was more effective than the AT (1)-receptor blocker losartan at preventing mortality associated with irreversible VF and to reduce myocardial infarct size in rat model of ischemia-reperfusion.", 
    "629": "Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (EC) play an important role in the physiological regulation of coronary blood flow, but their function has not been rigorously examined, because suitable in vitro models have not been available. Cardiac macrovascular and microvascular EC were isolated and cultured from 14-16-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats to examine the pharmacological responses of carbachol-induced nitric oxide (NO) production using a Griess method. Carbachol-induced NO production was only detected in cardiac macrovascular EC, which suggests that endothelial production of NO differs between macrovascular and microvascular EC. Next, cardiac microvascular EC was treated with either vehicle, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril, 10 micromol/L) or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (CV11974, 10 micromol/L) for 4 days. Carbachol-induced NO production was improved by captopril (136+/-45nmol, p<0.01 vs vehicle) and CV11974 (146+/-30nmol, p<0.01 vs vehicle). Angiotensin II concentration in the culture medium and protein expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and AT1 receptor in the EC were similar among the 3 groups. Interestingly, the level of muscarinic subtype 3 (M3) receptor was significantly increased in the EC treated with captopril (214%, p<0.01) and CV11974 (296%, p<0.01). When cardiac microvascular EC were treated with neomycin (non-selective phospholipase C inhibitor), carbachol-induced NO production was also improved (146+/-35nmol, p<0.01, neomycin I mmol/L) together with increased expression of M3 receptor (p<0.01). These data suggest that the upregulation of the M3 receptor by captopril or CV11974 occurs via a phospholipase C-dependent pathway. Cardiac microvascular EC also produced NO constitutively, as did the macrovascular EC, but carbachol-induced NO production was decreased. The present data suggest that the upregulation of the M3 receptor by the ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor antagonist is a new beneficial effect of these drugs on microvascular endothelial function.", 
    "630": "The hepatotoxins and neurotoxins produced by bloom-forming cyanobacteria have been the cause of human and animal health hazards and even death. The most common cyanobacterial neurotoxin is anatoxin-a, and intoxications by these toxins can be fatal through muscular paralysis causing respiratory arrest. We report here anatoxin-a-induced apoptosis in two non-neuronal cells, viz. cultured rat thymocytes and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero). Anatoxin-containing cell-free extracts (ACE) from Anabena flosaquae and purified anatoxin-a were used in the study. The toxin-induced cytotoxicity was characterized by loss of viability, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, loss of mitochondrial function, and DNA fragmentation. The toxin-induced apoptosis was characterized by plasma membrane blebbing, condensed chromatin, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Toxin-treated thymocytes showed typical internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis. Ultrastructure studies confirmed the apoptotic morphology in thymocytes. ACE and anatoxin-a showed caspase-3 activation, and pretreatment with the caspase-3-specific tetrapeptide inhibitor, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO) abolished the DNA fragmentation and reduced the incidence of apoptotic cells. The thymocytes also showed dose- and time-dependent toxin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species. The study demonstrates that anatoxin-induced apoptosis is possibly mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species and caspase activation.", 
    "631": "The structure, function, and composition of the basement membrane of the glomerular capillaries of the mammalian kidney have been extensively studied, in light of the membrane's important physiological role in glomerular filtration of macromolecules and of its frequent involvement in renal diseases. An analytical mathematical model, based on the fiber matrix theory, was developed to describe the dynamics of the permselective function of the glomerular capillary barrier using mainly its hemodynamic and morphometric variables. The glomerular basement membrane was represented as a homogeneous three-dimensional meshwork of fibers of uniform length (L(f)), radius (R(f)), and packing density (N(fv)) and characterized by a local Darcy permeability (a measure of the intrinsic hydraulic conductance of the glomerular basement membrane). The model was appropriate for simulating in vivo fractional clearance data of neutral test macromolecules from an experimental rat model. We believe that the L(f) and R(f) best-fit numerical values, characterizing a glomerular basement membrane geometrical arrangement, may represent diagnostic measures for renal function in health and disease. That is, these parameters may signify new insights for the diagnosis of some human nephropathies and possibly may explain the beneficial effects and/or sites of action of some pharmacological modifiers (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors).",

However, these observations were noted before treatment with beta blockers became part of standard clinical practice. Fifty-eight patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II and III, ejection fraction <35%; 53% ischaemic cardiomyopathy) were prospectively studied with a mean follow-up of 36 months. During the observational period, 17 patients (29.3%) had a predefined event (death and heart transplantation). All prognostic parameters were obtained before beta blocker therapy was initiated. In both uni- and multivariate analysis, the heart-mediastinum ratio of 123I-MIBG uptake did not correlate with cardiovascular mortality. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, plasma norepinephrine, peak oxygen consumption, end-diastolic volume as measured by echocardiography and exercise performance during bicycling and walking had prognostic significance in patients with heart failure treated with beta blockers in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "633": "The effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure is largely attributable to their suppression of angiotensin II production. Despite chronic therapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II levels may be incompletely suppressed and contribute to the high mortality of patients with heart failure. Recently, angiotensin receptor blockers, which block the effects rather than the production of angiotensin II, have become available. Angiotensin receptor blockers have been evaluated as both monotherapy and in combination with ACE inhibitors. In short term studies, angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy appears to share many of the hemodynamic and clinical features of ACE inhibitors. In a long-term study, the Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study, angiotensin receptor blockers failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect over that seen with ACE inhibitors. The addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to an ACE inhibitor appears to exert favorable short term hemodynamic, clinical, and neurohormonal effects. Four ongoing trials, Valsartan Heart Failure Trial, Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity, Optimal Therapy in Myocardial Infarction with Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study, and Valsartan In Acute Myocardial Infarction study, are evaluating the role of angiotensin receptor blockers either alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors in the management of left ventricular dysfunction.

A basic understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is essential to diagnosis and proper treatment. It is especially important to recognise the difference between the effect of prolonged upright posture on a failing autonomic nervous system (a hyposensitive or dysautonomic response) and the vasovagal response (which may be a hypersensitive response). Vasovagal syncope is the most common abnormal response to upright posture and occurs in all age groups. The advent of tilt table testing has helped define a population with an objective finding during provocative testing that has enabled researchers to study the mechanism of vasovagal syncope and to evaluate the efficacy of treatments. In most patients, vasovagal syncope occurs infrequently and only under exceptional circumstances and treatment is not needed. Treatment may be indicated in patients with recurrent syncope or with syncope that has been associated with physical injury or potential occupational hazard. Based on study data, patients with vasovagal syncope can now be risk stratified into a high-risk group likely to have recurrent syncope and a low-risk group. Many patients with vasovagal syncope can be effectively treated with education, reassurance and a simple increase in dietary salt and fluid intake. In others, treatment involves removal or avoidance of agents that predispose to hypotension or dehydration. However, when these measures fail to prevent the recurrence of symptoms, pharmacological therapy is usually recommended. Although many pharmacological agents have been proposed and/or demonstrated to be effective based on nonrandomised clinical trials, there is a remarkable absence of data from large prospective clinical trials. Data from randomised placebo-controlled studies support the efficacy of beta-blockers, midodrine, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and ACE inhibitors. There is also considerable clinical experience and a consensus suggesting that fludrocortisone is effective. Encouraging new data suggest that a programme involving tilt training can effectively prevent vasovagal syncope. For patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope that is refractory to these treatments, implantation of a permanent pacemaker with specialised sensing/pacing algorithms appears to be effective. A number of larger clinical trials are underway which should help further define the efficacy of a number of different treatments for vasovagal syncope.", 
    "662": "In 430 patients (pts) with hypertension (209F + 221M, mean age 46 +/- 13 yrs) screening value of the captopril angioscintigraphic test (CAT) was evaluated in years 1986-2001 in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVHT). Captopril renin test (CRT) and CAT were performed simultaneously in all 430 pts. Classical renal angiography was performed in 95 pts suspected for RVHT on the basis of clinical anamnesis and positive result at least one of captopril tests. Results were as follows. The critical renal artery stenosis (RAS) was found in 47 pts. At least one positive captopril test was found in 42 from 47 pts with critical RAS in angiography. CRT was found to be more sensitive and CAT more specific for hemodynamically significant RAS. The absence of false positive results of CAT as well as considerable percentage of false positive results of CRT stress the importance of isotopic test as the screening test for the diagnosis of RVT. Simplicity of the test, availability as well as immediately obtained result allow to propose CAT as a routine ambulatory screening test for RVHT.",

Moreover, the combined effect of captopril and enalapril on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice has been examined. The captopril (5 and 20 mg/kg) and enalapril (5 and 20 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally i.p. The drugs were given as single or repeated doses for 10 days. It has been shown that the captopril and enalapril administered in single doses decreases, but chronic administration increases acute toxicity of ethanol. Captopril and enalapril in single doses enhanced, but chronic administration inhibits hypothermic effect of ethanol. Captopril and enalapril reduces ethanol sleeping time. Captopril and enalapril administered for 10 days and enalapril in a single dose 20 mg/kg decreases ethanol induced hyperactivity.", 
    "664": "Recent clinical studies such as HOPE, SECURE, and APRES show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like ramipril improve the prognosis of patients with a high risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events. Atherosclerosis, as a chronic inflammatory condition of the vascular system, can turn into an acute clinical event through the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque followed by thrombosis. ACE inhibition has a beneficial effect on the atherogenic setting and on fibrinolysis. Endothelial dysfunction is the end of a common process in which cardiovascular risk factors contribute to inflammation and atherogenesis. By inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors prevent any damaging effects on endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory vascular processes. An increase in the release of NO under ACE inhibition has a protective effect. Local renin-angiotensin systems in the tissue are involved in the inflammatory processes in the atherosclerotic plaque. Circulating ACE-containing monocytes, which adhere to endothelial cell lesions, differentiate within the vascular wall to ACE-containing macrophages or foam cells with increased local synthesis of ACE and angiotensin II. Within the vascular wall, angiotensin II decisively contributes to the instability of the plaque by stimulating growth factors, adhesion molecules, chemotactic proteins, cytokines, oxidized LDL, and matrix metalloproteinases. Suppression of the increased ACE activity within the plaque can lead to the stabilization and deactivation of the plaque by reducing inflammation in the vascular wall, thus lessening the risk of rupture and thrombosis and the resultant acute clinical cardiovascular events. The remarkable improvement in the long-term prognosis of atherosclerotic patients with increased cardiovascular risk might be the clinical result of the contribution made by ACE inhibition in the vascular wall.", 
    "665": "A human zinc metalloprotease (termed ACEH or ACE2) with considerable homology to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (EC 3.4.15.1) has been identified and subsequently cloned and functionally expressed. The translated protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, a single catalytic domain with zinc-binding motif (HEMGH), a transmembrane region, and a small C-terminal cytosolic domain. Unlike somatic ACE, ACEH functions as a carboxypeptidase when acting on angiotensin I and angiotensin II or other peptide substrates. ACEH may function in conjunction with ACE and neprilysin in novel pathways of angiotensin metabolism of physiological significance. In contrast with ACE, ACEH does not hydrolyse bradykinin and is not inhibited by typical ACE inhibitors. ACEH is unique among mammalian carboxypeptidases in containing an HEXXH zinc motif but, in this respect, resembles a bacterial enzyme, Thermus aquaticus (Taq) carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.17.19). Collectrin, a developmentally regulated renal protein, is homologous with the C-terminal region of ACEH but has no similarity with ACE and no catalytic domain. Thus, the ACEH protein may have evolved as a chimera of a single ACE-like domain and a collectrin domain. The collectrin domain may regulate tissue response to injury whereas the catalytic domain is involved in peptide processing events.", 
    "666": "We investigated the effects of a 3-week treatment with various combinations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and B1 and B2 bradykinin receptor (B1R and B2R) antagonists (B1A and B2A) and AT1 receptor antagonist on ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation in isolated glomeruli from streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats (STZ rats). Body weight, glycemia, and blood pressure were monitored. The rats were divided into nine groups: (1) control; and groups 2-9 were STZ treated with (3) insulin, (4) ACEI, (5) ACEI + B1A, (6) ACEI + B2A, (7) B2A, (8) B1A, (9) AT1 antagonist. ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation and expression of B1R and B2R were assessed by Western blot analysis. ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation was higher in STZ rats; this activation was normalized by insulin and reduced by ACEI but not by AT1 antagonist. The reduction of ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation by the ACEI was reversed by B1A and B2A. The induction of B1R was confirmed by increased expression of mRNA and B1 receptor protein. Since ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation is an early event in the induction of matrix secretion and hyperproliferation associated with diabetic nephropathy, activation of B1R and B2R appears to be a useful pharmacological target in the management of this pathology.", 
    "667": "Myocardial blood flow (MBF) reserve is impaired in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure. Whether this is already present in asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and whether it is affected by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, is unknown. We examined MBF in 20 patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction and compared them to healthy volunteers. MBF (reserve) was assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia at rest, during dipyridamole stress test (DST) and during cold pressor test (CPT). Further, in the LV-dysfunction group, we studied the effects of 3 months treatment with ACE inhibition with a second PET study. Patients were randomized double-blind to perindopril 4 mg daily or placebo. MBF at rest was similar in controls and patients. DST-induced MBF reserve, however, was decreased in patients vs. controls (1.71+/-0.2 vs. 2.62+/-0.5, respectively p < 0.05). Also CPT-induced MBF was lower in patients (1.14+/-0.06 vs. 1.23+/-0.03, p < 0.05). After 3 months double-blind treatment, CPT-induced MBF decreased in the placebo group (from 1.12+/-0.02 to 0.93+/-0.06), but was preserved in the perindopril group (from 1.16+/-0.08 to 1.14+/-0.08 shifts from baseline: -0.19+/-0.05 vs. -0.02+/-0.07 respectively p = 0.07). This was compatible with a trend to a smaller increase in coronary vascular resistance during CPT (1.23+/-0.08 vs. 1.03+/-0.06, placebo vs. perindopril, p = 0.06). In patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, MBF, both after vasodilation and after CPT, is already impaired. ACE inhibition with perindopril during this short-term treatment had no significant effects.", 
    "668": "Once contraindicated, beta-blockers have become an established, evidence-based, recommended treatment concept in chronic heart failure during the last years.", 
    "669": "The increased activation of the adrenergic system in heart failure syndrome, which leads to transmission of several adverse biological signals to myocytes through adrenergic receptors, provides the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure. Long-term treatment with different types of beta-blockers addictive to an ACE-inhibitor and diuretics results in normalization of left ventricular shape, an improvement of left ventricular function, and a reduction of hospitalization rate for heart failure. Hemodynamic and clinical improvement is independent of etiology and severity of left ventricular dysfunction. THERAPEUTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ACCORDINGS TO STUDIES: Adequately powered clinical trials (CIBIS II, MERIT-HF, COPERNICUS) testing different types of beta-blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol, carvedilol) clearly demonstrated that total mortality and the incidence of sudden cardiac death were significantly reduced in heart failure patients by each of these agents. On the basis of all available evidence, all patients with chronic, stable heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and with impaired left ventricular function (LVEF < 45%) should receive one of the three above mentioned beta-blockers. Protective effects of beta-blockers in heart failure comprise decrease in heart rate, a decrease of energy consumption, antifibrillatory effects, protection against adrenergic overactivation, and hence, inhibition of myocardial cell necrosis. Moreover, several beta-blockers induce an up-regulation of beta-receptors leading to an improvement of contractility during long-term treatment. It should be mentioned that even a low dosage of beta-blockers exert negative inotropic effects and may lead to a deterioration of hemodynamics and heart failure symptoms in patients with heart failure. The patients treated should be informed that the success of the \"paradoxical intervention\" will be obvious until 2-3 months after initiation of additional beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blocker treatment for heart failure should be started in stable patients with a very low initial dosage and then up-titrated to the maximal tolerated dosage and should be continued indefinitely. Mortality reduction by beta-blockade in heart failure is no class effect. So far, beneficial effects could only be demonstrated for lipophilic agents. Whether the non-selective beta-blocker carvedilol with additional properties has advantages over the beta-1-selective metoprolol is currently investigated in the COMET (Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial) study. Despite the impressive effects in terms of morbidity and mortality reduction, the transfer of these benefits to the clinical practice setting is difficult, with international data showing only 10% of patients with heart failure being treated.", 
    "670": "All forms of chronic heart failure (high-output and low-output failure) are accompanied by an \"arterial underfilling\" inducing the activation of various neurohumoral systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathic nervous system, non-osmotic stimulation of vasopressin). Elevated levels of those neurohormones detrimentally modulate renal function. Subsequently, renal salt and volume retention occurs leading to the main symptoms of heart failure, edema formation and dyspnea.", 
    "671": "Diuretics, which have been discovered more than 40 years ago, beneficially influence renal salt- and volume retention by their effects on tubular sodium reabsorption. While thiazides are recommended in mild forms, loop diuretics are used in severe stages of congestive heart failure. The clinician has to consider the changed pharmacokinetic and -dynamic properties during the application of diuretics in patients with chronic heart failure. In addition, increased sodium reabsorption occurs immediately after cessation of diuretic action often nullifying the preceding diuresis. Thus, salt- and volume restriction should be guaranteed, and a regular application of loop diuretics during the day should be preferred due to the short-acting nature of currently available loop diuretics. Sometimes, diuresis does not longer occur during the treatment with one substance (diuretic resistance), although the therapeutic goals of water excretion have not been achieved. After ruling out factors reducing the actions of diuretics (non-compliance, hyponatremia, etc.), a sequential nephron blockade should be initiated (combination of loop diuretics and a thiazide or an aldosterone-receptor antagonist) to increase diuresis and to elevate symptoms of volume overload.", 
    "672": "Loop diuretics and thiazides often induce mild hypokalemia, which has been demonstrated to be not as benign as thought before. Chronic treatment with oral potassium supplements has several drawbacks, as urine excretion of potassium is subsequently increased and supplementation is not as effective as believed. Diuretic-induced hypokalemia seems to be aldosterone dependent. As aldosterone levels increase during diuretic therapy even during chronic treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (aldosterone-escape) a combined treatment including an aldosterone-receptor antagonist has been suggested. Beneficial effects of aldosterone-receptor blockade on mortality (RALES trial) appear to be mediated be extrarenal and renal mechanisms. The suggested beneficial renal mechanisms of aldosterone receptor blockade are discussed in detail in the review.", 
    "673": "In conclusion, diuretic therapy of patients with congestive heart failure is effective to relieve symptoms and, presumably, to prolong life. As renal function and pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of diuretics are changed in heart failure, diuretic treatment has to be adapted to provide optimal treatment. Increased levels of aldosterone appear to play an important role in diuretic-induced hypokalemia, and in the progression of heart and renal failure. Thus, aldosterone receptor antagonists should be used in the treatment of heart failure more frequently.", 
    "674": "1. We investigated the nitric oxide (NO) dependence of vasorelaxation in response to different calcium channel blockers (CCB), in rabbit femoral artery in vivo. 2. Anaesthetized rabbits underwent femoral artery ligation, and blood from the proximal artery was returned distal to the ligature through a constant infusion pump. The effects of local injection of CCB on perfusion pressure and plasma nitrite+nitrate (NO(x), which reflects local NO biosynthesis) concentration in this system were determined. 3. Intra-arterial verapamil, nifedipine or amlodipine 10 micromol x kg(-1) each reduced perfusion pressure. Pre-treatment with intra-arterial N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a NO synthase inhibitor) 1 micromol x kg(-1) did not affect responses to verapamil or nifedipine, but attenuated the reduction in perfusion pressure to amlodipine, from 33.2+/-2.1% to 22.5+/-1.6% (P=0.002). 4. Intra-arterial amlodipine--unlike verapamil or nifedipine--increased femoral venous NO(x), from 9.1+/-0.4 microM to 14.1+/-0.5 microM (P=0.005). 5. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140, 30 mg x kg(-1), attenuated the reduction in perfusion pressure and abolished the rise in venous NO(x) concentration, following intra-arterial amlodipine. 6. Amlodipine potently inhibited serum angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro, as effectively as enalapril at similar concentrations. 7. These results suggest that the vasorelaxant effects of nifedipine and verapamil are NO-independent, whereas those of amlodipine are partly NO-dependent, in rabbit femoral artery in vivo. This effect of amlodipine occurs through B2 receptor activation, and may be related to an increase in local bradykinin through inhibition of ACE.", 
    "675": "We have synthesized a prodrug of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril by coupling this drug covalently to the low molecular weight protein (LMWP) lysozyme. Such drug-LMWP conjugates can be used for renal drug delivery, since LMWPs accumulate specifically in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney. In the present study, we compared the effects of captopril-lysozyme and free captopril in male Wistar rats. ACE activity in plasma and the kidney was measured after intravenous bolus injection of either the captopril-lysozyme conjugate (33 mg. kg(-1), corresponding to 0.2 mg. kg(-1) captopril) or equivalent dosages of free captopril and lysozyme. The administration of the captopril-lysozyme conjugate resulted in less plasma ACE inhibition and a longer-lasting renal ACE inhibition compared with the free drug. Effects on blood pressure and natriuresis were studied during intravenous infusion of captopril-lysozyme (275 mg. kg(-1). 6 h(-1) conjugate, corresponding to 5 mg. kg(-1). 6 h(-1) captopril) or an equimolar dosage of free captopril. Captopril-lysozyme did not affect systemic blood pressure, whereas free captopril lowered blood pressure significantly (-23 +/- 32% versus control after 6 h). Captopril-lysozyme increased natriuresis about 3-fold compared with control levels (260 +/- 32% after 6 h), whereas free captopril treatment resulted in a reduced sodium excretion (26 +/- 12%). Furthermore, captopril at a lower dose, which only moderately lowered blood pressure, showed an increased sodium excretion. We conclude that renal delivery of captopril using captopril-lysozyme results in reduced systemic activity and increased kidney-specific activity of the targeted drug.",

Hypertension represents an imbalance of hemodynamic forces within the circulation, usually characterized by elevated systemic vascular resistance. We studied the utility of serial hemodynamic parameters in the selection and titration of antihypertensive medication in resistant hypertensive patients using highly reproducible noninvasive measurements by thoracic bioimpedance. Resistant hypertension patients (n=104) were randomized to drug selection based either on serial hemodynamic (HD) measurements and a predefined algorithm or on drug selection directed by a hypertension specialist (SC) in a 3-month intensive treatment program. Blood pressure was lowered by intensified drug therapy in both treatment groups (169+/-3/87+/-2 to 139+/-2/72+/-1 mm Hg HD versus 173+/-3/91+/-2 to 147+/-2/79+/-1 mm Hg SC, P<0.01 for systolic and diastolic BP), using similar numbers and intensity of antihypertensive medications. Blood pressures were reduced further for those treated according to hemodynamic measurements, resulting in improved control rates (56% HD versus 33% SC controlled to </=140/90 mm Hg, P<0.05) and incremental reduction in systemic vascular resistance measurements. Although the number of patients taking diuretics did not differ between groups, final diuretic dosage was higher in the hemodynamic cohort. Our results demonstrate superior blood pressure control using a treatment algorithm and serial hemodynamic measurements compared with clinical judgment alone in a randomized prospective study. Our measurements of thoracic fluid volume support occult volume expansion as a mediator of antihypertensive drug resistance and use of impedance measurements to guide advancing diuretic dose and adjustment of multidrug antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "700": "Both systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction coexist in various degrees in the majority of patients with heart failure. Although ACE inhibitors are useful in the treatment of heart failure, the roles of bradykinin in the systolic and diastolic properties of left ventricular function under long-term treatment of ACE inhibitor have not been fully elucidated. We therefore evaluated the changes in left ventricular function, histomorphometry, and the expression of several failing heart related genes, by use of an orally active specific bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist, FR173657 (0.3 mg/kg per day), with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (1 mg/kg per day), in dogs with tachycardia-induced heart failure (270 ppm, 22 days) and compared the effects to enalapril alone. Although there were no differences observed in blood pressure, left ventricular dimension, and percentage of fractional shortening, FR173657 significantly increased left ventricular filling pressure (P<0.01), prolonged the time constant of relaxation (P<0.05), and suppressed the expression of endothelial NO synthase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA (P<0.05). FR173657 also upregulated collagen type I and III mRNA (P<0.05) and increased the total amount of cardiac collagen deposits (P<0.05) in left ventricle compared with that in the enalapril-treated group. In conclusion, endogenous bradykinin contributes to the cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitor, improving left ventricular diastolic dysfunction rather than systolic dysfunction, via modification of NO release and Ca(2+) handling and suppression of collagen accumulation.",

SB236050 exhibits key polar interactions with Lys184, Asn193, and His162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of Trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. SB236050 and SB238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. Eight micrograms of SB236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the MIC of meropenem for two clinical isolates of B. fragilis producing CfiA, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (MIC < or = 4 microg/ml). Consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.",

Clinical and other laboratory investigations including echocardiographic parameters were noted and recorded meticulously within 24-48 hours after AMI and repeated at 4th week. The present study based on non-invasive methods other than haemodynamic methods has shown that the echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular functional parameters after 4 weeks of ACE inhibitor therapy (n = 100) were better in treated group in comparison to control group without ACE inhibitor (n = 80) and the difference was statistically significant at 99% level of confidence. Overall mortality was 4% in ACE inhibitor group and 8.75% in the control group. This short term study with early intervention with ACE inhibitor within 48 hours of AMI has shown statistically significant evidence of beneficial effect of ACE inhibitor in improving the ventricular functional parameters and also reducing short term mortality from cardiac cause within 4 weeks compared to the group not receiving ACE inhibitors.",

The fluorescent derivative of captopril was measured by HPLC using a C-18 reversed phase column with fluorescence detection at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 235 nm and 440 nm, respectively. The mobile phase consisted of a methanol-acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (0.02 mol.L-1, pH 6.4) mixture (30:30:135, v/v), and was set at a flow rate of 1 ml.min-1. The linear range of the assay was between 5 ng.ml-1 (lower limit of quantitation) and 300 ng.ml-1 for total captopril in plasma.

Mortality was similar in the 2 groups, but the combined mortality and morbidity end point was 13.2% lower with valsartan (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97; P.009), primarily because of a reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for CHF (13.8% v 18.2%). There were improvements in several secondary end points, including ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of CHF, and quality of life with valsartan. Of note is that analyses of subgroups defined according to background therapy at baseline showed highly significant interactions. For instance, the small subgroup of 366 patients (7%) who were not receiving ACE inhibitors had a 33% reduction in mortality and a 44% decrease in mortality and morbidity, whereas the morbidity and mortality benefit of valsartan observed in the overall trial was no longer significant in patients receiving background ACE inhibitor therapy (relative risk, 0.90; P.10).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to have multiple beneficial effects after MI, but until now, their effects on cardiac cytokine expression were unknown. It was hypothesized that ACE inhibitors reduce cardiac cytokine expression and that this is associated with improved cardiac remodeling and hemodynamics. Rats had an MI created by coronary artery ligation and ACE inhibitors were started either early (day 1) or late (day 25) after MI and followed for a total of 28 days after MI. In the early-post-MI group, quinapril improved cardiac hemodynamics, improved ventricular remodeling, and prevented the increase in the expression of several cardiac cytokines (interleukin-1beta and -6) and reduced the cardiac expression of other cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-5). The late introduction of quinapril (for 3 days) resulted in similar beneficial hemodynamic effects, and reductions in cardiac cytokines but did not result in improved cardiac remodeling. Thus, following MI, ACE inhibitors reduce cardiac cytokine expression both chronically and subacutely, an effect that may contribute to their beneficial effects after MI.",

This study tests BNP levels as a predictor of sudden death.",

Up to 3 years, 293 patients survived without HTx or a mechanical assist device, 89 patients died, and 65 patients underwent HTx. Mode of death was sudden in 44 patients (49%), whereas 31 patients (35%) had pump failure and 14 patients (16%) died from other causes. Univariate risk factors of sudden death were log BNP (P=0.0006), log N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (P=0.003), LVEF (P=0.005), log N-terminal BNP (P=0.006), systolic blood pressure (P=0.01), big endothelin (P=0.03), and NYHA class (P=0.04). In the multivariate model, log BNP level was the only independent predictor of sudden death (P=0.0006).

The pattern of left ventricular (LV) remodeling differed, omapatrilat causing less attenuation of the rightward shift of the LV pressure-volume relation at lower filling pressures than captopril. Both interventions reduced messenger ribonucleic acid expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta(1); neither effected the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, and only captopril reduced the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Expression of TNF-alpha was in cardiomyocytes. Both medications reduced circulating endothelin-1, angiotensin II and catecholamines, but only omapatrilat increased atrial natriuretic peptides.",

    "761": "Angiotensin-II (AT-II), which is produced mainly by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been shown to stimulate neovascularization. AT-II induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. The role of AT-II, however, in VEGF-mediated tumor development has not yet been elucidated. We examined the effect of RAS inhibition by angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on VEGF-mediated tumor development and angiogenesis in a murine experimental model using a retroviral tetracycline-regulated (Retro-Tet) gene expression system. This system allows VEGF gene expression to be manipulated in vivo by providing tetracycline in the drinking water. In an allograft study, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril (PE) significantly attenuated VEGF-mediated tumor development accompanying the suppression of neovascularization in the tumor at a clinically comparable low dose. In vitro study showed that perindoprilat, which is an active form of PE, inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration. These results suggested that RAS played an important role in VEGF-mediated tumor development and angiogenesis.",

    "764": "Most patients were male (68%), white (97%), and over 60 years old (59%). The main risk factor for coronary atherosclerotic disease was systemic blood hypertension (63%). Among all the variables studied, reperfusion therapy, smoking, hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and age were the predictors of 30-day mortality. Most commonly used medications were: acetylsalicylic acid (71%), nitrates (61%), diuretics (51%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (46%), thrombolytic therapy (39%), and beta-blockers (35%).", 
    "765": "The absence of reperfusion therapy, smoking status, hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and advanced age are predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In addition, some medications that are undoubtedly beneficial have been under-used after acute myocardial infarction.",

    "767": "We retrospectively analyzed 379 patients above the age of 65 years with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to the coronary unit of a university-affiliated hospital from 1990 to 1997. The patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the period of time of hospital admission as follows: group 1 - from 1990 to 1993; and group 2 - from 1994 to 1997.", 
    "768": "The use of beta-blockers (40.8% X 75.2%, p<0.0001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (42% X 59.5%, p=0.001) was significantly greater in group 2, while the use of calcium antagonists (42% X 18.5%, p<0.0001) and general antiarrhythmic drugs (19.1% X 10.8%, p=0.03) was significantly lower. No significant difference was observed in regard to the use of acetylsalicylic acid, thrombolytic agents, nitrate, and digitalis in the period studied. The length of hospitalization was shorter in group 2 (13.4+/-8.9 days X 10.5+/-7.5 days, p<0.001). The in-hospital mortality was 35.7% in group 1 and 26.6% in group 2 (p=0.07).",

The length of hospitalization and the mortality rate were also lower in group 2, even though the reduction in mortality was not statistically significant.", 
    "770": "The main purpose of this study was to assess the improvement in visual function in patients with glaucomatous neuropathy treated with Ramipril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor); we were thus able to link ischemia and visual deterioration in glaucoma. Ramipril increases endothelium-dependent relaxation and vasodilatation to bradykinin via B2 receptors linked to the formation of nitric oxide (NO). On the other hand, Ramipril could have an influence on retinal neurotransmission modulation.", 
    "771": "Ramipril was administered to 22 patients suffering from chronic glaucoma in whom intraocular pressure (IOP) was controlled by classic treatment, combining Ramipril with this treatment. It was given orally (1.25mg daily) for 3 months in order to improve visual function. In addition to the standard follow-up (visual acuity, intraocular pressure, automatic perimetry, optic disk), this study focused on the systemic tolerance to Ramipril.", 
    "772": "Thirty eyes in 22 patients were evaluated. Mean intraocular pressure did not change, but the mean visual acuity improved from 0.53 to 0.74. After 3 months of treatment, the perimetric test (Octopus) showed an improvement in the mean defect (MD) (48%) and the corrected loss variance (CLV) (54%). No complications in terms of arterial pressure were observed.", 
    "773": "This study has shown that Ramipril was an effective agent in glaucomatous neuropathy. It improved visual function without changing IOP and had a satisfactory general tolerance in all patients. This could be explained in part by a higher production of NO by endothelial cells. This gas is a powerful vasodilator. It is formed from L-arginine by constitutive nitric oxide synthetase. This would provide an improvement in local blood flow autoregulation altered in glaucoma by an endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "774": "It has been reported that aspirin (ASA) may interfere with the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of various antihypertensive agents and attenuate the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure.",

In ASA-treated and placebo-treated patients: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values achieved with antihypertensive treatment were superimposable, with clinically irrelevant differences; (2) these superimposable SBP and DBP were achieved with antihypertensive therapies, that were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, and (3) changes in serum creatinine and in estimated creatinine clearance and the number of patients developing renal dysfunction were also similar. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits of ASA were of the same magnitude in hypertensive patients receiving or not receiving ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "776": "Even long-term, low-dose ASA does not interfere with the BP-lowering effect of antihypertensive agents, including combinations with ACE inhibitors, or with renal function. No negative interaction occurs between ACE inhibition and the cardiovascular benefits of small dose of ASA. Our conclusions cannot be extended to larger doses of ASA, or to patients with congestive heart failure.",

    "778": "One hundred and twenty-eight patients (52 men and 76 women) aged 25-82 years (mean age 55.7 years), with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 100 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo washout period were allocated randomly to groups to receive valsartan (80-160 mg once daily) or lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily). At the end of 10 weeks of treatment, patients with DBP < 90 mmHg, while continuing to receive valsartan or lisinopril treatment, were allocated randomly to groups to receive either indomethacin (50 mg three times a day) or the corresponding placebo for 2 weeks, with a 1-week washout period between the two treatments, according to a double-blind, crossover design. After the initial washout period, patients were examined at the end of the 4th, 8th and 10th weeks of randomized treatment with valsartan and lisinopril, at the end of the first crossover period and then at the beginning and at the end of the second crossover period. At each visit, sitting and standing blood pressure were measured by standard mercury sphygmomanometer.", 
    "779": "The addition of indomethacin blunted the blood pressure-decreasing effect of both antihypertensive drugs. Although indomethacin produced greater increases in both systolic and DBP values in the lisinopril-treated patients (5.45/3.22 mmHg) than in the valsartan-treated ones (2.12/1.87 mmHg), no significant difference between the two drugs was found.", 
    "780": "From a theoretical standpoint, these findings suggest that prostaglandins may play a part in the antihypertensive action of Ang II antagonists. From a practical standpoint, hypertensive patients treated with valsartan or with lisinopril should be monitored to detect changes in blood pressure control while receiving indomethacin.", 
    "781": "In contrast to the vasculature, it remains unclear whether oestrogens also directly affect the myocardium. In this study, we addressed basic questions regarding oestrogen effects on the myocardium, including specificity, pathophysiological relevance and potential clinical implications, with a special focus on interactions between oestrogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in an established in-vivo model of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "782": "Female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were ovarectomized (OVX) or sham-operated and treated with 17beta-oestradiol (2 microg/kg per day subcutaneously), the oestrogen receptor antagonist ZM-182780 (250 microg/kg per day subcutaneously) and the ACE-inhibitor moexipril (10 mg/kg per day orally) alone or in combination for 3 months. Hormone replacement restored physiological oestradiol serum levels and prevented uterus atrophy. Whereas moexipril alone was ineffective in OVX rats, substitution of oestradiol restored the beneficial effect of moexipril on systolic blood pressure (-30 +/- 5 mmHg) and relative heart weight (-11 +/- 3%) in OVX rats. Oestradiol upregulated alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA (+37 +/- 7%) and protein expression (+43 +/- 6%) in spite of increased blood pressure in OVX rats. Simultaneous treatment with oestradiol plus moexipril most effectively shifted the ratio of alpha-/beta-MHC mRNA and protein expression towards alpha-MHC in OVX animals. Oestradiol (10 nmol/l) also upregulated alpha-MHC mRNA and protein in cultured cardiac myocytes. The oestrogen receptor antagonist ZM-182780 significantly inhibited the observed oestrogen effects.", 
    "783": "Oestrogen replacement is permissive for the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibition in female SHR rats. Oestrogen effects on the myocardium in vivo are specific (i.e. oestrogen receptor mediated) because they are inhibited by a pure oestrogen receptor antagonist and occur at physiological hormone levels.", 
    "784": "Omapatrilat, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is an effective antihypertensive agent. Here, we studied the relative roles of NEP and ACE inhibition and their effect on resistance artery structure and function of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats.", 
    "785": "Omapatrilat (40 mg/kg per day), the NEP inhibitor CGS 25462 (CGS, 100 mg/kg per day) and the ACE inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg per day), were given for 3 weeks to DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Effects on small mesenteric resistance arteries were studied on a pressurized myograph. Collagen deposition was evaluated by confocal microscopy.", 
    "786": "Systolic blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by omapatrilat and CGS. Omapatrilat and CGS treatment increased lumen diameter and decreased media width and media/lumen ratio of small arteries of DOCA-salt rats (P < 0.05). Small artery relaxation responses to acetylcholine improved under omapatrilat or CGS treatment. The stress-strain curve shifted leftward in mesenteric arteries from DOCA-salt rats compared to control rats. Omapatrilat or CGS treatment resulted in a rightward shift, which was significantly different from that induced by enalapril. Omapatrilat and CGS decreased collagen deposition in the vessel wall of DOCA-salt rats. Enalapril had no effect on blood pressure, vascular structure, endothelial function or collagen deposition in the vessel wall of DOCA-salt rats.", 
    "787": "Dual inhibition of ACE/NEP in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats resulted in potent anti-hypertensive effects, prevented vascular remodelling and improved endothelial function of resistance arteries. NEP inhibition is involved to a large extent in the effect of omapatrilat in DOCA-salt rats. These actions of omapatrilat may confer protection against end-organ damage characteristic of severe hypertension.", 
    "788": "Salt restriction leads to parallel increases of renin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene expression in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of rat kidneys. Because the upregulation of these genes is strongly enhanced if salt restriction is combined with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, our study aimed to find out whether the juxtaglomerular expressions of renin, COX-2, and nNOS are subject to a common direct negative feedback control by ANG II. For this purpose, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a low-salt diet (0.02% wt/wt) with or without additional treatment with the ANG I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (10 mg x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) for 1 wk, and renocortical renin, COX-2, and nNOS mRNAs were assayed. To narrow down possible indirect effects of the ACE inhibitor that may result from insufficient aldosterone production, the animals received mineralocorticoid substitution with fludrocortisone (6 mg. kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)). Thus mineralocorticoid substitution prevented the fall of systolic blood pressure and of glomerular filtration induced by ramipril in rats on low-salt diet. Although fludrocortisone had no effect on basal renin, COX-2, and nNOS mRNA, it clearly attenuated the threefold increases of both renin and COX-2 mRNA in response to low-salt diet. In rats on low-salt diet, ramipril further increased renin mRNA ninefold, COX-2 mRNA fourfold, and nNOS 2.5-fold in the absence of fludrocortisone. In the presence of fludrocortisone, ramipril increased renin mRNA 10-fold, COX-2 mRNA 2.5-fold, and nNOS mRNA 2.5-fold. These data indicate that mineralocorticoid substitution lowers the overall expression of juxtaglomerular renin and COX-2 during low-salt intake and attenuates a further rise of COX-2 expression by ACE inhibition, but it does not change the stimulatory effect of ACE inhibition on renin and nNOS expression. We conclude that the expression of renin, COX-2, and nNOS in the juxtaglomerular apparatus during low-salt diet is markedly limited by a direct feedback inhibition through ANG II.", 
    "789": "1. In the present study, the antinociceptive action of captopril was investigated, as well as its association with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), in mice under nociceptive stimulation. 2. The modulation of abdominal contortions (writhes) produced by acetic acid was observed in order to evaluate captopril pain stimuli blockade. 3. The administration of captopril produced a significant reduction of nociception, which was further reduced when captopril was associated with TENS. 4. Apparently this increase in the inhibition of nociception was produced by an indirect mechanism, involving opioid liberation by TENS and an enzymatic inhibition induced by captopril and this may lead to clinical applications of captopril and TENS association in pain relief.", 
    "790": "1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin-resistance both experimentally and clinically. We therefore investigated the effects of quinapril, which has high tissue specificity for ACE, regarding the contribution of insulin to vascular contractions, as well as insulin sensitivity in a dietary rat model of insulin resistance. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: (i) rats fed normal chow (normal diet group); (ii) rats fed fructose-rich chow containing 40% fructose and 7% lard (fructose diet group); and (iii) rats fed fructose-rich chow plus quinapril (10 mg/kg per day; quinapril-treated group). 3. After 2 weeks, we evaluated systolic blood pressure, insulin sensitivity as assessed by steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels, response of aortic rings to phenylephrine (10-9 to 10-6 mol/L) in the presence or absence of insulin and the response of aortic rings to acetylcholine. 4. Feeding rats fructose-rich chow resulted in an elevation of blood pressure (P < 0.01) and SSPG levels (P < 0.01). Quinapril treatment significantly prevented increases in both blood pressure and SSPG, with a return to the levels seen in the normal diet group. 5. In the absence of insulin, the maximal contractile response to phenylephrine did not differ between the three groups. However, in the presence of insulin (100 mU/mL), the contractile response to phenylephrine (10-6 mol/L) was reduced by 22.8 +/- 1.2% in the normal diet group, although no insulin effects were observed in the fructose diet group (P < 0.01). Quinapril restored the inhibitory effect of insulin on phenylephrine-induced contractions. 6. In addition, the reduction in relaxation induced by acetylcholine in the fructose diet group was significantly reversed by quinapril treatment. 7. It is concluded that the fructose diet impairs the vasodilator effects of insulin as well as acetylcholine-induced relaxation in rat thoracic aortas. Quinapril prevented deterioration in the responses of the aortic rings, suggesting that ACE inhibitors may be useful for treating vascular insulin resistance.", 
    "791": "In recent years, it has been demonstrated that losartan lowers macroproteinuria in diabetic or non-diabetic renal transplant recipients (RTx) similar to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Microalbuminuria (MAU) may reflect subclinical hyperfiltration damage of the glomerulus. It could be a marker of kidney dysfunction in renal transplantation. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of losartan in hypertensive RTx with MAU. This study was conducted in 17 (M/F: 4/13) stable RTx. No change was made in the medical treatment of the patients. All cases received 50 mg/day losartan therapy for 12 wk. Renal functions and MAU were determined 12 and 6 wk and just before the treatment as well as sixth and twelfth week of the treatment in all patients. Losartan satisfactorily lowered systemic blood pressure. A significant reduction in MAU was observed from 103 +/- 53 microg/min at the beginning to 59 +/- 25 microg/min in the sixth week and 47 +/- 24 microg/min in the twelfth week (p=0.0007 and 0.0005, respectively). From the sixth week of the treatment, the therapy significantly decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit and erythrocyte levels but did not change mean leukocyte and platelet counts, urea, creatinine levels and creatinine clearances. No serious side-effect was observed during the study. In conclusion, we found that losartan decreased MAU in hypertensive RTx. For that reason, it might be considered as the first choise antihypertensive agent for the renoprotection in selected patients.", 
    "792": "Candesartan cilexetil is converted to the angiotensin II receptor antagonist candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The selective and competitive binding of candesartan to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor prevents binding of angiotensin II, a key mediator in the renin-angiotensin system. Significant reductions in systolic BP and diastolic BP are achieved with a once-daily dosage of candesartan cilexetil 2 to 32 mg/day in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In randomised studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 to 16 mg/day was at least as effective as therapeutic dosages of losartan or other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. At a dosage of up to 32 mg/day candesartan cilexetil demonstrated greater antihypertensive efficacy than losartan 50 or 100 mg/day. In comparative trials, candesartan cilexetil demonstrated similar or greater antihypertensive efficacy compared with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide and equivalent efficacy compared with amlodipine. The efficacy of candesartan cilexetil is not affected by age, and the drug provided significant BP reductions in Black patients and in those with severe hypertension. Long-term clinical studies to assess the effects of treatment with candesartan cilexetil on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are ongoing. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy has been seen with candesartan cilexetil treatment in patients with hypertension. Furthermore, the drug has favourable effects on renal function in patients with hypertension with or without coexisting diabetes mellitus. Renal vascular resistance and albumin excretion were reduced following treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism were not affected by treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated and is not associated with cough, a common adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment. A pooled analysis of clinical trials found that the tolerability profile of candesartan cilexetil is not significantly different from that of placebo. Adverse events are not dose-related and are generally of mild to moderate severity.", 
    "793": "Candesartan cilexetil is an effective antihypertensive agent with a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. Comparative data indicate that candesartan cilexetil has antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that of other major classes of antihypertensive agents and has a long duration of action. Therefore, candesartan cilexetil is a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension.", 
    "794": "The present study was designed to examine whether the production of aldosterone from the heart is suppressed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with heart failure. Forty-one patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction were randomly divided into either the perindopril group (n = 21, perindopril 4 mg/day) or the placebo group (n = 20). Plasma levels of aldosterone and ACE activity were measured in the anterior interventricular vein, coronary sinus, and aortic root during cardiac catheterization. The levels of aldosterone as well as ACE activity were significantly higher at the anterior interventricular vein and the coronary sinus than at the aortic root in the placebo group (aldosterone: 92.1 +/- 9.0 vs 70.6 +/- 8.3 pg/ml [p <0.001]; 90.3 +/- 9.2 vs 70.6 +/- 8.3 pg/ml [p <0.001], respectively; ACE activity: 13.6 +/- 0.8 vs 12.2 +/- 0.7 IU/L [p <0.001], 13.4 +/- 0.8 vs 12.2 +/- 0.7 IU/L [p <0.001], respectively). On the other hand, there were no differences in the levels of aldosterone or ACE activity between the anterior interventricular vein and aortic root or between the coronary sinus and aortic root (aldosterone: 68.1 +/- 8.4 vs 69.9 +/- 9.4 pg/ml [p = NS]; 67.3 +/- 8.9 vs 69.9 +/- 9.4 pg/ml [p = NS], respectively; ACE activity: 9.7 +/- 0.8 vs 9.9 +/- 0.8 IU/L [p = NS]; 9.8 +/- 0.8 vs 9.9 +/- 0.8 IU/L, respectively) in the perindopril group. The levels of aldosterone as well as ACE activity were significantly lower at the anterior interventricular vein and coronary sinus in the perindopril group than in the placebo group. The difference in the level of aldosterone between the anterior interventricular vein and aortic root (Delta aldosterone [anterior interventricular vein - aortic root]) had a significant positive correlation with that of ACE activity (Delta ACE [anterior interventricular vein - aortic root]) (r = 0.536, p <0.001), whereas ACE activity in the aortic root had no significant correlation with either the aldosterone levels in the aortic root or Delta aldosterone (anterior interventricular vein - aortic root). Perindopril suppressed cardiac aldosterone production by mainly suppressing cardiac ACE activity in patients with heart failure. Thus, aldosterone production is activated in the failing ventricle and is suppressed by perindopril mainly via the suppression of cardiac ACE activity in patients with heart failure.", 
    "795": "Both derivatization of free captopril in human plasma samples using monobromobimane as fluorescent label and the corresponding HPLC-fluorescence detection (FLD) method were validated. Calibration curve for the fluorescent captopril derivative in plasma samples is linear in the ppb-ppm range with a detection limit of 4 ppb and an identification limit of 10 ppb (P%: 90; nu > or = 5). These methods were successfully applied on bioequivalence studies carried out on some marketed pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "796": "The continuous infusion of 1,3-dipropyl-8-sulfophenylxanthine (DPSPX), a non-selective antagonist of adenosine receptors, causes hypertension and marked cardiovascular structural changes in Wistar rats. Adenosine inhibits noradrenaline and renin release. We investigated the effects of sympathetic denervation, evaluated renin activity and the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in DPSPX-treated rats. Captopril was given (30 or 100 mg kg(-l) day(-l); p.o.) from day -l to day 28. On day 0, constant infusions of DPSPX (90 microg kg(-l) h(-l); i.p.) or vehicle were started. On day 28, fragments of the left ventricle, mesenteric and tail arteries were processed for morphological studies. Plasma renin activity was increased in DPSPX-treated animals. Sympathetic denervation delayed and partially prevented blood pressure rise. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition prevented DPSPX-induced hypertension and morphological changes. Our results, although pointing to the involvement of the sympathetic system, suggest that other mechanisms are involved. We could not differentiate between the trophic and anti-hypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "797": "Chronic heart failure is a common condition with a poor prognosis, usually associated with poor exercise tolerance and debilitating symptoms despite optimal modern therapy. Standard therapy includes diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers. Despite this, many patients remain symptomatic, and interest is high as to whether the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) would offer further advantage to a patient already receiving quadruple therapy. In addition, some patients are intolerant of ACEIs, and for this group the ARBs seem a logical choice. This article reviews the evidence for the use of ARBs as a class in heart failure concentrating on clinical recommendations and clinical needs and evidence rather than purely on statistical issues of significance in trials. The trials to date have demonstrated clearly similar hemodynamic effects to those seen with ACEIs and variety of ancillary benefits such as improvements in endothelial function, anti-thrombotic effects, and effects on neurohormonal inhibition. There is consistent evidence of a preservation of exercise tolerance when patients with heart failure are crossed over from stable ACEI therapy, and when added to ACEIs exercise tolerance appears to increase with ARBs. In terms of major outcomes, the two largest trials, Elite-II and Val-Heft, demonstrate that angiotensin receptor blockers probably have a clinical role in improving mortality and morbidity as an alternative to ACEIs in those patients unable to tolerate these agents, which remain, however, the first choice in unselected patients with heart failure. There is a worrying suggestion of a negative interaction when ARBs are added to beta-blockers, which is a reason for caution in using the ARBs, not a reason not to use beta-blockers.", 
    "798": "Nuclear radiology is valuable in assessing pathophysiology of a variety of organ systems. Pharmacologic interventions are often employed in radionuclide imaging to monitor the physiologic changes, which in turn facilitate the diagnosis. Metoclopramide, erythromycin, and cisapride have been used for gastric emptying studies. To overcome false-negative results, cimetidine, pentagastrin, and glucagon have been used in imaging of Meckel diverticula. Pharmacologic intervention with either cholecystokinin-8 or morphine is used primarily for the assessment of diseases of the gallbladder, common bile duct, and sphincter of Oddi. Pharmacologic interventions performed during renography include diuretic administration, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and aspirin renography. Recombinant thyrotropin can be used in patients with previously treated thyroid carcinoma who require lifelong follow-up for recurrent disease. Cardiac pharmacologic stress agents fall into two categories: coronary vasodilating agents, such as dipyridamole and adenosine, and cardiac positive inotropic agents, such as dobutamine and arbutamine. Measurement of hemodynamic responses to pharmacologic flow augmentation with carbon dioxide or acetazolamide is valuable in cerebrovascular perfusion studies.", 
    "799": "Although on account of their nephroprotective effects, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists appear to be advantageous for patients after renal transplantation, their use in these patients has been limited up to now. This is in part due to the risk of inducing a decrease in the glomerular filtration pressure gradient with subsequent impairment of allograft function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists on renal function, excretion of prostaglandins as a parameter of glomerular hemodynamics and TGF-beta1 plasma levels during an 8-week withdrawal phase in pretreated patients.", 
    "800": "Sixteen patients with stable long-term allograft function undergoing therapy with candesartan (group 1) and 16 patients with stable long-term allograft function undergoing therapy with perindopril (group 2) were included in the study. Any signs of chronic allograft dysfunction were defined as exclusion criteria. Renal function, albuminuria, TGF-beta1 plasma levels as well as the excretion of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin-F-1alpha were monitored during an 8-week withdrawal phase of the angiotensin receptor antagonist or ACE inhibitor, respectively. Normotension was maintained throughout the study period through adjustment of other anti-hypertensive drugs.", 
    "801": "Creatinine clearance as well as TGF-beta1 plasma levels and the excretion of prostaglandins remained unchanged after discontinuation of candesartan or perindopril. However, after withdrawal of the substances a significant increase in albuminuria was noted in both patient groups throughout the observation period. After 8 weeks, median albuminuria had increased by 63% in group 1 and by 163% in group 2.", 
    "802": "We were able to demonstrate that the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists in patients after renal transplantation is safe. Favorable effects of both substances on albuminuria were detectable in patients who showed no signs of chronic allograft dysfunction according to the usual criteria. Therefore, a nephroprotective effect of candesartan as well as of perindopril, is highly probable in patients after renal transplantation. Further investigations regarding routine use in these patients are therefore mandatory.", 
    "803": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a well known zinc-metallopeptidase that converts angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and that degrades bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator, both for regulation of vascular tone and cardiac functions. Other natural substrates of ACE were identified broadening the functions of this enzyme within different physiological contexts such as neuronal metabolism, hematopoiesis, digestion and reproduction. Synthetic substrates were developed for the determination of ACE activity in various biological fluids, mostly human plasma, for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases. After the successful use of captopril, the first ACE inhibitor in the treatment of hypertension, a number of molecules were synthesized and used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and for preventing cardiac impairment after myocardial infarction. This class of antihypertensive drugs benefited from structural data on carboxypeptidases active site, as ACE molecule has not yet been crystallized. In the last two decades ACE gene has been cloned that allowed the identification (i) of two isoenzymes, one called somatic ACE resulting from gene duplication and primarily expressed in endothelial cells, and the other, called germinative or testicular ACE, resulting from the transcription in the male reproductive system of a more simple gene, (ii) of an hydrophobic C-terminal peptide for membrane-anchoring and specifically cleaved by a metalloprotease to release soluble forms of both isoenzymes, and (iii) of several allelic polymorphisms, one of them consisting of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in a short intronic Alu sequence that could account for half the variance in plasma ACE level and resulting in a large inter-individual variability; moreover this I/D polymorphism was proposed as a genetic marker for identifying individuals at high risk of ischemic heart disease and of anticipating in one individual the efficacy of the antihypertensive therapy, although conflicting data arose from the past decade literature. Moreover, ACE gene cloning has confirmed the expression of the enzyme in endothelial cell, in particular as an ecto-enzyme facing the vascular lumen, but not to the same extent with regard to the vascular origin of the cells. Plasma ACE in healthy subjects arises essentially from the endothelium. On the other hand, in granulomatous diseases where a local stimulation of macrophages leads to an abnormal ACE secretion, it can also be found in other biological fluids such as cerebrospinal and broncho-alveolar fluids. Low plasma ACE levels result from endothelium impairment such as in deep vein thrombosis or in endothelio-toxic anticancer therapies. Another cause of low, sometimes undetectable, plasma ACE levels is the use of an ACE inhibitor, but this is without any significance with regard to its clinical benefits. Albeit molecular cloning has provided a number of new details on ACE structure and function, many questions still remain, in particular about its tertiary structure including glycosylations, about its tissue-specific expression and regulation, and also about the exact significance of the I/D polymorphism in cardiovascular pathology including the pharmacogenomic field.", 
    "804": "The kidney and the neurohormonal systems are essential in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF) and the physiologic response. Routine treatment of moderate to severe CHF consists of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-blockade. The need for control of renal function during initiation of ACE-inhibition in patients with CHF is well known. The aim of this study was to investigate whether supplementation by a combined alpha1-beta-blockade to diuretics and ACE-inhibition might improve cardiac function without reducing renal function.", 
    "805": "Fourteen patients treated for moderate to severe CHF with diuretics and ACE inhibitors were investigated at baseline, after 4 months of maximum carvedilol treatment and after withdrawal of carvedilol.", 
    "806": "Carvedilol lowered blood pressure and heart rate but increased left and right ventricular ejection fractions without changing cardiac output or pulmonary blood volume. At the same time, a minor fall was seen in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). but renal blood flow was unchanged and effective renal plasma flow slightly increased. Carvedilol also lowered the plasma levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone. All changes were reversed after withdrawal of carvedilol.", 
    "807": "Carvedilol augments ACE-inhibitor-induced vasodilation by lowering blood pressure, and angiotensin II beside reducing heart rate. The heart adapts to the haemodynamic alterations without changes in cardiac output and pulmonary blood volume. GFR is slightly lowered despite no changes in renal blood flow and a slight increase in effective renal plasma flow. The study emphasizes the need for control of renal function during treatment with carvedilol in patients with CHF.", 
    "808": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in a mouse model of pulmonary hypertension induced by bleomycin. Bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice is mediated by enhanced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) expression in the lung, which determines the murine strain sensitivity to bleomycin, and murine strains are sensitive (C57BL/6) or resistant (BALB/c). Bleomycin induced significant pulmonary hypertension in C57BL/6, but not in BALB/c, mice; average pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 26.4 +/- 2.5 mmHg (P < 0.05) vs. 15.2 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. Bleomycin treatment induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1 and enhanced collagen and TNF mRNA expression in the lung of C57BL/6 but not in BALB/c mice. Double TNF receptor-deficient mice (in a C57BL/6 background) that do not activate NF-kappaB or AP-1 in response to bleomycin did not develop bleomycin-induced pulmonary hypertension (PAP 14 +/- 3 mmHg). Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with enalapril significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the development of pulmonary hypertension after bleomycin exposure. Enalapril treatment inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation, the enhanced TNF and collagen mRNA expression, and the deposition of collagen in bleomycin-exposed C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that ACE inhibitor treatment decreases lung injury and the development of pulmonary hypertension in bleomycin-treated mice.", 
    "809": "With the introduction of more simple screening tests such as the aldosterone/renin ratio, the detection rate of primary aldosteronism has increased considerably. Until now, no reference values have been available for reporting the aldosterone/renin ratio using plasma aldosterone values expressed in SI units (pmol/L) and plasma active renin (ng/L) measured by immunoradiometric assay. We studied 153 subjects who had either normal blood pressure, essential hypertension, or primary aldosteronism. Essential hypertensive patients usually have aldosterone/renin (pmol/L/ng/L) ratios below 100, whereas ratios for patients with primary aldosteronism are above 140. Results that fall between 100 and 140 suggest a need for repeat testing. Patients with elevated aldosterone/renin ratios require confirmatory testing to demonstrate nonsuppressive autonomous aldosterone production. To this end, salt loading is widely used, but this approach may be contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension. The captopril suppression test appears as effective as salt loading in confirming a diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. In addition, the captopril test is safe, well tolerated, and cost-effective.", 
    "810": "Sexual dysfunction has a high prevalence among hypertensive men, and hypertension per se, regardless of drugs, has been suggested to affect sexual function. The available studies have not clarified which factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of sexual dysfunction in hypertensive men. Neurovascular factors, however, seem to be especially important, (in particular defective nitric oxide activity), although hormonal and psychogenic factors cannot be excluded. Further studies are needed to answer the important question of whether erectile dysfunction seen in hypertension may be one expression of vascular disease and target organ damage. The incidence of sexual dysfunction is exacerbated by antihypertensive drug treatment. There is evidence that some classes of drugs, such as diuretics, centrally acting sympatholytic drugs, and b-blockers have a greater impact on sexual function than other classes, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Present evidence on the effects of angiotensin II antagonists is limited, but some data suggest that sexual function in men receiving these drugs not only is not altered, but even improves. Since sexual function is an important aspect of quality of life for the individual, it is important in treating hypertension to ensure that the drugs used have the lowest possible potential for causing sexual problems. This ensures the best balance between therapeutic efficacy and quality of life, which is essential for compliance.", 
    "811": "Several studies have suggested that antihypertensive treatment may promote cancer through unknown mechanisms. Early retrospective studies implicated reserpine in breast cancer, but data from prospective studies and meta-analysis of several case-controlled studies showed only a weak association between reserpine and breast cancer which, although statistically significant, is of little clinical concern. Data from case-controlled studies and several cohort studies suggested an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of renal cell cancer, particularly in women. A recent study showed an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of colon cancer. Several prospective studies showed that treatment with atenolol may increase mortality from malignancy. However, other studies that analyzed data from several thousand patients could not confirm this association. In three prospective and a few case-controlled studies, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were not associated with increased mortality from malignancy. In addition, a recent retrospective study showed that long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had a protective effect against malignancy. Data from three large case-controlled studies and the combined data from eight randomized controlled studies and seven longitudinal studies showed a similar risk for malignancy among users and nonusers of calcium antagonists. Until further data from prospective clinical trials are available, we advise caution about long-term diuretic therapy in women. With regard to other antihypertensive drug classes, we suggest continuing the management of hypertension according to current treatment guidelines with little fear of any substantial cancer risk.", 
    "812": "The treatment of hypertension is proven to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk. Combination drug therapy is becoming recognized as a necessity in most patients with hypertension and kidney disease. Allegations about the safe use of calcium antagonists in patients with kidney disease have led to questions and confusion about their use in this common condition. This article reviews the cardiovascular and renal safety of the long-acting calcium antagonists from studies comparing calcium antagonists with placebo and with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with kidney disease and hypertension. Patients with proteinuria and kidney disease should have their blood pressure brought as close to target (< 130/80 mm Hg) as possible for cardiovascular and renal protection. Lowering blood pressure in this setting will require an average of three antihypertensive agents. In patients with hypertension and proteinuria, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers must be part of the regimen, and calcium antagonists are safe and effective in this condition when used with them in combination.", 
    "813": "Type 2 diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States, and type 2 diabetes has been shown to be a myocardial infarction equivalent in regard to risk of death from a cardiovascular event. Proteinuria is a surrogate marker for renal disease progression, and although data favor both the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in reducing proteinuria, data for renal outcomes, such as time to dialysis, only exist for the ARBs, which clearly increase the duration to dialysis. Conversely, ACE inhibitors have overwhelming data that show substantial risk reduction from cardiovascular events and death in people with type 2 diabetes. Similar data on cardiovascular risk reduction are not yet available with ARBs, although two trials of renal disease progression did have cardiovascular endpoints as secondary outcomes. There were no significant differences between the ARB and control group except for first hospitalization with heart failure, where losartan reduced the risk by 32%, but there was a trend, albeit not significant, toward reduction of myocardial infarction. The first information regarding ARB effects on cardiovascular events as primary outcomes will come from the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension study. Therefore, as of this writing, all patients with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of nephropathy, ie, proteinuria and an elevated creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, should be placed on an ACE inhibitor for cardiovascular risk reduction. If nephropathy is present, the evidence would support an ARB for therapy in concert with a b-blocker for cardiovascular risk reduction and renoprotection.", 
    "814": "The present study aims to objectivate by laser scanning confocal microscopy, the cardiac structure of the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with different doses of spironolactone, either alone or in combination with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or with a calcium channel blocker. Thirty SHRs were divided into six groups and treated during 13 weeks as follows: control, spironolactone (5, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day), spironolactone + enalapril and spironolactone + verapamil. Spironolactone action on the SHR blood pressure (BP) was dose-dependent. The cardiac hypertrophy was affected by the treatment with spironolactone (high dose) or a combination of spironolactone and Enalapril. The myocardial structure was less affected by the spironolactone monotherapy (at all doses) showing hypertrophied cardiac myocytes, focal areas of the reactive fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrate. The treatment with spironolactone in combination with enalapril or verapamil prevented these alterations. In conclusion, the monotherapy with spironolactone had only a limited effect in the preservation of the myocardial structure and in the attenuation of the interstitial fibrosis in SHRs, even after high dose. This action on the myocardium is more efficient when the spironolactone (even in medium dose) was associated with enalapril or verapamil.", 
    "815": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as well as angiotensin II receptor antagonists are able to prevent the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II on the efferent renal vessels, which is believed to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. This effect is assumed to be essential for the demonstration of renovascular hypertension by captopril renography. In this study, renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were compared in patients with a high probability for renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (grade of stenosis >50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan and baseline renography were performed within 48 h using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration before and after intervention was determined and urinary flow was estimated from the urinary output of the hydrated patients. Alterations in renographic curves after intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of the 33 stenosed vessels, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only ten. Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; reduction in blood pressure was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for valsartan and captopril studies, showing suppressed values after intervention in as many as 12 of the 25 patients. Urinary flow after valsartan was higher than after captopril (P<0.05). However, this difference could not explain the markedly higher sensitivity of captopril compared with valsartan in demonstrating renal artery stenosis. In 14 of the 25 patients, blood pressure response to revascularisation was monitored, showing a much better predictive value for captopril renography. It is concluded that captopril renography is much more sensitive than valsartan renography in detecting a clinically significant renal artery stenosis. Furthermore, our data suggest that other effects, such as that on the prostaglandin-bradykinin system, are of at least similar importance to ACE inhibition for the high diagnostic sensitivity of captopril renography regarding renovascular hypertension.", 
    "816": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether a combined treatment of ACE inhibitor and exercise training is more effective than either treatment alone in alleviating the insulin resistant states in the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, a model of type 2 diabetes. OLETF rats (25 weeks old) were randomly divided into 5 groups; sedentary control, exercise-trained, temocapril (ACE inhibitor; 2 mg/kg/day)-treated, with and without exercise, and losartan (AT1 receptor antagonist; 1 mg/kg/day)-treated. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats were used as a non-diabetic control. Body weight, the amount of abdominal fat and blood pressure were higher for OLETF rats than for control rats. However, glucose infusion rate (GIR), an index of insulin resistance, was decreased greatly in OLETF rats. The fasting levels of blood glucose, insulin and lipids were also increased in the diabetic strain. In OLETF rats, both temocapril and losartan reversed hypertensive states significantly, whereas GIR and hyperlipidemia were improved when rats were treated with ACE inhibitors, but not with the AT1 receptor antagonist. Exercise training decreased body weight and the amount of abdominal fat, and also increased GIR in parallel with improved dislipidemia. The combination of the ACE inhibitor with exercise training also improved obesity, hyperinsulinemia, dislipidemia and fasting level of blood glucose, and this combination resulted in the greatest improvement of insulin resistance. These results suggest that the combination of ACE inhibitor and exercise training may be a beneficial treatment for mixed diabetic and hypertensive conditions.", 
    "817": "We review the mechanisms by which arterial hypertension induces target organs damage, particularly the heart, kidney, and vascular endothelium, which is manifested as ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and renal failure and endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, the effect of antihypertensive treatment in these situations is analyzed. Experimental and clinical studies show that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor antagonist drugs are more efficient than other antihypertensive treatments in the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and proteinuria, in delaying kidney damage and improving of endothelial function.", 
    "818": "Heart failure during the immediate period of an acute myocardial infarction constitutes a major insult to this pathology; since, once installed, it is associate to ventricular dysfunction and expansion of the left ventricle. It can appear either early or delayed. Subsequent to the acute insult, the myocardium is subjected to diverse changes in its anatomical conformation and to diastolic and systolic alterations, which will affect the hemodynamic constants of the patient. Changes in the parietal ventricular architecture as well as at the neurohumoral level will also occur. The clinical signs of heart failure are: dyspnea, pallor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, cold skin, oliguria, somnolence, and gallop, which can be observed at the very beginning of the coronary occlusion. Its clinical identification, through in-hospital studies supported by adequate hemodynamic monitoring, is of utter relevance since it will lead to appropriate and fast treatment. The groups of patients with acute myocardial infarction with high risk for the development of cardiac failure are: patients with extensive Q wave infarction, diabetic, patients over 65 years of age, and those with a history of previous myocardial infarction(s). The cornerstone of treatment must be focused on reducing the myocardial ischemia, which can be achieved through the use of modern therapeutics and, given the case, pharmacological agents, coronary intervention procedures, or cardiac surgery must be taken into account. At present it is known that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, betablockers, inotropics, are useful to improve ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "819": "Studies performed in the last five years have led to the knowledge of new mechanisms by which the hypertensive process produces hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis, at the same time, favoring development of the atheroesclerotic plaque. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone axis is relevant by involved in the physiopathology of these alterations, not only by producing hyperplasia and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells or by increasing protein and DNA syntheses, mediated by Angiotensin II (by itself a potent Growth factor) but also through inflammatory processes exerted upon the vascular smooth muscle cells. These alterations (hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque) can now be counteracted by blocking the Angiotensin-Converting enzyme or its AT1 receptors with the consequent improvement in ventricular diastolic functions.", 
    "820": "Treatment strategies for patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction continue to evolve as the complex pathophysiology of this disease is better understood. A number of advances have been made in recent years, most notably the addition of beta-receptor antagonists. In addition, recent studies have provided important information regarding the utility of angiotensin receptor antagonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and natriuretic peptides in the management of heart failure. Nonpharmacologic advances include resynchronization therapy, which appears to confer symptomatic improvement in some patients, and improvements in ventricular assist device technology. As the importance of neurohormonal activation in the progression of heart failure becomes increasingly apparent, new therapeutic strategies targeting these neurohormonal systems are being investigated.", 
    "821": "Activation of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy since they have been shown to mediate cell proliferation, negative inotropic effects and myocardial hypertrophy. However, the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on cytokines in the treatment of heart failure and hypertrophy are unclear.", 
    "822": "To test the hypothesis that systemic immunosuppresion may influence serum and myocardial IL-6 and, thereby, may affect progression of myocardial hypertrophy. We studied the effects of chronic treatment with methotrexate (MTx) and with the ACE inhibitor ramipril on IL-6 in rats with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to aortic banding.", 
    "823": "Animals were treated with either vehicle (n = 6) or methotrexate (MTx 1: 0.3 mg/kg BW/week; MTx 2: 0.9 mg/kg BW/week; i.p.; n = 6 each group) once a week during weeks 4-12 after aortic banding; sham-operated rats served as controls (CTRL; n = 8). During the development of LVH, serum IL-6 was determined by rat-specific ELISA and 12 weeks after aortic banding myocardial IL-6 was measured using a tissue superfusion technique or determining of protein concentration.", 
    "824": "Aortic banding significantly lowered blood pressure, increased left ventricular weight and resulted in elevated serum IL-6 levels (27.6 +/- 5.1 vs 19.1 +/- 2.3 pg/ml, p < 0.05) compared to CTRL. MTx treatment normalised the initially elevated serum IL-6 levels after 8 weeks of treatment. The significant increase in IL-6 concentration in the superfusate of all aortic banding groups compared to CTRL (< 30%, p < 0.05) was not altered by prior MTx therapy. Accordingly, both doses of MTx failed to prevent LVH progression (1.67 +/- 0.23 g vs. 2.32 +/- 0.31 g, p < 0.05). In contrast, chronic inhibition of the RAAS not only prevents LVH but also reduces myocardial IL-6 concentration (6898 +/- 355 vs. 3073 +/- 366 pg/mg protein, p < 0.05).", 
    "825": "Pressure overload LVH in rats is characterized by an increase in serum levels of IL-6 as well as myocardial IL-6. Chronic immunosuppressive therapy normalized systemic IL-6 levels, but failed to reduce cardiac IL-6 expression and the progression of LVH, while ACE inhibition is sufficient to modify LVH and thereby normalises myocardial IL-6 expression.", 
    "826": "All the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are located in the vascular smooth muscle as well as in the heart. In recent years, numerous observations obtained from clinical and experimental models of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, ischaemia, myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy, have suggested that the reduced activity of the local kallikrein-kinin system may be instrumental in the induction of cardiovascular-related diseases. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it an excellent candidate in treating hypertension, and cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable kinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and renal disorders.",

Prescriptions of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors increased during 1990-1995, but during 1996-1998 a significant decrease in primary prescriptions of calcium antagonists was demonstrated (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06-0.36). During all periods, females were more frequently treated with older types of antihypertensive drugs than males. In the analysis of total prescriptions in 1998 women were prescribed calcium antagonists (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.45-0.78) and ACE inhibitors (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.31-0.58) less frequently than men.",

    "831": "Both experimental and clinical studies have shown a role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of heart failure. This seems related to an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Certain categories in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have shown the presence of humoral and cellular immunity activation suggesting a possible relation between myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Recent studies suggest a link between the circulating levels of cytokines (TNF alpha IL-1 et IL-6), the clinical status and prognostic. However, the mechanisms connecting heart failure and cytokine activation are unclear and the sites of cytokines production remain controversial. In the clinical setting, specific measurements of cytokines are not available. As tests of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration appear to have interesting pronostic values. Current conventional therapy i.e. ACE inhibitors, type I angiotensin II antagonist and beta-blockers have shown some anti-cytokine properties. Recently, immunosuppressive therapies have shown their ability to improve symptoms and LV ejection in selected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and clear sign of myocardium inflammation. Specific anti-cytokine therapy have been developed and showed interesting results in preliminary clinical studies. However large clinical trials testing this new therapy have been stoppel prematurely because of deterious effects.", 
    "832": "The ability of organisms to spontaneously develop collateral vessels represents an important response to vascular occlusive diseases that determines the severity of residual tissue ischemia. Neovascularization of ischemic cardiac or skeletal muscle may be sufficient to preserve tissue integrity and/or function, and may thus be considered to be therapeutic. Innovative gene technologies and advances in animal modeling have enabled research scientists to develop therapeutic angiogenesis strategies applied in animal models of limb or myocardial ischemia and in treatment of patients with peripheral vascular obstruction or coronary artery diseases. Several therapeutic strategies have been proposed and tested even at the clinical level. Recent studies have established the feasibility of using recombinant angiogenic growth factors (mainly VEGF and FGF) to enhance angiogenesis in patients with limb or myocardial ischemia. Angiogenesis therapies using cells as a support for growth factor delivery or using endothelial progenitor cells which may directly participate in the angiogenic process have also been developed. Finally, one potential alternative strategy may be the use of drugs with pro-angiogenic activity, available in an oral formulation and which are currently administered to patients for treatment of different pathologies. All strategies of angiogenesis therapy currently being tested have the potential to be effective in the treatment of ischemic disease. However, such strategies may cause harmful side effects which emphasize the need to be aware of the biological effects of each angiogenic agent proposed for clinical studies.", 
    "833": "Very few methods have been shown to change prescribing behaviour. Queensland Rural Medical Support Agency's Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) Program aims to engage rural general practitioners (GPs) in the development of strategies to improve health outcomes in relation to the quality use of medicines. The present paper describes the development of a tool to audit the management of heart failure in rural general practice and to encourage rural GPs to undertake such an audit as a method of continuing medical education. A self-administered retrospective clinical audit of heart failure patients was undertaken by rural and remote GPs. Fourteen doctors undertook the audit, providing data on 270 patient cases. Patient data collected include 30% not receiving adequate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses, 45% of patients who may benefit from a beta-blocker and 14% of patients taking a drug known to aggravate heart failure. The majority of participants would review a patient following the audit and 93% confirmed that the audit assisted them in identifying patients whose heart failure management could be enhanced. The clinical audit provided results and a commentary to allow GPs reflective educational opportunities through the dissemination of results and engagement with appropriate educational organisations (e.g. Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine) to inform the development of educational standards for personal development programs in QUM. Audits must be relevant and practical to meet the learning needs of GPs.", 
    "834": "The proximal tubule synthesizes and secretes angiotensin II into the lumen, where it regulates transport. Renal denervation abolishes the effect of angiotensin II on proximal tubule transport. Using in vivo microperfusion, we examined whether renal nerve stimulation modulates the effect of angiotensin II on transport. The effect of angiotensin II was assessed by measuring the decrease in volume reabsorption with the addition of 10(-4) M luminal enalaprilat. Luminal enalaprilat did not alter volume reabsorption (2.80 +/- 0.18 vs. 2.34 +/- 0.14 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1)). However, with renal nerve stimulation, enalaprilat decreased volume reabsorption (3.45 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.67 +/- 0.20 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.0005). The absolute and percent decrements in volume reabsorption with luminal enalaprilat were higher with renal nerve stimulation than with native innervation (1.78 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.23 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.02, and 51.8 +/- 5.0 vs. 14.6 +/- 7.4%, P < 0.05, respectively). Renal nerve stimulation did not alter the glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. Renal nerve stimulation augments the stimulatory effect of intraluminal angiotensin II. The sympathetic renal nerves modulate the proximal tubule renin-angiotensin system and thereby regulate proximal tubule transport.", 
    "835": "Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension and vascular disease, but whether this represents a causal relationship or an epiphenomenon remains unknown. We recently reported a model of mild hyperuricemia in rats that results in increased blood pressure and mild renal fibrosis. In this study, we examined the effect of hyperuricemia on the renal vasculature. Rats fed 2% oxonic acid and a low-salt diet for 7 wk developed mild hyperuricemia (1.8 vs. 1.4 mg/dl, P < 0.05), hypertension [147 vs. 127 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP), P < 0.05], and afferent arteriolar thickening, with a 35% increase in medial area (P < 0.05). Allopurinol or benziodarone prevented the hyperuricemia, hypertension, and arteriolopathy. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment did not prevent the hyperuricemia or arteriolopathy despite controlling blood pressure. In contrast, the arteriolopathy and hypertension were prevented by both enalapril and losartan. Uric acid also directly stimulated vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro, and this was partially inhibited by losartan. Thus hyperuricemia induces a renal arteriolopathy in rats that is blood pressure independent and involves the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "836": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, defined as a captopril-inhibitable dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity towards 3H-hippurylglycylglycine, was demonstrated in haemolymph, testes and ovaries of the grey fleshfly Neobellieria bullata, hereby suggesting a physiological role for ACE in these particular tissues. While the ACE activity in haemolymph and testes reached relatively high levels, only minute ACE activity could be detected in ovaries throughout the entire vitellogenic cycle. Ovarian extracts of Neobellieria bullata do contain, however, in addition to Neb-TMOF, the Neobellieria bullata trypsin modulating oostatic factor which is an in vitro and a putative in vivo substrate of ACE in circulation, several other heat-stable molecules which individually function either as an ACE substrate or ACE inhibitor. Presumably these ACE interactive factors mask ACE activity in the fly ovaries, as measured by a classic substrate-binding assay. Purification and characterisation of these ACE substrates/inhibitors is in progress and is likely to facilitate the elucidation of the enigmatic physiological relevance of ACE in insects.", 
    "837": "Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists share most but not all of their pharmacological actions with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The latter belong to standard heart failure therapy, with proven benefit in terms of morbidity and mortality. Promising data have been provided for angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists in experimental models of heart failure. In patients with hypertension and those with diabetic nephropathy, favourable results have been observed with regards to blood pressure control, reversibility of structural changes or prevention of progression of disease. The currently available clinical trials in heart failure patients with angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists suggest that they may be equivalent to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but superiority has not been proven. There is no doubt about their effectiveness with regards to symptoms; however, their effect on hospitalisation and mortality is not unequivocally demonstrated. Further trials are warranted, particularly to define their role in comparison with and in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and to further characterise heart failure patient populations who derive benefit from angiotensin II Type 1 receptor blockers above and beyond angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone.", 
    "838": "Despite considerable progress in therapy, the progressive augmentation of lifespan makes cardiac remodelling and its consequence, heart failure, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Heart failure is consequently becoming a major goal in pharmacological research. New approaches include converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and anti-aldosterones and have demonstrated that cardiac remodelling is, at least partly, a reversible process. This review aims to establish a strategy for therapeutic research which is based on the recent advances on the molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodelling, and also to evaluate some of the new developments which are presently in progress, including new inotropic drugs, new receptors or signals blockers, nitric oxide donors, metalloproteinases and apoptotic inhibitors. Our view is clearly evolutionary and several of our conclusions may contradict current opinions, such as those which consider hypertrophy a detrimental process, hormones as a primary cause of cardiac remodelling or inotropic interventions as beneficial.", 
    "839": "Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 are potent endothelium-derived contracting factors. The effects of acute endothelin antagonism on endothelial function in saphenous vein from patients treated with and without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were compared.", 
    "840": "Vascular segments of saphenous vein were obtained perioperatively from 14 patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 29 controls. In vitro endothelium-dependent and -independent responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed by constructing isometric dose-response curves in precontracted rings in the presence and absence of bosentan (endothelinA/B receptor antagonist) and BQ-123 (endothelinA antagonist) using isolated organ baths. Percent maximum relaxation and sensitivity were compared between interventions.", 
    "841": "Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was augmented in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated group (p < 0.005). Both specific and mixed endothelin receptor blockade improved acetylcholine-mediated relaxation in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated and untreated groups (p < 0.02). The effects of these antagonists were endothelium specific as endothelium-independent responses to sodium nitroprusside remain unaltered.", 
    "842": "These data demonstrate that (1) chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves endothelial function in saphenous veins, and (2) this effect can be further augmented by acute endothelin blockade. These data suggest that antagonism of both angiotensin II and endothelin may be important in attenuating saphenous vein arteriosclerosis.", 
    "843": "Many drugs can injure the kidneys, but they cause renal injury via only a few common mechanisms. Many patients who develop renal injury after drug exposure have identifiable risk factors that could be modified or that should preclude the use of these drugs in the first place.", 
    "844": "Recent trials have helped to clarify indications for the initial pharmacological therapy of hypertension. Both the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and World Health Organization-international Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) recommendations should be revised. The more recent trials indicate that: (1) diuretics and beta-blockers appear to be as effective in reducing overall morbidity/ mortality as other agents (Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension [STOP-2], United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS], Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment [INSIGHT], Nordic diltiazem [NORDIL]); (2) the use of an a-blocker results in more cardiovascular events, especially congestive heart failure, when compared with a diuretic (Antihypertensive Therapy and Lipid Lowering Heart Attack Trial [ALLHAT]); (3)the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor results in fewer myocardial infarctions and episodes of heart failure than calcium channel blockers in the elderly and in diabetic patients (Fosinopril vs. Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial [FACET], Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes [ABCD], STOP-2) - other data (Captopril Prevention Project [CAPPP]) suggest that the use of an ACE inhibitor is preferred in diabetic patients; (4) overall cardiovascular events are similar with calcium channel blockers compared with a diuretic - however, there are fewer strokes with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NORDIL) and a trend towards an increase in heart failure and myocardial infarctions with either a dihydropyridine or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers compared with a diuretic (INSIGHT, NORDIL); (5) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) will decrease proteinuria and slow progression of renal disease in type 2 diabetic patients when compared with regimens that do not include an ARB or an ACE inhibitor (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan [RENAAL], Irbesartan Type II Diabetic Nephropathy Trial [IDNT], Irbesartan Type II Diabetes with Microalbuminuria [IRMA Il]). The debate over initial therapy may be moot. High-risk hypertensive patients should probably be treated initially with combination therapy, one of which should be a diuretic. The use of diuretics and beta-blockers as well as ACE-inhibitors alone or with a diuretic should be considered as initial therapy (a change from JNCVI). Alpha-blockers should be reserved for special situations, i.e. prostatic hypertrophy (in contrast to WHO-ISH recommendations). An ACE-inhibitor or ARB, usually along with a diuretic, can be considered as preferred therapy in hypertensive diabetic patients. Some data suggest equal or greater reduction in strokes with a calcium channel blocker than other medications.",

    "846": "A 1-year, prospective, open-label pilot study.", 
    "847": "Rehabilitation hospital.", 
    "848": "Twenty-six consecutive patients older than 15 years with spinal cord injury above T6.", 
    "849": "During an autonomic dysreflexia episode, captopril 25mg was administered sublingually if systolic blood pressure (SBP) was at or above 150mmHg despite the use of nondrug measures. If SBP remained elevated 30 minutes after captopril administration, 1 dose of immediate-release nifedipine 5mg was given as rescue by the bite and swallow method and repeated, if necessary, in 15 minutes.", 
    "850": "SBP 30 minutes after captopril administration at initial autonomic dysreflexia episode.", 
    "851": "A total of 33 autonomic dysreflexia episodes were documented, of which 18 episodes in 5 patients were treated with drug therapy. Captopril alone was effective in 4 of 5 initial episodes (80%). Mean SBPs at baseline and 30 minutes after captopril were 178+/-18mmHg and 133+/-28mmHg, respectively. There were no cases of reactive hypotension. The addition of nifedipine successfully reduced SBP in the remaining patient. Of the combined 18 initial and repeat autonomic dysreflexia episodes, 94% were successfully treated with our protocol.", 
    "852": "Captopril appears to be safe and effective for autonomic dysreflexia management.", 
    "853": "Somatic angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) contains two functional active sites. Up to now, most of the studies aimed at characterizing the selectivity of inhibitors toward the two ACE active sites relied on the use of ACE mutants containing a single functional active site. By developing new fluorogenic synthetic substrates of ACE, we demonstrated that inhibitor selectivity can be assessed directly by using somatic ACE. This useful screening approach led us to discover that some bradykinin potentiating peptides turned out to be selective inhibitors of the C-domain of ACE. The peptide pGlu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro-Lys-Ile-Pro-Pro, with K(i)(app) values of 30 nM and 8 microM, respectively, for the C- and N-domain of ACE, is to our knowledge the most highly selective C-domain inhibitor of ACE so far reported. Inhibitors able to block selectively either the N- or C-domain of ACE will represent unique tools to probe the function of each domain in the regulation of blood pressure or other physiopathological events involving ACE activity.", 
    "854": "In all cardiovascular disease, there is an imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems that favours vasoconstriction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors help to redress this imbalance. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and, by blocking the metabolism of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors upregulate nitric oxide and prostacycline. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is the major enzymatic pathway for the degradation of natriuretic peptides and adrenomedullin, and is a secondary enzymatic pathway for the degradation of kinins. Thus, inhibition of NEP increases levels of natriuretic and vasodilatory peptides. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs), by simultaneously inhibiting ACE and NEP, reduce vasocontriction and enhance vasodilation; thus, they improve local blood flow, and improve sodium and water excretion. In addition, they likely reduce growth, fibrosis, coagulability, adhesive molecule expression and monocyte adhesion, and inflammation in the vasculature and the heart. In clinical studies, they have proven to be very effective in treating hypertension. The major side effect of the drugs appears to be angioedema. Thus, VPIs are promising new drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "855": "Biventricular pacing improves left ventricular dysynchrony, leading to improvement in congestive heart failure symptoms. The extent of placebo effect, the predictors of response and the long term benefits are unknown.", 
    "856": "Forty-five patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure underwent implantation of a biventricular pacing system over a 30-month period (age 65 10 years, 37 men). Patients underwent implantation of a biventricular pacemaker or implantable defibrillator one month or longer after stabilization of congestive heart failure on maximal medical therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 84% of patients and beta-blockers in 56% of patients. Three patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II heart failure, 34 had NYHA class III and eight had NYHA class IV. Cardiomyopathy was ischemic in 31 patients, dilated in 12 and the result of other causes in two. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 19 5%.", 
    "857": "Implantation of the biventricular pacing system was successful in 38 of 45 patients (84%). Two patients had successful implantation with a second attempt, and one patient had an epicardial lead implant. Lead dislodgement occurred in four patients, with successful repositioning in all. During a mean follow-up of 10 7 months, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire quality of life index score improved from 62 16 to 42 22 at one month (P<0.001), but subsequently returned to intermediate levels (55 26 at three months, 48 26 at six months and 56 34 at one year, P=0.50). In seven patients with deferred device activation, quality of life scores also improved by 10 15 points from baseline to one month with VDI 35 pacing, and improved a further 15 20 points with left ventricular lead activation. The mean NYHA class fell from 3.1 0.5 at baseline to 2.7 0.7 at one month (P=0.006) and remained stable thereafter (2.8 0.9 at three months, 2.8 0.9 at six months). Six patients died during follow-up, one patient had a cardiac transplantation and subsequently died, one patient had a successful cardiac transplantation and one patient underwent insertion of a left ventricular assist device. Death occurred due to progressive heart failure in five patients, sudden death occurred in one patient and a noncardiovascular cause resulted in the death of one patient. An analysis of NYHA responders (NYHA class improvement of 1 or more at last follow-up, 44% of patients) and quality of life responders (score improvement of 10 or more at last follow-up, 57% patients) did not show any difference in age, sex, heart failure etiology, QRS width, ejection fraction or baseline NYHA class.", 
    "858": "Biventricular pacing improves quality of life and NYHA class in patients with advanced heart failure and intraventricular conduction delay. The attenuated benefit seen over time may be related to initial placebo effect or simple dual- chamber pacing, or the natural history of the underlying disease. Identification of patients most likely to respond to biventricular pacing was not possible.", 
    "859": "Scientific evidence currently available supports the concept that renin-angiotensin blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as a first-line treatment exhibits in arterial hypertension beneficial effects in the prevention of mortality and morbidity comparable to those achieved with diuretics and beta-blockers. In addition, the renin-angiotensin blockade has also proved to be beneficial in the secondary prevention of several complications of hypertensive disease such as after myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, as well as in the prevention of the incidence of type 2 diabetes, and the progression of diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. In this later regard, recent evidence with angiotensin II receptor antagonists in reducing the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes strongly confirms that antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system is an effective approach to cardiovascular and renal disease. Finally, the renin-angiotensin blockade in high-risk patients may reduce cardiovascular mortality independently of the effect on blood pressure (BP). The effect of other antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular risk in patients with high-normal BP should be investigated to establish whether they exhibit a comparable effect or whether there is a class-related benefit of drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Such a strategy could also be encouraged to design future interventional studies with the newer classes of compounds (angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonists, vasopeptidase inhibitors, endothelin antagonists), which would have the additional potential advantage of providing information more easily transferable to large-scale clinical practice.", 
    "860": "We measured the effects of angiotensin II blockade on arterial stiffness, augmentation index (AI%), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and blood pressure (BP) in 12 hypertensive patients (mean 49 +/- 11 years) in a 4-week, randomized, cross-over study comparing valsartan 160 mg/day with captopril 100 mg/day, with a 2-week washout period. Subsequently both therapies were combined. Reductions in PWV and AI% remained significant when corrected for BP. Combined therapy reduced PWV and AI% (P < .05) more than monotherapy, even when corrected for BP. The study shows that angiotensin receptor antagonists reduce arterial stiffness in hypertension comparable with and possibly additive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "861": "This study compared the effects of losartan and perindopril on plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.", 
    "862": "We studied 85 nonsmoking outpatients, aged 46 to 64 years, with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] > 90 and < 110 mm Hg) and well controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. After a 4-week washout placebo period, patients were randomized to received perindopril 4 mg once daily (n = 42) or losartan 50 mg once daily (n = 43) for 12 weeks according to a double-blind, parallel-group design. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, BP was measured and plasma PAI-1 and fibrinogen were evaluated.", 
    "863": "Both perindopril and losartan reduced systolic and diastolic BP values (-16/15 mm Hg and -15/14, respectively; P < .001 v placebo), with no difference between the two treatments. Plasma PAI-1 was reduced by perindopril (-10 ng/dL, P = .028 v placebo) but not by losartan (+4 ng/dL, NS), the difference between the two treatments being statistically significant (P < .01). Plasma fibrinogen showed no significant change with both drugs, although a decreasing trend was noted with perindopril.", 
    "864": "These findings indicate that perindopril but not losartan decreases PAI-1 in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, which suggests that the PAI-1 lowering effect is unrelated with AT, receptor blockade and could rather be due to the fact that the endothelial receptors that mediate PAI-1 expression in response to angiotensin II are not type 1 receptor subtypes. Different effects of the two drugs on the bradykinin system might also be implicated.", 
    "865": "Finding the optimal combination of drugs in the correct dosages, which requires careful monitoring over time, is key to slowing the disease process and prolonging life. For most patients, treating heart failure involves correcting underlying left ventricular dysfunction, thereby slowing the remodeling process."
