    "0": "The deletion (D) allele of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is strongly associated with an increased level of circulating ACE. The ACE gene polymorphism may influence the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). It has been shown that Ang II modulates fibrinolysis, that is, Ang II increases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA and plasma PAI-1 levels in vitro and in vivo. Considered together, we tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene might be associated with increased levels of PAI-1. We related the ACE genotype to PAI-1 antigen levels in 603 men and 221 women attending a routine health screening. As a whole, the plasma PAI-1 level was not strongly associated with ACE genotype. Since the PAI-1 level was significantly influenced by well-known risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), we further analyzed the data after excluding subjects with major cardiovascular risk factors. In low-risk male subjects, the DD genotype had significantly higher levels of plasma PAI-1 (DD: 20.3 +/- 2.2; DI: 13.9 +/- 1.1; II: 13.6 +/- 1.3 ng/mL, P = .010 by ANOVA). In low-risk female subjects, the DD genotype showed a tendency to a high level of plasma PAI-1 without statistical significance. When analysis was restricted to postmenopausal women (age > or = 55 or FSH > or = 35 ng/mL), the DD genotype showed a significantly higher level of PAI-1 than subjects with the DI and II genotypes (27.7 +/- 6.2 versus 15.6 +/- 1.8 ng/mL, P = .028). The DD polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with high PAI-1 levels in male and possibly in postmenopausal female subjects who have lower conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These results suggest that the increased ACE activity caused by DD polymorphism may play an important role in elevating the level of plasma PAI-1. Our data support the notion that the genetic variation of ACE contributes to the balance of the fibrinolytic pathway.", 
    "1": "We previously showed that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition prevented the increase in aortic collagen in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) independently of blood pressure reduction. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the effects of ACE inhibition on aortic fibrosis were due to inhibition of angiotensin II formation, preservation of bradykinin, or a combination of both. Four week-old SHRs were treated for 4 months with the ACE inhibitor quinapril, quinapril with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140, or the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist CI996. Control SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats received a placebo for the same period of time. At the end of the treatment, as compared to conscious SHR and WKY controls, quinapril completely prevented the development of hypertension, whereas quinapril-Hoe 140 and the AT1 receptor antagonist produced only a partial reduction of blood pressure. In relation with blood pressure changes, aortic hypertrophy was significantly prevented by quinapril but not by quinapril-Hoe 140 or CI996. In contrast, aortic collagen accumulation was completely prevented by all three treatments. The study provides evidence that in young live SHRs, the prevention of aortic collagen accumulation is independent of blood pressure changes and bradykinin preservation and involves exclusively angiotensin II inhibition through AT1 receptors.", 
    "2": "In several situations, placebo-controlled trials may be difficult to conduct. This article discusses the reasons for such difficulty--principally, a belief that the effect of a therapy has already been established or the existence of another therapy already proved effective. In the latter case, an active control equivalence trial may be considered, but this design has important deficiencies in many situations, notably, the lack of assurance of assay sensitivity.", 
    "3": "The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, adverse effects, drug interactions, dosage, cost, and therapeutic interchange of oral angiotension-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. ACE inhibitors attenuate the formation of angiotension II and may lead to the accumulation of kinins. Although the hypotensive effects of many ACE inhibitors may persist for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, but it is unclear whether dosage adjustments are necessary. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate hypertension; for severe hypertension, additional anti-hypertensive agents may be necessary. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal insufficiency, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common adverse effect is a persistent nonproductive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia may also occur. ACE inhibitors may interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic agents, and some other drugs. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated with low doses that may then be slowly adjusted upward. Many of the agents have similar costs for lower and higher dosages. The only significant differences among the ACE inhibitors are the time of onset of hypotensive effects, time to peak effect, and duration of effect. Each formulary should include, at least, captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.", 
    "4": "We compared the outcome of lifelong treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramipril in young prehypertensive stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Ramipril was given in an antihypertensive and subantihypertensive dose. In addition to the primary end point, lifespan, surrogate parameters such as cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac function and metabolism, and endothelial function were studied.", 
    "5": "One-month-old SHR-SP and WKY rats, 135 of each, were randomized into 3 groups. Each group was treated via drinking water with an antihypertensive high dose of ramipril (HRA, 1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), a nonantihypertensive low dose of ramipril (LRA, 10 microg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), or placebo. Body weight and blood pressure were determined every 3 months. Molecular, biochemical, and functional data were assessed in SHR-SP and WKY rats after 15 and 30 months, respectively. These were the times when approximately 80% of the corresponding placebo group had died. Early-onset long-term ACE inhibition with HRA doubled lifespan to 30 months in SHR-SP, which was identical to the lifespan of placebo-treated normotensive WKY rats. LRA treatment prolonged lifespan from 15 to 18 months. In SHR-SP, left ventricular hypertrophy was completely prevented by HRA but not by LRA treatment. Cardiac function and metabolism as well as endothelial function were significantly improved by both doses of ramipril. Carotid expression of endothelial NO synthase was moderately enhanced, whereas cardiac ACE expression and activity were decreased to values of placebo-treated WKY rats.", 
    "6": "Lifelong ACE inhibition doubles lifespan in SHR-SP, matching that of normotensive WKY rats. This effect correlated with preservation of endothelial function, cardiac function/size, and metabolism. Thus, these data predict a beneficial outcome on survival in high-risk patients with hypertension and associated cardiovascular diseases by ACE inhibition.", 
    "7": "Blockade of type 1 angiotensin (Ang) II receptors combined with ACE inhibition may amplify the efficacy of the renin-angiotensin system blockade because ACE inhibitors do not completely and permanently suppress Ang II production.", 
    "8": "Enalapril or losartan (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) or their combination was administered for 2 to 4 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats. The combination of low doses of each agent induced greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/ BW) ratio than monotherapy with the same or higher doses. When approximately equipotent regimens of enalapril, losartan, and their combination, as judged by BP fall, were compared, there were similar increases in plasma and renal renin and in plasma Ang-(1-7) and Ang I and similar reductions in plasma angiotensinogen. Enalapril alone reduced plasma Ang II levels, and losartan alone increased Ang II levels. The combination of enalapril with losartan prevented or reduced the increase in Ang II levels observed with losartan alone.", 
    "9": "These findings show that the synergistic interaction between the effects of low doses of enalapril and losartan on BP and LVW/BW ratio is due to more effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by their combination than by either agent alone. When both drugs are given together, the ACE inhibitor-induced fall in plasma Ang II results in modulation of the Ang II antagonist-induced reactive rise in Ang II, thereby lowering the plasma Ang II concentration, which competes with the antagonist for the Ang II receptors.",

In contrast, 0.001-0.1 micromol/l bradykinin enhanced the release of noradrenaline in rat atrium. In the presence of 3 micromol/l of the ACE inhibitor captopril, however, bradykinin significantly enhanced the release of noradrenaline in human atrium. The bradykinin B1-receptor agonist (Des-Arg9)-bradykinin (0.01-1 micromol/l) had no effect on the release of noradrenaline in human atrium both in the absence and in the presence of 3 micromol/l captopril. Captopril (3 micromol/l) potentiated the facilitatory effect of bradykinin in rat atrium. The selective bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5, D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin (Hoe 140, 0.3 micromol/l) and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 micromol/l) reduced the facilitatory effect of bradykinin significantly in the presence of captopril in rat and human atrium. Prostaglandin F2alpha (0.1 micromol/l), prostaglandin E2 (0.3 micromol/l) and the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U-46 619 (0.1 micromol/l) enhanced the release of noradrenaline in human atria, whereas 0.1 micromol/l prostaglandin I2 had no effect.",

    "33": "The density of [125I]-amylin binding was reduced by approximately 50% in Sprague-Dawley and subtotally nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats after treatment with perindopril. These changes were associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure and an increase in plasma renin activity. In contrast, amylin binding in the perindopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats was not reduced, despite the prevention of a rise in systolic blood pressure and an increase in plasma renin activity.", 
    "34": "These findings provide further evidence for the hypothesis that there is an association among renal amylin binding, the renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure for rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain. In contrast, the lack of an effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on renal amylin binding for rats of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain is consistent with previous findings that the changes in amylin binding in rats of this strain are not linked directly to the prevailing systemic blood pressure but may be associated with a developmental abnormality in the kidney of these rats.", 
    "35": "The mechanisms precipitating sudden cardiac death may be ischemic, electrical, or mechanical. Activation of the autonomic nervous system leads to an increase in sympathetic tone, increasing blood pressure, shear forces, heart rate, platelet aggregation, and blood viscosity while decreasing heart-rate variability and lowering the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Such changes increase the likelihood of plaque rupture or erosion and platelet aggregation, resulting in ischemic or electrical sudden cardiac death. Management of benign ventricular arrhythmias should consist largely of abstinence from sympathetic nervous system stimulants; when pharmacotherapy is required, beta-adrenergic blockers are the agents of choice. Optimal therapy for potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias is not yet firmly established for amiodarone and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use; however, appropriate secondary prevention utilizes aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and revascularization procedures. Currently, ICDs are established as a first-choice intervention for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, while the adjunctive and independent use of beta-blocker therapy and amiodarone is undergoing further investigation.", 
    "36": "Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have central roles in vascular adaptive processes. Stimulation of the 2 systems has been demonstrated in a range of cardiovascular disorders, including congestive heart failure and hypertension. However, elucidation regarding the interactions of the many factors involved in these 2 systems is lacking. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used to reveal the contribution of some elements in the RAAS. Until relatively recently, little was known about the specific disturbances of the sympathetic nervous system in cardiovascular disease. Plasma norepinephrine levels, an indicator of sympathetic activity, have limited value because they are affected by various physiologic processes in addition to sympathetic activation. Newer approaches to the assessment of neurohormonal activity include the determination of the power content of heart-rate variability. More specific probes may lead to a better comprehension of neurohormonal physiology in health and disease and underlie future therapeutic advances targeted to prevention and treatment of specific syndromes.", 
    "37": "Mibefradil is the first of a new class of calcium antagonists with a unique structure and pharmacology. Its novel mechanism of action is characterized by L-type and selective T-type calcium channel blockade. Mibefradil is selective for smooth muscle over cardiac muscle and selectively dilates the coronary vasculature over the peripheral vasculature. In animal studies, mibefradil increases coronary blood flow during induced ischemia. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated that mibefradil decreases smooth muscle proliferation in response to vascular injury. The most intriguing effects of mibefradil include a lack of negative inotropy and reflex tachycardia, as well as inhibition of pathologic hypertrophy and remodeling in response to vascular injury. In clinical trials, mibefradil (100 mg) was more effective than diltiazem dual-release capsules (360 mg) and as effective as amlodipine (10 mg) in treating mild-to-moderate hypertension; mibefradil (100 mg) also resulted in a greater reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure than did nifedipine GITS (60 mg) in patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension. In patients with chronic stable angina, mibefradil (100 mg) was as effective as diltiazem SR capsules (120 mg) twice daily and more effective than amlodipine (10 mg) in improving exercise tolerance and reducing ischemic episodes. Mibefradil improved survival in a rat model of heart failure as effectively as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril. The apparent lack of negative inotropic activity and neurohormonal activity with mibefradil, as well as its favorable effects on cardiac remodeling in experimental models, suggest that this agent may be beneficial in congestive heart failure. This hypothesis is being tested in the ongoing Mortality Assessment in Congestive Heart Failure (MACH-1) trial.",

However, the effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers on LV remodelling after reperfused MI have not been compared.",

Both enalapril and amlodipine reduced the rate pressure product, but decreases in mean arterial and left atrial pressures were more sustained over six weeks with enalapril. Compared with controls over six weeks, both enalapril and amlodipine preserved LV volumes, global ejection fraction, regional function and infarct segment length, but enalapril blocked the increase in non-infarct wall thickness, attenuated the infarct wall thickness, preserved shape and decreased global LV mass more than amlodipine. Sham-operated dogs (n = 3) showed no significant structural changes.",

    "42": "We assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in Lyon genetically hypertensive (LH) and normotensive (LN) rats by measuring 1) kidney renin and prorenin contents; 2) effects of early, prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on blood pressure (BP) and regional hemodynamics; and 3) acute and chronic responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) and norepinephrine (NE). At the adult age, LH rats differed from LN rats by elevated BP, left ventricle weight, and vascular resistances, especially in the kidneys, associated with lower kidney renin and prorenin contents. ACE inhibition (perindopril, 3 mg.kg-1.24 h-1 orally from 3 to 15 wk of age) suppressed the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and the increase in renal vascular resistances. No specific hypersensitivity to ANG II could be disclosed in acute conditions. In perindopril-treated LH rats, a 4-wk infusion of ANG II (200 ng.kg-1.min-1) but not of NE (1,000 ng.kg-1.min-1) restored hypertension, mimicked the hemodynamic alterations seen in untreated LH rats, and produced a brief sodium retention. It is concluded that in LH rats, despite a low basal renin secretion, hypertension and hemodynamic abnormalities 1) are fully dependent on an active RAS and 2) may involve an enhanced sensitivity to the chronic effects of ANG II.", 
    "43": "Over 400,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) annually. The 3 major causes of acute cardiac hospitalizations in the United States--CHF, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction--all reflect a failure to prevent progression of established cardiovascular disease. More effective treatment strategies for CHF should be directed at preventing rehospitalization through modification of cardiac risk factors. Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, while considered preferred therapy, are routinely underutilized by all healthcare practitioners. Digoxin has also been shown in several clinical trials to reduce the need for rehospitalization in CHF patients. Finally, patients' quality of life and the morbidity associated with CHF can be reduced through well-structured disease management programs in conjunction with ACE inhibitor and digoxin therapy.", 
    "44": "Chronic heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting >4 million people. The increasing prevalence of HF has placed an enormous burden on the US healthcare system. For many patients with cardiovascular disease, HF is the final common pathway. Treatment strategies for HF are aimed at preventing and delaying progression of the disease and ultimately improving survival. This article reviews recent clinical drug trials for HF, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, vasodilators, beta-adrenergic blockers, positive inotropic agents, calcium antagonists, and antiarrhythmics. The benefits and shortcomings of these agents and the study designs are discussed. For patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors are the only agents that consistently improved survival and decreased the rate of HF progression. It is likely that beta-adrenergic blockers have the same effect. The syndrome of HF is complex with both peripheral and cardiac factors contributing to disease progression. The addition of a diuretic and/or digoxin is often needed to prevent worsening heart failure. Although an angiotensin II antagonist may also be beneficial in the treatment of HF, further studies are needed to clarify their precise role in the management of this condition. Calcium anatagonists, antiarrhythmics excluding amiodarone, and positive inotropes other than digoxin do not appear to prevent progression of HF nor improve survival. The most common cause of HF in the United States is related to coronary artery disease. Reduction of cardiac risk factors, such as smoking cessation, lowering serum cholesterol with diet and a lipid lowering agent, and blood pressure control, is likely to prevent the development or progression of HF.",

The choice of initial pharmacological therapy is one area where the different hypertension management guidelines vary in recommending either the use of diuretics and beta-blockers as preferred drugs or choosing from any of the five major classes of antihypertensives. 2. Improvement in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may have been shown most conclusively with diuretics and beta-blockers, but the effects on coronary events with these drugs were less than predicted and the other agents have a number of theoretical advantages. 3. Recent worries regarding the possible adverse effects of calcium antagonists have led to a reappraisal of the risks and benefits of these drugs and antihypertensives in general. 4. Many patients, particularly the elderly, have other conditions that influence the choice of first-line therapy and ethnic variations in the effects of hypertension or the efficacy or side effects of drugs should also be taken into account. 5. There is considerable heterogeneity within the major categories of antihypertensive drugs, so it is important to distinguish the different subgroups, dosages and formulations that may be used.", 
    "46": "The renin-angiotensin system is associated with a variety of pathophysiological processes in many organ systems, and is known to be involved in the normal regulation of blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension. Angiotensin II is a multifunctional hormone that manifests its properties by interacting with two major subtypes of cell surface receptors (AT1 and AT2). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to modify the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, and are indicated for the treatment of hypertension and heart disease. The antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibiting drugs are related to their ability to block the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the potent pressor octapeptide, angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors have been implicated in fetopathies in humans and perinatal mortality in rats, rabbits, sheep and baboons. Human fetopathies were seen when ACE inhibitors were given around the 26th week of gestation. The major adverse effects in babies include: oligohydramnios, renal tubular dysgenesis, neonatal anuria, calvarial and pulmonary hypoplasia, mild to severe intrauterine growth retardation, persistent patent ductus arteriosus and fetal or neonatal death. These developmental anomalies are thought to be partly due to a direct action of ACE inhibitors on the fetal renin-angiotensin system and partly due to the ischemia resulting from maternal hypotension and decreases in fetal-placental blood flow and oxygen/nutrient delivery to the fetus. The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss the pathophysiological role of the renin-angiotensin system, the therapeutic uses of ACE inhibitors in pregnant patients and to focus primarily on the major fetotoxic effects of ACE inhibitors encountered in humans and animal models. I will also review our recent data which show that capozide (captopril + hydrochlorothiazide) not only produces oligohydramnios but also disturbs the balance of glucose and NaCl in the maternal plasma and amniotic fluid of the rat.", 
    "47": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of captopril on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) of normoalbuminuric normotensive insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients with and without glomerular hyperfiltration. Eleven normoalbuminuric (UAER < 30 micrograms/min) patients (age: 34.3 +/- 4.6 years: diabetes duration: 9.5 +/- 6.4 years) participated in the study. Six patients were considered to be hyperfiltering (GFR > or = 134 ml/min/ 1.73m2). GFR (51Cr-EDTA single injection technique), extracellular volume (ECV; distribution volume of 51Cr-EDTA), UAER (RIA) and metabolic and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline, after 6 weeks on captopril (25 mg p.o. twice daily) and after 6 weeks off captopril. Plasma renin activity (PRA; RIA), plasma aldosterone (RIA) and blood volume (51Cr red cell labeled) were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks on captopril. The baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of hyperfiltering and normofiltering IDDM patients were similar.

No difference in blood volume (60.8 +/- 10.4; 62.3 +/- 8.4 ml/kg) or plasma aldosterone (10.4 +/- 4.9; 7.7 +/- 3.8 ng/dl) was observed between baseline values and values after captopril use. PRA increased (2.4 [0.4-22.1]; 12.9 [2.2-41.1]ng/ml/h) at the end of 6 weeks on captopril (P = 0.002). Fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, plasma cholesterol and potassium, 24 h urinary urea and sodium were similar during the study. These results were unchanged when patients with and without hyperfiltration were analyzed as separate groups. From baseline to the end of 6 weeks on captopril there was no correlation between change in GFR and change in glycated hemoglobin (r = 0.02, P = 0.96), systolic (r = 0.23; P = 0.49) and diastolic (r = -0.32, P = 0.32) blood pressure, urinary urea (r = 0.21; P = 0.53) and UAER (r = -0.16; P = 1.00). In conclusion, captopril has no effect on the GFR and UAER of normoalbuminuric normotensive IDDM patients irrespective of the presence of glomerular hyperfiltration.", 
    "48": "The effect of activating the renin-angiotensin system on the metabolism of angiotensins (ANGs) in normotensive human plasma was investigated. In normotensive supine human plasma, four peptides with in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity which correspond to the sequence of ANG (3-8), ANG (4-8), ANG (5-8), and ANG (3-4) existed at a concentration of > 39 fmol/ml of plasma. When activating the renin activity by keeping upright in posture for 60 min, ANG II and the four peptides significantly increased as compared with the levels in the supine posture, except for ANG I. In particular, Val-Tyr corresponding to ANG (3-4) in the upright posture was about 4-fold more than the value in the supine posture, and was predominantly present (447 fmol/ml of plasma) as well as ANG I. As a result of in vitro degradation tests on ANGs, ANG (3-4) was produced from ANG I, and not from ANG II, III or (3-8), during the 30-min incubation.", 
    "49": "After a period of stable hypertrophy, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop heart failure between 18 to 24 months of age, with depression of active myocardial function and increased passive stiffness. We tested the hypothesis that chronic ACE inhibition by captopril would prevent and possibly reverse impairment of myocardial function.", 
    "50": "Male SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were assigned to no treatment or captopril treatment (2 g/L in drinking water) begun at ages 12, 18, and 21 months; animals were studied at 24 months of age, or earlier when evidence of heart failure was found in SHR (mean age, 19+/-2 months). In an additional group, captopril treatment was begun when SHR developed heart failure; surviving animals were studied at 24 months of age. In untreated SHR, relative to WKY, isometric stress development at Lmax, maximum rate of stress development, and shortening velocity were depressed, whereas passive stiffness was increased, in association with the development of myocardial fibrosis. In the SHR treated before cardiac dysfunction, captopril administration attenuated hypertrophy and prevented contractile dysfunction, fibrosis, and increased passive stiffness. Captopril treatment begun after cardiac function was impaired reduced left ventricular hypertrophy but did not restore intrinsic contractile function or reduce fibrosis or passive stiffness.", 
    "51": "In the male SHR, early treatment with captopril was associated with the most marked attenuation of dysfunction relative to the untreated SHR. Treatment initiated after the onset of heart failure improved clinical signs of heart failure and decreased left ventricular hypertrophy in surviving animals but did not reverse the fibrosis and contractile dysfunction associated with heart failure.", 
    "52": "We have shown previously that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent coronary vascular remodeling (medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis) and myocardial remodeling (fibrosis and hypertrophy) in rats induced by long-term inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with oral administration of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). ACE inhibitors inhibit both the formation of angiotensin II and the catabolism of bradykinin. In this study, we aimed to determine the relative contribution of the latter two mechanisms to the beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor on structural remodeling. First, we examined the effects of the ACE inhibitor temocapril and the angiotensin II AT1 subtype receptor antagonist CS-866 on the structural remodeling induced by administering L-NAME for 8 weeks. Temocapril and CS-866 were equally effective in preventing remodeling. Second, we examined whether the effect of temocapril on the remodeling induced by L-NAME was reduced by the bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE140. The latter drug did not alter the beneficial effect of temocapril on remodeling. In conclusion, although species differences must be considered to apply our conclusion to clinical conditions, the present results suggest that the inhibition of angiotensin II activity, mediated via the AT1 receptors, is responsible for the beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor in our animal model of coronary vascular and myocardial remodeling induced by the long-term inhibition of NO synthesis.", 
    "53": "Surgical ablation of renal mass leads to a reduction in kidney function and commonly to the development of hypertension and chronic renal failure (CRF) in rats. The objective of this study was to determine whether endothelin (ET)-1 is involved in the maintenance of the hypertension that accompanies loss of renal mass. First, we demonstrated the antihypertensive efficacy of PD 155080, a selective, orally active ET(A) receptor antagonist, in a group of rats made hypertensive by continuous intravenous infusion of ET-1 (2.5 pmol x kg(-1) x min[-1]) for 7 days. ET-1 produced a sustained hypertension and PD 155080 (56.4 micromol/kg [25mg/kg] BID PO) normalized blood pressure (BP) during the 5 days of drug administration. In a second experiment, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5/6 reduction in renal mass (RRM); 4 weeks later, PD 155080 administered for 7 days resulted in a sustained reduction in BP. Sham-operated rats also showed a slight hypotensive response to PD 155080 administration. Plasma urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, urinary protein excretion, and creatinine clearance were not altered by PD 155080 administration in RRM or sham rats. In a third experiment, we investigated the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to BP control in RRM rats given PD 155080. In these rats, PD 155080 reduced BP during 5 treatment days, and this antihypertensive effect was not altered by coadministration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in the drinking water (508 micromol/L [250 mg/L]). These results demonstrate that (1) ET-1 plays a role in established RRM hypertension through activation of the ET(A) receptor subtype, (2) lowering blood pressure with PD 155080 in RRM rats does not adversely affect renal function, and 3) the antihypertensive effect of ET(A) receptor antagonism is not opposed by the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "54": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mesenchyme-derived pleiotropic factor that regulates cell growth, cell motility, and morphogenesis of various types of cells, and is thus considered a humoral mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions responsible for morphogenic tissue interactions. We have previously reported that HGF is a novel member of endothelium-specific growth factors whose serum concentration is positively associated with blood pressure in humans. Therefore, we speculated that serum HGF secretion might be elevated in response to high blood pressure as a counter-system against endothelial dysfunction. However, it is difficult to elucidate the role of circulating and tissue HGFs in human hypertension. To address this issue, we measured circulating and tissue HGF concentrations in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at different ages. Serum HGF concentration in SHR was significantly higher than that in WKY at 6, 15, and 25 weeks of age (P<.01). Serum HGF concentration was also significantly positively correlated with blood pressure in SHR (P<.02, r=.455). In contrast, tissue HGF concentrations in heart, aorta, and kidney were significantly decreased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age, when these organs showed hypertrophic changes induced by hypertension (P<.01). Cardiac HGF mRNA was also decreased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age. Moreover, cardiac HGF concentration showed a significant negative correlation with left ventricular (LV) weight (P<.01), whereas serum HGF concentration showed a significant positive correlation with LV weight (P<.05). Interestingly, concentrations of cardiac and vascular angiotensin II, a suppressor of HGF, were increased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age (P<.01). Therefore, we examined the effects of angiotensin blockade on circulating and tissue HGF concentrations, to study the role of angiotensin II in HGF regulation. Administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (losartan and HR 720) for 6 weeks resulted in a significant increase in cardiac HGF concentration, accompanied by increased cardiac HGF mRNA, and a significant decrease in serum HGF concentration, accompanied by lowered blood pressure and reduced LV weight (P<.01). Here, we demonstrated increased circulating HGF and decreased vascular, cardiac, and renal HGF in SHR as compared with WKY at the maintenance stage of hypertension. Decreased tissue HGF in target organs of hypertension may be due to increased tissue angiotensin II. These results suggest that decreased local HGF production may have an important role in the cardiovascular remodeling of target organs in hypertension, since HGF prevented endothelial injury and promoted angiogenesis. Blockade of angiotensin augmented local decreased cardiovascular HGF in hypertension, potentially resulting in the improvement of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "55": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits a transition from stable compensated left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy to heart failure (HF) at a mean age of 21 months that is characterized by a decrease in alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) gene expression and increases in the expression of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), pro-alpha1(III) collagen, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) genes. We tested the hypotheses that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) in SHR would prevent and reverse HF-associated changes in gene expression when administered prior to and after the onset of HF, respectively. We also investigated the effect of ACEI on circulating and cardiac components of the renin-angiotensin system. ACEI (captopril 2 g/L in the drinking water) was initiated at 12, 18, and 21 months of age in SHR without HF and in SHR with HF. Results were compared with those of age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and to untreated SHR with and without evidence of HF. ACEI initiated prior to failure prevented the changes in alpha-MHC, ANF, pro-alpha1(III) collagen, and TGF-beta1 gene expression that are associated with the transition to HF. ACEI initiated after the onset of HF lowered levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA by 50% (P<.05) and elevated levels of alpha-MHC mRNA two- to threefold (P<.05). Circulating levels of renin and angiotensin I were elevated four- to sixfold by ACEI, but surprisingly, plasma levels of angiotensin II were not reduced. ACEI increased LV renin mRNA levels in WKY and SHR by two- to threefold but did not influence LV levels of angiotensinogen mRNA. The results suggest that the anti-HF benefits of ACEI in SHR may be mediated, at least in part, by effects on the expression of specific genes, including those encoding alpha-MHC, ANF, TGF-beta1, pro-alpha1(III) collagen, and renin-angiotensin system components.", 
    "56": "Essential hypertension probably results from combinations of genetic variations, not necessarily the same in all afflicted persons, which individually may not cause sufficient deviation from normality to be significantly harmful. Genes contributing to hypertension are being sought by analytic experiments aimed at identifying candidate genes associated or segregating with the phenotype in humans and animals and by synthetic experiments in which changes are made in candidate genes in animals and their effects on blood pressure are determined. We have used gene targeting to vary the amounts of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) synthesized from their genes (Agt and Ace). These \"gene titration\" experiments establish that changes in Agt gene expression cause changes in the blood pressures of mice. Surprisingly, quantitative changes in Ace gene expression over a threefold range do not affect blood pressures. Computer simulations with a simple version of the renin-angiotensin system predict that changes in Agt function alter the steady state levels of both angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II). In contrast, modest changes in Ace function alter Ang I levels considerably but scarcely affect Ang II levels. Simulations over the ranges of ACE levels that can be achieved with ACE inhibitors predict that Ang II levels will decrease only when Ang I levels have plateaued. Comparisons of the computer simulations with our genetic experiments and with prior work of others using wide dose ranges of ACE inhibitor show a satisfactory agreement and help reconcile the apparent contradictions between the genetic and pharmacological experiments.", 
    "57": "A 35-year-old nephrotic man developed acute renal failure with serum creatinine to 1543 micromol/l after a month of therapy with enalapril. Renal biopsy demonstrated minimal glomerular changes with fusion of podocytes, tubular necrosis with regeneration of tubular epithelial cells, interstitial edema with focal interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial infiltration with neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells and mononuclear cells. Three hemodialyses were performed in the patient during the oliguric phase of the disease. Renal function was restored after withdrawal of enalapril and initiation of steroid therapy. Steroids also contributed to the improvement of the nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria decreased from maximal ranges of 27 g/l to 2.2 g/l after six months of the follow-up. Similar cases were previously described associated with captopril treatment, but not with enalapril.", 
    "58": "The analysis of RNA from postmortem human brain tissue by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a practical method to measure both normal and abnormal brain gene expression. A major limitation in using human material is that yields can vary dramatically from individual to individual, making comparisons between samples difficult. In this report, we study the association of pH and several pre- and postmortem factors on the RNA yields from 89 postmortem human occipital cortices. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPdH) mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. A major variant in this method is the priming used in the reverse transcription reaction. Three different methods of reverse transcription were performed and the resultant levels of products compared against the pre- and postmortem factors and pH. The levels of GAPdH correlated significantly to pH and pH itself to the rapidity of death (RoD) (agonal state) indicating that premortem factors may play the greatest role in determining postmortem RNA levels. The three methods of priming showed different sensitivities, most notably that oligo dT priming alone is vulnerable to long freezer intervals (FI). We conclude that premortem factors are the major affectors of RNA levels variations and that the polyA tail region of the molecule appears to be adversely affected by extended freezer storage.", 
    "59": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are established treatment for hypertension and heart failure. There are well documented differences between ACE inhibitors both in physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic actions are similar for most members of the ACE inhibitor class but there are compounds with additional effects which may reflect protease inhibition or non-enzyme-directed pharmacological properties. Clinically relevant differences are few and far between, particularly in the treatment of hypertension when the optimal dose and dose intervals are used. In heart failure there may be a role for drugs with additional properties such as neutral endopeptidase inhibition. In addition, ACE inhibitors differ in the profile of blood pressure changes after the first dose. Early haemodynamic changes with a fall in blood pressure in heart failure patients may be disadvantageous in terms of subsequent outcome. Thus the haemodynamic effects of the first dose may be relevant to the choice of ACE inhibitors in heart failure.", 
    "60": "Blood pressure should be controlled over 24 h to reduce or prevent cardiac hypertrophy and reduce the prevalence of sudden death, myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia at the time of the morning rise in blood pressure. Anti-hypertensive medication is usually given once-daily in the morning and the dose is titrated on the basis of post-dose (peak) blood pressure. This frequently leads to inadequate control prior to the next drug dose unless drugs with appropriate pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are used. ACE inhibitors exhibit an E(max) plasma concentration: blood pressure response relationship, and thus short-acting ACE inhibitors can exert an effect over 24 h if titrated based on pre-dose (trough) blood pressure. However, when titrated in clinical practice on post-dose (peak) blood pressure response, doses are used that are inadequate to control blood pressure for 24 h. ACE inhibitors with appropriate pharmacokinetics such as perindopril can control blood pressure when titrated at peak provided a dose is used (4 or 8 mg) that is known to have a T:P close to 1.0. Shorter-acting ACE inhibitors frequently give inadequate control when titrated at peak. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug, coupled with knowledge of the time the drug was taken, together with the time of blood pressure measurements, enables control to be achieved with once-daily therapy even if the drug is titrated at peak response.", 
    "61": "It is 10 years since the CONSENSUS I study showed that ACE inhibitors improved mortality in heart failure. This finding has been confirmed in numerous trials, for example SOLVD, SAVE. Indeed, in the intervening 10 years, many other potential therapies have been examined in mortality trials, but so far no other therapy has had as good effect on mortality as ACE inhibitors. The other therapies which have been examined are digoxin, amlodipine, beta-blockers, amiodarone, etc. Despite ACE inhibitors being a very effective therapy for heart failure, there is still remarkable under-use of them in clinical practice. The reason for this needs to be explained further, but fear of hypothermia and renal dysfunction appear to be major factors.", 
    "62": "Hypertensive changes in the vasculature occur at all levels of the circulation--from the large arteries through to the microcirculation. Detection of these changes may offer useful predictive information in assessing cardiovascular risk and the need for treatment. Recent evidence shows that at least some of these changes are reversible with anti-hypertensive treatment.", 
    "63": "1. Bradykinin (BK) has been shown to exert cardioprotective effects which are potentiated by inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). In order to clarify the significance of ACE within the whole spectrum of myocardial kininases we investigated BK degradation in the isolated rat heart. 2. Tritiated BK (3H-BK) or unlabelled BK was either repeatedly perfused through the heart, or applied as an intracoronary bolus allowing determination of its elution kinetics. BK metabolites were analysed by HPLC. Kininases were identified by ramiprilat, phosphoramidon, diprotin A and 2-mercaptoethanol or apstatin as specific inhibitors of ACE, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV and aminopeptidase P (APP), respectively. 3. In sequential perfusion passages, 3H-BK concentrations in the perfusate decreased by 39% during each passage. Ramiprilat reduced the rate of 3H-BK breakdown by 54% and nearly abolished [1-5]-BK generation. The ramiprilat-resistant kininase activity was for the most part inhibited by the selective APP inhibitor apstatin (IC50 0.9 microM). BK cleavage by APP yielded the intermediate product [2-9]-BK, which was rapidly metabolized to [4-9]-BK by dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV. 4. After bolus injection of 3H-BK, 10% of the applied radioactivity were protractedly eluted, indicating the distribution of this fraction into the myocardial interstitium. In samples of such interstitial perfusate fractions, 3H-BK was extensively (by 92%) degraded, essentially by ACE and APP. The ramiprilat- and mercaptoethanol-resistant fraction of interstitial kininase activity amounted to 14%, about half of which could be attributed to NEP. Only the product of NEP, [1-7]-BK, was continuously generated during the presence of 3H-BK in the interstitium. 5. ACE and APP are located at the endothelium and represent the predominant kininases of rat myocardium. Both enzymes form a metabolic barrier for the extravasated fraction of BK. Thus, only interstitial, but not intravascular concentrations of BK are increased by kininase inhibitors to the extent that a significant potentiation of BK effects could be explained. NEP contributes less than 5% to the total kininase activity, but is the only enzyme which is exclusively present in the interstitial space.", 
    "64": "1. The ability of 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists to modify the disinhibitory profile of diazepam and other agents was investigated in male BKW mice in the light/dark test box. 2. The 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonists ritanserin, MDL11939 and RP62203 and also methysergide, which failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone, caused dose-related enhancements (4 to 8 fold) in the potency of diazepam to disinhibit behavioural responding to the aversive situation of the test box. 3. Ritanserin was shown to enhance the disinhibitory potency of other benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (4 fold), temazepam (10 fold) and lorazepam (10 fold), the 5-HT1A receptor ligands, 8-OH-DPAT (25 fold), buspirone (100 fold) and lesopitron (500 fold), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron (100 fold) R(+)-zacopride (100 fold) and S(-)-zacopride (greater than a 1000 fold), the substituted benzamides, sulpiride (10 fold) and tiapride (5 to 10 fold) and the cholecystokinin (CCK)A receptor antagonist, devazepide (100 fold). It also reduced the onset of action of disinhibition following treatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Ritanserin failed to enhance the disinhibitory effects of the CCKB receptor antagonist CI-988, the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losarten or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ceranapril. 4. The 5-HT4 receptor antagonists SDZ205-557, GR113808 and SB204070 caused dose-related reductions in the disinhibitory effect of diazepam, returning values to those shown in vehicle treated controls. The antagonists failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone. 5. GR113808 was also shown to cause a dose-related antagonism of the disinhibitory effects of chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, lesopitron, ondansetron, R(+)-zacopride, sulpiride, tiapride, devazepide, CI-988, losarten, ceranapril and parachlorophenylalanine. 6. It was concluded that in BKW mice (a) the failure of 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists when administered alone to modify behaviour in the light/dark test indicates an absence of an endogenous 5-HT tone at the 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptors and (b) the enhancement by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists and attenuation by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists of drug-induced disinhibition indicates a plurality of 5-HT receptor involvement in the mediation of drug-induced disinhibitory profiles in the mouse.", 
    "65": "1. The present study was undertaken to investigate the interaction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), bradykinin and the sympathetic nervous system with cholinergic transmission in the rat airways. Experiments were performed on epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded preparations of rat isolated trachea which had been incubated with [3H]-choline to incorporate [3H]-acetylcholine into the cholinergic transmitter stores. Tracheal preparations were subjected to electrical field stimulation (trains of 1 ms pulses, 5 Hz, 15 V) and the stimulation-induced (S-I) efflux taken as an index of transmitter acetylcholine release. 2. In both epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded tracheal preparations, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK14304 (0.1 and 1 microM) inhibited the S-I efflux, in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of S-I efflux produced by UK14304 (1 microM) was antagonized by the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.3 microM). Idazoxan (0.3 microM) alone had no effect on the S-I efflux. 3. Angiotensin II (0.1 and 1 microM) was without effect on the S-I efflux in either epithelium-intact or epithelium-denuded tracheal preparations. When angiotensin-converting enzyme was inhibited by perindoprilat (10 microM), angiotensin II (1 microM) was also without effect on the S-I efflux. Similarly, in the presence of idazoxan (0.3 microM), to block prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors, angiotensin II (0.1 and 1 microM) did not alter the S-I efflux. When added alone, perindoprilat (10 microM) did not alter the S-I efflux. 4. In epithelium-denuded preparations, bradykinin (0.01-1 microM) inhibited the S-I efflux. In epithelium-intact preparations, there was also a tendency for bradykinin (0.1 and 1 microM) to inhibit the S-I efflux but this was not statistically significant. However, when angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase were inhibited by perindoprilat (10 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM), respectively, bradykinin (1 microM) significantly inhibited the S-I efflux in epithelium-intact preparations as well as in epithelium-denuded preparations. The inhibition of the S-I efflux produced by bradykinin, in the combined presence of perindoprilat (10 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM), was unaffected by the additional presence of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM) and/or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 microM), in either epithelium-intact or epithelium-denuded preparations. 5. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that airway parasympathetic nerves are endowed with alpha 2-adrenoceptors which subserve inhibition of transmitter acetylcholine release. Under the present conditions, however, transmitter acetylcholine release is not subject to transneuronal modulation by noradrenaline released from adjacent sympathetic nerves in the airways. Moreover, angiotensin II and perindoprilat do not appear to modulate acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves of the airways. In contrast, bradykinin inhibits acetylcholine release from airway parasympathetic nerves but this action of bradykinin is limited by the activity of epithelial angiotensin-converting enzyme and/or neutral endopeptidase. The inhibitory action of bradykinin on cholinergic transmission in the airways does not appear to involve the liberation of prostaglandins or nitric oxide.", 
    "66": "1. The haemodynamic effects of angiotensin II (AII) and, for comparison, arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the femoral and superior mesenteric artery of urethane-anaesthetized rats were analysed with the ultrasonic transit time shift technique. 2. I.v. bolus injection of AII (0.1-3 nmol kg-1) and AVP (0.03-1 nmol kg-1) increased blood pressure which was accompanied by a decrease in blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery and an increase in femoral blood flow. The femoral hyperaemia was in part due to vasodilatation as indicated by a rise of femoral vascular conductance up to 200% relative to baseline. The femoral vasodilatation caused by AVP, but not AII, was followed by vasoconstriction. 3. Blockade of angiotensin AT1 receptors by telmisartan (0.2-20 mumol kg-1) prevented all haemodynamic responses to AII. 4. The femoral dilator responses to AII and AVP depended on the increase in vascular perfusion pressure since vasodilatation was reversed to vasoconstriction when blood pressure was maintained constant by means of a gravity reservoir. However, the AII-evoked femoral vasodilatation was not due to an autonomic or neuroendocrine reflex because it was not depressed by hexamethonium (75 mumol kg-1), prazosin (0.25 mumol kg-1) or propranolol (3 mumol kg-1). 5. The AII-induced femoral vasodilatation was suppressed by blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 40 mumol kg-1) and reversed to vasoconstriction when L-NAME was combined with indomethacin (30 mumol kg-1), but was left unaltered by antagonism of endothelin ETA/B receptors with bosentan (37 mumol kg-1). 6. These results demonstrate that the effect of AII to increase systemic blood pressure and the resulting rise of perfusion pressure in the femoral artery stimulates the formation of NO and prostaglandins and thereby dilates the femoral arterial bed. This local vasodilator mechanism is sufficient to mask the direct vasoconstrictor response to AII.", 
    "67": "To evaluate the effects of antihypertensive agents on the circadian blood pressure (BP) of patients with previous brain infarction, the ambulatory BP was measured non-invasively for 24 h before and after administration of antihypertensive agents. One hundred milligrams of acebutolol twice daily (n = 15) is effective in lowering the BP during the daytime, but has little effect during the night and the morning. Twenty milligrams of slow-release nifedipine twice daily (n = 14) produced a consistent reduction in the BP over the entire 24-h period and effectively blunted the rise in BP in the morning. Captopril (12.5 mg) twice daily (n = 15) produced a mild reduction in BP with little change in the circadian pattern. The slow-release nifedipine group had the greatest decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP. The heart rate significantly increased after administration of slow-release nifedipine and decreased after administration of acebutolol. To reduce stroke recurrence, we should consider the effects of antihypertensive agents on circadian BP in hypertensive patients with previous brain infarction.", 
    "68": "We synthesized a novel potent alpha-chymotrypsin inactivator, 2,2-dimethyl-3-(N-4-cyanobenzoyl) amino-5-phenyl pentanoic anhydride, which fulfilled the criteria of a mechanism-based inactivator: first-order kinetics, irreversibility, saturation kinetics and substrate protection. The inactivation rate constant (kinact) and the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant (KI) were calculated to be 0.017s-1 and 0.071 microM, respectively (kinact/KI = 242,000 M-1s-1). These kinetic parameters indicate that this compound is one of the most powerful alpha-chymotrypsin inactivators ever reported. The average number of alpha-chymotrypsin turnovers per inactivation (partition ratio) was calculated to be 1, which indicates that it is a stoichiometrically ideal inactivator of alpha-chymotrypsin. We compared the IC50 values of this compound with those of several chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, recombinant human chymase and human neutrophil cathepsin G) and a metallo proteinase, rabbit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Our compound, 2,2-dimethyl-3-(N-4-cyanobenzoyl) amino-5-phenyl pentanoic anhydride, inhibited bovine alpha-chymotrypsin potently (IC50 = 1.0 (+/- 0.2) x 10(-9) M) as well as other chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase; recombinant human chymase (IC50 = 7.0 (+/- 1.0) x 10(-8) M) and human neutrophil cathepsin G (IC50 = 1.8 (+/- 0.2) x 10(-7) M).

This study was designed to examine the levels of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity and serum ACE activity during the course of 2 weeks in 40 patients with AMI within 12 hours after the onset of the symptom and who randomly received early treatment with either the ACE inhibitor imidapril or a placebo (20 patients in the imidapril group and 20 in the placebo group). The levels of serum ACE activity in the imidapril group decreased significantly (p < 0.01) 8 hours after the administration of imidapril, and the levels 24 hours after administration were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (3.6 +/- 0.6 IU/L vs 7.4 +/- 0.8 IU/L; p < 0.001). The plasma PAI activity increased gradually to peak levels 16 hours after the administration of imidapril and placebo. The levels in the placebo group decreased gradually but remained high during the study period. On the other hand, the levels of PAI activity in the imidapril group decreased rapidly and those 48 hours after administration were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (7.9 +/- 1.9 IU/ml vs 18.4 +/- 3.5 IU/ml; p < 0.01). The levels of left ventricular ejection fraction about 2 weeks after admission were significantly higher in the imidapril group than in the placebo group (65.9% +/- 2.5% vs 49.1% +/- 4.4%; p < 0.01). This study showed that imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, might be useful for the improvement of fibrinolytic function and left ventricular function in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "70": "Since 1987, publications in widely circulated medical journals have reported improved survival and lower hospital readmission rates when patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We describe changes in ACE inhibitor use among patients hospitalized with heart failure between 1986 and 1993. Simultaneous trends in readmissions and survival rates are reported. Subjects were 612 consecutive patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of heart failure at an academic medical center during the period of Sept. 1, 1986, to Dec. 31, 1987 (interval I) or during the period Aug. 1, 1992, to Nov. 30, 1993 (interval II). Medical records were reviewed for 434 patients, consisting of all patients hospitalized with heart failure during interval II and a randomly selected 50% subset of patients hospitalized during interval I. Among 145 patients with systolic dysfunction whose medical records were reviewed, ACE inhibitor prescriptions significantly increased between interval I and interval II (43% vs 71%, p < 0.01, odds ratio 3.22, 95% confidence interval 1.62 to 6.42). Prescriptions of ACE inhibitors combined with digoxin and a diuretic also increased (37% vs 56%, p = 0.02, odds ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 4.32). Among all 612 patients, 6-month heart failure readmission rates increased from 13% to 21% (p = 0.02, odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 2.82). There was no significant change in survival rate between interval I and interval II, however, survival rate was marginally significantly improved among patients with systolic dysfunction. Our results suggest that drug-prescribing practices have significantly changed between 1986 and 1993. The absence of observed improvement in outcomes may result from changes in hospital admission criteria for heart failure.", 
    "71": "Although several large studies indicate a beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction, the optimal timing of therapy in terms of safety and the effects on neurohormones during myocardial infarction are less well known. In order to investigate the effect of ramipril, administered within 24 h after myocardial infarction, on hemodynamics and neurohormones and its safety, 20 patients with a myocardial infarction were studied. Nine patients had an anterior, 10 an inferior, and 1 a non-Q-wave infarction. Fourteen patients received thrombolytic therapy, whereas 6 did not. The initial dose of ramipril was 1.25 mg, but was gradually increased to 5 mg during the next 4 days. Side effects did not occur. The mean arterial pressure decreased 8 h after the first dose from 84 +/- 2 mm Hg (control) to 77 +/- 2 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and remained decreased thereafter. This was accompanied by a reduction in systemic resistance of 8% after 8 h and of 12% on day 2. Heart rate, cardiac and stroke indexes, and pulmonary artery and wedge pressures did not change. The ACE activity decreased within 1 h of ramipril administration with a maximum of 71% at 4 h after the second dose and remained at this level throughout the study. Angiotensin II decreased by 34% (day 2) and by 41% (day 5). The renin activity gradually increased from 33 +/- 7.5 to 75.4 +/- 11.5 microM/ml on day 5, whereas epinephrine was reduced from day 2 onwards, with a maximal reduction of 71% on day 5. Arginine vasopressin was significantly reduced 5 h after ramipril administration until the end of the study, with a maximum of 77% on day 3. Moreover, a late but significant decrease in norepinephrine occurred on day 5. Thus, oral ramipril results in early ACE inhibition, followed by progressive attenuation of the neuroendocrine activation and a reduction in afterload during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. It is well tolerated, also in combination with nitroglycerin and thrombolytic therapy.", 
    "72": "To evaluate the utility of renal duplex scanning and the captopril test in the detection and functional assessment of renovascular disease, by comparing their results with those of angiography and captopril isotopic renography (CIR). Sixty hypertensive patients with aortoiliac disease and 16 with clinically suspected renovascular hypertension (RVH) were included. All the patients underwent renal duplex scanning prior to angiography. In addition, isotopic renograms and a determination of peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) at baseline and 60 min after oral intake of 50 mg of captopril were both performed. A postcaptopril PRA > 5.7 ng/mL/h was considered as diagnostic of a positive captopril test. On the basis of the results of the angiography and isotopic renograms, all the patients were classified into three groups: group I (n = 33), essential hypertension (EHT); group II (n = 20), hypertension and angiographic RAS > 60% but negative CIR; and group III (n = 24), RAS > 60% and positive CIR. This last condition was considered as highly suspicious for RVH. Renal duplex scanning showed greater accuracy than captopril PRA or CIR for detecting RAS > 60% (groups II and III) with 87.3% versus 52.4% and 45.3% sensitivity (S), and 91.5% versus 84.4% and 92.8% specificity (Sp), respectively. The captopril test correctly identified 44 of 51 EHT patients (groups I and II) and 20 of 23 highly suspected of RVH (group III) with 87% S, 86.5% Sp, 74.1% PPV, and 93.6% NPV. Accuracy was further increased when a combined approach (renal duplex scanning and captopril test) was followed (82.6% S, 93.7% Sp, 86.4 PPV, and 91.8 NPV). In our study, renal duplex scanning was a useful screening method for detecting anatomical RAS. A combination of both renal duplex scanning and captopril test may be an appropriate approach to the primary screening for RVH, thereby permitting the selection of those patients indicated for angiography.", 
    "73": "The objective of the study was to compare prospectively the impact of study design on drug therapy safety and effectiveness data obtained in hypertension management. The main study was a randomized controlled clinical trial of four different prospective study designs used in postmarketing assessment involving 1008 primary care practices in nine Canadian provinces. Two thousand nine hundred sixty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension received an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor daily for 14 weeks in one of four postmarketing studies--a randomized double-blind clinical trial (RCT) (10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily v 5 to 20 mg enalapril daily), two structured open label trials of 10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily (one with free drugs), or an unstructured open label trial of 10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily. Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, adverse events reported, and data quality were recorded as the outcome measures. The results showed that the RCT patients were titrated to higher doses of ACE inhibitor than patients in the open studies, P < .008; patients in the open studies were more likely to receive adjuvant diuretic therapy, P < .008. The decrease in blood pressure was similar for patients in all four studies, mean decrease in systolic BP was between 18 and 20 mm Hg, mean decrease in diastolic BP was between 11 and 13 mm Hg. Fewer patients in the unstructured open trial reported adverse events than patients in the RCT; a 55% relative reduction in reported adverse events (P < .008) was associated with the unstructured trial. There were also fewer drug-related adverse events per patient reported in the unstructured study (17 per 100 patients) than in the other studies (27 to 41 per 100 patients), P < .008. Physician preference for rounding off blood pressure measurements to 0 or 5 occurred most often in the unstructured open trial (P < .008). In conclusion, despite differences in dose titration and in the use of adjuvant therapy, antihypertensive drug therapy effectiveness observed in an RCT may be similar to uncontrolled postmarketing studies. Open trials with scheduled follow-up visits are as effective in detecting severe adverse events as RCT, but postmarketing studies with unstructured schedules of follow-up are insufficient in identifying drug-related adverse events and have poorer quality data.", 
    "74": "Strategies for managing acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with a focus on thrombolytics, are reviewed. Revised guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association strongly recommend the use of thrombolytic therapy in carefully selected patients to promote reperfusion of ischemic myocardium. Thrombolytics reduce in-hospital mortality, and the mortality benefit is maintained for at least one year. Which patients are the best candidates for thrombolytics has been debated; variables that have been analyzed include infarct location, time after onset of symptoms, age, sex, blood pressure, and prior AMI. Clinicians should be thoroughly familiar with the absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy to minimize potential hemorrhagic complications. The diagnosis of AMI should be clearly established. All patients should receive thrombolytic therapy if they arrive for treatment within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms of AMI and have appropriate ECG changes. Aspirin should be given to all patients, and beta-blockers should also be given if there are no contraindications. Heparin may be given as antithrombotic therapy in patients not receiving thrombolytics or as adjuvant therapy in those receiving thrombolytics. Other adjuvant treatments, notably angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, are used as indicated. Primary angioplasty may have a role in selected patients. Long-term interventions are intended to prevent recurrence of AMI. Thrombolytic therapy can substantially improve survival and function in patients with AMI, especially when it is given within six hours of the onset of symptoms.", 
    "75": "Two series of analogues of the tetrapeptide NAcSDKP, an inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, were prepared, and their enzymatic stability toward rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was evaluated as well as their capacity to inhibit NAcSDKP hydrolysis by this enzyme. In the first series, each of the peptide bonds has been successively replaced by an aminomethylene bond. In the second one, the C-terminus of the peptide has been modified by decarboxylation or amidation. The results reported here indicate that all of these molecules but one have good stability toward the enzyme but none of the compounds is able to inhibit NAcSDKP hydrolysis by ACE.",

    "77": "Ninety-three patients with a first AMI successfully treated with primary coronary angioplasty underwent two-dimensional echocardiography within 24 hours of admission and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography at a mean of 3 days after AMI. Two-dimensional echocardiography and coronary angiography were obtained in all patients 1 and 6 months after coronary angioplasty. On the basis of dobutamine echocardiography responses, patients were divided in two subsets: those with (n=48; group I) and those without (n=45; group II) infarct-zone viability. There was no difference in minimal lesion diameter and infarct-related artery patency at 1 and 6 months between the two groups. Group II patients had significantly greater end-diastolic (76+/-18 versus 53+/-14 mL/m2; P<.0003) and end-systolic (42+/-17 versus 22+/-11 mL/m2; P<.0003) volumes at 6 months than did patients in group 1. The extent of infarct-zone viability was significantly inversely correlated with percent changes in end-diastolic volumes at 6 months (r=-.66; P<.000001) and was the most powerful independent predictor of late left ventricular dilation.", 
    "78": "After reperfused AMI, the degree of left ventricular dilation, when it occurs, is inversely related to the extent of residual myocardial viability in the infarct zone.

LV function was assessed by radionuclide ejection fraction. Two hundred sixty-three patients (51.4%) sustained cardiovascular death and/or LV diastolic dilatation; 279 (54.5%) had cardiovascular death and/or systolic dilatation. In 373 patients with serial echocardiograms, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic sizes increased progressively from baseline to 2 years (both P<.01). More patients with LV dilatation had a decrease in ejection fraction: 24.8% versus 6.8% (P<.001) (diastole) and 25.7% versus 5.3% (P<.001) (systole). Captopril attenuated diastolic LV dilatation at 2 years (P=.048), but this effect was carried over from the first year of therapy because changes in LV size with captopril beyond 1 year were similar to those with placebo. Predictors of cardiovascular death and/or dilatation were age (P=.023), prior infarction (P<.001), lower ejection fraction (P<.001), angina (P=.007), heart failure (P=.002), LV size (P<.001), and infarct size (%AD) (P<.001).",

One year later, he was diagnosed as having jugular foramen syndrome. On admission, he had a fever and dyspnea. Pansystolic blowing murmur was audible at the apex. The chest ratio on his chest X-ray was 52.5%. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. An echocardiogram showed marked dilatation and severe dysfunction of left ventricle. Radionuclide scanning with technetium 99 m pyrophosphate identified inflammatory change in the apex. Myocardial biopsy showed fibrotic degeneration and IgG deposits in myocardium. Blood examination showed anemia, lymphopenia. positive anti-nuclear antibody (1000 times, shaggy pattern), positive anti ds-DNA antibody and hypocomplementemia. Furthermore, proteinuria was pointed out. Renal biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulonephritis with active necrotizing lesion (type III nephritis). Lupus myocarditis and nephritis was diagnosed. After prednisolone (80 mg/day) was administered. left ventricular function and hypocomplementemia improved. The ACE inhibitor was also used for proteinuria. In spite of a little amount of blood transfusion, he showed hepatic hemosiderosis. We suspect that the cause of hemosiderosis was related chronic inflammation of active lupus.

We also measured serum ACE activity of these patients. ACE genotype and derived allele frequencies in each disease group did not differ significantly from those in healthy subjects. In all disease groups, values of serum ACE activity were higher in genotype DD than in genotype II. These findings suggest no significant association between I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and renal disease.

    "86": "At inclusion, there were no significant differences regarding GFR or blood pressure between the groups. The blood pressure treatment goal was reached in all patients and was maintained during the whole observation period. A small but significant fall in GFR by 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA was noted in both groups after the first year of treatment but thereafter GFR decreased by only 1 ml/min/year/1.73 m2 BSA, in both groups.

The overall magnitude of the GFR decline approached that of the normal age-related decrease of kidney function, i.e. GFR decreased only about 1 ml/min/year. Thus, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor, enalapril, and a beta-blocker, metoprolol, protected the kidney function to the same extent in this 6 year long study in mild and moderate primary hypertension.", 
    "88": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy has been associated with poor fetal outcomes, including oligohydramnios, renal tubular dysplasia, cranial malformations, and fetal death. A 35-year-old woman with chronic hypertension was treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril until 27 weeks' gestation, when severe oligohydramnios was noted. After hospitalization for bed rest, fetal surveillance, and discontinuation of the agent, amniotic fluid rapidly reaccumulated, and a healthy infant was delivered at term. Although the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided during pregnancy, patients whose fetuses are inadvertently exposed in utero need not be given a uniformly poor prognosis. Oligohydramnios induced by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy may be reversible if the agent is discontinued. This case underscores the need for obstetricians to review carefully the medication regimens of all pregnant women and to be familiar with generic and proprietary names of medications to avoid the use of potentially harmful agents during pregnancy.", 
    "89": "Insulin initiates its metabolic and growth-promoting effects by binding to the alpha subunit of its receptor, thereby activating the kinase in the beta subunit. This event leads to tyrosyl phosphorylation of its cytosolic substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), which in turn associates with and activates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The clinical use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity. However, the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and IRS-1, as well as the association between IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase in the liver and muscle of 20-month-old rats treated acutely with captopril, using immunoprecipitation with antipeptide antibodies to the insulin receptor and IRS-1, and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies. Insulin stimulation increased receptor autophosphorylation to 462 +/- 253% (P < 0.05) in the liver and 697 +/- 78% (P < 0.001) in the muscle of ACE inhibitor-treated rats. There were also increases to 250 +/- 17% (P < 0.001) and 280 +/- 50% (P < 0.05) in the insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation levels in the liver and muscle, respectively, of animals treated with captopril. The insulin-stimulated IRS-1 association with PI 3-kinase rose to 305 +/- 20% (P < 0.001) in liver and 267 +/- 48% (P < 0.05) in muscle. Losartan, an ANG receptor blocker, had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation in both tissues. The acute administration of bradykinin increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in the liver and muscle. These data demonstrate that ACE inhibitors modulate the early steps of insulin signaling, and that this effect may be simulated by the administration of bradykinin.", 
    "90": "A previously fit 22 year old man was struck in the chest by a concrete block dropped through the windscreen of his car while he was driving on the motorway. He suffered extensive chest wall trauma and lung contusion, which subsequently precipitated acute respiratory distress. On admission ECG showed right bundle branch block and left axis deviation. Three days later QRS duration was normal but there was anterior ST segment elevation and subsequent T wave change. There was a large rise in creatine kinase, and echocardiography revealed septal and apical hyokinesis as well as a mobile mass attached to the left side of the interventricular septum, which had the echogenic texture of myocardium. The patient had fixed perfusion defects in the areas of hypokinesis on thallium scanning but the coronary arteries were unobstructed at angiography. He was treated with warfarin in the short term and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in the longer term and has made an asymptomatic recovery. Outpatient echocardiography two months after the injury demonstrated some recovery in overall left ventricular systolic function and no evidence of the intracardiac mass. This case illustrates some of the typical features of non-fatal cardiac contusion associated with non-penetrating cardiac trauma, and was complicated by partial thickness avulsion of a strip of the myocardium in the interventricular septum.",

The plasmid constructed containing this fusion gene was introduced into S. cerevisiae and expressed under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from S. cerevisiae. The CMCase activity was detected in the cell pellet fraction. The CMCase protein was solubilized from the cell wall fraction by glucanase treatment but not by sodium dodecyl sulphate treatment, indicating the covalent binding of the fusion protein to the cell wall.

These recommendations include annual comprehensive foot examinations, yearly ophthalmologic screening for retinopathy, and urinalysis for microalbuminuria. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is advocated for the majority of diabetic patients with proteinuria or hypertension. Based on recent evidence, improved glycemic control is also increasingly advocated. Compliance with practice guidelines by primary care physicians has historically been poor.

Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for regression of LV hypertrophy after treatment, LV mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured before and after treatment.

Initial studies with CGS 30440 produced dose-related reductions in mean arterial pressure, with a dose of 30 mg/kg/day of CGS 30440 producing a maximal sustained response of 40 mm Hg. CGS 30440 significantly inhibited plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by 82% in WKY rats. In SHRs, lung ACE and renal neutral endopeptidase (NEP) were inhibited by >60 and >90%, respectively. Urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) excretion was significantly increased by CGS 30440 in SHRs but was unaltered in WKY rats. One hour after the final dose of an 8-week regimen, blood pressure was 122 +/- 4 and 189 +/- 5 mm Hg in CGS 30440-treated (30 mg/kg/day) and vehicle-treated SHRs, respectively. Heart-rate responses were not different between treatment groups. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LV weight/body weight ratio) was reduced significantly in SHRs to 2.45 +/- 0.08 mg/g at 10 mg/kg/day and 2.26 +/- 0.07 mg/g at 30 mg/kg/day versus 2.91 +/- 0.09 mg/g in rats receiving only vehicle. These results demonstrate that CGS 30440 is a potent, orally active antihypertensive agent with a long duration of action. The cardiac hypertrophy of established hypertension in the SHRs was attenuated by CGS 30440. Thus CGS 30440, an orally active prodrug, has been shown to be a novel antihypertensive agent with dual ACE/NEP inhibitory activity in SHRs.", 
    "109": "Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in developing left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy has been demonstrated to have inhibitory effects on myocardial growth. An important mechanism of action of ACE inhibition is modulation of myocardial AT1 Ang II-receptor activity. However, whether and to what extent AT1 Ang II-receptor blockade may influence LV and myocyte function during the hypertrophic process remains unclear. Accordingly, our project examined the relation between changes in LV and myocyte function during the LV hypertrophic process that occurs after recovery from long-term rapid pacing. Dogs were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: (a) Pace and Recovery, long-term rapid pacing (4 weeks; 216 +/- 2 beats/min) followed by a 4-week recovery period (n = 6); (b) Recovery/AT1 Block, concomitant AT1 Ang II-receptor blockade [irbesartan (SR 47436; BMS-186295) 30 mg/kg b.i.d.] administered during the 4-week recovery period (n = 5); and (c) Control, sham controls (n = 6). There was no difference in mean arterial pressure in any of the three groups. With pacing and recovery, LV end-diastolic volume and mass were increased by >50% from control values. The significant LV remodeling that occurred with recovery from long-term rapid pacing was associated with a decline in LV ejection fraction (59 +/- 3% vs. 68 +/- 4%) and myocyte velocity of shortening (43 +/- 3 microm/s vs. 63 +/- 3 microm/s) when compared with controls (p < 0.05). With recovery from long-term rapid pacing, LV myocyte length (176 +/- 6 microm vs. 150 +/- 1 microm) and cross-sectional area were increased (292 +/- 7 microm2 vs. 227 +/- 6 microm2) compared with controls (p < 0.05). With AT1 Ang II block during recovery from rapid pacing, LV end-diastolic volume was similar to untreated recovery values, but LV mass was normalized. LV ejection fraction was not different from control values with AT1 Ang II-receptor block. Steady-state myocyte velocity of shortening with AT1 Ang II block was similar to control values (55 +/- 5 microm/s), but percentage shortening remained reduced from control (3.55 +/- 0.37% vs. 4.71 +/- 0.12%, respectively, p < 0.05) and was similar to untreated recovery (3.59 +/- 0.23%). With AT1 Ang II block, myocyte length was similar to untreated recovery values, but cross-sectional area was reduced (260 +/- 5 microm2, p < 0.05). Thus AT1 Ang II-receptor blockade instituted in this model of developing LV hypertrophy, significantly reduced LV mass but did not reduce the degree of LV dilation. The cellular basis for these effects of AT1 Ang II-receptor blockade included persistent abnormalities in LV myocyte geometry. AT1 Ang II-receptor blockade improved certain indices of myocyte contractile function from untreated hypertrophy values. These findings suggest that in this pacing-recovery model, the development of LV hypertrophy and myocyte contractile dysfunction may be caused, at least in part, by AT1 Ang II-receptor activation.", 
    "110": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was aimed at detecting cerebrovascular effects of isradipine and enalapril in patients with moderate hypertension depending on the presence and grade on unilateral stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA). We evaluated carotid vascular resistance by using Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by using 133Xe-clearance technique before and after a single 5-mg oral dose of isradipine, enalapril, or placebo. Their effects were randomly and consecutively tested in 73 patients with essential hypertension subdivided into three groups: without carotid occlusive lesions, with moderate (50-75%), and with severe (76-99%) unilateral asymptomatic ICA stenosis. There were no differences in age, gender, and antihypertensive effects of the drugs between these three subgroups. Three major variants of cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: absence of changes (variant I), decrease in carotid vascular resistance with increase in rCBF and elimination of side-to-side asymmetry (variant II), and increase in carotid vascular resistance with further reduction of rCBF ipsilaterally ICA stenosis, and increased side-to-side asymmetry (variant III). Frequency of variant III was significantly higher in patients with severe ICA stenosis. Enalapril produced variant I of cerebrovascular effects in most patients examined; variant III was observed only in 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine produced variant I of cerebrovascular effects much less frequently than did enalapril. For this drug, variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate ICA stenosis. In 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis, however, isradipine produced reduction of cerebral perfusion. Presumably the presence of ICA stenosis, especially >75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular disorders in antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with enalapril appears to be safer than that with isradipine.", 
    "111": "This study was aimed at evaluating the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide administered in the fixed combination of 20 and 12.5 mg, respectively, on clinic and 24-h blood pressure in elderly patients (age, 68.8 +/- 5.8 years, mean +/- SD) with mild-to-moderate essential systodiastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. After a washout period of 4 weeks, patients received once daily lisinopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide for a 6-week period. At the end of the washout and treatment periods, clinic blood pressure was assessed 24 h after dosing, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was monitored, taking blood pressure readings every 15 min. Pretreatment clinic blood pressure was 171.3 +/- 14.0/103.7 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) in the group with systodiastolic hypertension (n = 405) and 179.6 +/- 9.4/83.6 +/- 5.4 mm Hg in the group with isolated systolic hypertension (n = 165). The corresponding 24-h average blood pressures were 144.1 +/- 13.9/88.7 +/- 8.4 mm Hg (n = 114) and 150.7 +/- 15.5/80.8 +/- 9.4 mm Hg (n = 40). Clinic blood pressure was significantly reduced by treatment in both groups. This was the case also for ambulatory blood pressure, which was reduced by 9.6 +/- 0.9%/9.9 +/- 0.9% in systodiastolic and by 11.8 +/- 1.3%/8.5 +/- 1.5% in isolated patients with systolic hypertension (p < 0.05 at least for all differences). The antihypertensive effect was similar in patients older and younger than 70 years. In all groups, it was manifest both during the day and the nighttime and was still significant after 24 h. Thus single daily administration of combined lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension.", 
    "112": "We demonstrate the presence of a membrane and soluble form of leech Theromyzon tessulatum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Four steps in the purification of this enzyme include gel-permeation, captopril-sepharose affinity and anion-exchange chromatography followed by a reverse-phase HPLC. The peptidyl dipeptidases (of approximately 120 and approximately 100 kDa) are glycosylated enzymes hydrolysing the Phe8-His9 bond of angiotensin I, exhibiting the same specific activity and Km whereas the soluble ACE exhibits a higher catalytic efficiency. This hydrolysis is inhibited by the ACE-specific antagonist captopril. Western blot analysis of a polyclonal antiserum raised against the first 11 amino-acid residues of the membrane ACE and the N-terminal sequence of the soluble molecule also demonstrates the presence of two ACE enzymes. Anti-ACE immunocytochemistry also supports the presence of two forms of ACE. This material is found in neurons and glia. We demonstrate for the first time the cellular localization and biochemical characterization of ACEs in the central nervous system of an invertebrate. Thus, the leech brain may represent a simple model for the study of these enzymes.", 
    "113": "Microdialysis was used to selectively assess the effect of the paracrine renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on interstitial glucose and lactate concentration profiles in skeletal muscle of healthy volunteers (n = 8) during basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Paracrine RAS was selectively inhibited by local retrodialysis with enalaprilate. Under basal conditions, local administration of enalaprilate (2 micrograms mL-1) increased interstitial dialysate glucose concentration from 0.71 +/- 0.14 mmol L-1 to 0.84 +/- 0.14 mmol L-1 and decreased the serum interstitial gradient (SIGglu) compared with baseline (P < 0.02). Under clamp conditions, enalaprilate, even at the lowest concentration (0.02 microgram mL-1), increased interstitial dialysate glucose concentration from 0.77 +/- 0.11 mmol L-1 to 1.02 +/- 0.09 mmol L-1 and decreased SIGglu compared with baseline (P < 0.01). Interstitial lactate concentrations slightly increased during basal as well as during clamp conditions (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Selective inhibition of paracrine muscle angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases interstitial glucose and lactate concentrations and decreases SIGglu in muscle by facilitating transcapillary glucose transport. This effect is more pronounced during hyperinsulinaemia and may be of clinical relevance in diabetic patients treated with therapeutic doses of enalapril.", 
    "114": "The present study examined the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 or angiotensin II (AII) on the expression of ovarian metalloproteinase inhibitor and activity in rat granulosa cells and intact ovaries. Granulosa cells were collected from rats primed with pregnant mares' serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) and cultured for 24 h with A23187, AII, or the AII receptor antagonist, saralasin, in the presence or absence of LH. Metalloproteinase inhibitor activity and progesterone concentrations were determined in the media. In the A23187 experiment, addition of A23187 to granulosa cells, cultured without LH, decreased inhibitor activity, especially at the concentrations of 10 and 100 mumol l-1 (decrease to 33 +/- 7% and 31 +/- 5% of control culture values, respectively). Addition of LH to the media increased inhibitor activity 3.04 +/- 0.39 times compared with the control; however, A23187 (10 and 100 mumol l-1), in the presence of LH, decreased inhibitor activity by approximately 67%. The ionophore had disparate effects on progesterone production. Without LH, A23187 increased progesterone production by 2.96 +/- 0.47 times at 10 mumol l-1 and by 5.53 +/- 0.65 times at 100 mumol l-1. However, in LH-stimulated cells, progesterone was inhibited by A23187 at 1 and 10 mumol l-1 but was unchanged at 100 mumol l-1. In the angiotensin experiment, addition of AII (0-10,000 nmol l-1) or saralasin (1 mumol l-1) did not affect inhibitor activity or progesterone concentrations compared with control values in the absence or presence of LH. For the angiotensin experiment in vivo, PMSG-primed rats were injected with hCG followed by saralasin (10 mmol l-1) 1 or 3 h later and killed at 4, 8, or 12 h after hCG. Expression of the ovarian tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) increased by 1.7 times at 4 h, 3.3 times at 8 h, and 3.0 times at 12 h after hCG compared with values in ovaries collected at the time of hCG injection. Administration of saralasin at 1 or 3 h after hCG had no effect on expression of TIMP-1 or on serum concentrations of progesterone or oestradiol. In summary, A23187 decreased granulosa cell-derived inhibitor activity, whereas All had no effect. We propose that calcium may play a role in modulating proteolysis associated with ovulation, while AII does not appear to regulate ovarian metalloproteinase inhibitor activity.", 
    "115": "A number of data suggest that angiotensin II-dependent activation of the protooncogene c-myc participates in the proliferative response of smooth muscle cells (SMC) of rats with spontaneous hypertension (SHR). We therefore investigated the effects of chronic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril on the oncoprotein c-Myc and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen cyclin A in SMC of small intramyocardial arteries from the left ventricle of SHR. The expression of c-Myc and cyclin A was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis. The number of smooth muscle cells was assessed by morphometrical analysis. As compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, untreated SHR exhibited an increased percentages of cells expressing c-Myc (33% +/- 4% v 19% +/- 2%, mean +/- SEM, P < .005) and cyclin A (25 +/- 2 v 11% +/- 1%, P < .001). In quinapril-treated SHR compared with untreated SHR, we found decreased expression of c-Myc (22% +/- 2%, P < .005) and cyclin A (13% +/- 1%, P < .001). No significant differences were found between WKY rats and quinapril-treated SHR in the above parameters. Cyclin A was directly correlated with the number of SMCs in each group of rats. These results suggest that an enhanced expression of c-Myc may be involved in the increased proliferation seen in SMCs from small arteries of SHR. Quinapril administration normalizes proliferation in the SMCs of SHR, possibly by inhibiting the expression of the oncoprotein c-Myc and its effects on the cell cycle.", 
    "116": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which frequently occurs in chronic uremia, may be due in part to factors other than arterial hypertension, chronic anemia, and/or other well-known loading conditions inherent to the uremic state. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be able to reverse LVH by mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. In this study, 18 subjects free of arterial hypertension or severe anemia were selected from 170 chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients after fulfilling the criterion of a supranormal left ventricular mass (LVM). Ten subjects agreed to undergo treatment with 2.5 to 20 mg lisinopril every other day over a period of 2 years, during which annual determinations of the LVM by echocardiography and of the 24-hour blood pressure with a portable device were carried out. Eight patients unwilling to undergo the treatment served as controls. The average resting left ventricular mass index (LVMi) of the overall group was 178 +/- 30 g/m2 body surface area (+/- SD), and did not differ between the two subgroups. Lisinopril treatment significantly decreased the LVM of eight of 10 treated subjects and actually even completely normalized it in three. The LVM of the untreated group remained unchanged. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 138 +/- 5 mm Hg and 78 +/- 6 mm Hg in the treated group and 133 +/- 9 mm Hg and 75 +/- 4 mm Hg in the untreated group, respectively (P = NS), and did not vary over the following 2 years. This study indicates that a mild degree of LVH, which is seemingly independent of arterial blood pressure load, does exist in a tight subset of uremic patients. This study also demonstrates that this type of LVH is apparently nonprogressive. ACE inhibitors given at doses not affecting blood pressure are able to reverse it.", 
    "117": "Modern cancer therapy produces substantial acute and chronic toxicity which impairs quality of life and limits the effectiveness of treatment. Recent clinical and laboratory data suggest that repair of treatment-related injury is a multiphase and continuous process providing multiple opportunities for pharmacologic intervention. A host of agents (toxicity antagonists) are under development that modulate normal tissue response or interfere with mechanisms of toxicity. Although significant challenges remain, the routine application of such agents promises to substantially reduce treatment related morbidity and potentially allow treatment intensification in high-risk disease.", 
    "118": "We compared the effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and triple therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine, and hydralazine) on the metabolic and renal features in the SHR/N-corpulent (cp) rat, a genetic model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Obese male SHR/N-cp rats (4 to 6 weeks old) were fed a 54% carbohydrate diet containing 18% sucrose and 36% starch. After 2 months on the diet, rats were assigned to one of three groups: one group (n=8) received perindopril (PE); the second group (n=8) received triple therapy (TT); and the third group (n=8) did not receive therapy. Treatment was maintained for 3 to 4 months. Body weight, food intake, and fasting levels of serum glucose and insulin did not differ among the three groups. Control rats exhibited progressive proteinuria in parallel with the rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Both PE and TT equally lowered SBP to normal levels and reduced proteinuria in treated rats. However, the reduction of proteinuria was greater and more sustained with PE than with TT (P<.05), whereas the effect of TT on proteinuria was delayed. Plasma renin activity was increased in PE and TT rats compared with control rats (P<.02). Semiquantitative analysis of renal lesions showed that the percentage of glomeruli with mesangial expansion and sclerosis and the tubulointerstitial score (an index of severity of tubulointerstitial lesions, namely tubular atrophy, inflammatory cellular infiltrates, and interstitial fibrosis) was reduced in both PE and TT rats. However, the reduction of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions was greater in PE than in TT rats (P<.01). The percentage of glomerular sclerosis was positively correlated with the severity score of tubulointerstitial lesions (r=.60, P<.01). We conclude that PE is more effective than TT in halting the progression of proteinuria in the SHR/N-cp rat with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The antiproteinuric effect of PE is associated with significant reduction in glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions, independent of the effect of treating hypertension.", 
    "119": "Young (approximately 1 month old) male normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n=26) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=38) were randomized into three groups treated via drinking water for approximately 2 years with, respectively, placebo, low doses, or high doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (10 microg x kg[-1] x d[-1], non-blood pressure-lowering dose, or 1 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], blood pressure-lowering dose). Relative to placebo treatment in each respective rat strain, both ramipril dosages increased endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase expression (Western blot) and resultant synthesis of nitric oxide (porphyrinic sensor) in freshly excised carotids and thoracic aortas, respectively. Paradoxically, this activity was associated with an increased/decreased superoxide accumulation (chemiluminescence) in freshly excised aortas from 24-/22-month-old normotensive/hypertensive rats. In normotensive rats, relative to placebo treatment, the threefold increase in superoxide accumulation with antihypertensive ramipril treatment is most likely from the >300% increase in endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase expression (some of which may be disarranged by local insufficiencies in L-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin). In hypertensive rats, relative to placebo treatment, the 35% increase in nitric oxide availability by long-term antihypertensive ramipril treatment may contribute to the preservation of the endothelium and prevent its dysfunction by inhibiting superoxide production. Increased nitric oxide production with concomitant decreased superoxide accumulation (approximately one third of placebo levels) correlates positively with the previously reported +40% life span extension for rats with genetic hypertension that were treated with antihypertensive doses of ramipril.", 
    "120": "We investigated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial distensibility, a marker of biophysical vessel wall properties, in 32 normoalbuminuric type I diabetic patients and 32 healthy control subjects on diets containing 50 mmol and 200 mmol sodium per day. The increase in daytime diastolic blood pressure from 50 to 200 mmol sodium was significantly higher in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects (2.3+/-4.9 versus 0.2+/-3.7 mm Hg, P<.05). On a high sodium regimen, femoral artery distensibility was decreased in the diabetic patients compared with the control subjects (19.2+/-7.6 versus 24.1+/-9.3 10[-3]/kPa, P<.05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the diabetic patients on a high sodium diet decreased daytime diastolic blood pressure and increased femoral artery distensibility. The blood pressure decrease in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition correlated significantly with the blood pressure increase to sodium (for 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure, r=.72, P<.001 and r=.76, P<.001). In addition, we found that in the diabetic patients on a high sodium diet, the renal blood flow response to exogenous angiotensin II was not bimodally distributed, as is the case in essential hypertension, in which a subgroup of the patients are characterized by sodium sensitivity of the blood pressure and an abnormal renal blood flow response to exogenous angiotensin II (\"nonmodulator phenotype\"). These results show that blood pressure in insulindependent diabetes mellitus is sodium sensitive, but that this is not related to the nonmodulator phenotype, and suggest that in IDDM a relatively high sodium intake may be a factor that predisposes to the development of diabetic vascular disease.", 
    "121": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether interventions that promote kinin production or decrease kinin inactivation affect nitric oxide production in isolated canine coronary microvessels. Accordingly, bradykinin (10[-8] to 10[-5] mol/L), ramiprilat (10[-10] to 10[-8] mol/L), A23187 (10[-8] to 10[-6] mol/L), kallikrein (1 to 20 U/mL), and kininogen (0.5 to 10 microg/mL) were used to stimulate endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production. Receptor antagonists, serine protease inhibitors, and a kinin antibody were used to inactivate local kallikrein-kinin activity. Nitrite, the metabolite of nitric oxide in aqueous solution, was measured using the Griess reaction. All the agonists significantly increased nitrite release. For instance, the highest dose of bradykinin, ramiprilat, A23187, kallikrein, and kininogen markedly increased nitrite production, from 60+/-10 to 156+/-12, 153+/-11, 161+/-15, 176+/-15, and 168+/-16 pmol/mg (all P<.05), respectively. The increased nitrite production caused by these agents was not only blocked by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and HOE 140 (which blocks B2 kinin receptor) but by the kinin antibody also. For instance, nitrite production elicited by bradykinin, ramiprilat, A23187, and kininogen was reduced to 95+/-8, 87+/-8, 94+/-11, and 85+/-11 pmol/mg (all P<.05), respectively, by the kinin antibody. Carbachol-induced nitrite production (from 66+/-8 to 144+/-13) was blocked by L-NAME but not by HOE 140 or the kinin antibody. These results suggest that either increasing kininogen to promote endogenous kinin formation or inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme to decrease kinin breakdown, increases nitric oxide production in isolated coronary microvessels. These data indicate that a microvessel kallikrein-kinin system has an important role in the control of nitric oxide production in coronary microvessels.", 
    "122": "Using Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a new model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we examined the role of local angiotensin II in cardiovascular and renal complications of NIDDM. OLETF rats were orally given cilazapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 1 or 10 mg/kg), E4177 (an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg), or vehicle for 26 or 40 weeks (from the age of 20 to 46 or 60 weeks). Cardiac mRNAs were measured by Northern blot analysis, and the thickening of the coronary arterial wall and the degree of perivascular fibrosis were determined by an image analyzer. Cilazapril or E4177 did not significantly affect body weight or plasma glucose and insulin levels of OLETF rats, indicating the minor effects on diabetes itself. However, both drugs significantly and similarly prevented coronary microvascular remodeling (the increase in wall thickening and perivascular fibrosis in coronary arterioles and small coronary arteries) in OLETF rats, and they were associated with the suppression of cardiac transforming growth factor-beta1 expression. Both drugs suppressed not only the increase in left ventricular weight but also the downregulation of cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain expression in OLETF rats. Glomerulosclerosis and glomerular hypertrophy in OLETF rats were improved by cilazapril and E4177 to a comparable extent. These results, taken together with the fact that OLETF rats show normal plasma renin levels, support that the AT1 receptor is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac and renal complications in NIDDM.", 
    "123": "Cardiac fibroblasts, as the source of extracellular matrix for the left ventricle, subserve important functions to cardiac remodeling and fibrotic development following myocardial infarction or with pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy. The fibroblast may be the target cell for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) that are cardioprotective and reverse collagen deposition and remodeling but whose mechanisms of action remain controversial. Because we previously documented phenotypic differences between cardiac fibroblasts from the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) left ventricle, the present study evaluated whether phenotypic differences also exist in the release of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolites or in the activation of phospholipase D, and the importance of observed differences to the formation of collagen and the mechanism of action of ACEI. The experimental design compared endogenous sources of arachidonic acid with exogenous prelabeling of cells. Angiotensin II stimulated greater arachidonic acid release than bradykinin, and WKY cells were more responsive than SHR. The major prostanoid formed by cardiac fibroblasts was prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), with more prostacyclin production by WKY cells than SHR cells both under nonstimulated conditions and in response to angiotensin II or bradykinin. Beraprost, a PGI2 analogue, was shown to decrease growth rate and DNA synthesis of fibroblasts and to inhibit mRNA expression for collagen types I and III, with SHR cells being less responsive to beraprost than WKY cells. These results potentially implicate eicosanoid metabolism, particularly PGI2, in collagen formation, fibrotic development, and cardiac remodeling, and they imply that the SHR genetic hypertension model may be predisposed to excess cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "124": "The acute administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril to healthy subjects transiently increases 5.5-fold the plasma levels of a natural stem-cell regulator, N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP). The aim of this study was to measure plasma Ac-SDKP levels during chronic treatment with all types of ACE inhibitors and to assess its relevance as a marker of ACE inhibition. Plasma levels of Ac-SDKP were blindly determined in age- and sex-matched hypertensive patients either treated (ACEI group, n=27) or not (non-ACEI group, n=23) with an ACE inhibitor for more than 1 month. Geometric mean [range] of plasma Ac-SDKP levels were significantly higher in the ACEI group (3.78 [1.48 to 14.5] pmol/mL) than in the non-ACEI group, with no overlap between the groups (0.75 [0.36 to 1.22] pmol/mL, P<.0001). The measurement of Ac-SDKP in plasma discriminated all the patients of the ACEI group, whereas the simultaneous determination of either in vitro (using hippuryl-histidine-leucine as substrate) or in vivo (angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio) ACE activity failed to identify nine and five cases, respectively. We conclude that Ac-SDKP accumulates in plasma during chronic ACE inhibitor treatment. The long-term consequences of Ac-SDKP accumulation are unknown. The reliability of plasma Ac-SDKP measurement makes it the best marker of chronic ACE inhibition, which can help to verify patients' compliance to ACE inhibitor treatment.", 
    "125": "During method development in support of non-clinical studies in animal models, BMS-186716 was found to be extremely unstable in blood and plasma. Stabilization of the compound was achieved by reacting the compound with methyl acrylate (MA) in blood, from which the plasma was then prepared. While the resulting BMS-186716-MA adduct was found to be stable in dog plasma, and hence it was used as the basis for the method developed for analysis of dog plasma samples, the BMS-186716-MA adduct was found to be unstable in rat plasma as it was readily hydrolyzed to BMS-186716-acrylic acid (AA) by native esterases found in rat plasma. Although the finding of the instability of BMS-186716-MA in rat plasma was not the result of prospective planning, we were able to successfully develop a quantitative bioanalytical method using BMS-186716-AA as the analyte instead of the originally planned BMS-186716-MA analyte. The standard and quality-control (QC) samples were prepared by spiking blank plasma with BMS-186716-MA, and then allowing them to stand at room temperature for 1 h to convert BMS-186716-MA to BMS-186716-AA. After adding the internal standard BMS-188035-AA, each sample was acidified with HCl and then extracted with methyl tert.-butyl ether. The reconstituted extract was injected into a HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometric system for detection by positive ion electrospray ionization. A lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) of 5 ng/ml was achieved, using 0.1 ml plasma and a standard curve range of 5-5000 ng/ml.", 
    "126": "The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF), a debilitating condition associated with impaired quality of life and markedly shortened life expectancy, is increasing. The goals of therapy for CHF are reducing symptoms, improving functional capacity, and slowing the progression of the condition. In most cases, this is best achieved with a combination of diuretic and vasodilator therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have several advantages over other vasodilatory agents and are becoming widely used for treating CHF. The most recently introduced ACE inhibitor, fosinopril, is at least as effective as enalapril, and its dual and compensatory route of excretion is particularly advantageous in patients with renal insufficiency. Fosinopril may also have particular benefits in the prevention of CHF, as it has beneficial effects on cardiac function that may help delay the onset of overt cardiac failure.", 
    "127": "Heart failure (HF) still presents a major health problem despite significant understanding of its underlying pathophysiology and recent therapeutic advances. Hypertension is a major risk factor for HF and plays a key role in the evolution of the disease. In an attempt to compensate for the increased peripheral resistance frequently noted in hypertension, the heart may hypertrophy, with the left ventricular enlargement accompanied by fibrosis and resulting in reduced contractility. Ultimately the hypertrophied or fibrosed myocardium is no longer able to maintain normal cardiac output and left ventricular failure occurs. Evidence shows that treating hypertension effectively can have a major beneficial impact on some, but not all, forms of adult cardiovascular disease. For example, the incidence of HF and stroke are clearly reduced; however, until recently, treating hypertension has had relatively little effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events. The benefits of antihypertensive treatment are, however, clearly underestimated, possibly because many studies are too short and because more subtle benefits of treatment have been overlooked. Also, it must be realized that hypertension is a complex disorder and antihypertensive drugs do indeed differ regarding their effects on associated metabolic derangements often seen in hypertensive patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be highly efficacious and safe antihypertensive agents, and have additional favorable effects on metabolic parameters, renal functions, and cardiac hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors are now the mainstay of therapy in the patients with heart failure and it is now well recognized that earlier and more aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce the incidence of HF. ACE inhibitors are an excellent choice as an antihypertensive agent; however, many physicians limit their use of ACE inhibitors due to concern about possible renal side-effects, which accompanied the early use of these agents at very high doses.", 
    "128": "As a result of the increasing cost of health care and the limited resources available, it has become more difficult to allocate resources efficiently and effectively in the health care system. This environment has led to the development of pharmacoeconomic studies, which have been designed in response to the need for assessment of the economic benefits of a product prior to its acceptance in the market. The field of pharmacoeconomics has grown rapidly, especially in relation to the development of new pharmacological products. Economic analysis is now routinely incorporated into many clinical trials, and this type of information, in conjunction with the usual safety and efficacy data, is becoming more important to pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, third party payers, and end-users. The cost-effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of heart failure has been evaluated on the basis of a number of large-scale studies, including the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study and the Veterans Administration Cooperative Vasodilator Heart Failure Trials (V-HeFT I and II). The cost-effectiveness of the ACE inhibitor captopril compares favorably with other cardiac interventions, reducing both mortality and the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Captopril also appears to be cost-effective in the treatment of patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. In addition, analysis of more recent studies of the treatment of fosinopril in patients with mild to moderate CHF have been performed and have proved this newer ACE inhibitor to be cost-saving in these patients.", 
    "129": "The complementary action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics in the treatment of hypertension has been demonstrated in a number of studies of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The combination provides a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure while minimizing the dose-dependent adverse effects of HCTZ, such as hypotension and its metabolic effects on plasma lipoproteins, by keeping the dose of each agent to the minimum. Fosinopril has a unique dual mechanism of elimination and can therefore be used in patients with renal impairment. The efficacy of the combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo and other agents is reviewed in this article. Studies have demonstrated that the combination is effective in the elderly and in renally impaired patients, regardless of severity. In addition, in non-insulin dependent diabetes, antihypertensive effect is achieved without further affecting carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which is often the case when thiazide diuretics alone are used. A matrix study was performed to evaluate the optimum dose combination to produce blood pressure normalization and minimize side effects. This study evaluated 17 different dose combinations and demonstrated that the lowest dose combination to produce a clinically significant effect was fosinopril 10 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg. However, a dose-related antihypertensive effect can be seen, giving the option for the use of 20 mg fosinopril for moderately hypertensive patients. Both combination therapy and fosinopril were significantly more effective than HCTZ alone or placebo. The fosinopril/HCTZ combination has also been shown to have a comparable effect to sustained-release nifedipine and propanolol + HCTZ. The studies reviewed here demonstrate that fosinopril/HCTZ combination treatment has a number of advantages over either agent used alone, providing blood pressure normalization in a broad range of hypertensive patients, including diabetic patients and the elderly.", 
    "130": "Data regarding the tolerance of ACE inhibitors in old age are sparse, despite this class of compound being regarded as one of the first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension. In the present trial, the efficacy and tolerance of the ACE inhibitor fosinopril was examined over a period of 12 weeks in an open trial of hypertensive patients aged over 60 years with diastolic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 110 mm Hg) and isolated systolic hypertension (ISH; systolic blood pressure 160 to 219 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 80 to 94 mm Hg). Fosinopril decreased blood pressure from 174/101 mm Hg to 149/88 mm Hg in patients with diastolic hypertension and from 182/86 mm Hg to 151/80 mm Hg in patients with ISH. Seventy percent of patients did not require any adaptation of the initial fosinopril dose to achieve an adequate therapeutic response. In the patients in whom 20 mg fosinopril did not adequately reduce blood pressure, the addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide was found to be slightly more effective than doubling the initial dose of the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril was well tolerated and the occurrence of drug-dependent side effects was not increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Fosinopril is an excellent therapy for the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients, particularly because, as a consequence of its dual, compensatory excretion, no adaptation of the dose is necessary, even in patients with a physiological reduction in renal function.", 
    "131": "Many studies have clearly documented the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (FAMIS) was a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study investigating the hemodynamic and clinical effects of early (< 9 h from onset of symptoms) administration of fosinopril in 285 patients with anterior AMI undergoing thrombolysis within 6 h of symptom onset. The objective of the study was twofold: 1) to estimate changes in left ventricular (LV) volumes and function over 3 months by a series of echocardiographic evaluations, and 2) to clinically assess mortality and the occurrence of congestive heart failure (CHF) over 2 years. LV volumes measured at baseline (24 to 48 h from symptom onset) were within the normal range in over two-thirds of randomized patients, and the changes in volume were comparable after 3 months of treatment with either fosinopril or placebo. However, fosinopril-treated patients showed a 30% reduction in the 2-year incidence of death or moderate-to-severe CHF (P = .04) despite having a worst prognostic profile at baseline. This benefit of fosinopril was confirmed in the subgroup of patients without CHF on admission, who showed a 34.1% reduction in the 2-year occurrence of CHF (P = .05) and a 29.1% reduction in death or CHF (P = .04). The results of the FAMIS study suggest that early treatment with fosinopril, in conjunction with thrombolysis, can significantly delay the development of CHF in patients with AMI, acting through mechanisms independent of fosinopril's impact on LV remodeling.", 
    "132": "Arterial hypertension is the most common chronic medical condition requiring office visits to physicians and is a major contributing factor to the development of myocardial infarction and stroke. Its importance as a cardiovascular risk factor is at least as significant in women as in men; however, the ever-growing literature on hypertension shows surprisingly little data concerning sex differences. Large clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment have not clearly demonstrated gender differences in blood pressure response and outcome, but the majority of patients in these trials were men. Even so, some evidence indicates that white women treated for hypertension obtain less benefit than men. The pathophysiology of hypertension in men and women is similar in many aspects, but important gender differences are now emerging. Studies designed to clarify these differences are required, as a better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms will allow for a more precise stratification of risk and a more accurate approach to both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment.", 
    "133": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common and clinically important cardiovascular diseases. This pathologic state is characterized not only by well-defined hemodynamic alterations, but also by complex abnormalities involving the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system, and other hormones involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. In addition, there is an abnormality in the homeostatic cardiovascular control exerted by arterial baroreceptors and the viscoelastic properties of medium-size arteries are altered, causing a reduction in arterial compliance. All of these abnormalities can be favorably affected by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have been shown to improve not only the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profiles of CHF, but also patient survival. CHF is accompanied with a decline or some sort of effect on renal function. An ACE inhibitor with a dual route of excretion, such as fosinopril, may be especially useful in treating patients with CHF.", 
    "134": "Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of mortality, and hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease in all ages. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial has shown that the pharmacologic reduction of isolated systolic hypertension can significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications. The aim of the Italian multicenter study reported here is to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fosinopril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a dual route of excretion, with chlorthalidone, the diuretic administered in the SHEP study, in 312 elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Our results show that fosinopril and chlorthalidone produce identical and statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (-23.9 +/- 11.6 mm Hg and -23.7 +/- 10.9 mm Hg, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, in diastolic blood pressure (-7.1 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and -5.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, respectively). Only chlorthalidone caused a statistically significant change in uric acid, total cholesterol, blood urea, and serum potassium concentrations. Fosinopril was also somewhat better tolerated than chlorthalidone. In conclusion, the novel ACE inhibitor fosinopril is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent for use in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension and appears to be a suitable alternative for the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "135": "Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, particularly hypercholesterolemia, are often present in the hypertensive patient. Recent guidelines, ranging from those prepared by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension to those of the three European Societies of Cardiology, Atherosclerosis, and Hypertension, stress the importance of evaluating global risk, based on the presence of all cardiovascular risk factors in an individual or in a group of subjects. It has also been suggested that treatment should aim to correct all modifiable risk factors. This is a reasonable recommendation, but although observational epidemiologic studies have shown that the effects of concomitant risk factors are additive, if not multiplicative, it is surprising that no intervention trial has been undertaken to determine whether the benefits of treating more than one risk factor are also additive. The Plaque Hypertension Lipid-Lowering Italian Study (PHYLLIS) is the first such study. Its aim is to investigate the potential benefit of lowering blood pressure and plasma cholesterol on the progression of carotid plaque in hypertensive patients with elevated plasma cholesterol. Using a factorial design, the antiatherosclerotic effect of two different antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide will be compared. The study aims to confirm animal experiments demonstrating the benefit of ACE inhibitors on experimental atherosclerosis. PHYLLIS will also compare the effects of two lipid-lowering regimens, diet plus placebo and diet plus pravastatin, in the study population. This 3-year, multicenter, double-blind, randomized Italian study, using B-mode ultrasound evaluation of the carotid walls with central reading of the ultrasound scans (Bowman Gray University, Winston-Salem, NC) is now underway and should provide useful evidence about the benefits of multiple risk factor treatment in the hypertensive patient.", 
    "136": "To determine whether changes in density (rho) of infarct and noninfarct zones during healing and remodeling after myocardial infarction influence estimates of left ventricular mass and detection of temporal changes by imaging, we measured weights (g) and volumes (mL) of infarct, noninfarct, and mixed tissue in hearts removed 1 to 42 days after anterior infarction in three groups of dogs: nonreperfused infarction treated with placebo or captopril, or infarcts reperfused after 2 h. In vivo mass was calculated from in vivo diastolic myocardial volumes (echocardiograms) and an assumed density of 1.05 g/mL or actual values derived from tissue weights and volumes. Over the 42 days, actual density deviated more from the assumed value of 1.05 in infarct than noninfarct zones, and the overall density was higher for reperfused than nonreperfused ventricles (1.09 vs. 1.06 g/mL, p < 0.01). Correction for density improved the correlation between absolute in vivo and postmortem mass slightly but not the detection of relative changes in mass in control, captopril, or reperfusion groups. These findings suggest that (i) densities of infarct and noninfarct zones differ and change during healing, especially after reperfusion, and (ii) correction for density provides more accurate estimates of volume-derived mass in reperfused hearts.", 
    "137": "Phencyclidine-like drugs are effective against convulsions and brain lesions related to soman intoxication but induce severe side effects. The well tolerated antitussive dextromethorphan (DM) and its metabolite dextrorphan (DX) have antiepileptic and neuroprotective properties that we evaluated in mice against 2 LD50 of soman in a three-drug pretreatment (atropine sulfate and oxime HI-6 plus DM: 20-50 mg/kg or DX: 10-40 mg/kg i.p). Neuroprotection was evaluated by measurement of hippocampal omega 3 binding site density. DM and DX have weak anticonvulsant and neuroprotective activities which are counterbalanced at high doses by an increased mortality due to respiratory distress for DM and by ataxia for DX. Thus DM and DX do not appear to be appropriate for the pretreatment of soman intoxication.", 
    "138": "To test the hypothesis that platelet activation is present in hypertension, we measured plasma markers beta thromboglobulin and soluble P-selectin in hypertensive patients and normotensive controls. Both markers were raised in the patients (P < 0.05), and in a subgroup of patients, beta thromboglobulin was reduced with successful treatment of hypertension with the ACE inhibitor quinapril. We suggest that reversible platelet activation is present in hypertension. This may be a contributing factor to the link between this risk factor and the development of thrombotic disease such as stroke.", 
    "139": "Side-effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as a slight decrease in hematocrit, are increasingly being reported. A 14-year-old renal transplant patient on enalapril therapy developed anemia with reticulocytosis. She was investigated for other causes of anemia and enalapril therapy was ceased. Her hemoglobin level increased and reticulocyte count decreased after cessation of therapy. No other cause of anemia was found. Although anemia in patients receiving ACE inhibitors such as enalapril has previously been reported, this is the first reported patient who developed anemia associated with mild reticulocytosis and macrocytosis.", 
    "140": "The present in vitro microperfusion study examined the effect of luminal angiotensin II on proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) volume absorption and bicarbonate transport. Neither 10(-11) M, 10(-10) M, nor 2 x 10(-8) M luminal angiotensin II significantly affected PCT transport. When tubules were first perfused with enalaprilat to inhibit endogenous angiotensin II production, addition of 10(-10) M luminal angiotensin II increased volume absorption (0.72 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.07 nl x mm(-1) xmin(-1), P < 0.01) and bicarbonate transport (52.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 67.9 +/- 4.2 pmol x mm(-1) min(-1), P < 0.01). Addition of 10(-6) M losartan, an AT1 inhibitor, to the luminal perfusate inhibited volume absorption (0.95 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.11 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05) and bicarbonate transport (65.0 +/- 7.3 vs. 54.7 +/- 9.2 pmol x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05). Addition of 10(-4) M luminal PD-123319, an AT2 inhibitor, was without effect. In tubules perfused with 10(-4) M luminal enalaprilat and 10(-4) M luminal PD-123319, addition of 10(-10) M luminal angiotensin II in the experimental period resulted in a stimulation in volume absorption (0.61 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.10 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01) and bicarbonate transport (49.9 +/- 6.3 vs. 77.4 +/- 14.3 pmol x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01). In tubules perfused with 10(-6) M losartan and 10(-4) M enalaprilat, addition of luminal 10(-10) M angiotensin II resulted in no change in transport. These data are consistent with endogenous angiotensin II affecting PCT bicarbonate transport in vitro via luminal AT1 receptors.", 
    "141": "The capacity of aging rats to defend body fluid homeostasis in response to a variety of dipsogenic and natriorexigenic stimuli was assessed. Male and female rats of both the Fischer 344 (FR) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) strains were used and tested at target ages of approximately 5, 10, 15, and 20 mo in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. There were no consistent age-related declines in water intake in response to water deprivation or acute administration of hypertonic NaCl; angiotensin (ANG) I, II, III; or isoproterenol. Likewise, there were no major impairments in either urinary excretion of the hypertonic NaCl load or excretion of water or hypotonic NaCl loads, although the latter were excreted more slowly in the older cohorts. The preference/aversion functions for NaCl solutions differed between SD and FR rats, but did not change with age except in male FR rats that lost their aversion to dilute NaCl at 20 mo of age. Intake of hypotonic NaCl solution after acute sodium depletion (furosemide treatment) showed a partial decline with age, and the older rats sustained larger estimated sodium deficits after a 6-h repletion period. A more complete age-related decline was observed in the intake of hypertonic NaCl stimulated by chronic dietary administration of a kininase II inhibitor (ramipril). Male rats of 15-20 mo of age showed no ramipril-induced sodium appetite. Brain ANG II receptor density, determined by autoradiography, declined by almost 50% in the paraventricular nucleus at 20 mo of age and declined slightly in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis but did not decline in either the supraoptic nucleus or subfornical organ. Thus the major deficits in fluid intake in aging rats are related to salt appetite; the mechanism was not identified definitively.", 
    "142": "Neonatal treatment of rats with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan induces irreversible renal histological abnormalities, mainly papillary atrophy, in association with an impairment in urinary concentrating ability. In the present study, sodium and potassium balance were assessed during high and low sodium intake and dietary potassium restriction in adult Wistar rats treated neonatally with enalapril (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) from 3 to 24 days of age. During balance studies, neonatally enalapril-treated rats showed 1) normal adaptation to dietary sodium restriction, 2) sodium retention during dietary sodium loading, and 3) a transient, modest, renal potassium wastage during dietary potassium restriction. Renal clearance determinations under pentobarbital anesthesia showed elevated fractional excretions of sodium and potassium and osmolar clearance without changes in glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow in enalapril-treated compared with vehicle-treated rats. Thus, in addition to the impaired urinary concentrating ability, adult rats treated neonatally with enalapril demonstrated alterations in renal sodium and potassium handling, which may be related to the prevailing papillary atrophy.", 
    "143": "We measured erythrocyte Na+/Li+ and Na+/H+ countertransport (CT) activity (millimoles per liter per cell per hour) in 10 healthy control subjects (age, 38 +/- 4 years; body mass index, 25 +/- 1 kg/m2) and in 25 hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ([NIDDM] age, 49 +/- 3 years; body mass index, 29 +/- 1 kg/m2; fasting plasma glucose, 157 +/- 12 mg/dL) 4 weeks after discontinuation of previous antihypertensive treatment. Na+/Li+ CT was significantly increased in hypertensive NIDDM patients compared with controls (0.56 +/- 0.04 v 0.30 +/- 0.03, P < .01), whereas Na+/H+ CT was similar to control levels (21 +/- 1 v 20 +/- 2). A positive correlation was found between Na+/Li+ CT and the severity of insulin resistance (r = .69, P < .01), mean arterial pressure ([MAP] r = .64, P < .01), plasma triglyceride concentration (r = .46, P < .05), and plasma total cholesterol (r = .41, P < .05). An inverse correlation was found between Na+/Li+ CT activity and plasma insulin concentration (r = -.47, P < .05). No relationship was observed between Na+/Li+ CT activity and either creatinine clearance or proteinuria. Stepwise multiple regression analysis for all metabolic variables and blood pressure showed that only the severity of insulin resistance was positively correlated with increased Na+/Li+ CT activity. Na+/H+ and Na+/Li+ CT activity were not altered by 3 hours of euglycemic physiologic hyperinsulinemia (84 +/- 3 microU/mL). Hypertensive NIDDM subjects were treated for 3 months with captopril, nifedipine, or doxazosin. After captopril, a reduction of Na+/H+ CT was observed (22 +/- 4 v 13 +/- 2, P < .05); Na+/Li+ CT decreased after doxazosin (0.56 +/- 0.06 v 0.45 +/- 0.05, P < .05) and nifedipine (0.52 +/- 0.06 v 0.42 +/- 0.05, P < .05). In conclusion, in hypertensive NIDDM subjects, (1) Na+/Li+ CT is increased and is correlated with the level of insulin resistance and the MAP; (2) acute physiologic hyperinsulinemia does not affect Na+/Li+ or Na+/H+ CT activity; and (3) Na+/H+ CT activity is reduced by captopril, and Na+/Li+ CT is decreased by doxazosin and nifedipine.", 
    "144": "We surveyed 161 medical practitioners in Trinidad and Tobago (124 reporting private sector practice and 37 describing government health centre practice) for their views on blood pressure (BP) management. 96% of the respondents agreed that BP should be measured on all adults seen and 90% agreed that diastolic pressure should be recorded as the disappearance of sounds. There was disagreement over the level of diastolic BP at which drug treatment should be initiated: 63% would treat diastolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, but 35% would only treat diastolic BP of 110 mm Hg or higher. In private practice 31% preferred angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as treatment for an African Caribbean man with diastolic BP 110 mm Hg, but in public clinics 41% preferred thiazide diuretics. ACE inhibitors were most often preferred as treatment for an Indo-Caribbean man with diabetes and diastolic BP 110 mm Hg in both public and private practice. Doctors considered that noncompliance (66%), lack of education (34%) and unhealthy lifestyles (25%) were important obstacles to BP control. In private practice doctors considered patients' financial constraints to be an obstacle (58%), whereas in the public sector limited availability of drugs (57%) was felt to be more important. Less costly and, possibly, more appropriate drugs were used in public clinics.", 
    "145": "Between January 1990 and May 1995, 117 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Holberton Hospital, Antigua, for chest pain due to suspected acute myocardial infarction. 39 (45%) of 86 patients whose records were available for retrospective review had confirmed (27 patients) or probable (12 patients) acute myocardial infarction. Risk factors identified among the patients included hypertension, diabetes, tobacco smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity. On admission, 82% were Killip class I and 18% were Killip class II. Medications in the Intensive Care Unit included nitrates, aspirin, calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, heparin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (21%). No thrombolytic agents were available. The average hospital stay was 10 days and the in-hospital mortality rate was 13%. These data indicate that early mortality from acute myocardial infarction can be reduced in developing countries by early admission to an Intensive Care Unit and use of drugs known to be effective in its treatment.", 
    "146": "Sympathetic and angiotensinergic activation reduce splanchnic oxygen delivery during hypovolemia, which may lead to failure of the intestinal mucosal barrier and eventually multiple organ dysfunction. This study integrates sympathetic and angiotensinergic responses with splanchnic hemodynamics and duodenal mucosal function during hypovolemia and evaluates pharmacologic blockade of either system to ameliorate the impact of acute hypovolemia. Chloralose-anesthetized pigs subjected to 20 and 40% blood volume reductions were randomized to controls or administered guanethidine or enalaprilate to block sympathetic and angiotensinergic activation, as assessed by plasma norepinephrine spillover and angiotensin II levels, respectively. Mesenteric and hepatic oxygen delivery/consumption as well as duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and potential difference were determined. Hypovolemia preferentially increased mesenteric sympathetic outflow and caused a vigorous angiotensinergic activation. Guanethidine and enalaprilate blocked effectively the sympathetic and angiotensinergic responses. Treatment with enalaprilate, but not guanethidine, prevented the reduction of mesenteric oxygenation and duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and potential difference observed in control animals. The down-regulation of mesenteric oxygenation and duodenal mucosal function during hypovolemia can be prevented by administration of enalaprilate, whereas guanethidine is uneffective in this respect. Interference with the reninangiotensin system might be of clinical interest to support mesenteric perfusion and organ function in hypovolemia.",

    "151": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is an ongoing prospective randomized, multicentre trial conducted in 26 countries. There are two main aims of the study. The first is to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The second is to determine the effect on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 18,790 patients have been recruited and randomized, and two-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability, and other available data after 24 months of follow-up of all patients. Special emphasis is given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 5988) compared with young patients (< 65 years, n = 12 802). On average, patients in the < or = 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure target group have reached 85 mmHg, in the < or = 85 mmHg target group patients have reached 83 mmHg and in the < or = 80 mmHg target group patients have reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of those achieving target blood pressure in each target group at 24 months of follow-up is 85% in the < or = 90 mmHg target group, 75% in the < or = 85 mmHg target group and 57% in the < or = 80 mmHg target group. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age), the percentage of patients achieving target at 24 months is higher for all target groups, namely 89% in the < or = 90 mmHg group, 80% in the 85 mmHg group and 62% in the 80 mmHg group. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure was not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was given. Further dose adjustments were made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth, and final, step, a diuretic could be added. There have been relatively few side effects in this large, multinational study of hypertensive patients. Only ankle oedema and coughing exceed a frequency of 0.5% (ankle oedema 1.3% in young and 1.7% in elderly; coughing 0.5% in young and elderly). After two years, 84% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy, felodipine. The 24-month data presented here indicate that it should be possible to fulfil the primary aims of the HOT Study.", 
    "152": "Arterial hypertension may be associated with altered left ventricular filling dynamics. The specific goal of this study was to evaluate whether short-term administration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in hypertensive patients with an altered diastolic pattern induced an improvement of left ventricular dynamics, assessed by the echocardio-Doppler technique, independently of effects on left ventricular mass. In a double-blind cross-over study 39 essential hypertensive patients with a ratio of peak early to peak atrial velocity (E/A) < 1 were randomized, after a run-in period of 2 weeks without any antihypertensive treatment, to receive lisinopril (20 mg once a day) and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. At the end of both the run-in and the treatment periods, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and an echocardio-Doppler examination was carried out. The echocardio-Doppler evaluation was performed both at rest and at the peak of a hand-grip test (3 min at 30% of maximal strength). Left ventricular dimensions were obtained from two-dimensionally guided M-mode tracings using the criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography. Left ventricular peak filling rates and filling rate integrals were measured by a pulsed Doppler technique. Lisinopril caused a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest (-13/-9 mmHg vs baseline values, p < 0.05; -6/-4 mmHg vs placebo values, p < 0.05) and during isometric exercise (-17/-9 mmHg vs baseline period, p < 0.05; -6/-5 mmHg vs placebo, p < 0.05). Lisinopril did not induce any significant change in left ventricular structure and systolic function. All the left ventricular filling parameters considered (E velocity, A velocity, E/A ratio) both at rest and during isometric exercise did not significantly differ after lisinopril treatment when compared to those obtained in basal conditions and after placebo administration. This double-blind cross-over study demonstrates that short-term afterload reduction induced by lisinopril does not modify altered diastolic dynamics in hypertensive patients. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle is a complex process influenced by a number of functional and structural factors and apparently cannot be significantly improved by short-term blood pressure reduction by antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "153": "The concept of initiating treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension with a low-dose combination of reserpine and the thiazide clopamide in comparison to monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor was investigated. A total of 127 adult outpatients with diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 114 mmHg were randomized into this double-blind, parallel group study. After a 2-week wash-out period and a subsequent 2-week placebo run-in period, they were allocated to once-daily treatment with 0.1 mg reserpine plus 5 mg clopamide (R/C), or 5 mg enalapril. If diastolic blood pressure was not normalized after 3 weeks of therapy (i.e. DBP < 90 mmHg), the dosage was doubled from week 4 to 6. The primary efficacy variables were the change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP) after 3 weeks of therapy. Secondary variables included the change in DBP and SBP after 6 weeks of therapy, the BP normalization rates at 3 and 6 weeks and, concerning tolerability, the rates of adverse events after 6 weeks of therapy. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed. The reserpine/ clopamide and enalapril groups did not differ with regard to demographic and baseline characteristics (mean age 57 or 58 years, respectively; 63% or 56% males, respectively; mean SBP/DBP after the 2-week placebo period = 156 mmHg/104 mmHg in both groups). After 3 weeks of treatment with one capsule daily, mean SBP/DBP reduction from baseline (24 h after last medication intake) in the R/C combination group was -19.6/ -17.0 mmHg, in the enalapril group -6.1/ -9.5 mmHg (between-group comparison: 2p < 0.01 for both parameters). The normalization rates for DBP (< 90 mmHg) were 64.1% (R/C) and 28.6% (enalapril) (2p < 0.01). Adverse events that were considered possibly or definitely drug-related by the investigator were noted in 11 patients (17.2%) in the R/C group and in 9 patients (14.3%) in the enalapril group (NS). Two patients in the enalapril group discontinued the study prematurely due to adverse events (cough; skin eruption). In the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension, a low-dose combination of reserpine and clopamide once a day is considerably more effective than, and as tolerable as, 5-10 mg of enalapril once a day. These findings suggest that treatment with a combination of different antihypertensives with different modes of action in low doses is a rational alternative to conventional monotherapy in the first-line treatment of hypertension. Besides, the \"old\" reserpine-diuretic regimen also in these days appears to be a rational alternative to \"modern\" monotherapies.", 
    "154": "The stability of captopril in several extemporaneously prepared oral liquid formulations was studied. Captopril 1-mg/mL oral liquid formulations were prepared from either powder or tablets in two grades of water, syrup, methylcellulose, and edetate disodium. The liquids were stored at 5 degrees C in amber glass containers, and samples were removed at intervals up to 30 days for assay of captopril concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. The pH of the formulations remained fairly stable for 30 days. In general, captopril was more stable in formulations containing captopril from tablets than from powder. Captopril in formulations in which the only vehicle was highly purified water was slightly but not significantly more stable than in formulations made with sterile water for irrigation. Formulations made with undiluted syrup were more stable than formulations in which water was used to dilute syrup or formulations containing methylcellulose. The formulations containing edetate disodium were much more stable than those that lacked this component. The stability of captopril 1 mg/mL in oral liquid formulations was influenced by the captopril source (tablets versus powder) and by the presence of syrup, methylcellulose, and edetate disodium. Captopril in a preparation made with tablets and undiluted syrup was stable for 30 days at 5 degrees C, and the formulation should be palatable.", 
    "155": "The efficacy and safety of nisoldipine CC and lisinopril were compared in 278 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension in a double-blind, placebo run-in trial. Patients were randomized to nisoldipine CC or lisinopril for 8 weeks to achieve a trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) < or = 90 mmHg. Responders were maintained on their optimal dose for a further 8 weeks. Nonresponders were switched to combination therapy and treated for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was carried out during placebo and monotherapy. The responder rate of 73.8% with nisoldipine CC after 8 weeks was greater than 56.1% with lisinopril (p = 0.007). The responder rate with combination therapy was 61%. ABPM showed that both nisoldipine CC and lisinopril produced constant blood pressure lowering effects over the 24-hour period and maintained circadian rhythm. Adverse effects were more frequent with nisoldipine CC (headache and peripheral edema) than with lisinopril (cough) monotherapy. Nisoldipine CC monotherapy was at least as effective as lisinopril monotherapy in the management of mild to moderate hypertension. Both agents were well tolerated. Combination therapy with nisoldipine CC and lisinopril was effective and well tolerated in patients with blood pressure not controlled by monotherapy alone.", 
    "156": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, on heart rate variability in patients with heart failure simultaneously treated with digitalis. This study was a multicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including 50 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). All patients were in NYHA functional class II and III. The etiology of CHF was mainly idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease. After a 4-week placebo run-in period with digoxin and diuretics, patients were randomized to receive additional ramipril or placebo. To assess heart rate variability (HRV) and arrhythmias, 24-hour ECGs were recorded at the end of the placebo run-in period, 8 and 24 weeks after randomization. Spectral analysis of HRV was performed during one diurnal and one nocturnal 5-minute time period. No statistically significant differences in HRV within low-, high-, and total-frequency bands were induced by ramipril in either the diurnal or nocturnal periods, both at 8 and 24 weeks after randomization. Ramipril produced a significant decrease in nonsustained ventricular tachycardia at 24 weeks of treatment (p = 0.01). These results run against previous observations showing an increase in parasympathetic tone with ACE inhibitors in heart failure. The present study thus suggests that the effects of ACE inhibitors in CHF are variable and depend on the patient and concomitant treatment that might influence HRV such as digoxin treatment.", 
    "157": "Smokeless tobacco elicits plasma exudation from the oral mucosa that is mediated by bradykinin, and it decreases the activity of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a peptidase that cleaves and inactivates bradykinin. However, the mechanisms regulating bradykinin-induced responses during exposure to smokeless tobacco are uncertain. The purpose of this study was to begin to address this issue by determining whether inhibitors of ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), a membrane-bound peptidase widely distributed in the oral mucosa that also cleaves and inactivates bradykinin, potentiate a smokeless tobacco-induced increase in macromolecular efflux from the oral mucosa in vivo. Using intravital microscopy, we found that suffusion of an aqueous extract of smokeless tobacco elicited a significant concentration-dependent increase in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (molecular mass 70 kd) leaky site formation in the hamster cheek pouch (p < 0.05). This response was significantly potentiated by captopril and lisinopril, two ACE inhibitors, and by phosphoramidon and thiorphan, two NEP inhibitors (p < 0.05). The effects of ACE and NEP inhibitors were additive. By contrast, a mixture of proteinase inhibitors consisting of leupeptin, Bestatin, and DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid had no significant effects on smokeless tobacco extract-induced responses. Overall, these data suggest that ACE and NEP each play a role in modulating a smokeless tobacco-induced increase in macromolecular efflux from the in situ oral mucosa, in part by regulating local bradykinin catabolism.", 
    "158": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in renal growth and development: exposure of the fetus or neonate to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increases mortality and results in growth retardation and abnormal renal development. This study was designed to investigate the effects of ACE inhibition in the neonatal rat on the expression of genes known to modulate renal cellular proliferation, cell interactions, and extracellular matrix. Newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 14 d, and kidneys were removed for Northern analysis of mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), prepro epidermal growth factor (EGF), clusterin, and renin. Distribution of TGF-beta1, EGF, and clusterin was also determined by immunohistochemistry. Enalapril treatment resulted in 40% mortality by d 14, reduced body and kidney weight, decreased glomerular area, and caused tubular dilatation (p < 0.05 versus vehicle group). Enalapril decreased renal TGF-beta1 and EGF mRNA expression, and increased renal clusterin and renin expression (p < 0.05). Renal tubular immunoreactive EGF was decreased, and clusterin was increased by enalapril treatment. These results indicate that ACE inhibition in the developing kidney reduces the renal expression of critical growth factors, which may account for renal growth impairment. Clusterin expression may increase either due to blockade of tonic angiotensin-mediated inhibition, or as an adaptive response to renal ischemia.", 
    "159": "ACEIs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium antagonists are effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agents but, except in special situations, should be considered alternative drugs for first line therapy until randomized trials show that they are at least as effective as diuretics and beta-blockers in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a broad spectrum of hypertensive patients. ACEIs are particularly indicated for managing patients with congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and patients with diabetic nephropathy, especially in Type I diabetes. Theoretically, the AII receptor antagonists will be equally effective for these indications, and randomized trials are now underway to demonstrate this. Special indications for calcium antagonists in the management of hypertension include angina pectoris, and for the non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is a special indication for long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, although diuretics are preferred. Calcium antagonists have been particularly effective in managing hypertension induced by cyclosporine. They are contraindicated in CHF due to systolic dysfunction and in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The long-term cardioprotective effect of calcium antagonists after a myocardial infarction has been demonstrated only for verapamil and diltiazem in patients with no evidence of LV dysfunction during their infarction. Calcium antagonists should be prescribed for this purpose only when beta-blockers are poorly-tolerated or contraindicated.", 
    "160": "Several adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genes with expanded CAG triplet repeats within their coding regions and extended polyglutamine (Qn) domains within the expressed proteins. Generally, in clinically affected individuals n >/= 40. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase binds tightly to four Qn disease proteins, but the significance of this interaction is unknown. We now report that purified glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is inactivated by tissue transglutaminase in the presence of glutathione S-transferase constructs containing a Qn domain of pathological length (n = 62 or 81). The dehydrogenase is less strongly inhibited by tissue transglutaminase in the presence of constructs containing shorter Qn domains (n = 0 or 10). Purified alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex also is inactivated by tissue transglutaminase plus glutathione S-transferase constructs containing pathological-length Qn domains (n = 62 or 81). The results suggest that tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed covalent linkages involving the larger poly-Q domains may disrupt cerebral energy metabolism in CAG/Qn expansion diseases.", 
    "161": "Mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) is one of several proteins that exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms as a result of a post-translational proteolytic processing event. For ACE we have previously identified a metalloprotease (secretase) responsible for this proteolytic cleavage. The effect of a range of structurally related zinc metalloprotease inhibitors on the activity of the secretase has been examined. Batimastat (BB94) was the most potent inhibitor of the secretase in pig kidney microvillar membranes, displaying an IC50 of 0.47 microM, whereas TAPI-2 was slightly less potent (IC50 18 microM). Removal of the thienothiomethyl substituent adjacent to the hydroxamic acid moiety or the substitution of the P2' substituent decreased the inhibitory potency of batimastat towards the secretase. Several other non-hydroxamate-based collagenase inhibitors were without inhibitory effect on the secretase, indicating that ACE secretase is a novel zinc metalloprotease that is realted to, but distinct from, the matrix metalloproteases. The full-length amphipathic form of ACE was labelled selectively with 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine in the membrane-spanning hydrophobic region. Although trypsin was able to cleave the hydrophobic anchoring domain from the bulk of the protein, there was no cleavage of full-length ACE by a Triton X-100-solubilized pig kidney secretase preparation when the substrate was in detergent solution. In contrast, the Triton X-100-solubilized secretase preparation released ACE from pig intestinal microvillar membranes, which lack endogenous secretase activity, and cleaved the purified amphipathic form of ACE when it was incorporated into artificial lipid vesicles. Thus the secretase has an absolute requirement for its substrate to be inserted in a lipid bilayer, a factor that might have implications for the development of cell-free assays for other membrane protein secretases. ACE secretase could be solubilized from the membrane with Triton-X-100 and CHAPS, but not with n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. Furthermore trypsin could release the secretase from the membrane, implying that like its substrate, ACE, it too is a stalked integral membrane protein.", 
    "162": "Several peptidases have been postulated to degrade the hypothalamic peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), but it is not known if such enzymes contribute significantly to the delivery of GnRH to the pituitary in vivo. Furthermore, the activity of GnRH-inactivating peptidases may vary in different reproductive states, such as across the estrous cycle. In the present study, specific fluorescent substrates were used to measure the activity of the two major GnRH-degrading enzymes, prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) and endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15), in soluble extracts of the median eminentes (ME) of ewes during different phases of the estrous cycle. Levels of EP 24.15 and PEP activity in the ME did not vary significantly across the cycle, although PEP activity was lowest at the time of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. However, a statistically significant decline in PEP activity (18%, P = 0.02) was observed in the ME of OVX ewes in which a surge was induced by estrogen when compared to oil-treated OVX controls, suggesting a possible negative regulation of PEP activity by this steroid. The effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of several peptidase inhibitors on the pulsatile release of LH in the conscious OVX ewe was also examined. No consistent changes in the pattern of LH release were observed with i.c.v. infusion of the EP 24.15 inhibitor N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAY-pAB) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Similarly, administration of the prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor bacitracin, or a more specific inhibitor of this enzyme, Z-Proprolinal (ZPP), did not alter LH release patterns. The results did not demonstrate a major role for changes in the activity of EP 24.15, PEP, or ACE in altering the pattern of GnRH secretion, but a minor reduction in PEP levels may occur at the time of the estrogen-induced LH surge.", 
    "163": "A series of renin inhibitors containing the (2S,3S,5S)-2-amino-1-cyclohexyl-6-methyl-3,5-heptanediol (2-amino-3,5-anti-diol) fragment as a novel transition-state mimic was synthesized, and their biological activities were evaluated. All of the synthesized compounds containing the 2-amino-3,5-anti-diol fragment at the P1-P1' position showed high in vitro renin-inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 10(-8)-10(-10) M range, and most of them caused a reduction of blood pressure when administered orally to salt-depleted, conscious marmosets. The inhibitor (29) with the 4-hydroxypiperidine residue at the P4 position showed the highest activity in terms of both potency and duration of the blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "164": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to potentiate relaxations to kinins in several arteries, but the effects of long-term therapy on the responses to bradykinin in normotensive and hypertensive animals remain largely unknown. Therefore, the effects of 12-week-long ramipril therapy (1 mg kg-1 day-1) on responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Endothelium-dependent relaxations of noradrenaline-precontracted rings to acetylcholine were similar in normotensive rats and ramipril-treated hypertensive rats and more pronounced than in untreated hypertensive group. Higher concentrations of bradykinin (0.1-1 microM) induced slight contractions in noradrenaline-precontracted endothelium-intact rings of normotensive groups and untreated hypertensive group, whereas no response or a transient relaxation were observed in ramipril-treated hypertensive rats. Interestingly, in ramipril-treated hypertensive rats but not in the other groups, 20-min. pretreatment of arterial rings with ramiprilat unmasked or potentiated the relaxations to bradykinin, and these bradykinin-induced relaxations were effectively inhibited by the B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe-140. In conclusion, ramipril treatment clearly improved endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation to acetylcholine, and potentiated of even unmasked the dilatory response mediated via the endothelial B2-kinin receptor in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Since these enhancing effects on arterial relaxation in vitro could not be attributed to reduced breakdown of bradykinin, the present results suggest that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition potentiated the actions of kinins at level of B2-kinin receptors.", 
    "165": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been suggested to improve the function of arterial endothelium and smooth muscle not only through inhibition of angiotensin II formation and reduction of blood pressure, but also via additional pathways, e.g. potentiation of endogenous kinins and enhancement of endothelial autacoid formation. Therefore, we investigated whether 10-week-long quinapril therapy (10 mg kg-1 day-1) could beneficially influence the function of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated Wistar-Kyoto rats, a model of hypertension which is known to be resistant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The quinapril treatment had no long-term blood pressure-lowering effect nor did it reduce the associated cardiac hypertrophy in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl hypertension. In noradrenaline-precontracted arterial rings the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate as well as the endothelium-independent relaxations to nitroprusside and isoprenaline were clearly attenuated in the deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated rats. However, the quinapril therapy was without significant effect on any of these dilatory responses. In the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the relaxations to acetylcholine in untreated and quinapril-treated hypertensive animals were practically absent, whereas in normotensive rats distinct relaxations to higher concentrations of acetylcholine were still present. Interestingly, when endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization was prevented by precontracting the preparations with potassium chloride, no differences were found in relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate between the study groups. Exogenous bradykinin induced small comparable contractions in endothelium-intact mesenteric arterial rings from all study groups. In conclusion, the 10-week-long quinapril therapy did not have any significant effects on arterial function in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl hypertensive rats. Therefore, the present results stress the roles of reduced blood pressure and diminished angiotensin II formation in the beneficial vascular effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the present model of hypertension. Furthermore, since the relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate in the deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated rats were attenuated in the absence and presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibition but not under conditions which prevented hyperpolarization, impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to agonists can be attributed to diminished endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization in this model of hypertension.", 
    "166": "To compare the effects of a potent rat renin inhibitor peptide (RIP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on the intrarenal and plasma renin-angiotensin systems, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with an infusion of vehicle, ramipril or graded doses of the rat RIP (acetyl-His-Pro-Phe-Val-statine-Leu-he-NH2) for 30 min. Kidney and plasma samples were processed rapidly, and angiotensin peptides were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography before measurement by a double-antibody radioimmunoassay. Blood pressure fell identically, by approximately 15 mm Hg, after either the RIP or ACE inhibitor. Plasma Ang II was 83 +/- 20 fmol/ml in vehicle-treated rats and fell to 28 +/- 3 fmol/ml with ramipril (10 mg/kg), the dose-response zenith. Plasma Ang II was significantly lower, 9 +/- 2 fmol/ml, with the highest RIP dose used. Control renal tissue Ang II was 183 +/- 18 fmol/g, fell with ramipril to 56 +/- 6 and then fell to a similar level (47 +/- 10 fmol/g) after RIP. Ang I/Ang II ratios indicated the expected sharp drop in Ang I conversion after ramipril in plasma and tissue. RIP did not influence conversion rate in plasma but was associated with an unanticipated fall in Ang I conversion in renal tissue, perhaps reflecting local aspartyl protease inhibition, which contributes to normal Ang II formation. Also unanticipated was a rise in tissue Ang I concentration during RIP administration. Renin inhibition is more effective than ACE inhibition in blocking systemic Ang II formation, supporting studies suggesting that quantitatively important non-ACE-dependent pathways participate in Ang II formation.", 
    "167": "We investigated the effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and low-salt intake on the survival rate of Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt (6.0% NaCl) diet. The systolic blood pressure of the rats increased gradually from 5 weeks of age and reached >240 mm Hg at 12 weeks of age. At this point, a low-salt diet group received a placebo (group 1, n = 10), and the high-salt diet group was divided into three groups: those given a placebo with the high-salt diet (group 2, n = 15), those given a chow change from a high- to a low-salt diet with a placebo (group 3, n = 14) and those given enalapril (30 mg/kg/day p.o., group 4, n = 14). At 19 weeks of age, all rats in group 1 were alive, and the survival rate of group 2 was only 40% (P < .001 vs. group 1). The survival rates of both groups 3 and 4 were significantly better: 86% (P < .01 vs. group 2) and 93% (P < .01), respectively. This beneficial effect on mortality was accompanied by an amelioration of the elevated plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels and a decrease in the glomerular sclerosis lesion scores in both groups. These results suggested that a high-salt content diet and the renin-angiotensin system are deterioration factors in lethal renal damage and the limitation of the diet salt content and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system are important to improve the survival rate in high-salt-loaded hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats.", 
    "168": "To determine the effect of beta blockade on parasympathetic nervous system activity, we assessed RR variability during 24-hour Holter monitoring in 10 patients with congestive heart failure before and after 3 to 4 months of treatment with the beta blocker carvedilol. High-frequency power increased from 26 to 64 ms2, root-mean-square of successive differences in RR interval increased from 14.3 to 23.7 ms2, and percentage of absolute differences >50 ms between successive normal RR intervals increased from 0.8% to 4.7%, all p <0.01, indicating a substantial increase in parasympathetic modulation of RR intervals.", 
    "169": "Drugs can cause cardiac arrhythmias in a number of clinical situations, and many of the implicated agents are used to treat non-cardiac conditions. These adverse effects are frequently idiosyncratic, but are often mediated via triggered activity causing torsade de pointes. Drugs being used for treatment of cardiac conditions may promote arrhythmias by re-entrant mechanisms or via triggered activity. Many drugs may cause cardiac arrhythmic complications when taken in excessive amounts. Keys to reducing the incidence of drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias include increased awareness among the medical, pharmaceutical and nursing professions of the potential problems in using certain agents, especially in specific situations. Appropriate monitoring when such treatment is essential and, after diagnosis, prompt withdrawal of the offending agent and treatment for the arrhythmia should be initiated.", 
    "170": "Renal transit time usually refers to tubular transit time, as introduced by Taplin, but other measures of renal transit have been proposed. Here we examine the vascular transit time (VTT, following Rutland) and the standard deviation of tubular transit time (SDTT, following Britton) in a group of 30 patients having baseline and ACE-inhibitor 99Tcm-MAG3 renography prior to arteriography. A same-day, low-dose/high-dose protocol was used for renography; only the post-captopril dose was high enough to measure VTT. Pre-captopril, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for SDTT was rho = 0.52 (n = 53 kidneys; P < 0.0002); post-captopril, rho = 0.54 (n = 49 kidneys; P < 0.0002). For VTT, the post-captopril value was rho = 0.24 (n = 30 kidneys; N.S.). For comparison, the same statistics were calculated for Taplin's original measure of transit time: the time from injection to maximum count rate (peak time). Pre-captopril, for peak time, rho was 0.47 (n = 53 kidneys; P < 0.001); post-captopril, rho was 0.39 (n = 50 kidneys, P < 0.01). These findings confirm the diagnostic value of SDTT but not of VTT. SDTT correlated better than peak time with the arteriographic findings.", 
    "171": "Nearly all physiological functions as well as pathophysiological events display reproducible rhythmic changes within 24 hours of a day, including the cardiovascular system. Clinical chronopharmacological studies with antihypertensive drugs gave evidence that effects on the rhythms in blood pressure and heart rate are also dependent on the time of day. Chronopharmacokinetic studies with propranolol, oxprenolol, nifedipine, verapamil, etc. also revealed daily variations in the drugs' kinetics. In general, Cmax was higher and/or tmax shorter after morning than evening dosing of these rather lipophilic drugs. However, independently of whether or not daily variations in the kinetics were found the dose-response relationship was always dependent on the time of day. These data demonstrate that PK/PD modelling has to take into account reproducible rhythmic variations both in the kinetics and/or effects of cardiovascular active drugs.", 
    "172": "Acetyl-N-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is a physiological inhibitor of the proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells. In 12 healthy volunteers treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (20 mg day-1 for 15 days), we studied plasma and urinary AcSDKP levels, the in vitro degradation of AcSDKP by plasma ACE and the numbers of circulating haematopoietic progenitors (granulocyte-monocytic colony forming unit: CFU-GM; burst forming unit-erythroid: BFU-E; and mixed colony forming unit: CFU-mixed). During treatment, plasma and urinary AcSDKP concentrations increased 2- to 5-fold, degradation of AcSDKP was reduced, and CFU-mixed significantly increased by 100% while BFU-E and CFU-GM significantly decreased by 16% and 26%, respectively. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors may be of value during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, warranting further study.", 
    "173": "Based on results from a multitude of clinical trials of acute myocardial infarction, the beneficial role of a variety of pharmacologic agents, used in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy, has emerged. This is particularly true for aspirin, beta-blockers, heparin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In addition, the dosage and timing of their administration have been shown to be crucial to their efficacy. The scientific and pathophysiologic basis as well as practical recommendations regarding their use are discussed. The exact role of nitrate therapy and potential for magnesium are presented in addition to data on agents that might be detrimental in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "174": "There are few studies on the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists in hypertensive patients with moderate renal insufficiency. We undertook an open study on the effects on renal function, albumin excretion and blood pressure of the slow-onset, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, lacidipine, in 14 patients with stable, chronic renal insufficiency (mean assessed GFR 0.78 ml/s, range 0.50-1.17 ml/s) and moderate hypertension. Following a 2 week washout phase, lacidipine was administered for 24 weeks in a dose of 2 mg/day with the dose being titrated at 2 weekly intervals to a maximum of 6 mg/day in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Frusemide was introduced if blood pressure was not controlled on the maximum lacidipine dose. Blood pressure, creatinine clearance, 24 h urinary albumin excretion and plasma creatinine and albumin concentrations were measured at regular intervals throughout the study. Isotopic GFR was determined at the end of the washout period and at week 24. Lacidipine was not very effective in controlling blood pressure and had an adverse effect on renal function. In 3 patients with an incipient nephrotic syndrome this necessitated withdrawal from the study. Mean GFR of the 10 patients who completed the study decreased from 0.69 ml/s/1.73 m2 at baseline to 0.56 ml/s/1.73 m2 at week 24 (p = 0.006) with a decline in GFR being observed in 9 of these patients. The decrease in GFR was greatest in patients with poorly controlled blood pressure. An insignificant increase in mean urinary albumin excretion occurred during the study with this increase being observed only in patients with albuminuria > 1 g/24 h at baseline. These findings indicated that systemic hypertension altered glomerular hemodynamics and that the vasodilatation of pre-glomerular vessels which followed introduction of the calcium antagonist may have exacerbated this situation. The withdrawal of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor during the washout period may have contributed to these changes. We suggest that renal function should be monitored closely in patients with renal insufficiency when a calcium antagonist is being used to control blood pressure, particularly in those with either marginal blood pressure control, significant albuminuria or an incipient nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "175": "Little attention has been paid to nephropathies and proteinuria in renovascular hypertension (RVH). Recently there has been a growing interest in the conditions induced by RVH. 10 cases of RVH were diagnosed by angiography and renin sampling from renal veins in the last 6 years in our hospital. The patients were all male and mean age was 64 +/- 8 (SD) years. Data were as follow: protein excretion was 3.8 +/- 2.2 g/day (> or = 3.5 g/day in 8 patients), sBP 202 +/- 24 mmHg, dBP 113 +/- 17 mmHg, serum renin concentration 64 +/- 45 pg/ml, and ipsilateral/contralateral renal vein renin ratio 3.3 +/- 1.0. RVH was treated by nephrectomy in 3 patients, percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTA) in 2, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) administration in 8. Biopsies were performed on contralateral kidney in 4 patients. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS) was found in 3 patients, and nephrosclerosis in 1, whereas only nephrosclerosis was found in nephrectomized kidneys in all 3 patients. After nephrectomy, PTA and the treatment by ACE-I, not only blood pressure but also proteinuria was markedly reduced. These findings suggest that severe stenosis of the renal artery led to renal ischemia, which activated renin excretion, to cause glomerular hyperfiltration through vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles in the contralateral kidney. FGS-like lesion thus induced appeared to have caused massive proteinuria.", 
    "176": "To investigate the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on nitrate tolerance during continuous nitrate therapy, coronary artery diameters and platelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels were measured before and 2 minutes after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin 200 microg in 60 patients with coronary artery disease and were compared among 20 patients treated with nitrates (nitrate group), 20 patients treated with both nitrates and enalapril (enalapril group), and 20 untreated patients (control group). The percent increase in platelet cGMP and coronary dilatation in the nitrate group was significantly less than in the control group, but the percent increase in the enalapril group was significantly greater than that in the nitrate group. These results indicate that enalapril may be helpful as concomitant therapy to maintain the effect of nitrates during continuous nitrate therapy.", 
    "177": "Part of the beneficial effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are due to augmenting the actions of bradykinin (BK). We studied this effect of enalaprilat on the binding of [3H]BK to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected to express the human BK B2 receptor alone (CHO-3B) or in combination with ACE (CHO-15AB). In CHO-15AB cells, enalaprilat (1 mumol/L) increased the total number of low-affinity [3H]BK binding sites on the cells at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, from 18.4 +/- 4.3 to 40.3 +/- 11.9 fmol/10(6) cells (P < .05; Kd, 2.3 +/- 0.8 and 5.9 +/- 1.3 nmol/L; n = 4). Enalaprilat preserved a portion of the receptors in high-affinity conformation (Kd, 0.17 +/- 0.08 nmol/L; 8.1 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(6) cells). Enalaprilat decreased the IC50 of [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK, the BK analogue more resistant to ACE, from 3.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.41 +/- 0.16 nmol/L (P < .05, n = 3). The biphasic displacement curve of the binding of [3H]BK also suggested the presence of high-affinity BK binding sites. Enalaprilat (5 nmol to 1 mumol/L) potentiated the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and the liberation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) induced by BK and [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK. Moreover, enalaprilat (1 mumol/L) completely and immediately restored the response of the B2 receptor, desensitized by the agonist (1 mumol/L [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK); this effect was blocked by the antagonist, HOE 140. Finally, enalaprilat, but not the prodrug enalapril, decreased internalization of the receptor from 70 +/- 9% to 45 +/- 9% (P < .05, n = 7). In CHO-3B cells, enalaprilat was ineffective. ACE inhibitors in the presence of both the B2 receptor and ACE enhance BK binding, protect high-affinity receptors, block receptor desensitization, and decrease internalization, thereby potentiating BK beyond blocking its hydrolysis.", 
    "178": "We determined whether local bradykinin production modulates cardiac adrenergic activity. Depolarization of guinea pig heart sympathetic nerve endings (synaptosomes) with 1 to 100 mmol/L K+ caused the release of endogenous norepinephrine (10% to 50% above basal level). This release was exocytotic, because it depended on extracellular Ca2+, was inhibited by the N-type Ca(2+)-channel blocker omega-conotoxin and the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro31-8220, and was potentiated by the neuronal uptake-1 inhibitor desipramine. Typical of adrenergic terminals, norepinephrine exocytosis was enhanced by activation of prejunctional angiotensin AT1-receptors and attenuated by adrenergic alpha 2-receptors, adenosine A1-receptors, and histamine H3-receptors. Exogenous bradykinin enhanced norepinephrine exocytosis by 7% to 35% (EC50, 17 nmol/L), without inhibiting uptake 1. B2-receptor, but not B1-receptor, blockade antagonized this effect. The kininase II/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and the addition of kininogen or kallikrein enhanced norepinephrine exocytosis by approximately equal to 6% to 40% (EC50, 20 nmol/L) and approximately equal to 25% to 60%, respectively. This potentiation was prevented by serine protease inhibitors and was antagonized by B2-receptor blockade. Therefore, norepinephrine exocytosis is augmented when bradykinin synthesis is increased or when its breakdown is inhibited. This is the first report of a local kallikrein-kinin system in adrenergic nerve endings capable of generating enough bradykinin to activate B2-receptors in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and thus enhance norepinephrine exocytosis. This amplification process may operate in disease states, such as myocardial ischemia, associated with severalfold increases in local kinin concentrations.", 
    "179": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is a determinant of vascular events. Subjects in metabolic wards are at high risk for these events. The renin-angiotensin system modulates plasma PAI-1 levels. An insertion (4G)/deletion (5G) polymorphism is involved in the regulation of the circulating levels of PAI-1. We have evaluated the levels of plasma PAI-1 in 208 individuals from our metabolic ward and correlated these levels with the 4G/5G genotype as well as with a genotype (homozygosity for a deletion polymorphism, DD genotype) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. Homozygosity for the insertion genotype (5G/5G) was associated with PAI-1 levels lower than those associated with the deletion genotype (4G/4G) (26.2x/:1.6 versus 33.7x/:1.7 ng/mL, P = .036). Plasma PAI-1 levels appeared to depend on the genotype (P = .014) as much as on age (P = .044), t-PA (P = .0001), or triglyceride levels (P = .005). The association between triglycerides and PAI-1 was significant in subjects carrying the 4G/4G and the 4G/5G genotypes (P = .013 and .036, respectively) but not in those with the 5G/5G genotype. When stratified according to PAI-1 and ACE genotypes, individuals homozygous for both deletions (4G/4G-DD genotypes) exhibited higher plasma PAI-1 levels compared with those of individuals without such homozygosities. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that in a group of subjects from a metabolic ward, a 4G/5G polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene exerts effects on plasma PAI-1 antigen levels comparable to those of established determinants. The association between triglycerides and plasma PAI-1 levels is genotype dependent. A trend to a positive interaction between ACE DD and PAI-1 4G/4G in the regulation of circulating plasma PAI-1 levels is present in this setting.", 
    "180": "PURPOSE AND DESIGN OF STUDY: Asymmetric-induced changes of the renogram under angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-i), i.e. lateralization, is probably the most distinctive finding for the detection of haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) in compensated kidney, since bilateral and symmetric patterns are non-specific. In the Consensus statement of diagnostic criteria of renovascular hypertension with captopril renography (Am J Hypertens 1991; 4: 749-755S) ACE-i-induced asymmetry of renograms for the left and right kidney was viewed as vitally important. However, detection of change in split function is a reliable parameter only when using a glomerular tracer, i.e. 99mTc-DTPA. No indication regarding a more widely used tubular tracer such as 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3) has been given.", 
    "181": "The theoretical contralateral curve, called 'expected renogram', was calculated frame by frame from renal curves obtained under ACE-i and one of two baseline curves. The expected renogram was compared with the recorded ipsilateral curve. More than +/- 2 SD difference between expected and recorded renograms was assumed as suggestive of monolateral or bilateral RAS. Twenty-nine patients with angiographically proven RAS (bilateral in 12) and 20 patients without arteriographic evidence of stenosis were evaluated by postcaptopril/baseline 99mTc-MAG3 renography. Results obtained with the expected renogram analysis were compared with those obtained by standard criteria which included: improvement of peak time under baseline conditions, wash-out (75%) time, and monolateral or bilateral residual cortical activity > 10%, but asymmetrical, i.e. with > 5% change in split function. Compared to the standard evaluation, the use of the expected renogram for the diagnosis of RAS improved the specificity from 70 to 95% (P < 0.03) without loss of sensitivity (79.3%). Follow-up data after revascularization were available in 18 scintigraphically positive and six scintigraphically negative patients with RAS. The sensitivity of the expected renogram method referring to short-term (1 month) patient outcome following revascularization was 88.8%. The beneficial effects on blood pressure response persisted in 77% of the these patients at 18 months. Notably, four of six scintigraphically negative patients with RAS did not show any short-term benefit from revascularization and the improvement in blood pressure values lasted for 18 months in only one case.", 
    "182": "The high specificity of the expected renogram method reduces the number of unnecessary invasive procedures. This is a critical point for a low-prevalence disease such as renovascular hypertension.", 
    "183": "The greatest change in GFR in response to treatment with cyclosporin occurs in the first 3-6 months and the magnitude of the decrement in the first year (or perhaps the first few months) appears to be a vital indicator of future problems. However, the apparent stabilization of renal function, particularly when monitored only by plasma creatinine, can conceal progressive tubulointerstitial injury, and increasing proteinuria is an ominous sign. Although lower doses of cyclosporin and careful monitoring of renal function may be helpful, there is at present no pharmacological intervention to protect or reverse the reduction in GFR that occurs. We believe that the vascular lesion induced by cyclosporin is fundamental, with early and initially reversible cyclosporin-induced vasospasm leading to progressive vascular damage with activation of endothelial cells and increased platelet interactions. Amongst other determinants, the renal response to this vasculopathy will depend on the balance between the presence of vasoactive factors with the vasoconstrictors promoting interstitial fibrosis and the vasodilators inhibiting proliferation. It is likely that the kidneys of heart-transplant recipients are chronically ischaemic and as a consequence their renin-angiotensin systems massively activated, which may further sensitize their kidneys to cyclosporin. Overproduction of angiotensin II, associated with the DD ACE genotype, has already been associated with poor prognosis in diabetic and IgA nephropathy. It is interesting to speculate that this ACE genotype, which is associated with a poor outcome in non-ischaemic heart disease can influence renal sensitivity to cyclosporin and predict the development of morphological injury. Extension of these experimental findings into the clinical arena with a placebo-controlled trial of early introduction of ACE inhibitor therapy in recipients of cardiac transplants would be timely.", 
    "184": "Bradykinin exerts important influences on renal hemodynamics and tubular function by acting on renal bradykinin B2 receptors. However, the precise sites and mechanisms of its actions on the kidney are not known. To help elucidate the mechanisms of renal actions of bradykinin in vivo, we have employed high resolution electron microscopic autoradiography to localize bradykinin B2 binding sites in the rat kidney following intravenous administration of a radiolabeled ligand, 125I-HPP-Hoe140 (3-4-Hydroxyphenyl-propionyl-DArg0-[Hyp3-Thi5-D-Tic 7-Oic8]-bradykinin), a derivative of the highly selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe140. In non-treated rats, bradykinin B2 binding sites were localized to the cell bodies and the luminal brush border of the proximal convoluted tubules in the cortex. In the medulla (except for the outer stripe of the outer medulla), binding occurred in the distal tubules, thin limbs of the loop of Henle, collecting ducts, peritubular capillary endothelium and renomedullary interstitial cells. To exclude the possibility that the radioligand may bind to angiotensin converting enzyme, rats were pretreated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril. In these rats, binding to the cell bodies and the luminal brush border of the proximal convoluted tubules in the cortex was completely abolished, while binding remained unaltered in the medulla. Further studies using high performance liquid chromatography revealed that while the radioligand was degraded following systemic administration in nontreated rats, the degradation was significantly reduced in the rats pretreated chronically with perindopril. These results indicate that binding detected in the proximal tubules in the normal rats is due primarily to the tubular uptake of the degraded radioligand, and that bradykinin B2 binding sites occur predominantly in the renal tubules, vascular endothelium, and renomedullary interstitial cells of the renal medulla.", 
    "185": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have uniformly been shown to prevent the development both of proteinuria and of glomerulosclerosis in rats with a remnant kidney.

Animals were allocated randomly to one of four groups: control (no treatment), amlodipine (A rats), benazepril (B rats), or a combination of benazepril and amlodipine (B + A rats). We implanted intraperitoneal sensors for telemetric monitoring of the animal's blood pressure. Other parameters measured at baseline included proteinuria and inulin clearance. After approximately 7 weeks all of the parameters were remeasured and animals killed for morphologic assessment of the kidney.",

The degree of glomerulosclerosis in the B + A rats was also reduced markedly compared with that in A rats (12 +/- 4% for B + A rats versus 43 +/- 12% for A rats, P < 0.05). Moreover, the results on proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis of B + A rats were similar to those for B rats. These differences could not be explained totally in terms of differences in blood pressure control (144 +/- 12 mmHg in A rats versus 132 +/- 13 mmHg in B + A rats, NS).",

    "191": "Three strains of rats anesthetized with urethane were used (normotensive Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR), and [TGR(mREN-2)27]). In addition, the effects of lisinopril treatment on SDR and transgenic animals were tested. The neuronal discharge frequency and the pattern were recorded extracellularly, and their behaviors in response to angiotensin and angiotensin antagonists administered iontophoretically were analyzed.", 
    "192": "Angiotensin-sensitive neurons located in the ventral posteromedial and ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei, and in the zona incerta were excited mainly by angiotensin II. The increase in the firing rates induced by administration of angiotensin II often coincided with an increase in the number of bursts of discharges. Effects induced by angiotensin II could be blocked by administration of specific antagonists (losartan, PD 123319). Long-term treatment with lisinopril reduced the neuronal responsiveness to angiotensin II in SDR significantly in comparison with that of untreated SDR controls. Lisinopril-treated SDR had a significantly lower responsiveness to angiotensin II than did hypertensive transgenic rats that had been treated with lisinopril.", 
    "193": "The results show for the first time that administration of angiotensin II induced changes in discharge rates of somatosensory neurons, and that long-term administration of lisinopril caused a significant difference between the neuronal responsiveness to angiotensin of normotensive SDR and that of hypertensive transgenic rats.",

Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-alpha can reduce viremia and improve renal disease. After liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus-associated liver failure, standard immunosuppressive protocols result in a significant increase in hepatitis C viremia. In this report we describe a patient with end-stage liver disease and biopsy-proven hepatitis C-associated glomerulonephritis who underwent liver transplantation. Within 1 month after transplantation, he developed a severe nephrotic syndrome that paralleled a marked increase in viremia. We discuss the possible pathogenic relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the nephrotic syndrome that followed liver transplantation.", 
    "195": "The ACE/angiotensin II/bradykinin system is inextricably linked to some of the processes that contribute to the generation of atherosclerosis at genetic, molecular, biochemical and pharmacological levels. There is a large body of laboratory-derived experimental data that suggests that inhibition of ACE activity has antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects that can modulate this atherosclerotic process from the earliest form of endothelial dysfunction, to delay of lesion formation in primary atherosclerosis or in myointimal proliferation after PTCA. The clinical evidence for these potential benefits is so far sparse. There are several possible explanations for these discrepancies. Firstly, the role of the ACE/bradykinin/angiotensin II system in the local vascular response to either the primary process of atherosclerosis, or to the injury induced by balloon angioplasty is likely to vary between species and models. Secondly, there is a tendency to ensure the presence of ACE inhibitor in high concentration before or during the vascular insult in animal models, whereas this has not been the case in the clinical studies of post-PTCA restenosis. Whilst the animal studies therefore offer potentially valuable insights into the mechanics of local vascular response, the ability of ACE inhibitors to interfere with such mechanisms now needs to be tested in clinical trials that are each aimed at precisely answering specific questions. The experimental data so far lend considerable support to the fact that drugs acting solely by interference with the angiotensin II-receptor complex are at a theoretical disadvantage, when compared with ACE inhibitors, since the former would be expected to have little effect on bradykinin-mediated activities. To the established benefits of ACE inhibitors in left ventricular dysfunction, and the interesting possibility that there may be an anti-ischaemic action in these circumstances, we may add the promise of the TREND study. In the coming years, there is an urgent requirement for intensive investigation into the ability of ACE inhibitors to modulate the various stages of the atherosclerotic spectrum. For now though, the jury remains out.",

    "197": "Hypertrophied and failing myocardium has been shown to undergo creatine kinase (CK) isoform switching, resulting in increased MB and BB components. We tested the hypothesis that chronic volume overload hypertrophy due to mitral regurgitation in the dog causes CK isoenzyme switching and that this could be reversed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Thirteen adult mongrel dogs had mitral regurgitation induced by mitral valvular chordal rupture: six were treated with ramipril for 4 months and seven were untreated for 4 months. Twelve dogs were sham-operated: six received ramipril for 3 months and six were untreated. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased from 58+/-4 to 104+/-10 ml in untreated (P<0.001) and from 55+/-3 to 91+/-6 ml in treated dogs (P<0.01) as LV mass/volume ratio decreased in both untreated (1. 60+/-0.07 to 1.13+/-0.08 g/ml, P<0.001) and treated dogs (1.44+/-0.06 to 1.20+/-0.08 g/ml, P<0.01). CK-MB isoform was 7.4+/-1.1% in normal shams and increased to 13.5+/-1.9% and 18.1+/-3.0% in both treated and untreated mitral regurgitation dogs; respectively (P<0. 05). Steady state CK-B mRNA increased three-fold in treated and untreated dogs with mitral regurgitation (P<0.003) compared to normals, while CK-M mRNA expression did not differ in all groups. Thus, chronic volume overload hypertrophy of mitral regurgitation induces CK isoform switching by selective induction of the CK-B gene, and ramipril therapy does not affect this isoform switch. This may reflect a response to increased diastolic stress and more efficient energy utilization in the volume overloaded myocardium.", 
    "198": "Denervation in man often results in shiny, dry, thin skin. A previous study has shown that the epidermis of glabrous skin in the rat becomes approximately 40% thinner within 1 week following sciatic nerve transection, but which nerve fiber type or types influence epidermal thickness is unknown. In this study, we compared the effects on the epidermis of selective sensory, motor, and sympathetic denervation. Protein gene product 9.5 and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunocytochemical staining were used to determine the extent of denervation of epidermis, dermis, and sweat glands in the footpads. Epidermal thickness of the glabrous plantar skin of the foot was measured. To verify the specificity and reliability of each animal model, the relevant regions of the peripheral nervous system were examined by light or electron microscopy or both. Epidermal thickness decreased significantly following sciatic nerve transection (58% of control, P < 0.05) and dorsal root ganglionectomy (59%; P < 0.05). The thickness also decreased following lumbar ventral rhizotomy (61%; P < 0.01), destruction of lumbar spinal motor neurons (66%; P < 0.05), and botulinum toxin-induced paralysis of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles (70%; P < 0.05). A slight decrease followed dorsal rhizotomy (84%; P < 0.01). In contrast, no significant alterations in epidermal thickness were detected following sham operation and sympathectomy. Epidermal thinning was paralleled by reductions in the amounts of transcripts for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin. These results suggest that selective loss of both sensory and motor fibers to the hind limb can contribute to reducing epidermal thickness in rat foot glabrous skin.",

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays combined with antibody supershift/depletion demonstrated that NF-kappa B subunits p50, p52, c-rel, p65 (RelA) and RelB were all activated. Immunocytochemical analysis using an antibody to the p50 subunit demonstrated activation occurring predominantly in nuclei of tubular cells. Treatment of animals with unilateral ureteral obstruction with an oral ACE inhibitor significantly decreased NF-kappa B activation. This suggests that the antiinflammatory effect of ACE inhibitors in renal disease is in part due to a blunting of NF-kappa B activation.", 
    "213": "This experiment was designed to investigate the possible involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in the mechanism underlying stretch-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs from the rabbit aortic media were grown on polystyrene rubber-bottomed dishes coated with type I collagen. Cells were stretched cyclically by a vacuum-operated downward flexion of the culture dish bottom. A 1.4- to 1.6-fold increase in proliferation of SMCs was induced by cyclic stretching, as determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation, in a stretch force-dependent manner in the range of 5% to 15% elongation, 30 cycles/min for 24 h. Expression of PDGF-B chain mRNA was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner in the range of 2 to 24 h, 10% elongation, and 30 cycles/min. Saralasin, a selective antagonist of Ang II, and captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, significantly suppressed the stretch-induced proliferation of SMCs. Blockade of angiotensinogen mRNA translation by antisense oligonucleotide inhibited proliferation under the mechanical strain. Stretch-induced proliferation was inhibited by 78% in the presence of anti-PDGF-AB neutralizing antibody. Increased expression of PDGF-B chain mRNA under the mechanical strain was inhibited by treatment with saralasin. Our results indicate that the stretch-induced proliferation of cultured SMCs is mediated at least in part via increased production of Ang II by the local renin-angiotensin system and a subsequent up-regulation of PDGF-B chain mRNA in an autocrine-paracrine manner.",

We assessed whether the activity of this enzyme reflects vascular damage in a genetic rat model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in humans. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats fed a regular chow were treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril for 16 wk. Systolic blood pressure increased in a time-dependent manner in the untreated OLETF rats as compared with that in the control Long-Evans Tokushima (LET) rats. The blood pressure elevation was associated with increases in cardiac and aortic weight. Imidapril treatment significantly attenuated the blood pressure elevation and reduced the increases in cardiac and aortic weight. The untreated OLETF rats had higher plasma glucose and insulin concentrations than did the LET rats and presented with glucosuria at the age of 22 wk. Imidapril treatment strikingly decreased plasma glucose levels and the glucosuria. Plasma insulin concentrations decreased, approaching those of the non-diabetic control LET rats. ACE inhibitor treatment attenuated the nodular lesions in the glomeruli of OLETF rats and improved the kidney function. Serum NAG activity increased significantly by 35% in the untreated rats; this increase was attenuated significantly by imidapril treatment. The reduction in serum NAG activity correlated with improvement in cardiovascular injury. In contrast, there were no changes in urinary NAG excretion in the three OLETF rat groups. In addition, NAG excretion did not correlate with indices of cardiovascular injury. These data suggest that serum NAG activity is useful in predicting injury in the cardiovascular system in rats with diabetes mellitus.",

Drug research into restenosis prevention has been hampered by problems with the definition of restenosis and the applicability in humans of animal models.

At baseline and subsequently at the end of third, sixth, and twelfth months, each patient underwent an integrated echocardiographic study and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, casual or monitored (p < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (from 125 +/- 32 to 100 +/- 12 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with amlodipine and from 106 +/- 18 to 89 +/- 10 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with fosinopril). The decrease in left ventricular mass was essentially caused by a reduction of ventricular thickness. Free right ventricular wall thickness was also lowered in both groups, more consistently with amlodipine (from 8.0 +/- 2.1 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mm; p < 0.01), without an increase in plasma natriuretic peptide and insulin concentrations or heart rate. With both treatments, the decrease in ventricular mass was not associated with impairment of systolic function, whereas a trend toward an improvement of Doppler echocardiographic indexes of biventricular diastolic function was observed. In conclusion, both amlodipine and fosinopril induced similar qualitative effects on anatomy and function of both ventricles. The clinical meaning of these observations must be defined further by means of adequately sized prospective trials.", 
    "217": "Chronic renal disease evolves to end-stage renal failure through events, including enhanced intraglomerular pressure and plasma protein ultrafiltration, mediated at least in part by angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce intracapillary pressure and ameliorate glomerular size-selective function, which may account for their antiproteinuric effect and renoprotective potential. Thus, the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study found a significant correlation between enhanced urinary protein excretion and faster disease progression in non-diabetic patients with proteinuric chronic renal disease. In proteinuric non-diabetic renal disease at comparable levels of blood pressure control, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression to end-stage renal failure safely and more effectively than non-angiotensin-converting enzyme therapy. On the contrary, most non-proteinuric chronic renal diseases progress slowly and do not benefit specifically from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy.", 
    "218": "Because diuretic drugs remain the main treatment for disorders of sodium and water metabolism, the quest for improved diuretic and natriuretic agents continues in the hope of achieving fewer side effects and a more rational basis in pathophysiology. One aim has been to enhance endogenous diuretic and natriuretic activity by selective manipulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and related compounds. The first approach has been to inhibit degradation of these peptides using inhibitors of their main catabolic enzyme, neutral endopeptidase, and to offset any antagonistic effect of the renin-angiotensin system by combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The second and more recent approach has been to inhibit breakdown of the second messenger of atrial natriuretic peptide, cGMP, using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. As yet, neutral endopeptidase inhibition has not advanced successfully beyond animal experimentation and phosphodiesterase inhibition is still in its infancy. Both strategies suffer from the problem that, on the one hand, neutral endopeptidase metabolizes a variety of bioactive peptides, including endothelin, and it is not possible to develop inhibitors that will be selective for a given peptide; whereas, on the other hand, there are several phosphodiesterase isoforms metabolizing cGMP and cAMP, both second messengers for many different bioactive compounds, and selective inhibitors are still under development.", 
    "219": "We compared total costs and adherence to the regimen of older versus newer angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. A computer search using the data base of a health care insurer identified 6176 subjects age 65 years or older who had ICD-9 coding for hypertension only and had a new prescription for an ACE inhibitor dispensed between April 1, 1992, and January 31, 1993. Subjects receiving concurrent antihypertensive drugs were included. Total cost of therapy included acquisition costs for the ACE inhibitors and concurrent antihypertensive agents, and nondrug costs. Other costs were laboratory tests, hospitalization, and clinic visits associated with monitoring outcomes of antihypertensive therapy. Total median cost per month was greater for older than for newer agents, $59.82 versus $53.09 (p<0.0009). The mean percentage of patients complying with therapy as determined by refill data was greater with newer than with older agents, 66% versus 58% (p<0.0001). Based on our results, newer ACE inhibitors should be first-line antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients. They also should be considered for elderly patients who are unresponsive to older ACE inhibitors.", 
    "220": "Hypertension occurs about twice as frequently in diabetics as in the general population, with a prevalence of approximately 25% in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 50% in patients with newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Studies strongly suggest that hypertension is involved in the progression and perhaps the onset of diabetic nephropathy, which is a major cause of illness and premature death in diabetic patients, largely through accompanying cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal failure. A large body of evidence has accumulated that emphasizes the beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment in reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function in both IDDM and NIDDM. It appeared that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists, notably nondihydropyridine, calcium antagonists, and second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, produce a more beneficial effect on nephropathy in terms of reducing proteinuria and slowing progression to renal failure. These drugs are attributed nephroprotective capacity beyond their systemic blood pressure lowering effects, and initial clinical trials with combinations have revealed additive effects on reduction in albuminuria and have led to the lowest rate of decline in glomerular filtration rates with the lowest incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "221": "Both essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus affect the same major target organs-the brain, the fundi, the heart, and the kidneys. The common denominator of hypertensive/diabetic target organ disease is the vascular tree. Both hypertension and diabetes are well identified risk factors for atherogenesis. Coronary artery disease is much more common in diabetic hypertensive patients than in patients suffering from hypertension or diabetes alone. Typical for the diabetic hypertensive heart are extensive degenerative changes and a greater degree of hypertrophy compared with the nondiabetic hypertensive heart. The combined presence of hypertension and diabetes concomitantly affects glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, thereby greatly accelerating a decrease in renal function. Hypertension accelerates the development of diabetic retinopathy; hypertensive/diabetic cerebral disease leads to vascular dementia, transient ischemic attacks, and strokes. A decrease in the hemodynamic and glycemic burden is the primary goal in the management of the hypertensive diabetic patients. Both diuretics and beta-blockers have been reported to adversely affect the overall risk factor profile in the diabetic patient. In contrast, the postsynaptic alpha-blockers, the calcium antagonists, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to be either neutral or beneficial with regard to the overall metabolic risk factor profile. The combination of a heart rate lowering calcium antagonist, particularly verapamil, with an ACE inhibitor offers some potential to either prevent or reverse target organ disease associated with hypertension and diabetes.", 
    "222": "Insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been shown to be a determinant for serum ACE level and a marker for several cardiovascular diseases. We investigated whether the ACE gene can predict the therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors in essential hypertensive patients. The response of blood pressure and plasma renin activity (PRA) 1 h after 50 mg captopril administration were evaluated in 82 inpatients with untreated essential hypertension (42 men, 40 women; mean age +/- SD: 52 +/- 13 years; range: 27 to 79 years) in relation to ACE genotypes. There were no differences in age, gender, blood pressure, and PRA in the basal conditions, among essential hypertensive patients with the II, ID, and DD genotypes (n = 36, 34, and 12, respectively). The acute responses of PRA and blood pressure to an ACE inhibitor were similar in the three groups. The blood pressure response was negatively correlated with baseline PRA (r = 0.497). These data suggest that PRA but not the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is a useful predictor of the short-term antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "223": "We explored the putative inhibitory effects of losartan, a potent nonpeptide, AT1 receptor antagonist, against thromboxane A2 (TxA2)/prostanoid (TP) receptor-mediated transcapillary shift of plasma fluid and proteins. The effects of the TP receptor agonist U-46619 (1.25 or 10 microg/kg intravenously) on hematocrit (Hct), albumin extravasation (AE), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. U-46619 dose-dependently increased Hct (by 4.5% +/- 0.7% and 7.5% +/- 1.0% at the low and high dose, respectively; both P < .05 v vehicle-infused group) and decreased MAP (by 7.9% +/- 4.1% and 16.8% +/- 5.7% at the low and high dose, respectively; P = NS and P < .05 v vehicle-infused group, respectively). In these experiments, using a quantitative Evans blue technique, we showed that U-46619 dose-dependently increased AE in kidney, lung, spleen, and testis (by approximately 31%, 172%, 52%, and 57% at the highest dose) but not in adipose tissue, brain, liver, mesentery, and skeletal muscle. In the heart, AE was maximally increased by the low dose of U-46619. The U-46619 (10 microg/kg)-induced increases in Hct and AE and decreases in MAP were blocked by pretreatment with the TP receptor antagonist SQ 29,548 (2.5 mg/kg intravenously + 2.5 mg/kg/h) and the high dose of losartan (40 mg/kg intravenously). The low dose of losartan (10 mg/kg intravenously) did not significantly alter the responses to U-46619 except for the AE, which was reduced in some but not all tissues. Furthermore, the U-46619-induced changes in Hct (+6.3% +/- 1.7%), MAP (-13.9% +/- 8.4%) and AE were not affected in rats pretreated with the converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Thus, selective activation of TP receptors by U-46619 induced plasma fluid and protein exudation; these responses were specifically attenuated by the relatively high dose of losartan, suggesting that this compound acts as a TP receptor antagonist in this experimental model.", 
    "224": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the delayed effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on blood pressure and on structural and functional alterations in mesenteric small resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The ACE inhibitor fosinopril (25 mg/kg/day) was administered according to three different schedules: in one group of SHR from 4 to 8 weeks of age (n = 12), in a second group from 8 to 12 weeks of age (n = 15), and in a third group from 4 to 12 weeks of age (n = 12). Eighteen untreated SHR and 18 untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. About half the animals in each group were killed at 13 weeks of age, and the remaining were killed at 38 weeks of age. After death, relative left ventricular mass (left ventricular weight/body weight) was calculated. Vascular morphology (media:lumen ratio) and function (responses to norepinephrine and acetylcholine) in mesenteric small resistance arteries were then assessed using a micromyographic technique. Short-term fosinopril, given either before or after the development of hypertension, persistently reduced (but did not normalize) systolic blood pressure, vascular structural alterations, and reactivity to norepinephrine in mesenteric resistance arteries in SHR. These favorable effects were maintained at least for 26 to 30 weeks after treatment withdrawal. The endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine was improved at 13 but not at 38 weeks of age, in treated SHR. Therefore, the vascular response to norepinephrine seems to be dependent mainly on the structure of the vessels, whereas endothelial function is probably more linked to the hemodynamic load.", 
    "225": "The present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic administration of the arginine analogue L-Name (50 mg/kg body weight), the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg/kg body weight), and perindopril (2 mg/kg) plus L-Name (50 mg/kg) on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensinogen, and hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA levels in young and adult rats. The drugs were given daily from birth to day 21 to puppies and for 15 days to adults. Analytical procedures were performed on day 21 for the puppies and at 10 weeks for the adults. In puppies, blood pressure did not change with L-Name, it decreased to 45% of control values (P < 0.001) with perindopril, and decreased to 77% of control values (P < 0.05) with perindopril plus L-Name. In adults, blood pressure increased to 129% of control values (P < 0.02) with L-Name, decreased to 80% of control values (P < 0.05) with perindopril, and did not change with perindopril plus L-Name. Compared with controls, plasma renin activity was unchanged in puppies and adults with L-Name, undetectable in puppies and slightly increased in adults with perindopril, undetectable in puppies and slightly decreased in adults with perindopril plus L-Name. With L-Name, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies and slightly increased in adults, while plasma angiotensinogen levels were decreased (P < 0.05) in puppies and increased (P < 0.01) in adults; with perindopril, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies and slightly decreased in adults, while plasma angiotensinogen levels were undetectable in puppies and decreased (P < 0.05) in adults; with perindopril plus L-Name, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies while plasma angiotensinogen levels were undetectable in puppies and decreased (P < 0.01) in adults. This study suggests that during the early postnatal period (1) nitric oxide does not exert a basal vasodilator tone but contributes to the hypotensive state induced by perindopril, (2) angiotensin II is essential to maintain blood pressure, (3) and angiotensinogen mRNA levels are not influenced by nitric oxide or angiotensin II.",

    "232": "Recent studies have shown that increased intake of dietary sodium chloride produces blood pressure-independent increase in cardiac and renal mass even in young normotensive rats. With advancing age the harmful cardiovascular effects of increased dietary sodium are not so well known. In the present study the influence of advancing age on the cardiovascular effects of increased intake of sodium (control diet, 0.3% and high-sodium diet, 2.6% sodium in the chow) were examined in young and aged (3 and 18 months old, respectively, at the beginning of the experiment) male normotensive Wistar rats in a six-week study. Moreover, the potential role of renin-angiotensin system in ageing during normal and a high-sodium intake was studied using a pharmacological tool, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril. Ageing did not significantly modify basal systolic blood pressure measured by the tail cuff method. A high intake of sodium chloride increased blood pressure significantly only in aged rats, while in young rats it increased renal weight. Left ventricular weight was not affected by high-sodium diet in either age group. The ACE inhibition during control diet lowered blood pressure and decreased left ventricular weight in young rats only and these effects were completely blocked by a high-sodium diet. The maximal vascular contraction force of mesenteric arterial rings to noradrenaline was decreased with ageing while endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation responses were unaltered with ageing. The sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside was impaired by the high-sodium diet in young rats. In both age groups the urinary excretion of calcium was increased during the high-sodium diet. In conclusion, the increased intake of sodium produced different changes in cardiovascular function in normotensive rats depending on age. With advancing age, the sensitivity to sodium-induced increase in blood pressure was increased. In aged rats a high intake of dietary sodium elevated blood pressure, while in young rats it increased renal mass without increase in blood pressure. In both age groups sodium did not affect left ventricular hypertrophy. Both high-sodium intake and ageing attenuated or even abolished the cardiovascular effects of ACF inhibition.", 
    "233": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a complex clinical syndrome, especially in the elderly, which results from cardiac dysfunction. Epidemiological studies have shown a gradual increase in age-adjusted hospitalisation rates for CHF and overall population prevalence of CHF during the last 2 decades in Western countries. The healthcare costs associated with CHF are considerable and are likely to increase in the near future. Hence, identification of risk factors which could induce or exacerbate CHF is of major importance. NSAIDs are frequently prescribed in elderly patients for several rheumatological and nonrheumatological indications. Numerous adverse reactions, mainly related to the gastrointestinal tract and kidney function, have been described for NSAIDs. In addition, some case reports have suggested a causal relation between the use of NSAIDs and the onset of CHF. The pathophysiology of CHF and the pharmacological properties of NSAIDs support this hypothesis. In particular, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may adversely affect cardiovascular homeostasis in patients with a propensity to develop CHF. Notwithstanding the adverse effects, however, the prescription of NSAIDs in elderly patients is often desirable and justifiable. Therefore, further pharmaco-epidemiological research is needed to quantify the risk for CHF attributable to the use of NSAIDs and to identify patients who are particularly susceptible to the adverse cardiovascular effects of these agents. In these patients, it may be advisable to avoid the use of NSAIDs.", 
    "234": "Previous studies of the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the process of cardiac remodeling have devoted little attention to potentially beneficial alterations in collagen fiber morphology and microscopic organization. The present work is part of a continuing effort to define mechanisms responsible for changes in microscopic material properties of cardiac tissue that are induced by such pharmacologic therapy. Morphologic evaluation of 11 cardiomyopathic (CM) and 5 control hamsters was performed. Six CM hamsters received captopril for 3 months in their drinking water (2 gm/l), and five other CM hamsters and five normal control hamsters received no treatment. Myocyte and collagen content, organization, and fiber size were defined with the use of circular statistics in fixed sections that were stained with picrosirius red and viewed with polarized light. The scar regions from both treated and untreated CM hearts manifested similar collagen fiber thicknesses, organization (angular deviation 21.1 \u00b1 0.7 degrees vs. 19.2 \u00b1 2.2 degrees, untreated vs. treated, p = NS), and content (65.0% \u00b1 2.2% vs. 65.7% \u00b1 3.7%, untreated vs. treated, p = NS). However, significant muscle fiber disarray was observed in myocytes in the non-necrotic zones near scars for both treated and untreated CM heart, and a strong trend toward normalization of myocyte alignment was observed after captopril therapy. In the present study, captopril exerted no significant effect on collagen content, two-dimensional fiber organization, or fiber thickness in either scar or nonscar regions. Thus, the beneficial effects of captopril on cardiac material properties in ventricular remodeling associated with heritable cardiomyopathy does not appear to be related to alterations in collagen fiber morphology or organization. However, the trend toward normalization of myocyte alignment induced by captopril in non-necrotic zones suggests a possible mechanism for the known beneficial effects of captopril on favorable ventricular remodeling.",

Moexipril (10 mg/kg per day), HCTZ (10 mg/kg per day), alone or in combination, as well as 17 alpha-estradiol (30 micrograms/kg per day) were given to OVX SHR immediately after surgery and studied for short- and long-term effects (14 and 56 days respectively). All drugs were given orally. Histomorphometric data on the secondary spongiosa of proximal tibial metaphyses (cancellous bone) and tibiofibular junctions of tibial shafts (cortical bone) were analyzed. Ovariectomy induced cancellous bone loss in SHR by inducing negative bone balance. Estrogen prevented ovariectomy-induced cancellous bone loss in the SHR by reducing bone turnover and partially suppressing the coupling of bone formation to resorption on the endocortical surface. HCTZ reduced blood pressure after 1 week of treatment, yet this effect was no lower than that seen in controls after 3 weeks of treatment. Two weeks of HCTZ transiently prevented ovariectomy-induced increases in bone turnover rate and eroded surface. This delayed ovariectomy induced trabecular bone loss in the proximal tibial metaphysis, but had no effect on the tibial shaft. Like HCTZ, moexipril also reduced blood pressure after the first week of treatment but it had no apparent effect on either the proximal tibial metaphysis or the tibial shaft. A combination of moexipril and HCTZ exhibited a much more potent hypotensive effect and had the same effect on bone mass and dynamic end-points as HCTZ alone. Our data indicate that (1) HCTZ treatment has some transient beneficial effects on both antihypertension and osteoprotection in hypertensive osteopenic rats, (2) the combination of moexipril with HCTZ improved the antihypertensive effect but did not potentiate or hamper the osteoprotective effect of HCTZ, and (3) the skeletal effect of estrogen is not impacted by the hypertensive state. These findings are relevant for the use of ACE inhibitor and thiazide diuretics, alone or in combination, in antihypertensive therapy in postmenopausal women.",

Monotherapy with DIU reduced SBP (175+/-3 mm Hg; P<.05) and normalized EDR and left ventricular hypertrophy but did not provide effective renal protection. In hypertensive DS, impaired EDR and left ventricular hypertrophy were positively correlated with SBP. In addition, we found a significant correlation between cardiac hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that impaired aortic EDR, and therefore decreased aortic compliance, positively contributed to left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to but independently of SBP [F(2,37)=6.29; P=.004].",

In untreated SHRSP, the last blood pressure measurement before the first stroke sign was significantly higher than in SHRSP of the same age treated with perindopril. Withdrawal of the treatment resulted in a rise in blood pressure in all the treatment groups, to approximately 260 mm Hg within 4 weeks. Most of the rats treated for 8 or 12 weeks died within 10 weeks after withdrawal of treatment, whereas those treated for 24 weeks survived up to 43 weeks of age.

    "277": "The beneficial therapeutic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the result of reduced angiotensin II formation and possibly also of an accumulation of bradykinin that is inactivated by ACE. In particular, recently developed ACE inhibitors with tissue-penetrating properties, such as quinaprilat, may exert vascular effects via the bradykinin B2-receptor. To test direct arterial effects of quinaprilat and enalaprilat and to study their effects on vasodilation induced by bradykinin, venous occlusion plethysmography was used during local intra-arterial drug administration into the brachial artery in healthy volunteers. The response to bradykinin was augmented by both ACE inhibitors, but the effect of quinaprilat (3.9 nmol/min) was exclusively attributable to its direct vasodilator action. Enalaprilat (13 nmol/min) did not change baseline blood flow in the human forearm circulation. In contrast, quinaprilat significantly increased arterial flow from 3.5 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 0.7 mL/100 mL tissue/min, which was inhibited by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (8 micromol/min IA). Moreover, the effect of sodium nitroprusside (0.023 to 22.9 nmol/min) was substantially attenuated during concomitant administration of quinaprilat. These results suggest that quinaprilat induces vascular effects beyond the inhibition of angiotensin II formation; it causes vasodilation by increasing vascular nitric oxide production and thereby attenuates the relaxing effect of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside.", 
    "278": "We examined the effect of long-term enalapril treatment on renal function and histology in the monogenetically hypertensive TGR(mRen2)27 rat strain. Untreated transgenic rats had significantly (P<.01) higher blood pressures than treated transgenic and control animals throughout the study. Urinary nitric oxide metabolite excretion was significantly lower in young transgenic rats and rose with enalapril, suggesting abnormal TGR nitric oxide production and its correction by enalapril. Converting enzyme inhibition produced preferential preglomerular vasodilatation and increased renal blood flow (6.5 +/- 0.5 versus 9.0 +/- 0.7 mL/min per gram kidney weight, P<.05) without altering whole-kidney and single-nephron glomerular filtration rates in TGR(mRen2)27. Glomerular capillary pressure fell modestly in treated transgenic animals (54 +/- 1 versus 50 +/- 1 mm Hg, P<.05). These hemodynamic changes were associated with reductions in albuminuria (59 +/- 6 versus 9 +/- 2 mg/d, P<.01) and glomerulosclerosis in TGR. However, urinary albumin excretion (15 +/- 3 versus 3 +/- 1 mg/d, P<.05) and glomerulosclerosis also declined in treated control animals in the absence of significant alterations in glomerular hemodynamics. The mechanism of the beneficial effect of enalapril on the TGR(mRen2)27 kidney is unclear but could involve either control of hypertension or suppression of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",

At the end of the treatment, high doses of losartan and enalapril significantly reduced the arterial systolic blood pressure compared with the untreated SHR to the level of WKY rats. But low doses of losartan and PD123319 were without effect. High doses of losartan and enalapril also significantly reduced both the left ventricular (LV) weight and the ratio of LV to body weight compared with the untreated SHR, which were still larger than that of WKY rats. However, the collagen concentration of SHR treated with high doses of losartan or enalapril was completely reduced to the level of WKY rats. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we examined the mRNA expression for ACE, AT1, and AT2 in experimental animals. The enhanced AT1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the SHR treated with a high dose of losartan or PD123319 compared with the untreated SHR. The level of ACE mRNA was also decreased in the SHR treated with a high dose of losartan or enalapril. The level of AT2 mRNA was not significantly different between the Wistar-Kyoto rats and the SHR; however, this expression was decreased significantly after the treatment with a high dose of losartan or PD123319. These results indicate that AT1 receptor and ACE, but not AT2 receptor, play a crucial role in the remodeling of matrix tissue but a smaller role in the development of the hypertrophy of LV myocyte in SHR and that the LV/body weight changes do not fully account for the complete suppression of hypertension.", 
    "280": "Combined therapy with an angiotensin-II type I receptor (AT1) antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor results in more complete suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, the blood-pressure response and safety of combining AT1-receptor blockade with losartan for ACE inhibition were evaluated in patients with congestive heart failure who were already treated with maximally recommended or tolerated doses of an ACE inhibitor. Forty-three patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were evaluated biweekly for 1 month before addition of losartan and weekly during administration of losartan at a daily dose of 25 mg for the first week and 50 mg for the second week. Systolic blood pressure, which remained unchanged before addition of losartan, decreased from 122 +/- 18 mm Hg to 112 +/- 17 and 107 +/- 17 mm Hg (p < 0.001) after 1 week of 25 mg and 1 week of 50 mg losartan, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure also significantly decreased. The decreases in blood pressure were well tolerated by all patients, even by those in whom symptomatic hypotension developed during uptitration of ACE inhibition. Serum potassium and sodium and parameters of renal function remained unchanged. Combining AT1-receptor blockade with losartan to maximally recommended or tolerated ACE inhibition appears safe and leads to further vasodilatation in symptomatic patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "281": "To determine how short-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor affects drug-induced reflex bradycardia at different ages in conscious rats, we compared the magnitude of drug-induced reflex bradycardia before and after injecting bolus intravenous doses of lisinopril, 1 mg/100 g, in male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 4 (young) or 19 (old) months. Anesthetic artifacts were avoided by recording all drug-induced cardiovascular responses from femoral arterial cannulas implanted 1 week earlier. For eliciting reflex bradycardia, blood pressure was increased by graded intravenous infusion of angiotensin or phenylephrine. Impairment of reflex bradycardia in old rats occurred only during pressor responses to angiotensin but not when blood pressure was equally increased with phenylephrine. Subsequent administration of lisinopril affected neither pressor and reflex bradycardic responses to phenylephrine nor pressor responses to angiotensin. However, contrary to the baroreflex enhancement described previously by others, the reflex bradycardia induced by angiotensin was reduced by lisinopril treatment but only in old and not in young rats. Thus our results indicate that whereas angiotensin-induced reflex bradycardia was already impaired in old rats before lisinopril was given, it was reduced further after short-term lisinopril treatment.", 
    "282": "In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of benazepril, 10 mg, and amlodipine, 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, compared with benazepril, 10 mg, monotherapy in patients with hypertension inadequately controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor monotherapy. After a 2-week placebo and 4-week single-blind benazepril, 10 mg once daily, run-in period, 448 patients, 213 men and 235 women, aged 24-73 years (mean, 55 years), with mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =95 and < or =120 mm Hg at the end of the benazepril run-in period, were randomized to receive one of the following treatments once daily for 8 weeks: (a) benazepril, 10 mg, plus placebo (BZ10); (b) benazepril, 10 mg, plus amlodipine, 2.5 mg (BZ10/AML2.5); or (c) benazepril, 10 mg, plus amlodipine, 5 mg (BZ10/AML5). Before the patients were admitted to the trial, at the end of the placebo run-in and the benazepril run-in period and at the end of weeks 4 and 8 of the treatment period, sitting and standing blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and body weight were measured 22-26 h after the intake of the trial medication. Both BZ10/AML2.5 and BZ10/AML5 combinations showed better antihypertensive activity than did BZ10 monotherapy at the terminal visit as demonstrated by (a) the 24-h postdosing sitting and standing systolic BP (SBP) and DBP values, which were statistically lower with combination therapy than with BZ10; (b) the success rate, which was statistically higher with both the combinations (69.2% in the BZ10/AML2.5 and 65.8% in the BZ10/AML5 group) compared with the BZ10 group (40.5%). The tolerability was good in the three treatment groups. No significant abnormal laboratory data were detected. There was no difference in efficacy and safety/tolerability between the BZ10/AML2.5 and BZ10/AML5 groups.", 
    "283": "Angiotensin II enhances platelet aggregation through activation of the G protein-linked pathway present in platelets. Studies of several angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated marked differences on platelets. Therefore this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study compared the ex vivo effects of equivalent antihypertensive doses of captopril, enalapril, and fosinopril on platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) formation in subjects with stage I-II essential hypertension. Nineteen male subjects with a baseline mean seated blood pressure of 141 +/- 3/100 +/- 1 mm Hg were enrolled. The decline in mean arterial pressure after 4 weeks of stable dosing was 10 +/- 1, 12 +/- 1, and 11 +/- 1 mm Hg for captopril, enalapril, and fosinopril, respectively (p = NS). There was no significant change in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, epinephrine-, or thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation from baseline or between ACE inhibitors. Compared with baseline, fosinopril decreased TxB2 concentrations 27.5-67.6% with all stimuli after 1 and 5 min. Captopril also decreased TxB2 formation, but this effect was stimulus and time dependent. Enalapril consistently increased TxB2 concentrations, independent of stimuli or time. We conclude that different ACE inhibitors have distinct effects on platelet TxB2 formation without significant effects on platelet aggregation. Fosinopril may be a direct antagonist ofTxA2 synthase, suggesting benefit in syndromes of platelet activation or vascular occlusion.", 
    "284": "Impaired baroreflex function is a characteristic feature of congestive heart failure (CHF), although the mechanism is obscure. This study examined the hypothesis that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to baroreflex dysfunction in CHF. The acute effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, on baroreflex-mediated changes in heart rate (HR), total and renal noradrenaline (NA) spillover rates were examined in conscious rabbits with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathic CHF. Studies were performed under resting conditions and in response to changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine infusions. Seven saline-treated (normal group) and 11 doxorubicin-treated rabbits (1 mg/kg administered intravenously twice weekly) were studied after 4 and 6 weeks' treatment. Five CHF rabbits received saline (C group) and 6 enalaprilat infusion (ACEI group) during each study period. After 4 weeks of doxorubicin, baroreflex-HR responses were normal, whereas baroreflex-NA spillover responses were enhanced. Enalaprilat infusion shifted the HR-MAP curve downwards to the left but had no effect on the NA spillover-MAP curves. After 6 weeks of doxorubicin, when CHF was established, baroreflex-HR and NA spillover curves were depressed. At this stage, enalaprilat had little effect on the HR-MAP curve but restored towards normal the NA spillover-MAP curves. The results suggest that the endogenous renin-angiotensin system contributes to attenuated baroreflex responses when CHF is established.", 
    "285": "We investigated whether angiotension II was involved with diabetic nephropathy in the mouse model. Twelve days after streptozotocin (STZ) injection, the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) level was increased by 118% of the baseline value. On days 21, 28, 35 and 42 after STZ injection, the UAE levels were significantly increased compared with the level at day 12. A marked elevation of creatinine clearance and diabetic-induced renal hypertrophy were also observed on day 49 after STZ injection. The 35-day treatments of captopril and Dup 753 (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist) significantly attenuated the increment of UAE levels (26.4% on day 14 and 34.6% on day 28). PD123177 (angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist) also attenuated the increment of UAE (24.7% on day 14) at the dose of 150 mg/kg. Furthermore, Dup 753 partially prevented diabetic-induced renal hypertrophy. These results suggest that angiotensin II type 2 receptor as well as type 1 receptor may be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy in the STZ-induced diabetic mice, and these mice are beneficial models of early diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "286": "The effects of enalaprilate on duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion (in situ titration) and mean arterial blood pressure were investigated in chloralose-anesthetized male rats. A bolus injection of enalaprilate (0.7 mg/kg intravenously) increased alkaline secretion by about 60%, and this response was resistant to guanethidine (5 mg/kg intravenously), splanchnicotomy, and vagotomy. Furthermore, angiotensin II infusion (0.25-2.5 microg/kg/hr intravenously) following the administration of enalaprilate failed to influence this response. Bradykinin (10(-6)-10(-4) M) applied topically to the serosal surface of the duodenal segment under study increased dose-dependently the duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion, an effect that could be blocked by the selective bradykinin receptor subtype-2 antagonist HOE140 (100 nmol/kg intravenously). HOE140 also antagonized the response to enalaprilate. These data suggest that enalaprilate increases duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion via a local bradykinin pathway involving receptors of the bradykinin receptor subtype-2 antagonist, rather than by blockade of endogenous angiotensin II or by central autonomic neural regulation.", 
    "287": "Myocardial infarction is an important cause of heart failure because it cause tissue loss and contractility disturbances. In chronically infarcted hearts the increase in the collagen content in the extracellular matrix of the surviving viable myocardium has been considered a major factor contributing to development of heart failure. Postinfarction neuroendocrine activation involving the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in this cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "288": "As collagen synthesis and degradation are dynamic processes and postinfarction remodeling is a time-dependent phenomenon, rats submitted to coronary artery ligation to produce myocardial infarction were treated with captopril after infarction (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, daily) to investigate whether blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can prevent postinfarction myocardial hypertrophy and reactive fibrosis. Groups of rats with myocardial infarction were treated with captopril throughout the protocol period (6 weeks), or during the first 3 weeks after infarction (early therapy), or only during the last 3 weeks of the protocol (late therapy). Untreated groups of rats with or without myocardial infarction were used as control subjects. All animals were killed 6 weeks after surgery to evaluate hypertrophy of heart chambers and collagen deposition in the right ventricle wall and in surviving left ventricular muscle. Protein and hydroxyproline concentrations were assayed biochemically in these tissue homogenates. Only rats with an infarct covering 20 to 40% of the left ventricular surface were included in the study. In the control uninfarcted group (n = 12), hydroxyproline content was 152 +/- 12 micrograms in the right ventricle and 370 +/- 30 micrograms in the left ventricle. These values increased (P < .05) to 232 +/- 13 and 630 +/- 46 micrograms, respectively, in the group with myocardial infarction (n = 8) without treatment. These values were significantly reduced (P < .05) to 160 +/- 9 micrograms in the right ventricle and 520 +/- 40 micrograms in the left ventricle in the group with myocardial infarction treated with captopril for 6 weeks. The percentage decreases in collagen content and myocardial weight produced by captopril were similar. Thus, hydroxyproline concentration (mg hydroxyproline muscle), which increases significantly in both ventricles after myocardial infarction, was not modified by captopril therapy. Protein concentration in the right and left ventricular muscles decreased after myocardial infarction. This decrease was enhanced in the infarcted groups submitted to captopril treatment, mainly in the group treated for 6 weeks. Lesser effects on hypertrophy and hydroxyproline content were observed in the groups of rats treated with captopril in only the earlier or later phase of infarction.", 
    "289": "It is concluded that captopril reduces similarly postinfarction hypertrophy and collagen deposition in surviving myocardium. These effects, although less intense, also occur when the drug is used for a short period immediately after myocardial infarction or when used later, when ventricular remodeling is almost fully developed.",

Mean peak oxygen consumption (peak Vo2) was 17.4 mL/min/kg (range, 14.2-19.9 mL/min/kg) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28% (range, 13-40%). Exercise duration in the captopril group showed a significant increase after 12 weeks (P < .05) of treatment compared with the spirapril group. Peak oxygen consumption tended only to increase in the captopril-treated patients compared with the spirapril-treated patients.

Captopril therapy reduced LVED k, myocardial HPRO, collagen type I/III, and augmented collagen solubility (43+/-4) in SHRs to values similar to those measured in WKY controls. Hydralazine therapy, despite a favorable effect on LVED k in SHRs (20.+/-1.6, P<.01 compared with untreated SHRs), failed to influence either myocardial HPRO (4.18+/-0.18) or collagen type I/III (8+/-1) but did improve collagen solubility (31+/-2).", 
    "295": "An association between alterations in LVED k and collagen solubility but not between changes in LVED k and total collagen or phenotype ratios after antihypertensive therapy in SHRs suggests that myocardial stiffness in hypertension is the consequence of an enhanced myocardial collagen cross-linking rather than of an increase in total collagen or type I phenotype concentrations.", 
    "296": "In this study, we evaluated the effect produced by lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricular, I.C.V.) infusion of the selective angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) antagonist, D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7) (A-779), in the modulation of the baroreflex control of heart rate in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats (2K1C) treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. Twenty days after the surgery to produce renovascular hypertension, I.C.V. cannulas were implanted in the rats with blood pressure (BP) greater than 145 mm Hg (n=33) and in sham-operated rats (n=32). Five days later, the rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1); 6 days, in the drinking water) or vehicle (tap water). On the sixth day of treatment, direct continuous BP recording and measurement of reflex changes in heart rate elicited by phenylephrine were made in conscious rats before and at 1 hour of I.C.V. infusion of saline (8 microL/h) or A-779 (4 microg/h). To evaluate the degree of ACE blockade produced by enalapril treatment, the pressor effect of Ang I (50 ng, I.V., and 100 ng, I.C.V.) and plasma ACE activity was determined. As expected, enalapril treatment in 2K1C produced a significant fall in BP, significant attenuation in the pressor response of Ang I (I.V.), and a reduction in plasma ACE activity. In addition, enalapril treatment increased the baroreflex sensitivity (0.76+/-0.04 versus 0.43+/-0.04 ms/mm Hg in 2K1C untreated rats). I.C.V. infusion of A-779 reverted the improvement in baroreflex sensitivity produced by enalapril treatment in 2K1C (from 0.80+/-0.07 to 0.42+/-0.08 ms/mm Hg) and also attenuated the baroreflex sensitivity in untreated 2K1C (0.36+/-0.05 versus 0.48+/-0.06 ms/mm Hg) and untreated sham-operated rats (1.21+/-0.05 versus 0.78+/-0.17 ms/mm Hg). These results suggest that central endogenous Ang-(1-7) is involved at least in part in the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity observed in 2K1C after peripheral chronic ACE inhibition.", 
    "297": "Hypovolemia inhibits duodenal mucosal alkaline (HCO-3) secretion by activation of sympathoadrenergic nerves. A possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system was investigated. Experiments were performed on chloralose-anesthetized rats. The mucosal alkaline output by a duodenal segment was measured using in situ pH-stat titration equipment. A modest hypovolemia was induced by bleeding the animals approximately 10% of the total blood volume. This procedure decreased duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion to a sustained level of approximately 50% of baseline and reduced mean arterial pressure by approximately 20 mmHg. Intravenous pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilate (0.7 mg/kg) or the angiotensin II-receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg) altered the response to hypovolemia to a transient one, and alkaline secretion returned to the control level within 40-50 min. When exogenous angiotensin II was administered intravenously (0.25 and 0.75 microgram.kg-1.h-1), a hypovolemia-induced sustained depression of the secretion was observed even during ACE inhibition. Direct electrical stimulation (3 Hz, 5 V, 5 ms, bilaterally) of the peripheral splanchnic nerves decreased duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion to approximately 60% of the control level and increased mean arterial pressure by approximately 20 mmHg. However, in enalaprilate-pretreated animals, the inhibition of alkaline secretion due to splanchnic nerve stimulation was transient, a response that became sustained on angiotensin II substitution. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system prolongs the sympathoadrenergic inhibition of duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and that angiotensin II, in this regard, acts mainly on the peripheral sympathetic efferents.",

Both the higher and the lower doses of quinapril reduced the serum and cardiac ACE activities significantly, whereas the higher dose of TCV-116 reduced the cardiac ACE activity and increased the serum ACE activity. The lower dose of quinapril, however, exerted no significant effect on MBP and the LVW:body weight ratio, although it reduced the cardiac and serum ACE activities significantly.

Untreated TG(mREN2)27 and Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR) were used as controls. Both treatment regimens normalized the left ventricular weight, which was increased significantly (P < 0.001) in TG(mREN2)27. Both treatments normalized the left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures, which were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in TG(mREN2)27 than they were in SDR, and they improved the velocity of the decrease in pressure [P < 0.05, Bay and Cap versus TG(mREN2)27]. Decreased left ventricular SERCA 2a mRNA and protein levels and increased atrial natriuretic peptide messenger RNA levels were normalized by Bay and Cap treatments (P < 0.05, Bay and Cap versus TG(mREN2)27, by Northern and Western blotting). According to radioimmunoassay and an enzyme assay, respectively, Bay, but not Cap, increased plasma angiotensin I concentrations and the renin activity above normal levels (P < 0.05), whereas myocardial angiotensin II concentrations (determined by radioimmunoassay), which were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in TG(mREN2)27, were normalized equally by Bay and Cap.",

In some studies an inappropriate activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that could be related to cyst growth and intrarenal ischemia was found. An increase in renal vascular resistance has been demonstrated and might be caused by intrarenal release of angiotensin II. Interestingly, the protective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the renal function could not be demonstrated in ADPKD patients with a moderately decreased renal function.

    "321": "All the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are highly expressed in the developing kidney in a unique spatial and temporal pattern that is associated with nephrogenesis, vascularization, and the proper architectural and functional development of this organ. Pharmacological inhibition of the RAS results in structural and functional developmental abnormalities of the kidneys in several animal species, including humans. Similarly, altered renal morphology and functional abnormalities have been described in mice with targeted inactivation of the angiotensinogen (Agt) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes. In contrast, inactivation of angiotensin receptors have not resulted in renal morphological abnormalities, suggesting a redundancy at this level of the RAS cascade that prevents the development of renal pathology. More importantly, inactivation of the ACE or Ao genes results in a renal phenotype remarkably similar to that obtained with pharmacological inhibition of the RAS. Taken together, the available information suggests that angiotensin is necessary for normal kidney development and for the maintenance of the functional and structural integrity of the adult kidney.", 
    "322": "Cellular processes leading to renal tubular hypertrophy may contribute to the development of progressive renal disease. Angiotensin II (ANG II) is a prime agent that has been linked to the progression of renal disease by a host of mechanisms, including the induction of tubular epithelial hypertrophy and stimulation of extracellular matrix biosynthesis. All components of a functional renin-angiotensin system reside within the renal tubule. Epithelial cells exhibit distinct patterns of growth behavior after stimulation with ANG II (namely, hypertrophy of proximal tubule segments and proliferation of more distal segments). The hypertrophic action of ANG II is mediated through high-affinity AT1-receptors, involves activation of pertussis-toxin sensitive G1 proteins, and depends on a decrease in intracellular cAMP. In addition, ANG II induces sequential activation of MAP kinases and S6 kinase, and leads to activation of early immediate genes and the modulation of a series of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. There is also compelling evidence that the ANG II-induced epithelial hypertrophy and the stimulated-synthesis of collagen type IV are mediated by increased transcription and production of TGF-beta. ANG II-mediated inhibition of protein degradation may further increase protein content. The hypertrophic response to ANG II is greater in medium with high glucose concentration. Blockade of the action of ANG II prevents the renal hypertrophy and the tubulointerstitial fibrosis in animal models of chronic renal diseases (independent of changes in systemic or glomerular hemodynamics), in part through interception of ANG II-mediated induction of TGF-beta expression.", 
    "323": "Classically, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in diabetes was thought to be suppressed, and relatively unimportant in the regulation of hemodynamics and the development of complications. However, recent developments have caused reconsideration of this notion. Studies of pharmacological interruption of the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition have implicated this hormonal system in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, both experimentally and clinically. Preliminary evidence also suggests a beneficial effect of angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonists. The relative roles of the systemic versus intrarenal RAS in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy have recently been evaluated. Although plasma renin level is generally low, it is not yet clear whether RAS component processing is normal in diabetes; there may be subtle changes in ANG II metabolism that sustain relatively higher plasma ANG II levels. Furthermore, the intrarenal RAS may not be suppressed. Renal renin levels tend to be disproportionately elevated, as compared with plasma renin values. Renal ANG II levels are normal, and renal mRNAs for RAS components have been variable. In general, lack of RAS suppression (despite plasma volume and increased exchangeable sodium) may indicate inappropriate activity of the RAS in diabetes. RAS-mediated injury may occur via stimulation of a number of sclerosing mediators, and there is evidence that hyperglycemia acts synergistically with ANG II to promote cellular injury. Finally, various RAS candidate genes for development of diabetic nephropathy have been examined and, although controversy remains, ACE gene polymorphisms may be involved. Together, these recent investigations lend further support to the notion that the RAS plays an important role in diabetic nephropathy, and are beginning to shed light on the mechanisms of progressive renal injury.", 
    "324": "Interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonism dramatically reduces injury in the remnant kidney model. Furthermore, converting enzyme inhibition reduces proteinuria and slows the decline in renal function in clinical disease. Hemodynamic actions of ANG II in the kidney in conjunction with a more poorly defined effect of the RAAS on systemic hypertension have been posited as the major mechanisms for maintenance of elevated glomerular pressure. Reductions in glomerular pressure have been attributed, at least in part, to removal of intrarenal effects of ANG II. Growth and fibrotic actions of ANG II may also contribute to progressive renal injury and relief from them reduce injury. The participation of circulating aldosterone in the remnant kidney model has been recently raised. Hyperaldosteronism and adrenal hypertrophy attend the hypertension, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis of this model. Although the hemodynamic actions of aldosterone probably account for some of the adverse effects it has in this model, other direct cellular actions may participate in its renal, as well as cardiac and fibrotic consequences. Thus, the RAAS, working through both ANG II and aldosterone, contributes to chronic progressive renal injury.", 
    "325": "Angiotensin II maintains extracellular volume homeostasis, in part, by regulating proximal tubule transport. Physiological doses of angiotensin II stimulate volume and solute transport in the proximal tubule independent of changes in the glomerular filtration rate. Stimulation of bicarbonate transport primarily occurs via increasing activity of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger and the sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter. The effects of circulating angiotensin II are mediated by angiotensin II receptors on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule. Recently, the proximal tubule was found to synthesize and secrete angiotensin II into the lumen. The luminal membrane contains angiotensin II receptors and luminal angiotensin II levels are 100 to 200-fold higher than that found in plasma. Luminal angiotensin II receptor blockade or luminal inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis both significantly diminish proximal tubule transport, consistent with stimulation of proximal tubule transport by endogenously produced and luminally secreted angiotensin II. These data provide evidence for an autocrine/paracrine role for angiotensin II that functions independent of circulating angiotensin II.",

    "327": "To evaluate how basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms are affected by ACE inhibition in injured rat carotid arteries in relation to smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, we examined the effects of oral perindopril on FGF-2 and PDGF isoform levels in carotid arteries 2 days after balloon catheter injury. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into medial and intimal SMCs was also assessed. Uninjured vessels contained two forms of FGF-2, with molecular weights of 18 and 22 kD, and PDGF-AA. Two days after injury, FGF-2 and PDGF-AA levels were markedly reduced, but high levels of PDGF-AB became apparent when the SMCs were proliferating. Perindopril completely abolished the biosynthesis of PDGF-AB but had little effect on residual FGF-2. This was accompanied by a 25% reduction in medial SMC proliferation. Neointimal cell proliferation 10 days after injury was unaffected by perindopril, although neointima size was reduced by 30%. Commencing perindopril treatment 4 days after the injury confirmed that early events associated with effects on medial SMCs were the major contributors to the attenuated neointimal lesions.", 
    "328": "The ability of ACE inhibitors such as perindopril to attenuate neointima formation and growth in balloon catheter-injured rat carotid arteries is dependent on early events in the media, the inhibition of SMC PDGF-AB biosynthesis and attenuation of proliferation. Neointima formation in similarly injured vessels containing SMCs that are either unresponsive to PDGF-AB or exhibit an ACE-independent profile of growth factor biosynthesis responses may account for the ineffectiveness of ACE inhibition in some species.",

Each treatment was administered for 10 weeks. Diastolic filling patterns at rest were assessed by Doppler determination of the systemic atrioventricular valve flow velocity at the conclusion of each therapy. No difference was detected in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac index. Diastolic filling patterns were also similar. Exercise duration was not different (6.4+/-2.6 [enalapril] versus 6.7+/-2.6 minutes [placebo]). The mean percent increase in cardiac index from rest to maximum exercise was slightly but significantly decreased in subjects after 10 weeks of enalapril therapy (102+/-34% [enalapril] versus 125+/-34% [placebo]; P<.02). At maximal exercise, cardiac index (3.5+/-0.9 [enalapril] versus 3.8+/-0.9 L x min[-1] x m2 [placebo]), oxygen consumption (18.3+/-9 [enalapril] versus 20.5+/-7 mL x min[-1] x kg[-1] [placebo]), minute ventilation (57.5+/-17 [enalapril] versus 55.4+/-19 L/min [placebo]), and total work (247+/-181 [enalapril] versus 261+/-197 W [placebo]) were not different.",

The effects of doxorubicin (DOX) on intracellular calcium transients were examined in neonatal rat cultured cardiac myocytes, as were the cardioprotective effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on DOX-induced impairment of calcium handling. 2. Cultured cardiac myocytes isolated from neonatal Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with DOX for 24 h. Field-stimulated calcium transients in single myocytes were measured in the presence or in the absence of isoproterenol using fura-2/AM. Calcium transients were also measured after the addition of DOX to myocytes pretreated with M-I (an active metabolite of delapril HCL, an ACE inhibitor. 3. Doxorubicin reduced the amplitude and maximum velocity of increase and decrease of calcium transients, prolonged the time-course of calcium transients and impaired the beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness of calcium transients in a dose-dependent manner. The DOX-induced impairment of calcium transients and beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness was improved by M-I. 4. Doxorubicin impaired both the mobilization and sequestration of intracellular calcium ions in contraction-relaxation cycles and the response of calcium transients to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The ACE inhibitor ameliorated DOX-induced impairment of calcium dynamics, suggesting ihat M-I, an active metabolite of delapril, protects against DOX-induced abnormal calcium handling leading to cardiac dysfunction.",

The pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) before and after i.v. administration of captopril (1 mg/kg), losartan (1 and 10 mg/kg), sodium nitroprusside (SNP: 5 micrograms/kg per min), losartan (1 mg/kg)+captopril (1 mg/kg), captopril (1 mg/kg) + losartan (1 mg/kg) or the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (1 mg/kg)+captopril (1 mg/kg) were measured. Plasma NA concentrations were measured during 60 s SNS before and after losartan (1 mg/kg), captopril (1 mg/kg), SNP (5 micrograms/kg per min) or HOE 140 (1 mg/kg)+captopril (1 mg/kg). Pressor responses to exogenous NA were measured before and after administration of losartan (1 mg/kg), captopril (1 mg/kg), HOE 140 (1 mg/kg) + captopril (1 mg/kg) or the nitric oxide synthase (NO) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 mg/kg) + captopril (1 mg/kg). 3. Captopril, losartan and SNP decreased frequency-response curves to a similar extent. The captopril-induced decrease in pressor responses to SNS was restored by pretreatment with HOE140. Adding captopril to losartan decreased the curve more than did adding losartan to captoprill. Both losartan, captopril and HOE 140 + captopril significantly decreased the plasma NA concentration after SNS (34.1 +/- 5.0, 27.4 +/- 2.6 and 41.4 +/- 8.1%, respectively). Sodium nitroprusside did not change the plasma NA concentration after SNS (3.8 +/- 28.2%). The dose-response curves to i.v. NA were not affected by losartan, but were significantly decreased by captopril. However, responses to NA that were reduced by captopril were restored to control values by pretreatment with HOE 140 or L-NAME. 4. We suggest that both losartan and captopril decrease pressor responses to SNS by inhibiting NA release from sympathetic nerve endings; however, captopril also decreases 'vascular reactivity' to NA, which is mediated by nitric oxide produced by activation of the bradykinin B2 receptors.", 
    "334": "1. Evidence suggesting an involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development/maintenance of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) relies, in part, on early experimental data reporting centrally mediated antihypertensive effects of saralasin. However, recent data using non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists does not always support this theory because these compounds usually do not lower blood pressure when given centrally. 2. In the present study we have re-assessed the central effects of saralasin in conscious SHR as well as in sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated (SAD) rats. Both of these models exhibit heightened sensitivity to the central pressor effects of angiotensin II (AngII) and, thus, any potential antihypertensive activity would provide functional evidence of activated brain RAS mechanisms in these models. 3. In SHR, saralasin failed to lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) when given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) as bolus or infusion doses that blocked the centrally mediated pressor effect of AngII. 4. In SAD rats, there was a marked impairment of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex function and enhanced centrally mediated pressor responses to AngII. However, i.c.v. saralasin infusions again did not alter MAP. 5. Collectively, these results suggest that the central RAS is not involved in the maintenance of MAP in SHR and SAD rats, both of which are models exhibiting a functional hyperresponsiveness to AngII.", 
    "335": "This study was designed to determine whether the JAK/STAT (indicating just another kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is activated in cardiac hypertrophy induced in vivo by pressure overload in rats and to demonstrate whether angiotensin II is involved in the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Acute pressure overload was produced by constricting the abdominal aorta of Wistar rats. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis revealed that pressure overload activated JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 as early as 5 minutes and that STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 were tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly after exposure to the pressure overload. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 peaked in the early stage at 5 to 15 minutes, whereas that of STAT3 peaked in the late stage at 60 minutes. Gel mobility shift of the interferon gamma activation site/interferon alpha-stimulating response element was observed immediately after the aortic banding, whereas the band of sis-inducing element was shifted in the late stage at 60 minutes. Both cilazapril (angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor) and E4177 (angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor antagonist) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of Tyk2 and partially inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2, but neither affected JAK1. Coimmunoprecipitation of the AT1 receptor with JAK2 or Tyk2 was clearly observed at 5 minutes and peaked at 15 minutes (20-fold the control value). These results indicate that the JAK/STAT pathway is activated by acute pressure overload in rats and that angiotensin II is involved in activating Tyk2, and partially activating JAK2, via the AT1 receptor. Both angiotensin II-dependent and -independent pathways take part in activating the JAK/STAT pathway in the pressure-overloaded rat heart.",

    "340": "The present study was designed to identify an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and noradrenergic transmission in the human heart. It is still under debate whether angiotensin II facilitates noradrenaline release in the heart. Clinical studies of congestive heart failure, involving systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration, have indicated anti-adrenergic effects, without giving a clear mechanistic picture. The influence on cardiac sympathetic transmission by local intracardiac administration of an ACE inhibitor has not been determined. Seven angina patients with normal left ventricular function, who underwent control coronary angiography after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were studied. Baseline measurements of haemodynamics and total and cardiac noradrenaline spillover were followed by handgrip exercise in the absence and presence of intracoronary enalaprilat infusion (0.05 mg min-1, 1 mL min-1). Baseline total body and cardiac noradrenaline spillover remained unchanged following intracoronary enalaprilat infusion, being 3745 +/- 349 and 3896 +/- 257 pmol min-1, and 148 +/- 56 and 149 +/- 55 pmol min-1, before and after drug administration, respectively. Mean arterial pressure, peripheral plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels were also unaffected by enalaprilat infusion. During handgrip exercise procedures, both total body and cardiac noradrenaline spillover increased substantially, showing no reduction in the presence of intracardiac enalaprilat. Direct administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat to the human heart failed to attenuate cardiac sympathetic drive during baseline conditions or following cardiac adrenergic activation by handgrip exercise. Thus, in the non-failing heart, without chronic adrenergic activation, no angiotensin II-facilitated effect on cardiac noradrenaline spillover could be detected.", 
    "341": "Extracellular recordings were obtained from 34 phasically active neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of male rats under urethane anesthesia. Intracarotid injections of hypertonic saline (0.2 M NaCl solution, 0.05 ml) caused an increase in neuronal activity of 27 PVN cells. Pretreatment with saralasin (Sar, 10(-10) M), a specific angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonist, into the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) diminished the excitatory response to the osmotic stimulation in 13 of 17 cells tested. Pretreatment with Sar in the vicinity of the MnPO or the third ventricle did not cause a marked change. These results suggest that the ANGergic system in the MnPO could contribute to the mechanism of osmotic activation of PVN neurosecretory cells.", 
    "342": "We wished to determine whether the acute toxic effects of oxidized LDL are attenuated in aortas isolated from rats chronically treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In aortic rings incubated with human oxidized LDL (300 microg/mL), the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were attenuated, but not those to A23187 and to nitroprusside. This toxic effect of oxidized LDL was completely prevented in preparations coincubated with oxidized LDL and the nitric oxide (NO) precursor L-arginine (0.3 mmol/L). In aortas isolated from rats orally treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg/kg ramipril (group 1) or 1 mg/kg ramipril (group 2), this toxic effect of oxidized LDL was also markedly attenuated. In contrast, in aortas isolated from rats cotreated with ramipril (10 mg/kg) for 6 weeks and subcutaneous injections of Hoe 140 (a B2 kinin antagonist), 500 microg/kg per day for the last 2 weeks (group 3) or from rats orally treated for 6 weeks with losartan (an AT1-type angiotensin II receptor antagonist), 20 mg/kg (group 4), the inhibitory effect of oxidized LDL on acetylcholine-induced relaxations was similar to that observed in the control group (group 5). Moreover, long-term treatment with ramipril increased relaxations to acetylcholine in groups 1 and 2 and also relaxations to A23187 and aortic cGMP content in group 1, suggesting an enhanced NO availability. Thus, the protective effect of long-term ACE inhibition against the acute vascular toxicity of oxidized LDL is bradykinin dependent and seems to involve a facilitation of NO release via endothelial B2 kinin receptors.", 
    "343": "Local renal and plasma renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) both play an important role in blood pressure regulation during the development of two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension (2K1C) through their vasoactive component, angiotensin II (Ang II). Our goal was to characterize glomerular and preglomerular vascular Ang II receptors during the different stages of development of hypertension in 2K1C rats (2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-weeks postoperative) using Ang II antagonists [Sar1,Ile8]-Ang II, losartan, and PD 123319 and their regulation after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril. Competitive binding studies showed that the only Ang II receptor detected on both glomeruli and preglomerular vessels of all groups (2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-week 2K1C rats, control rats, and captopril-treated rats) was the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1). Vascular AT1 receptor density (Bmax) was significantly lower in only the 16-week 2K1C group, whereas glomerular Bmax was significantly lower in 2K1C rats at 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks. Vascular and glomerular receptor densities were both significantly higher in captopril-treated rats than in nontreated rats. We therefore conclude that in 2K1C rats, Ang II receptors on preglomerular vessels and glomeruli are regulated differentially during the development of hypertension and after ACE inhibition. Our results suggest that glomerular Ang II receptors are regulated by systemic plasma Ang II levels, whereas vascular Ang II receptors are not. However, when renal and systemic RASs are both blocked, these receptors are upregulated but are no longer differentially regulated.",

    "347": "We explored the relative roles of the suppression of angiotensin II and the prevention of bradykinin degradation in mediating the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors in experimental diabetic nephropathy. Over a 24-week period, we studied male Sprague-Dawley diabetic and control rats and Sprague-Dawley diabetic rats treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril, the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan, the bradykinin-B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (icatibant), and a combination of ramipril and icatibant. Serial measurements of urinary albumin excretion, blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin were performed monthly. After 6 months, the animals were killed for the measurement of kidney weight and the assessment of glomerular ultrastructure. Over 24 weeks, urinary albumin excretion showed a continuous rise in the untreated diabetic rats. Both ramipril and valsartan, which were equihypotensive, prevented the increase in urinary albumin excretion over the whole study period. Icatibant therapy did not attenuate the antialbuminuric effect of the ACE inhibitor, nor did it have any effect as the sole therapy. Diabetes was associated with increased glomerular basement membrane thickness, glomerular volume, and total mesangial volume. Both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II receptor antagonism attenuated the glomerular ultrastructural changes to a similar degree. Icatibant did not attenuate the effects of ramipril on glomerular morphology. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II-AT1 receptor blockers appear to confer similar benefits in experimental diabetic nephropathy, and bradykinin-B2 receptor blockers do not influence this effect. These findings suggest that the blockade of angiotensin II is the major pathway responsible for renoprotection afforded by ACE inhibition in experimental diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "348": "The effects of chronic treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116, 0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg), and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate (enalapril, 10 mg/kg), on the development of end-organ damage were examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The control SHRSP developed severe hypertension with stroke signs and increased urinary protein excretion. TCV-116 (0.1 mg/kg) reduced the stroke incidence and urinary protein excretion without affecting the blood pressure. TCV-116 (1 and 10 mg/kg) and enalapril reduced blood pressure, the stroke incidence, the urinary indices and left ventricular weight. Circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and renal renin mRNA expression were significantly accelerated or tended to be accelerated in the control SHRSP with end-organ damages. A low dose of TCV-116 tended to reduce the RAS indices in plasma by improving the damages, whereas a high dose (10 mg/kg) increased them by the reflexes with blocking RAS. The present results indicate that chronic All blockade reduces the increase in blood pressure, end-organ damages and RAS related to the damages in SHRSP.",

We sought to assess, in a nonacademic primary care environment, pharmacotherapeutic treatment patterns for CHF with respect to consistency with clinical trial evidence and published treatment guideline recommendations. Over an 18-month period, we examined CHF pharmacotherapy using a computerized, integrated clinical diagnoses and prescription database from an outpatient community healthcare center without academic affiliations. We identified adult patients meeting contact criteria and with diagnosis of CHF by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) coding and assessed prescribed therapy as well as select comorbid conditions. Drugs of interest included those with known or suspected benefit or detriment and those with unproven benefit. An eligible group of 14,983 patients was identified, from which a cohort of 148 patients with CHF was selected. Forty-one percent of these 148 patients were prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 34% digoxin, 12% diuretic, 12% hydralazine + nitrate, 20% inhaled beta-agonists, and 66% warfarin. Only 5% of patients were prescribed the combination of an ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and diuretic. Thirty-one percent had a comorbid diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, of whom 44% were prescribed digoxin, 22% diltiazem, 15% beta-blockers, 15% digoxin and diltiazem, 7% digoxin and a beta-blocker, and 33% warfarin. In general, recommended therapies for CHF appeared underutilized in this cohort, whereas those of unclear benefit and potential detriment appeared overutilized. Although these results may not be readily generalized to the entire healthcare system, they do suggest a need for additional analysis and potential intervention.",

In the present study we assessed the effect of captopril, an ACEI, on the voluntary consumption of 10% ethanol solution, water and solid food in our strain of rats genetically selected for their voluntary consumption of ethanol, namely UChA (low consumer) and UChB (high consumer). Captopril (30 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days to UChA and UChB rats and ethanol, water and food intake were measured before, during and after captopril treatment; these results were compared with those produced by a control saline solution. Results showed that captopril produced a significant reduction of alcohol voluntary consumption in UChB but not in UChA rats. However, this effect was not specific for ethanol since captopril also induced a significant decrease in food intake leading to a loss of weight in both rat strains, suggesting that it seems to be secondary to changes in appetite for calories.",

The average annual amount spent on these patients was calculated for eight cardiovascular drug groups defined in the British National Formulary (BNF), hospitalizations for ischaemic heart disease, and revascularization and angiography procedures. The proportion of the study population with the potential to benefit from treatment with statins was then determined by identifying individuals with the characteristics of participants who benefited in any one of three published clinical trials. Identification of these individuals was assisted by the use of population-specific morbidity data and serum cholesterol levels reported in published surveys.", 
    "355": "The actual average annual expenditure on statins (pound 774 per 1000 patients registered) was lower than that on ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and nitrates and was less than one-tenth of the combined annual cost of all coronary hospitalizations examined. In the patient population studied it was estimated that 7547 (1.7%) individuals would be eligible for secondary prevention with statins whilst 20406 (4.5%) would be eligible for primary prevention. After adjusting for possible non-adherence, the estimated annual cost of statin treatment for all such individuals was calculated to be between pound 22 599 and pound 28 413 per 1000 of the study population. Application of these figures to the registered population of the health authority would add approximately pound 11.8 million to a pound 60 million primary and secondary care drugs budget. It is proposed that statin treatment will have to be prioritized for those at highest risk, whilst maintaining a population-based strategy of promoting lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",

Application of this method in large multi-centre clinical trials allows one to assess the mean treatment effect, where we consider participating centres as a random sample from an underlying population. We evaluate properties of the proposed estimators via extensive simulation studies.

    "358": "The suppression of plasma aldosterone by captopril treatment (50 mg.kg-1.d-1) was prevented by the subcutaneous infusion of aldosterone into captopril-treated SHRSP. We studied the effect this had on blood pressure (BP) and stroke development.", 
    "359": "SHRSP fed a Japanese-style diet containing 4% NaCl developed hypertension and a 100% mortality associated with intracerebral hemorrhage by 14 weeks of age. Captopril treatment from 6 weeks of age did not lower the BP but increased survival past 35 weeks of age. Hydralazine treatment (40 to 80 mg/L of drinking water) lowered BP in SHRSP but was less effective than captopril in retarding stroke. Plasma aldosterone levels were elevated with age in SHRSP after 10 weeks and were higher in poststroke versus prestroke SHRSP. Captopril treatment suppressed plasma aldosterone. When we elevated plasma aldosterone in captopril-treated SHRSP to levels between those present in untreated pre- and poststroke SHRSP, the ability of captopril to retard stroke development was negated. The effects of aldosterone were mimicked by deoxycorticosterone (40 mg/kg, SC2 times/wk) but not by dexamethasone (0.1 mg.kg-1.d-1, SC). Spironolactone treatment (20 mg.kg-1.d-1, SC) of SHRSP reduced BP but had little effect on stroke development.",

When compared with obstructed animals, captopril administration significantly inhibited the increase in total DNA (P < 0.05) and reduced the amount of total collagen (P = 0.054).

    "365": "Selective A2A adenosine receptor agonists are potent vasodilators that reduce blood pressure and induce marked increments in heart rate and plasma renin activity (PRA). To examine the mechanisms and pressor relevance of these cardiac and renin responses, we measured blood pressure and heart rate by telemetry and PRA in separate sets of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), which were given i.p. 2-hexynyl-5-methylcarboxamidoadenosine (2HE-NECA, 0.01 mg/kg) and 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosin e (CGS 21680, 0.1 mg/kg) alone and after pretreatment with the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol (100 mg/kg). The effects of 2HE-NECA (0.003 mg/kg) also were examined after pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril (3 mg/kg). Both A2A agonists induced marked reductions in blood pressure, associated with significant increments in heart rate and in PRA. Atenolol reduced blood pressure to the same extent as did the A2A agonists and markedly decreased heart rate and PRA. Pretreatment with atenolol entirely prevented the increase in heart rate and in PRA induced by the two A2A agonists but potentiated only slightly their antihypertensive effect. Spirapril alone reduced blood pressure and increased PRA and when given before 2HE-NECA potentiated its depressor and renin-stimulating effects by 44% and 69%, respectively. These results suggest that the increase in heart rate and in PRA induced by A2A agonists is the result of a reflex increase in sympathetic activity triggered by the decrease in blood pressure rather than of a direct stimulating effect on cardiac and renal A2A-adenosine receptors; the reactive activation of the renin-angiotensin system elicited by these compounds may contribute to blunting their antihypertensive effect.",

To clarify the functional role of amniotic IL-1 alpha, we studied its effect on the induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the uterus. IL-1 alpha administered intraperitoneally to rats induced an increase in the amount of mRNA encoding the macro-phage-type iNOS which was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. NO measurement by NO selective electrode revealed that NO production in the rat and human uterus treated with IL-1 alpha was promoted by the addition of 1 mM L-arginine to the culture medium. These findings suggest that in women with PROM, amniotic IL-1 alpha may reduce uterine contractions, in part, by inducing of iNOS.", 
    "368": "Myocardial ischemia, as well as angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors, increase cardiac concentrations of the non-apeptide bradykinin. Cardiac effects of bradykinin are potentially mediated by modulation of sympathoadrenergic neurotransmission. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine the influence of bradykinin on exocytotic noradrenaline release from rat isolated perfused heart. Exocytotic noradrenaline release was induced by electrical field stimulation (1 min, 5 V, 6 Hz) twice to compare the effect of intervention (S2) with respective control stimulation (S1). The overflow of endogenous noradrenaline was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. The results are expressed as the mean S2/S1 ratio+/-S.E.M. Bradykinin (1 micromol/l) evoked a significant increase in noradrenaline release (S2/S1: 1.60+/-0.12; P<0.01), which was even more pronounced after inhibition of neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline by desipramine (0.1 micromol/l: S2/S1: 1.83+/-0.15; P<0.01) excluding interference of bradykinin with the noradrenaline uptake1 carrier. The concentration-response curve for bradykinin (0.1 nmol/l to 10 micromol/l) revealed a maximum effect at 1 micromol/l and an EC50-value of 7.5 nmol/l. The effect of bradykinin was unaltered by the B1-receptor antagonist des-Arg9 (Leu8)-bradykinin (1 micromol/l; S2/S1: 1.69+/-0.17), whereas it was reduced significantly by the B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (1 micromol/l; S2/S1: 1.14+/-0.11; P<0.05). Des-Arg9-bradykinin (1 micromol/l), a specific B1-agonist, had no effect on stimulation-induced noradrenaline release (S2/S1: 0.94+/-0.08). Utilizing pharmacological interventions, we attempted to characterize the intraneuronal signal transduction pathway mediating the effect of bradykinin on exocytosis. Neither inhibition of cyclooxygenase nor blockade of nitric oxide synthesis affected bradykinin-induced stimulation of noradrenaline release. Likewise, inhibition of protein kinase C by bisindolylmaleimide (1 micromol/l) or tyrosine kinase by genistein (10 micromol/l) had no effect on the promoting action of bradykinin. In contrast, inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity by the specific inhibitor AACOCF3 (1 micromol/l) prevented bradykinin-induced increase in noradrenaline release (S2/S1: 1.09+/-0.15; P<0.01). In conclusion, bradykinin increases exocytotic release of endogenous noradrenaline from cardiac sympathetic neurons via activation of presynaptic B2-receptors. Intraneuronal coupling of B2-receptors to phospholipase A2 appears to mediate the facilitatory effect of bradykinin on noradrenaline release in rat heart.",

The STNx rats developed hypertension, proteinuria, and renal impairment. These changes were associated with a 2.4-fold increase in SPARC gene expression in STNx compared with SHAM kidneys (P < 0.001). In situ hybridization revealed increased SPARC mRNA in glomeruli and interstitial cells, as well as de novo expression by tubular epithelial cells at sites of renal injury. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed concordant changes in SPARC protein. Both ramipril and valsartan ameliorated renal injury and significantly reduced SPARC overexpression in the STNx animals.

However, family practitioners and general internists chose ACE inhibitors less frequently (p < or = .01) than cardiologists for the other indications. Respective rates of ACE inhibitor use for each simulated patient were new-onset, symptomatic (family practitioners 72%, general internists 76%, cardiologists 86%); asymptomatic (family practitioners 68%, general internists 78%, cardiologists 93%): and asymptomatic, postmyocardial infarction (family practitioners 58%, general internists 70%, cardiologists 94%). Compared with generalists, cardiologists were more likely [p < or = .05] to increase ACE inhibitors to a target dosage (45% vs 26%) and to tolerate systolic blood pressures of 90 mm Hg or less [43% vs 15%).", 
    "381": "Compared with cardiologists, family practitioners and general internists probably underutilize ACE inhibitors, particularly among patients with decreased ejection fraction who are either asymptomatic or post-myocardial infarction. Educational efforts should focus on these indications and emphasise the dosages demonstrated to lower mortality and morbidity in the trials.", 
    "382": "Over 50 percent of deaths in patients who survive an acute myocardial infarction are due to fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients who survive an episode of sustained ventricular arrhythmia are at highest risk of recurrent cardiac arrest. Electrophysiologic studies have been found to be useful in guiding therapy and reducing mortality in these patients and in patients with syncope due to arrhythmic etiology. Evaluation and treatment of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia post infarction remains somewhat controversial. A recently published trial (MADIT), however, showed improved survival with an implanted defibrillator in patients with coronary disease and asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Asymptomatic patients post infarction at high risk include those who have significant left ventricular dysfunction, late potentials, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and abnormal heart rate variability. These tests individually, however, have a low positive predictive accuracy. This, combined with the fact that antiarrhythmic drugs are frequently not effective and can be proarrhythmic, leaves the best treatment for these patients uncertain. It is known, however, that beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents do reduce mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Early studies have shown mixed results relating to sudden death and total mortality with amiodarone. To date, no other antiarrhythmic drug has shown benefit, while several have been shown to be harmful. Recent studies have also shown some beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocking agent with vasodilator properties, and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan. However, their precise role in reducing sudden death needs to be defined further.", 
    "383": "The von Willebrand factor (vWF) has been used as a marker of endothelial dysfunction in several diseases. We measured plasma vWF in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). In a group of 10 IgAN patients with normal renal function, normal blood pressure, and no proteinuria, vWF plasma levels were significantly higher than in a group of 21 healthy volunteers (134% +/- 38% v 80% +/- 22%; P < 0.01). In another group of 16 IgAN patients with normal renal function and proteinuria ranging between 0.3 and 3.8 g/d, vWF levels were also significantly higher than in the control group (148% +/- 63% v 80% +/- 22%; P < 0.001). Afterward, we studied the effects of enalapril administered for 4 weeks on vWF levels and proteinuria in a group of 11 IgAN patients with normal renal function and proteinuria > or = 1 g/d. After 2 weeks on enalapril treatment, both vWF levels and proteinuria had significantly decreased (vWF: 158% +/- 122% to 117% +/- 72%, P < 0.05; proteinuria: 1.6 +/- 0.7 g/d to 0.9 +/- 0.4 g/ d, P < 0.05). After enalapril withdrawal, both vWF and proteinuria significantly increased. A significant correlation between the variations in vWF levels and proteinuria was observed (r = 0.6; P < 0.05). No correlations between blood pressure and changes in vWF or proteinuria were found. We conclude that endothelial dysfunction is observed in patients with IgAN. This abnormality is already present in some patients with normal blood pressure, normal renal function, and absence of proteinuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induced a significant decrease in both vWF levels and proteinuria.", 
    "384": "Death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) remains an important public health problem; patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) constitute the largest identifiable population for prophylactic interventions. Targeting of progressively higher-risk subgroups of post-MI survivors carries inevitable tradeoffs with respect to the global impact of interventions on overall mortality. Therapy with aspirin, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors comprise the benchmark against which all additional interventions, including implantable defibrillators, must be measured. Initial enthusiasm for empiric amiodarone therapy has been tempered by the limited benefit demonstrated in recent randomized trials. Trials of other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, including both d,l-sotalol and d-sotalol, have also failed to demonstrate survival benefit. The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) demonstrated significantly improved survival associated with defibrillators in a small subgroup of post-MI survivors with a high short-term risk of death. The ultimate number and optimal criteria for selection of patients who may benefit from prophylactic defibrillator therapy after MI will undergo continued evolution as new data from current and ongoing trials become available.", 
    "385": "Recognition that non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a focus of recent therapeutic and genetic studies on the renin system have rekindled interest in mechanisms by which angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors influence the diabetic kidney. We evaluated the renal hemodynamic status of 19 hypertensive patients with NIDDM under controlled sodium balance, low (10 mmol/day for 5 to 7 days) or high (200 mmol/day for 5 to 7 days). The renal plasma flow (RPF) response to ACE inhibition and to angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion was measured as para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance before and during enalapril administration (10 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Our premise was that if renal vasodilation induced by ACEI involves kinins, prostaglandins, and/or nitric oxide, vasoconstrictor responses to Ang II would be blunted. Conversely, if the dominant ACE inhibitor action were a reduction in Ang II formation, the consequence would be up-regulation and an enhanced vasoconstrictor response to exogenous Ang II. RPF in NIDDM on a high-salt diet was lower than in age-matched controls (477 +/- 25 vs. 551 +/- 25 ml/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.02). Enalapril increased RPF in NIDDM to 511 +/- 29 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P < 0.05) and enhanced renal vasoconstrictor responses to Ang II infusion, from -68 +/- 9 to -106 +/- 18 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P = 0.03). Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone significantly exceeded matched normotensive controls (1.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 ng AI/ml/hr and 10 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.5 ng/dl, P < 0.01, respectively). Conversely all measures in studies on a low-salt diet were normal. Our findings indicate that: (1) NIDDM with hypertension is associated with reduced RPF when dietary salt intake is high, (2) reduced Ang II formation is the dominant mechanism of ACEI-induced renal vasodilation in hypertensives with NIDDM; and (3) the sustained renal hemodynamic responses to ACE inhibition despite high-salt balance, and the increased PRA suggest an autonomous renin-angiotensin system suppressed subnormally by a high salt diet in patients with NIDDM despite greater volume expansion.", 
    "386": "In the glomerulus, angiotensin II (Ang II) reduces the ultrafiltration coefficient and enhances the filtration of macromolecules. During glomerular injury, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors reduces proteinuria and retards the progression to end-stage renal insufficiency. The mechanisms by which Ang II modulates glomerular function are still a matter of investigation. To study whether Ang II may regulate the cytosolic calcium activity ([Ca2+]i) in podocytes, these cells were propagated in short-term culture and the effect of Ang II was examined with the Fura-2 microfluorescence technique in single podocytes. The cellular identity of cultured podocytes was proven by the expression of WT-1 and pp44, specific antibodies against podocytes in vivo. Ang II led to a concentration-dependent, reversible and slow increase of [Ca2+]i with an EC50 of 3 nmol/liter Ang II (N = 229). Ten nmol/liter Ang II increased [Ca2+]i from 41 +/- 9 to 260 +/- 34 nmol/liter (N = 210). In a solution with an extracellular reduced Ca2+ concentration of 10 micromol/liter, Ang II-mediated [Ca2+]i increase was significantly reduced by 60 +/- 20% (N = 12), indicating that the [Ca2+]i increase was due to a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space and a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Flufenamate, an inhibitor of non-selective ion channels, significantly inhibited Ang II-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i (IC50 = 20 micromol/liter, N = 29), whereas the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine even in high concentrations of > 1 micromol/liter had only a small inhibitory effect. The AT1 receptor antagonist losartan inhibited Ang II-mediated [Ca2+]i increase with an IC50 of about 0.3 nmol/liter (N = 35). The data suggest that Ang II increases [Ca2+]i in podocytes by an influx of Ca2+ through non-selective channels and by a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The effect of Ang II is mediated via an AT1 receptor.", 
    "387": "Previous studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin axis plays a pivotal role in vasoconstriction of the gastric, intestinal, and hepatic circulations during cardiogenic shock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fundamental hemodynamic mechanism of pancreatic ischemia during cardiogenic shock induced by pericardial tamponade.",

Pancreatic blood flow decreased disproportionately to 30% +/- 3% of baseline, because of a disproportionate increase in pancreatic vascular resistance to 220% +/- 19% of baseline. Previously confirmed blockade of the renin-angiotensin axis ablated this response, whereas confirmed blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system or vasopressin system had no significant effect. Without shock, central intravenous infusions of angiotensin II closely mimicked this selective vasoconstriction.",

    "391": "During the development to overt nephropathy, diabetic patients go through several characteristic stages of renal disease, moving from normo- to micro- to macroalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is defined as a urinary albumin excretion between 20 and 200 microg/min; values <20 microg/min are designated as normoalbuminuria, and values >200 microg/min are designated as macroalbuminuria. Only with macroalbuminuria does the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fall consistently. The decisive intermediary endpoints are postponement or prevention of micro/macroalbuminuria and reduction or prevention of the fall in GFR (stronger endpoint), with postponement of end-stage renal disease as a final endpoint. Good metabolic control can prevent or postpone the development of microalbuminuria, the earliest sign of diabetic renal disease. The ideal realistic therapeutic window may be an HbA1c value between 7 and 8.5% (mean reference value 5.5%). Thus, efforts should aimed at implementing the best possible control before the onset of microalbuminuria, with the other important aim of minimizing hypoglycemic side effects. In patients with microalbuminuria, blood pressure gradually increases, and early antihypertensive treatment becomes crucial. Good glycemic control (with the same glycemic goal as above) may be difficult to achieve in some of these patients, but it is still important. With overt nephropathy, defined as clinical proteinuria, a relentless decline in GFR is inflicted, unless patients are carefully treated with antihypertensive agents, often in combination therapy. Good metabolic control is still strongly warranted because patients with high HbA1c progress much more rapidly. The natural history of the rate of fall in GFR may be reduced from 12 to 3 ml x min(-1) x year(-1), but genetic factors may be involved; the ACE-genotype DD seems to progress more rapidly during treatment. Protein restriction is also of some interest. Early screening is recommended in all guidelines, with emphasis on testing for albuminuria, including microalbuminuria, along with careful control of glycemia and blood pressure.", 
    "392": "The adhesive interactions of endothelial cells with each other and the adhesion receptors that mediate these interactions are probably of fundamental importance to the process of angiogenesis. We therefore studied the effect of inhibiting the function of the endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1/ CD31, in rat and murine models of angiogenesis. A polyclonal antibody to human PECAM-1, which cross-reacts with rat PECAM-1, was found to block in vitro tube formation by rat capillary endothelial cells and cytokine-induced rat corneal neovascularization. In mice, two monoclonal antibodies against murine PECAM-1 prevented vessel growth into subcutaneously implanted gels supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Taken together these findings provide evidence that PECAM-1 is involved in angiogenesis and suggest that the interactions of endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecules are important in the formation of new vessels.",

There were significant differences between case and control patients in type of diabetes treatment, diabetes duration, place of routine diabetes care, and congestive cardiac failure.

    "397": "The dispersion model with mixed boundary conditions uses a single parameter, the dispersion number, to describe the hepatic elimination of xenobiotics and endogenous substances. An implicit a priori assumption of the model is that the transit time density of intravascular indicators is approximately by an inverse Gaussian distribution. This approximation is limited in that the model poorly describes the tail part of the hepatic outflow curves of vascular indicators. A sum of two inverse Gaussian functions is proposed as an alternative, more flexible empirical model for transit time densities of vascular references. This model suggests that a more accurate description of the tail portion of vascular reference curves yields an elimination rate constant (or intrinsic clearance) which is 40% less than predicted by the dispersion model with mixed boundary conditions. The results emphasize the need to accurately describe outflow curves in using them as a basis for determining pharmacokinetic parameters using hepatic elimination models.",

An alternative definition is: an albumin-creatinine ratio of 2-20 mg/mmol creatinine. Microalbuminuria is an indicator of an enhanced risk of chronic kidney failure and cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients and of cardiovascular disease in the elderly general population. It is not known whether these relationships exist in essential hypertension as well. In essential hypertension there is, however, a relationship between microalbuminuria and endothelial dysfunction, impaired regulation of renal haemodynamics and an increased risk of left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive retinopathy. By screening for microalbuminuria a group of patients can be distinguished who have a relatively high risk for the presence of complications of hypertension. It is not certain, however, that more intensive treatment of such patients (e.g. with ACE inhibitors) is useful. Consequently, for the time being, screening of patients with essential hypertension for microalbuminuria is of little practical importance.",

One patient had thrombus at 2 examinations. The day 1 echocardiogram was not correlated with thrombus development. LV size increased more in patients with thrombus than in those without thrombus. Patients with thrombus had more wall motion abnormality after day 1 than patients without thrombus (p = 0.03). Thus, the current prevalence of LV thrombus in anterior wall AMI is lower than previously reported, possibly due to changes in AMI management. Preservation of LV function is likely to be an important mechanism. Most thrombi are seen by 2 weeks after AMI. Resolution documented by echocardiography is frequent.",

In both groups, blood pressure and heart rate during flow measurements were not different before and after therapy. Before treatment, mean MBF at rest, during pacing tachycardia, and after dipyridamole infusion was similar in the two groups; however, pacing and dipyridamole flows were significantly lower than those obtained in a control group of normotensive subjects. After treatment, in the enalapril-treated patients, MBF did not change in the three study conditions. In the verapamil-treated patients, MBF did not change at rest and significantly increased during pacing and after dipyridamole.

Left ventriculograms were analyzed for diastolic and systolic volumes, global left ventricular sphericity, extent of wall motion abnormality, and endocardial curvature. The presence of MR was related to the risk of developing a cardiovascular event during 3.5 years of follow-up. MR was present in 141 patients (19.4%). Severe (3+) MR was present in only 2 patients. Patients with MR were more likely to have a persistently occluded infarct artery (MR versus no MR, 27.3% versus 15.2%; P=.001). Although the ejection fractions were similar, MR patients had larger end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and more spherical ventricles than patients without MR.

    "436": "Early action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction (MI) has been shown in large scale clinical trials to reduce mortality over the first weeks. However, the mechanisms involved are yet unclear and several trials showed a tendency toward a small, albeit unexpected, rise in cardiogenic shock or mortality. Since cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) has become a \"gold standard\" in assessing the severity of heart failure, we studied--after finishing a pilot trial--the effect of captopril versus placebo in 208 patients who were individually titrated (titrated dose, mean 46/69 mg/day after 7 days/4 weeks, respectively) in order to preserve their blood pressure in the acute phase of myocardial infarction; we followed the development of congestive heart failure (CHF) over 4 weeks by measuring oxygen consumption. After 4 weeks, overall oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (VO2-AT; 13.7 vs 13.1), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max 19.3 vs 18.9 mL/kg per min) and exercise duration (896 vs 839 sec) showed a nonsignificant difference in favor of the captopril group. The predefined, categorized, combined endpoint of severe heart failure or death (heart failure necessitating ACE inhibition, VO2max < 10 mL/kg per min, or death) was significantly reduced in the captopril group (n = 7/104) versus placebo (n = 18/104; p = 0.03). Differences were mainly caused by fewer CHF events (delta n = 10). We conclude that ACE inhibition with individualized dose titration markedly reduces the 4-week incidence of severe heart failure or death; > 10 patients per 100 treated gained major benefits from this therapy.", 
    "437": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and prolong survival in animal models and patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Considering the dual function of the ACE, the therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors after MI implicates the renin-angiotensin system and/or the kallikrein-kinin system in the pathophysiology of postinfarction cardiac remodeling. We evaluated the role of kinins, and their potential contribution to the antiremodeling effects of ACE inhibition in this setting. Rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by chronic B2 kinin receptor blockade with icatibant (HOE 140). Additional groups of MI rats were treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, alone or in combination with icatibant. B2 kinin receptor blockade enhanced the deposition of collagen (morphometric analysis) in the left ventricular interstitial space after MI, whereas markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (left ventricular weights and prepro-atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] expression) were not affected. Chronic ACE inhibition reduced collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after MI. The inhibitory action of ACE inhibition on interstitial collagen was partially reversed by B2 kinin receptor blockade. However, B2 kinin receptor blockade did not attenuate the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In conclusion, kinins inhibit the interstitial accumulation of collagen, but do not modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after MI. Kinins contribute to the reduction of myocardial collagen accumulation by ACE inhibition; however, the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are related to reduced generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "438": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-stimulated glucose metabolism and perfusion in muscle tissue seem to be, at least in part, mediated by kinins. However, the relative contribution of direct metabolic or secondary hemodynamically induced effects is unclear. It was the aim of this study to characterize the effects of ACE inhibition and bradykinin on glucose transport while changes in cardiocoronary function that might influence glucose transport were minimized. Hearts from Wistar rats were perfused by a Langendorff preparation and a set of functional parameters were simultaneously measured. Bradykinin (10[-11] M) and fosinoprilate (10[-7] M) were administered at concentrations that did not affect coronary flow. Insulin was employed as reference at half-maximal concentration. The nonmetabolizable glucose analog 3-O-[14C]methyl-D-glucose and the nontransportable tracer L-[3H]glucose were coperfused for the calculation of glucose transport. Using a 2-compartment mathematical model we found that the glucose transport rate, which was doubled with insulin, was increased almost 3-fold by either bradykinin or fosinoprilate. In the presence of the B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 (D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin; icatibant), the effect of both agents was completely abolished. Both agents also induced minor changes in contractility/relaxation parameters that again were completely neutralized with icatibant. A perfusion-independent but B2-kinin receptor-dependent stimulating effect on glucose transport by either bradykinin or fosinoprilate is concluded. This effect could, in analogy to insulin be due to increased glucose transporter translocation, increased endothelium-derived nitric oxide formation, or--despite constant coronary flow conditions--secondary to altered cardiac function.", 
    "439": "We have previously shown that nitric oxide (NO) release by the coronary circulation in the failing and nonfailing human heart is, in part, regulated by local kinin production in coronary microvessels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) also known as kininase II, inactivates kinins. ACE inhibitors prevent kinin breakdown by ACE, thereby increasing the concentration of bradykinin (BK) and related kinins. The goal of this study was to determine if kinins contribute to the therapeutic action of ACE inhibitors. Six hearts from end-stage heart failure patients were harvested at the time of orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Microvessels were prepared as previously described, and nitrite production, a metabolic product of NO in vitro, was determined by the Griess reaction. Microvessels were incubated in the presence of kininogen and bradykinin, and with the ACE inhibitors ramiprilat, enalaprilat, or captopril. All caused dose-dependent increases in nitrite. For instance, ramiprilat increased nitrite from 76 +/- 5.6 to 155 +/- 15 pmol/min per mg wet weight. Nitrite production in response to ACE inhibition was blocked by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NO synthase inhibitor, and icatibant (HOE 140), a B2-kinin receptor-specific antagonist. Furthermore, NO production was prevented by 3 different serine protease inhibitors, which block kallikrein, the enzyme responsible for conversion of kininogen to kinins. Our results indicate that ACE/kininase inhibitors increase NO production by the coronary microvasculature in the failing human heart, through increased available active kinins. The therapeutic action of ACE inhibition in the failing human heart may result in part from increased NO production by coronary microvessels.", 
    "440": "The positive inotropic effects of bradykinin (BK) and 2 analogs resistant to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) were potentiated on isolated guinea pig atrial preparations by enalaprilat. The stable BK analogs, dextran-BK and [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-BK, were as active as BK. Pretreatment for 5 min with enalaprilat augmented the maximal positive inotropic effect of [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-BK 2.8-fold, from 19% to 53% and that of BK from 28% to 42% over baseline; inotropic responses to dextran-BK (1 microM) were similarly increased. The activity of atrial ACE, a zinc-requiring enzyme, was completely inhibited by 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (QSA, 10 mM), which raised the maximal inotropic effect of BK to 39% above baseline. This value rose to 67% when in addition to QSA, 1 microM enalaprilat was added; enalaprilat thus, potentiated the effects of BK independently of enzyme inhibition. The positive inotropic effects to BK and its analogs decline with time in the presence of these agonists. After 10 min of exposure, the response to 1 microM [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-BK decreased to about half, and after 20 min, to 0. Enalaprilat, when present in the tissue bath, prevented the decline in inotropy; even after tachyphylaxis occurred, it reversed this decrease in activity when added. The effects of 1 microM [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-BK, in the absence or presence of enalaprilat, were abolished by the BK B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (0.75 microM). The results indicate that ACE inhibitors, by potentiating the BK effects and blocking BK B2-receptor desensitization, may contribute to the beneficial cardiac effects of BK independently of blocking its inactivation.", 
    "441": "Myocardial ischemia results in the release of a variety of vasoactive substances from coronary vascular endothelial cells and/or from cardiac myocytes. Some of these substances appear to be protective and include nitric oxide and bradykinin. One hypothesis for the pronounced antiarrhythmic effects of preconditioning involves the early generation of bradykinin and, subsequently, nitric oxide. Evidence for early bradykinin release has come from clinical studies involving patients undergoing coronary angioplasty where, in 4 of 5 patients, there was evidence for elevated kinin levels in coronary sinus blood either during balloon inflation (i.e., ischemia) or deflation (reperfusion). The levels reached are sometimes considerable (increases 10-20 fold). The second piece of evidence comes from dogs subjected to a preconditioning stimulus (2 x 5 min periods of ischemia), followed 20 min later by occlusion of the same artery for a 25-min period. This preconditioning procedure markedly reduces ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias and, although under resting conditions there was little difference between arterial and coronary sinus bradykinin levels (125 +/- 22 and 157 +/- 41 pg/mL, respectively), there was a marked increase in coronary sinus levels in preconditioned dogs before the prolonged occlusion (637 +/- 293 pg/mL compared with 114 +/- 18 pg/mL in nonpreconditioned dogs); levels at the end of the prolonged occlusion in the preconditioned dogs were also higher (577 +/- 305 pg/mL compared with 162 +/- 34 pg/mL in control dogs). Other evidence for the involvement of bradykinin and nitric oxide comes from studies in which the generation, or effects, of these mediators have been suppressed (e.g., with the bradykinin B2 receptor blocking agent icatibant, with inhibitors of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway, and by methylene blue). The conclusion is that early bradykinin release is protective under conditions of ischemia, is presumably enhanced during therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is suppressed under conditions of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "442": "There is growing evidence for a local kallikrein-kinin system in the heart. In the ischemic heart the enhanced generation and release of kinins seem to have cardioprotective actions. In isolated rat hearts with ischemia-reperfusion injuries, perfusion with bradykinin reduces the duration and incidence of ventricular fibrillations, improves cardiodynamics, reduces release of cytosolic enzymes, and preserves energy-rich phosphates and glycogen stores. In anesthetized animals, intracoronary infusion of bradykinin is followed by comparable beneficial changes and limits infarct size. Inhibition of breakdown of bradykinin and related peptides induces similar beneficial cardiac effects. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as ramipril increases cardiac kinins and reduces postischemic reperfusion injuries in isolated rat hearts as well as infarct size and remodeling in postinfarcted animals, respectively. Blockade of B2 kinin receptors increases ischemia-induced effects. In isolated hearts, ischemia-reperfusion injuries intensify with the B2 kinin receptor antagonist icatibant, which also abolishes the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and of exogenous bradykinin. Infarct size reduction by ACE inhibitors and bradykinin in anesthetized animals is reversed by icatibant. Kinins contribute to the cardioprotective effects associated with ischemic preconditioning. Preconditioning or bradykinin-induced antiarrhythmic and infarct size-limiting effects are attenuated by icatibant.", 
    "443": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is considered to be an independent risk factor giving rise to ischemia, arrhythmia, and left ventricular dysfunction. In this article, we summarize recent studies performed in our laboratory to investigate (1) the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the cardiac remodeling process, which is triggered by myocardial infarction (MI) or hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy; (2) the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonism on cardiac parameters, such as myocardial infarct size, cardiac hypertrophy, heart function, and myocardial metabolism; (3) the mechanism of an ACE inhibitor-induced increase in cardiac capillary density in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke prone SHR (SHR-SP). We observed that AT1 receptor gene expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (but not in rat coronary endothelial cells) was markedly enhanced after an ischemic insult in vitro. In a rat model in which MI was induced by coronary artery ligation, the AT1 receptor mRNA levels were transiently increased after MI and reached a peak level 24 hours post-MI. The AT2 receptor gene expression increased in a pattern similar to that of the AT1 receptor. ACE expression at the protein level in the repairing scar, which was demonstrated by monoclonal antibody staining, started to increase 2 weeks after MI and reached a peak level 3 weeks post-MI. Furthermore, long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor limited infarct size, prevented cardiac hypertrophy, and improved heart function in the rat MI model. In SHR-SP, long-term treatment with either an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor antagonist improved cardiac function and metabolism. Cardiac metabolism was even improved after low-dose ACE inhibitor treatment, which did not prevent hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. In both SHR and SHR-SP, we found that the ACE inhibitor ramipril significantly increased capillary length density independently of its antihypertensive and antihypertrophic actions. Most of the cardiac effects of the ACE inhibitor could be abolished by a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. Thus, these cardiac effects of ACE inhibitors can be ascribed, at least under our experimental conditions, to ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin potentiation.", 
    "444": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the blood pressure reduction induced by valsartan, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, with that induced by enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in essential hypertension. METHODS: In total 189 adult outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension participated in this double-blind study. Patients were allocated randomly in equal numbers to be administered 80 mg valsartan or 20 mg enalapril daily for 12 weeks. Patients whose blood pressure had not been controlled adequately despite 8 weeks of monotherapy were administered additional therapy with 12.5 mg hydroclorothiazide (HCTZ) daily thereafter. Patients were assessed aftger 4, 8 and 12 weeks of therapy. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) after 8 weeks of therapy. Other variables analyzed included the change in sitting systolic blood pressure and percentage responses after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: Valsartan and enalapril were both effective at lowering the blood pressure. Similar falls were induced in the two groups with a similar time course of blood pressure reduction. The mean decreases in SDBP after 8 weeks of therapy were 13.2 mmHg for valsartan and 12.0 mmHg for enalapril. There was no significant difference between the treatments [P = 0.475, 95% confidence interval of the estimated difference (SBP after therapy - SDBP before therapy) -3.5 to 1.6 mmHg]. After 8 weeks of therapy 60.6% had responded to valsartan and 52.6% to enalapril (P = 0.267). Both treatments were tolerated well. Three patients administered enalapril and one patient administered valsartan discontinued their treatment because it made them cough. CONCLUSION: The data show that 80 mg valsartan is as effective as 20 mg enalapril in the treatment of moderate hypertension and that it is tolerated well.",

Nevertheless, there exists a group of patients, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), who remain at high risk for the development or progression of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). For these patients additional measures such as surgery and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis have to be considered. The objective of this multicenter trial, which included 30 clinical centers (28 in Germany and one each in Scotland and Luxembourg), was to determine if repeated LDL apheresis using the Liposorber LA-15 system (Kaneka Corporation, Osaka, Japan) could lead to an additional acute and time averaged lowering of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in severely hypercholesterolemic patients whose cholesterol levels could not be controlled by appropriate diet and maximum drug therapy. A total of 6,798 treatments were performed on 120 patients, including 8 with homozygous FH, 75 with heterozygous FH, and 37 with unclassified FH or other hyperlipidemias from 1988 through 1994. The mean TC and mean LDL-C levels at baseline were 410.0 mg/dl and 333.9 mg/dl, respectively. LDL apheresis was performed once a week or at least once every 2 weeks in all patients. During treatment with the Liposorber system the mean acute percentage reduction was 52.6% for TC and 63.1% for LDL-C. Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were also substantially reduced to 60.6% and 47.5%, respectively. Fibrinogen, a potential risk factor for CHD, was reduced by 26.2%. In contrast, the mean acute reduction of high density lipoprotein (HDL) was only 3.4%. During the course of the treatment, the time averaged levels of TC and LDL-C were reduced by approximately 39% and 50%, respectively, compared to baseline levels. The adverse events (AEs) were those generally associated with extracorporeal treatments. The most common AE was hypotension, with 69 episodes corresponding to 1% of all treatments reported in 44 of the 120 patients treated. All other kinds of AEs occurred in less than 0.2% of the treatments. The treatment with the Liposorber LA-15 system was overall well tolerated. It should be noted, however, that a more severe type of hypotensive reaction associated with flush, bradycardia, and dyspnea was reported in patients taking concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medication. Except for such anaphylactoid-like reactions associated with the intake of ACE inhibitors, the Liposorber LA-15 system represents a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients suffering from severe hypercholesterolemia that could not be adequately controlled by diet and maximum drug therapy.",

    "458": "The removal capacity of an eliminating organ by metabolism and/or excretion is often expressed as its clearance. Metabolic and excretory clearances are considered to be mutually independent, and the sum of these constitute the whole organ clearance. The influence of metabolism on estimates of the excretory clearance and vice versa was examined for the liver and kidney with physiologically based models. Mass transfer first-order rate equations describing transport and removal were derived. Upon inversion of the matrices originating from the coefficients of these equations, the area under the curve (AUC) and clearance (dose/AUC) were obtained with the liver or kidney as the eliminating organ. A more complex solution was found to exist for the kidney since glomerular filtration, secretion; reabsorption, and intrarenal metabolism were present. To ascertain the effect of excretion on estimates of the metabolic clearance as well as the effect of metabolism on estimates of the excretory clearance, intrinsic clearances for excretion or metabolism were set to zero. Clearance values were found to be altered when alternate pathways were present. Whereas excretory clearance estimates were consistently reduced in the presence of metabolism, metabolic clearance estimates were affected differentially by excretion and varied according to the site of metabolism. Excretion reduced metabolic clearance estimates when metabolism occurred intracellularly. If metabolism occurred intraluminally (e.g., on the renal brush border or luminal membrane), the metabolic clearance estimate could become higher since the substrate was made available to the enzymes following its excretion. As expected, these changes depended on the relative magnitudes of the intrinsic clearances for metabolism and excretion. The above theory was applied to the elimination of enalapril which is both metabolized and excreted by the perfused rat liver and kidney preparations. Data obtained in these studies were consistent with a set of published physiologic parameters denoting transfer and intrinsic clearances. Perturbations on clearance estimates were studied by setting the metabolic/excretory intrinsic clearance to zero, then to some finite value. In liver, the avid hepatocellular metabolism of enalapril reduced biliary clearance by 73%. For the kidney, the fractional excretion (FE or unbound excretory clearance/glomerular filtration rate) was decreased modestly (from 0.64 to 0.44) with intracellular esterolysis, whereas if metabolism had occurred intraluminally, FE would have been significantly decreased (from 1.8 to 0.45). Simulation results show clearly that clearance estimates are affected by the presence of alternate removal pathways, and question the well-established principle the metabolic and excretory clearance estimates are independent of each other.",

The program thus differs from existing programs for pharmacophore mapping in that it does not require all of the molecules to share exactly the same pattern of points, although it will find such a common pattern if it does, indeed, exist. MPHIL uses a genetic algorithm (GA) approach in which an initial, and very rapid, GA is used to suggest possible combinations of points that are then processed by the second GA to yield the final 3D pattern.", 
    "465": "The presence of persistent microalbuminuria in IDDM is strongly predictive of the future development of end stage renal failure and of cardiovascular disease to a lesser extent. Screening for microalbuminuria is an essential component of modern diabetes practice, as effective antihypertensive therapy, and particularly, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is of proven benefit in retarding progression of renal disease. Cost benefit analysis justifies the expense of microalbuminuria screening programmes and early intervention. It has been estimated that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in microalbuminuric IDDM will save 5200 Pounds-11,000 Pounds per year of life saved. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are not free of side-effects, and it is therefore essential, given the intrinsic variability of the albumin excretion rate, and the regression to normoalbuminuria of a significant proportion of patients, to confirm the diagnosis of microalbuminuria by repeated measurements prior to the commencement of treatment. The value of intensive glycaemic control is unproven, and further prospective studies are required. There are no proven therapies for the prevention of macrovascular disease in IDDM, although the value of cessation of smoking and aggressive blood pressure control are undoubted in the non-diabetic population. Controversy persists about the value of lipid lowering therapy, especially in young patients, although even in this group there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria is the strongest known predictor of cardiovascular disease in NIDDM; in contrast to the situation in the non-diabetic population, active lipid lowering therapy is not of proven cardiac benefit, but intervention seems justifiable when taken in the context of the very high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria is also predictive of end stage renal disease in NIDDM. Although intervention with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has not been proven to prevent end stage renal disease, stabilisation of albumin excretion rate and creatinine clearance have been demonstrated in normotensive NIDDM, and it seems likely that longer term follow-up studies will confirm the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the prevention of end-stage renal disease. The observed predictive power of microalbuminuria as regards both cardiac and renal risk in NIDDM when considered in conjunction with the preliminary results of the benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition lend further support to the employment of microalbuminuria screening in NIDDM.", 
    "466": "We evaluated effects of perindopril (Prestarium-SERVIER) in the treatment of the primary hypertension in 41 patients (mean age 41.6) in the I or II degrees WHO using 24 ambulatory blood pressure measurement and echocardiography. Investigation were performed before and after 3 and 6 months of the treatment. Initially 4 mg of perindopril was given and individually was increased after 3 months to 8 mg according to 24 ambulatory blood pressure measurement results. We obtained significant decrease of blood pressure in 3 (134.6/86.6 mm Hg) and in 6 (135/88, 9 mm Hg) months of treatment in comparison to baseline values (141.8/91.1 mm Hg), decrease of left ventricular mass to 244.4 g in 3 and 248.8 g after 6 months (baseline 258.5 g), as well as index of left ventricular mass, wall thickness and left ventricular end diastolic volume. There was no significant differences in: ejection, heart rate, left ventricular inflow on the successive investigations. Good effect of perindopril we observed in 31 patients (75.6%) after 6 months of treatment. We did not observe any serious side effects of perindopril.", 
    "467": "Perindopril in treatment hypertension effectively reduces the level of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean) without any effect on heart rate. Prestarium reduces left ventricular mass, intraseptal wall thickness and left ventricular end diastolic volume. There is no influence on inflow to the left ventricle as well as on ejection fraction.",

All patients received either thrombolytic therapy (n = 46) or underwent primary coronary angioplasty (n = 25). Medication was started within 48 h admission to hospital and continued for 48 weeks. The process of left ventricular remodelling was assessed with two-dimensional echocardiography at 3 weeks and 1 year after the acute onset, and was related to the severity of the residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery.", 
    "470": "Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 39.2% +/- 8.7%. During the study period left ventricular end-diastolic volume index increased from 48.2 +/- 9.9 ml.m-2 to 54.6 +/- 12.2 ml.m-2 at 3 weeks, and to 59.4 +/- 17.0 ml.m-2 after 1 year I control patients (P < 0.001). In the enalapril-treated patients, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index increased from 50.0 +/- 16.1 to 57.7 +/- 19.3 ml.m-2 at 3 weeks, and to 61.9 +/- 22.7 ml.m-2 after 1 year (P < 0.001). Both at 3 weeks and after 1 year, no overall differences in left ventricular volumes were observed between the enalapril and the placebo group (both ns). However, patients with a residual stenosis severity of > or = 70% in the infarct-related artery (n = 43) showed significant attenuation of remodelling by enalapril (n = 22) when compared to placebo (n = 21).

As left ventricular dilatation is an early process we suggest that treatment with ACE inhibition should be started as soon as possible in this group of patients.", 
    "472": "The outlook in heart failure patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy has improved dramatically over the past ten years. The availability of many excellent drugs apart from angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has contributed to this. The best current survival rates reported are, however, in association with deliberate optimisation of haemodynamic parameters and incorporation of functional testing to monitor disease progression. These practises could well be adopted more widely in Australia and New Zealand. Surgical options for heart failure continue to expand, but apart from heart transplantation, remain somewhat experimental.",

They were treated with placebo or one of the following ACE inhibitors for 30 days: captopril, cilazapril, enalapril, lisinopril or quinapril. HRV was assessed 3 days after the onset of AMI (baseline), and 30 days after treatment. Fifteen patients with stable coronary artery disease and 15 healthy volunteers, age- and sex-matched with AMI patients, served as controls.", 
    "475": "At baseline, time and frequency domain HRV indices in the AMI groups were equally less than those in patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal volunteers. Compared with placebo, quinapril, lisinopril and captopril changed frequency domain HRV indices 30 days after initiation of treatment, indicating an increase in vagal tone, whereas enalapril and cilazapril had no significant effect on these indices. Most of the time domain HRV indices 30 days after initiation of treatment increased significantly in all patients treated with ACE inhibitors, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Frequency domain and time domain HRV indices 30 days after treatment in the quinapril group did not differ statistically from those in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but were less than those in normal volunteers.", 
    "476": "Quinapril, lisinopril and captopril improved frequency domain HRV indices related to vagal tone, whereas cilazapril and enalapril had no effect on these indices. This influence of some ACE inhibitors on HRV may be beneficial in reducing the risk for sudden death in post-myocardial infarction patients.", 
    "477": "Aging and hypertension are associated with a progressive decline in renal blood flow and renal function. As a result, physicians planning therapeutic strategies to control blood pressure need to consider these changes and how they relate to potassium homeostasis, particularly in elderly patients. Commonly used antihypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics need to be used with increasing caution in patients with declining renal function. This is especially important in patients with diabetes who may also have type IV renal tubular acidosis, and in patients given concomitant therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other therapies such as calcium channel blockers, particularly those that gate atrioventricular nodal conduction, also need to be used with care in people with significant renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia, as this clinical scenario may result in a greater risk of complete heart block.",

    "479": "To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin system, we measured different renin-angiotensin system parameters during the first day of treatment (Day 1) as well as after two weeks of treatment (Day 14). Ramipril was given orally once daily to adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats. Renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in the plasma, renal cortex and renal medullar were assessed at Day 1 and Day 14 of the treatment. In the plasma, both renin activity and angiotensin I increased 10 to 15 fold one to four hours after acute as well as at Day 14 of ramipril treatment and then returned to basal values within 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin II levels were not significantly decreased at Day 1 or Day 14. The decrease in the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio suggested a sustained inhibition of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme at Day 14. In the renal cortex and medulla, a clearly different pattern was observed: in ramipril treated rats, renin activity in the renal cortex and medulla did not change at Day 1 but at Day 14 we observed a slight and sustained increase in renin activity. Despite very high basal levels of renin activity, angiotensin I levels in the renal cortex were comparable to those in the plasma. The angiotensin I level increased only one-fold one hour after ramipril intake at Day 1 and Day 14. This suggests that angiotensinogen may have a limiting role in the synthesis of angiotensin I in the kidney. Angiotensin II levels were slightly higher in the renal cortex and medulla than in the plasma suggesting local synthesis of the peptide. In the kidney, angiotensin II levels decreased one and four hours after the acute or prolonged ramipril treatment and the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio was reduced at the same time. Our results show that the responses of the plasma and kidney components of the renin-angiotensin system to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are different in the plasma and the kidney suggesting that the circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin system are at least in part independent.", 
    "480": "Kinins, by an autocrine or paracrine hormonal action, are potent modulators of regional vasomotricity. Their effects on the renal circulation are not well defined. The aim of this study was to analyse the renal vascular response induced by bradykinin, to precise the type(s) of receptor involved and to evaluate the contribution of various peptidases in the local catabolism of the kinin. Experiments were performed on the isolated rat kidney, perfused in an open circuit, at a constant flow of 8 mL/min, with a Tyrode's solution. Vasodilator responses were evaluated after renal vascular tone had been restored by a continuous perfusion with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Infusion of bradykinin (0.1-30 nM) induced a concentration-dependent renal vasorelaxation. A maximal response of 39.5 +/- 2.8% (n = 32) reversion of the tone induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (about 50% of the maximal response induced by acetylcholine on the same kidneys) was obtained at 30 nM. Bradykinin-induced vasodilatation was completely inhibited by HOE 140 (10 nM), a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. At a supramaximal concentration of 300 nM, bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation was modulated by a concomitant vasoconstriction. A concentration-dependent vasoconstriction was also obtained with desArg9 bradykinin (1-8 microM), a selective agonist of the bradykinin B1 receptor. The inhibition of neutral endopeptidase by phosphoramidon (10 microM) or the inhibition of carboxypeptidase M by MGTPA (10 microM) did not modify the bradykinin-induced renal vasorelaxation. On the other hand, the inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme by lisinopril (1 microM) potentiated by about 32% the vasorelaxant response induced by 30 nM bradykinin (52.3 +/- 11.8% relaxation, n = 5, p < 0.05). Present results demonstrate that 1) bradykinin primarily evokes B2 receptor-linked renal vasodilatation, 2) bradykinin B1 receptors appear also to be present on the rat renal vasculature and 3) angiotensin 1 converting enzyme contributes to the local vascular catabolism of the kinin.", 
    "481": "Results are presented which assess the reactivity of isolated human internal mammary artery fragments from non-hypertensive and treated hypertensive patients in vitro. Material from three patient groups was examined: group I, no hypertension; group II, arterial hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors; and group III, arterial hypertension treated with nifedipine. Responses to KCl, norepinephrine and acetylcholine, as well as the influence of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on the effects of norepinephrine were tested. Response to KCl was highest in group III, while the contractile reactivity to norepinephrine was depressed in group II. Relaxation after acetylcholine was enhanced in groups II and III. Incubation of vessel fragments with L-NMMA sensitized the tissue to norepinephrine in the order of potency group II>group III>group I. Internal mammary artery function as the graft, and particularly in terms of endothelial function, is not adversely affected in arterial hypertension, although proper antihypertensive treatment may be essential.", 
    "482": "The correlation of brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity with renal hypertension has been investigated in rats. NOS activity was measured by oxyhaemoglobin and by conversion of radioactive arginine to citrulline. There was significant elevation of blood pressure (54% increase) along with left ventricular hypertrophy (26% greater than the control) 8 weeks after coarctation. The brain NOS activity was also significantly reduced in coarctated animals (45% of the control value). Treatment with captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or centhaquin (centrally acting antihypertensive agent) led to significant reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy and a marked recovery in the brain NOS activity (to 92% and 135% of the control, respectively). Nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) also brought about normalization of blood pressure but the left ventricular hypertrophy was not prevented. The brain NOS activity in the nifedipine treated group also showed a significant trend of recovery (to 73% of the control NOS activity). The results suggested that there is an inverse correlation between brain NOS activity and blood pressure level.", 
    "483": "A 23-year-old woman with longstanding renovascular disease associated with intimal dysplasia presented with stage I-II hypertension 6 years following bilateral percutaneous renal artery angioplasties (associated with normotension after antihypertensive agents). Following the diagnostic selective left renal arteriogram, blood pressure (BP) rose from 140/90 mm Hg to 200/130 mm Hg over 30-40min. Reassessment angiography revealed a proximal intimal dissection with the development of a lengthy false lumen. Attempts to cross the dissected area for stent placement were unsuccessful. To avoid the consequences of severe and accelerated hypertension, intravenous enalaprilat was administered (which lowered BP to 160-170/100 mm Hg) and the patient underwent emergency aortorenal bypass surgery. Fortunately, the BP normalised post-operatively and renal function remained normal. This case illustrates the possibility that catheterisation of a renal artery may lead to acute, severe hypertension by creating an acutely ischaemic kidney through intimal or medial arterial dissection. In such cases, pharmacologic blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may provide stabilisation of BP to allow surgical revascularisation to proceed safely.",

Volunteers received valsartan 80 mg (n = 364), lisinopril 10 mg (n = 187) or placebo (n = 183) daily for 4 weeks, with subsequent titration of dose depending on response to treatment (valsartan 80 mg titrated to valsartan 160 mg once daily or valsartan 80 mg twice daily, lisinopril 10 mg titrated to lisonopril 20 mg once daily). Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.", 
    "486": "The primary variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP). Other efficacy variables included sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and percentage of 'successful' responders (SDBP <90 mm Hg or > or =10 mm Hg reduction from baseline).", 
    "487": "All active treatment groups were shown to demonstrate significant reductions in SDBP compared to placebo at endpoint of therapy (least mean square reduction from baseline: valsartan 80/160 mg: -5.25 mm Hg (Cl -7.17, -3.34, P< 0.001); valsartan 80/80 mg twice daily: -5.63 mm Hg (Cl -7.51, -3.75, P< 0.001); lisinopril 10/20 mg: -6.93 mm Hg, (Cl -8.81, -5.05, P< 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the active treatment groups at endpoint of therapy. In patients requiring titration to a higher dose (placebo n = 142, valsartan 80/80 twice daily n = 124, valsartan 80/160 n = 114, lisinopril 10/20 n = 120), there were no significant treatment differences between valsartan 160 mg given as a single daily dose or as 80 mg twice daily (P = 0.658). Both valsartan and lisinopril produced similarly high percentages of 'successful' responders at endpoint of therapy. A somewhat higher frequency of drug related cough was observed in lisinopril treated patients (8%) compared to valsartan (1.1%) or placebo (0.5%).", 
    "488": "Valsartan 80 mg daily, with titration to 160 mg daily as required, provides similar antihypertensive efficacy to lisinopril 10 mg daily with titration to 20 mg daily. Valsartan provides a new antihypertensive agent with comparable efficacy to lisinopril and appears to be associated with a reduced incidence of cough.", 
    "489": "A multiple drug regimen consisting of trandolapril, verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were sequentially added in an open-label evaluation of patients with severe hypertension. Ninety patients (58 white and 32 black patients) were titrated on one or more drugs and followed for a 19-week maintenance period. Statistically significant (P = 0.001) mean (+/-s.d.) decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 9.0 (+/-9.3) mm Hg for trandolapril, 13.9 (+/-11.0) mm Hg for the trandolapril + verapamil (TV) combination, and 19.0 (+/-12.3) mm Hg when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the combination. The decrease in BP observed on TV combination therapy plus HCTZ was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for the TV combination, which was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for trandolapril monotherapy. Clinical responder rates were 44.8%, 56% and 77.7% for trandolapril monotherapy, trandolapril + verapamil combination therapy and triple therapy, respectively. Black and white patients had similar response rates, but black patients appeared to benefit more from the addition of HCTZ; 20% of black patients achieved a post-treatment supine DBP <90 mm Hg compared to 12.8% of white patients. This study demonstrates that the addition of verapamil to trandolapril has an additive effect on BP that is maintained throughout the day.", 
    "490": "We examined the antihypertensive efficacy of: (1) sublingual-oral single doses of captopril (25 mg) and nifedipine-capsules (10 mg) in 9 + 9 white patients and in 9 + 8 black patients with hypertensive crisis; and (2) a single oral dose of the slow-acting preparation of nifedipine-retard (20 mg) in another 10 black patients. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed at 10 min intervals for 6 h after administration. After 6 h, the BP falls induced by these drugs were still significantly lower than the baseline placebo values. Hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was established more rapidly than that of captopril in both white and black patients, and of nifedipine-retard in black patients. Considering the area under the curve of BP values during the 6-h treatment, the overall hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was similar to captopril in white patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine-retard in black patients. In white patients similar maximal drops of BP (mean+/-s.e.m.) were obtained with nifedipine-capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril (69+/-4/50+/-3 mm Hg). In black patients the maximal drop of BP of nifedipine-capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P < 0.02) than that of captopril (48+/-4/32+/-3 mm Hg) but similar to that of nifedipine-retard (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, in contrast to nifedipine-capsules and captopril, nifedipine-retard produced a slower drop in BP. The time of peak drop in BP of both nifedipine-capsules and captopril occurred within the first 2 h whereas with nifedipine-retard it occurred only between 4 and 6 h after administration. Fewer patients reported side effects with nifedipine-retard as compared with the other two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine reduces BP for at least 6 h in both white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine is more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow release form of nifedipine-retard effectively and safely lowers BP while achieving a rapid enough effect without the critical rapid falls in BP that occur with nifedipine-capsules.", 
    "491": "In a double-blind, randomized trial in a consecutive group of postinfarct patients in treatment with diuretic agents for congestive heart failure, the 3 month rate of cardiac events (i.e., death, repeat infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or repeat admission because of heart failure) was 14% in patients treated with verapamil and trandolapril and 35% in patients treated with trandolapril (p = 0.01). In another study of patients with angina pectoris and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, trandolapril plus verapamil improved exercise duration and left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings indicate that combined treatment with verapamil and trandolapril may be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "492": "Coronary artery disease and its sequelae remain the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. Because the pathophysiologic characteristics of coronary artery disease are multifactorial, impairment of endothelial function featuring enhanced vasoconstriction, increased platelet vessel wall interaction, adherence of monocytes, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells are crucially involved. Endothelial cells release numerous vasoactive substances regulating function of vascular smooth muscle and trafficking blood cells such as nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator also inhibiting cellular growth and migration. In addition, NO possesses antiatherogenic and thromboresistant properties by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. These effects are counterbalanced by endothelial vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1. In the blood vessel wall, the local vascular effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists are synergistic. ACE inhibitors diminish the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin. Calcium antagonists counteract angiotensin II and endothelin-1 at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing Ca2+ inflow and facilitating the vasodilator effects of NO. In hypertensive animals, long-term combination therapy with verapamil and trandolapril is particularly effective in reversing endothelial dysfunction. Further, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists exert beneficial vascular and complementary hemodynamic effects. Whereas ACE inhibitors inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and reduce sympathetic outflow, calcium antagonists dilate large conduit and resistance arteries. Because small vessels appear to be more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ than larger vessels, nifedipine and verapamil effectively inhibit endothelin-induced vasoconstriction in vitro and in vivo in the resistance circulation. Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors substantially reduces morbidity and mortality rates in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction; beneficial effects of verapamil in secondary prevention are confined to patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. In summary, long-term combination therapy of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists might provide beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease because they exert synergistic hemodynamic, antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and antiatherogenic properties.", 
    "493": "The management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has undergone major changes in the last decade. Today clinical practice can be based on sound evidence derived from a large number of well-conducted, randomized, large-scale clinical trials. Because of this, Scientific Societies, such as the European Society of Cardiology, have recently produced evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of AMI. This article summarizes the up-to-date, evidence-based treatments for patients with AMI, and their limitations in terms of uncertainty and transferability to real populations.", 
    "494": "This study was conducted to provide evidence of an association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use and clinical outcomes among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function who are treated in the community setting, and to compare the magnitude and direction of these associations among the subset with preserved function to the subset with LV contractile dysfunction. Seven hundred sixty-three hospital survivors who had measurement of systolic function were identified from among a series of consecutive patients with CHF admitted to 10 community hospitals. They were prospectively followed-up for 6 months after discharge to track death, hospital readmission, and quality of life. Outcomes were stratified by ACE inhibitor use among those with preserved systolic function, defined as an LV ejection fraction (EF) > or = 40% or qualitatively normal contractility, and among those with systolic dysfunction, defined as an EF < or = 39% or qualitatively abnormal contractility. ACE inhibitor prescription rates were higher among the 413 patients with LV contractile dysfunction than among the 350 with preserved function (77% vs 54%, p < 0.0001). Drug-treated and untreated patients were similar in many ways, although lower serum creatinine levels, lower EF, and a higher prevelance of high blood pressure characterized those receiving ACE inhibitors. After adjusting for these and other covariables, ACE inhibitor use among the group with normal function was associated with a trend for a lower risk of death and delayed time to hospital readmission but not absolute rates of rehospitalization. By comparison, ACE inhibition among those with impaired systolic function was associated with trends for lower risk of death and rehospitalization. These data suggest that ACE inhibition may be of benefit when CHF occurs in the context of preserved or normal LV systolic function. Large, multicenter, prospective randomized trials to better test this hypothesis are warranted.", 
    "495": "A 68-year-old man experienced systemic pruritus since he was 63 years old, and systemic sclerosis and skin pigmentation were observed when he was 64. When he developed dyspnea the same year, he was admitted and SSc was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical and skin biopsy findings, lung fibrosis on X-P and TBLB findings. At 65, his dyspnea reappeared along with elevated blood pressure, acute renal failure and lung congestion, and he was diagnosed as having a scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) from the clinical and renal biopsy findings. Hemodialysis was started because he showed mental disturbance, and this and other acute symptoms were subsequently reduced. As he showed no recovery from his renal failure, the patient has been maintained on hemodialysis for over four years now. In the meantime, his sclerosis has improved and antinuclear antibody almost disappeared. Hemodialysis appears to be the most likely reason for his improvement, although spontaneous remission, D-penicillamine and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy may also have contributed, considering the short period and the small amount of drugs given until improvement.", 
    "496": "Carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) from human liver were purified using Q-Sepharose, Sephadex G-150, isoelectrofocusing and Con A-Sepharose. The calculated molecular mass of the pI 5.3 enzyme was 120 kDa and 61 kDa from the results of Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), respectively, suggesting that this enzyme is a dimer. On the other hand, carboxylesterase pI 4.5, with a molecular mass of 64 kDa, was a monomer. The activities of both enzymes were inhibited by typical serine enzyme inhibitors. Amino acid sequence analysis of the purified enzymes pI 5.3 and 4.5 showed high homology with rabbit carboxylesterase form 1 and 2, respectively. The results also suggested that carboxylesterase pI 5.3 is identical to the deduced amino acid sequence from cDNA for HU1, and that carboxylesterase pI 4.5 is identical to the deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA registered as human carboxylesterase (hCE-2) in GenBank. We first purified carboxylesterase pI 4.5 and investigated its hydrolytic activity upon various drugs. The two enzymes differed in substrate specificity. Prodrugs of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as delapril and imidapril, were converted to active metabolites by carboxylesterase pI 5.3, but not by carboxylesterase pI 4.5. The hydrolysis velocity of temocapril by carboxylesterase pI 5.3 was 12-fold faster than by carboxylesterase pI 4.5. In contrast, aspirin, oxybutynin and procaine were hydrolyzed by only carboxylesterase pI 4.5. We also found that an amide-linkage in drugs, except for that in aniracetam, was not a good substrate for the two enzymes. Consequently, carboxylesterases pI 5.3 and 4.5 may be involved in the metabolism of various drugs containing an ester-linkage.",

Benazepril was administered orally at a dosage of 7.5 mg (about 0.5 mg/kg) both as a single dose and then once daily for 14 consecutive days. The prodrug, benazepril, and its active metabolite, benazeprilat, were measured in plasma using a gas chromatography mass-spectrometry method with mass-selective detection. 2. Benazepril appeared quickly in the plasma (tmax 0.5 h) and was rapidly eliminated by metabolism to benazeprilat. Peak benazeprilat concentrations were attained later (tmax 1.25 h) and declined biphasically with a rapid elimination phase (t1/2 lambda 1 1.1 and 1.7 h after single and the last repeated dose respectively) followed by a terminal elimination phase (t1/2 lambda z 11.7 and 19.0 h after single and repeated dose respectively). The mean residence time for benazeprilat was 15.2 h after the single dose and 17.4 h after the 14th dose. 3. Repeated administration of benazepril produced moderate bioaccumulation of benazeprilat; the ratio of AUC[0-->24 h]'s after the 14th dose as compared with the single dose was 1.47, equivalent to a half-life for accumulation (t1/2acc) of 14.6 h. Steady-state benazeprilat concentrations at peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) were reached within three doses. 4. The pharmacodynamics of benazepril were assessed by measurement of plasma ACE activity. After both single doses and at steady-state, benazepril produced inhibition of ACE activity in all dogs that was maximal at peak effect (Emax = 100%) and long-lasting (> 85% inhibition was present at 24 h). The long duration of action of benazepril on plasma ACE is due to the presence of the terminal elimination phase of benazeprilat, even though most of the metabolite is rapidly eliminated from the plasma.",

    "500": "The age at onset of MMD ranged from 9 months to 7 years 1 month (mean, 3.3 years). The most common initial manifestation of MMD was transient ischemic attack. Hypertension was detected between 4 years 4 months and 12 years 3 months (mean, 7.87 years). Unstimulated plasma renin activity was elevated in all six cases. Renal ultrasonography and captopril technetium 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid scan showed abnormal findings in four of five and in three of four available studies, respectively. However, both imaging studies showed abnormal findings only in the most severely affected kidneys even with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Renal arteriography revealed bilateral lesions in three of the patients and unilateral lesions in the others. Renal angioplasty was performed in four cases but was successful in only one and partially successful in another. A renal artery specimen obtained during renal autotransplantation showed intimal fibroplasia. At the last follow-up, one patient had normal blood pressure without the use of antihypertensive agents, but the other five patients needed this medication to control blood pressure.", 
    "501": "Because RVHT may be more commonly associated with MMD than has hitherto been appreciated, it is recommended that blood pressure be carefully followed and that diagnostic procedures for RVHT be carried out in hypertensive patients with MMD.", 
    "502": "There is a subgroup of patients with coronary artery disease who are refractory to the therapeutical methods so far applied. We report on 128 patients who fulfill this definition and have therefore undergone pure transmyocardial laser revascularisation (TMLR) or transmyocardial laser revascularisation in combination with coronary bypass surgery at our institution. The patients can be characterized by a long history of coronary artery disease with multiple revascularizing procedures, e.g. bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), pronounced symptoms of coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure in the presence of markedly reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and intense antiischemic medical therapy. The patients were 62.2 +/- 9.8 (SD) years of age, in 89.9% of them at least one bypass operation and in 44.5% up to more than three percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCAs) had been performed prior to TMLR. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 90.7% of patients and 89.8% were in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classes III or IV and 94.5% of them were in the NYHA classes III or IV. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.5 +/- 16.4% and all of the patients were under intense antiischemic medical treatment which included nitrates or molsidomine in 96.9%, beta blockers in 53.1%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) in 44.5%, digitalis in 22.7% and diuretics in 52.3% of patients. The preoperative data on myocardial viability, inducible ischemia and coronary morphology provided important clinical information for the decision, which revascularizing method would be the most appropriate for each vessel or myocardial region. This had to be weighed against the patient's operative risk, which is predominantly determined by the left ventricular ejection fraction, the arteriosclerotic involvement of the remaining vascular system and concomitant diseases, particularly of pulmonary origin.", 
    "503": "Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but their proper therapeutic role is controversial. Nevertheless, drugs from this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than are their long term effects on harder end-points such as mortality. Such long term data are sorely needed, particularly for hypertension. An increased risk with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly seen across several studies of patients with coronary disease. In coronary patients with heart failure, the deleterious effects of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil outweigh any possible benefit. Long acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not share all of the adverse effects of the older drugs of this class; however, their long term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of the limitations of calcium channel blockers, based upon clinical trial evidence, often leads the practitioner to choose a drug from another class, where efficacy has been clearly proven.", 
    "504": "Hypertension remains a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Classification of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is 1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, 2) chronic hypertension, 3) chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia-eclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by the triad of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema but these findings are not specific. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain unknown, several factors such as abnormalities in prostaglandin systems, in coagulation process, derangements of the endothelium and so on. Management of preeclampsia is bed rest, aspirin administration, antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, hydralazine, alpha-methyldopa) would be used for reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "505": "Systemic hypertension is accompanied by various renal diseases. Lowering of blood pressure is widely recognized effective for slowing further decline of renal function. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) have recently emerged as antihypertensive drugs endowed with renoprotective action directed specifically to the kidney. Improvement of glomerular hypertension which is more remarkably observed in ACEI than in CCB, is thought to be a factor responsible for renoprotection. Although this effect is widely shown in experimental models, consensus has not yet been reached as to whether this effect as well as the therapeutic efficacy are really exerted in various clinical settings other than diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "506": "The one of the most important goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent and improve the hypertensive heart disease including cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease. The regression of cardiac hypertrophy by treatment reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. ACE inhibitor (ACEI) may be the most powerful among antihypertensive agents to regress hypertrophy. Ca-antagonist and ACEI can improve the impaired coronary flow reserve by microvascular circulation. Recently, the evidences have been accumulated that the release of nitric oxide (NO) from the coronary artery of hypertension is reduced. \"TREND\" study proved that ACEI can improve this decreases in the clinical study. For the heart failure, ACEI is a effective drugs, and Ca-antagonist and beta-blocker also have been getting good results.", 
    "507": "Several experimental studies suggest many similarities between the effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on the arterial wall. Both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia have proinflammatory effects on the artery. An increased production of oxygen-free radicals leads to increased transcription of redox-sensitive genes, which increases the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the endothelium, resulting in increased recruitment of monocytes to the endothelium. The oxidative stress on the arterial wall may occur in both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, therefore a synergistic reaction between hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may play a role in the atherosclerotic process as common causal mechanisms. Among therapeutic strategies to protect the vascular injury in both hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic state, future research should include direct attack on these common mechanisms.", 
    "508": "The number of patients with non-insulin-dependent-diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is dramatically increasing in Japan and estimated to be 6 million, more than one of ten adults. It is well known that more than a half of diabetics are hypertensive. Therefore, it is very important to treat hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events as well as end-stage renal disease. At first, life style modification such as body weight reduction, exercise and restriction of salt and alcohol intake will be recommended. Improved glycemic control by such a non-pharmacological therapy will lower blood pressure. Recent studies demonstrated that hypoglycemic agents improving insulin resistance such as metformin and troglitazone reduce blood pressure. If these maneuvers do not lower blood pressure, hypotensive medication will be necessary. As a first line therapy, ACE inhibitor, alpha 1-blocker or Ca-channel blocker will be selected. In diabetics with proteinuria or micro-albuminuria, ACE inhibitors will be effective to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "509": "Nonpeptide angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonists, AT1 receptor antagonists are newly developed and useful drugs for hypertension and congestive heart failure. In Japan, the efficacy and safety of losartan and candesartan cilexetil in patients with essential hypertension have been evaluated by the double-blind, parallel group-comparison study using enalapril as control drug. Both trials revealed that these drugs showed a hypotensive effect comparable to that of enalapril with a high safety since the adverse drug reaction of cough was recognized in very few patients. Furthermore, a recent randomised trial of losartan versus captopril in patients over 65 with heart failure, evaluation of losartan in the elderly study (ELITE), showed that losartan was associated with a lower mortality than that found with captopril. Further studies will clarify differences in protection of cardiovascular system with a long-term treatment between AT1, receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "510": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors now have an accepted place in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. With the discovery and development of captopril, several other ACE inhibitors have been synthesized and introduced for clinical use. All ACE inhibitors bind to zinc ions located in the active site of the ACE molecule. ACE inhibitors can be classified according to the ligand of the zinc ion of ACE, into 3 different structural types: (1) the first type such as captopril has a sulphhydryl moiety as the ligand; (2) the second type such as enalapril uses a carboxyl moiety as the ligand; (3) the third type such as fosinopril uses neither a sulphhydryl nor carboxyl group, but a phosphinic acid as the zinc binding moiety. ACE inhibitors can also be classified according to the excretion route of their active moiety, into 2 different excretion route types:(1) excreated mainly through the kidney such as captopril, enalaprilat, lisinopril, benazeprilat, imdaprilat, trandraprilat, etc.; (2) excreated both in the bile and urine such as fosinoprilat, temocaprilat, zofenoprilat etc. ACE inhibitors have clinically beneficial effects not only for patients with either hypertension or congestive heart failure, but also can be used to prevent the progression of renal dysfunction induced by hypertension and diabetes mellitus.", 
    "511": "1. We compared the relaxant effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) 1-27 with that of a newly developed PACAP 1-27 analogue, [Arg15,20,21Leu17]-PACAP-Gly-Lys-Arg-NH2, in the guinea-pig trachea and primate bronchi in vitro (n = 4-5). 2. In the guinea-pig trachea precontracted by a submaximally effective carbachol concentration (0.1 microM), cumulative administration of PACAP 1-27 and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (3 nM-3 microM) caused significant and concentration-dependent smooth muscle relaxation, with salbutamol being approximately one log-step more potent in this model. However, in primate bronchi precontracted by carbachol (0.1 microM), cumulative administration of PACAP 1-27 and salbutamol caused concentration-dependent smooth muscle relaxation with very similar potencies and maximum relaxant effects. 3. In the guinea-pig trachea, non-cumulative administration of the PACAP 1-27 analogue and the original PACAP 1-27 (0.3-3 microM) caused concentration-dependent relaxation with a very similar maximum relaxant effect and potency. However, the onset and offset of action was markedly slower for the PACAP 1-27 analogue than for the original PACAP 1-27 (< 90% versus < 10% of peak relaxation remaining 6 h after administration). Separate experiments confirmed that the PACAP 1-27 analogue also caused significant relaxation with slower onset and offset of action than did the original PACAP 1-27 in primate bronchi. 4. Peptidase inhibition by captopril (10 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM) significantly increased the maximum relaxant effect and duration of action of PACAP 1-27 but not of the PACAP 1-27 analogue, during the 3 h of observation in the guinea-pig trachea. 5. We conclude that [Arg15,20,21Leu17]-PACAP-Gly-Lys-Arg-NH2 produces significant, concentration-dependent and sustained airway smooth muscle relaxation in vitro. The sustained relaxant effect is due, at least in part, to the PACAP 1-27 analogue being less susceptible to cleavage by peptidases than the original peptide PACAP 1-27.", 
    "512": "Myofibroblasts (myoFb) are cells responsible for fibrous tissue formation in injured systemic organs such as the heart. Cultured myoFb, obtained from rat cardiac scar tissue, express genes that encode components requisite for angiotensin (Ang) II generation, which in turn regulates myoFb collagen turnover in an autocrine/paracrine manner. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these wound-healing fibroblast-like cells and locally generated Ang II are involved in other repairing tissue. To test this hypothesis, we used a granuloma pouch model, where a subcutaneous air sac is created followed by injection of croton oil. Pouch tissue was collected at days 4, 7, 14 and 21. The presence of myoFb was determined by immunohistochemical alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) labeling and collagen accumulation by picrosirius red staining. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II receptor binding were detected by in vitro quantitative autoradiography using 125I-351A and 125I[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II, respectively, while Ang II receptor subtype was defined by displacement studies using either an AT1 (losartan) or AT2 (PD123177) receptor antagonist. Cells expressing ACE were determined by immunohistochemistry. Ang II content in pouch tissue was measured by radioimmunoassay following HPLC separation while its capacity to generate Ang II was assessed in tissue bath, with and without exogenous Ang I or lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. Collagen accumulation in pouch tissue was examined by determining hydroxyproline content in response to lisinopril, AT1 or AT2 receptor antagonists (losartan or PD123177). In pouch tissue, we found: (1) myoFb at day 4 which became more extensive at days 7, 14 and 21; (2) morphologic evidence of collagen deposition evident at day 4, which gradually became more extensive thereafter; (3) ACE and Ang II receptor binding was evident at day 4 and remained invariant on days 7, 14 and 21; (4) the predominant Ang II receptor subtype expressed was AT1; (5) myoFb express ACE and AT1 receptors; (6) picogram quantities of Ang II (per g tissue) was evident on days 7, 14 and 21; and (7) Ang II was generated from Ang I substrate. Lisinopril and losartan, but not PD123177, significantly attenuated pouch weight and accumulation of collagen. Thus, in this model of cutaneous repair, the appearance of myoFb is associated with Ang II generation that regulates fibrogenesis by AT1 receptor binding. Signals involved in the appearance of myoFb remain uncertain. Further studies are required to address the regulation of Ang II generation in pouch tissue of the rat.",

There was a two-week wash-out phase between each of the four treatment phases. At the end of each treatment phase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-amino-hippuric acid (PAH) clearance. Proteinuria was determined in the course of a three-day collection period at the end of each treatment phase.

Celiprolol produced a significant rise In ERPF (322 +/- 109 ml/min with placebo, 391 +/- 110 ml/min with celiprolol: P < 0.05). GFR was slightly, but not significantly, reduced by celiprolol and atenolol. Filtration fraction remained unchanged with atenolol and celiprolol, while it was slightly, but not significantly, reduced with ramipril. Compared with the placebo, all three drugs significantly reduced proteinuria (P < 0.05): 1.8 +/- 1.3 g/24 h with placebo, 1.2 +/- 1.2 g/24 h with atenolol, 1.2 +/- 1.1 g/24 h with celiprolol and 1.4 +/- 1.4 g/24 h with ramipril.",

    "517": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) regulates a variety of physiological parameters, including the blood pressure and intravascular volume, by interacting with its receptors present on the plasma membrane. ANP receptors are of three subtypes: ANP-A, -B and -C receptors. ANP-A and ANP-B receptors are guanylyl cyclase receptors, whereas ANP-C receptors are coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibition or phospholipase C activation through inhibitory guanine nucleotide-regulating protein. Unlike other G protein-coupled receptors, ANP-C receptors have a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain of 37 amino acids, the cytoplasmic domain has a structural specificity like those of other single-transmembrane-domain receptors and 37 amino-acid cytoplasmic domain peptide is able to exert is inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase. The activation of ANP-C receptor by C-ANP(4-23) (a ring-deleted peptide of ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase activity stimulated by endothelin-3, platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate. C-ANP also inhibits mitogen-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis, indicating that the ANP-C receptor plays a role in cell proliferation through an inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and suggesting that the ANP-C receptor might also be coupled to other signal transduction mechanism(s) or that there might be an interaction of the ANP-C receptor with some other signalling pathways. ANP receptor binding is decreased in most organs in hypertensive subjects and hypertensive animals. This decrease is consistent with there being fewer guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors in the kidney and vasculature and selective inhibition of the ANP-C receptor in the thymus and spleen. Platelet ANP-C receptors are decreased in number in hypertensive patients and spontaneously hypertensive rats. ANP-A, -B and -C receptors are decreased in number in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-treated kidneys and vasculature; however, the responsiveness of adenylyl cyclase to ANP is augmented in the vasculature and heart and is attenuated completely in platelets. These alterations in ANP receptor subtypes may be related to the pathophysiology of hypertension. Several hormones such as angiotensin II, ANP and catecholamines, the levels of which are increased in hypertension, downregulate or upregulate ANP-C receptors and ANP-C receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. It can be suggested that the antihypertensive action of several types of drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists and beta2-adrenergic antagonists may partly be attributed to their ability to modulate the expression and function of the ANP-C receptor.", 
    "518": "Endothelial dysfunction is a prevalent phenomenon in non-insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients with hypertension and albuminuria, and may contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of the high morbidity and mortality observed in these patients. Therefore the aim of our study was to evaluate whether inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (with lisinopril 10-20 mg day-1) could ameliorate endothelial dysfunction more than reducing blood pressure with conventional antihypertensive treatment (atenolol 50-100 mg day-1), usually in combination with a diuretic. We performed a 12-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel study in 43 hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy (21 treated with lisinopril and 22 with atenolol). The following variables were measured: 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP); transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb; i.e. initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin); serum concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF), using ELISA, and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE). Data are presented for 32 patients (16 lisinopril and 16 atenolol; age 60 years, SD 8; 25 males) out of 35 who completed the study and had valid measurements of TERalb. At baseline the two groups were comparable; TERalb (8.5 (SEM 0.6) vs. 7.2 (0.4)%); vWF (2.09 (range 0.82-4.34) vs. 1.97 (0.95-3.86) IU ml-1; UAE 916 (x/divided by antilog SEM 1.3) vs. 1444 (1.2), and mean ABP 110 (SEM 3) vs. 113 (2) mmHg, in the lisinopril and atenolol group, respectively. During follow up, the mean ABP was equally reduced in the lisinopril and atenolol group, by 12 (SEM 2) vs. 10 (2) mmHg, respectively, TERalb decreased in the lisinopril group by 0.6 (SEM 0.7)%, whereas it increased in the atenolol group 1.5 (0.5)%; the mean difference was 2.2% (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.9; p = 0.015). UAE was reduced by 45% (95% CI, 25 to 60) in the lisinopril group vs. 10% (-15 to 30) in the atenolol group (p = 0.014). Serum vWF was not changed during follow up in either group.

    "519": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of a sustained-release biodegradable pellet containing imidapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated in comparison with those of an osmotic pump in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A pellet was prepared from copolymer of DL-lactic acid and glycolic acid by the melt-pressing technique. Imidapril was released in vitro from the pellet at an approximately zero-order rate and the release profile was similar to that of the osmotic pump. Imidapril was administered subcutaneously via a pellet or an osmotic pump implanted under the skin in the back of SHRs. Plasma concentrations of imidaprilat as an active metabolite of imidapril, plasma ACE activity and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were determined periodically. The plasma concentration of imidaprilat during the administration of a pellet was maintained for 4 weeks, and the plasma concentration profile was close to that of the osmotic pump. Both groups of pellet and osmotic pump significantly inhibited plasma ACE activity and reduced SBP for 4 weeks, and these action profiles were similar in both groups. In addition, in vivo release profile of the pellet was close to the in vitro release profile, and the in vivo release profiles of the pellet and the osmotic pump were similar to each other. From these results, it was found that the PK/PD of a biodegradable pellet were close to those of the osmotic pump, and it was shown that the pellet may be a useful system to maintain the plasma concentration of imidaprilat for a long time.",

Plasma concentration of imidaprilat, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and plasma ACE activity were determined periodically. The plasma concentration of imidaprilat increased in proportion to the infusion rates and was maintained for 4 weeks. The SBP and ACE activity did not decrease in proportion to the infusion rates due to the saturation of the pharmacologic effects, but these actions also were maintained for 4 weeks. The PK/PD of imidaprilat were not influenced by aging of SHRs. The antihypertensive action in subcutaneous infusion of imidapril was as potent as that in oral administration at the same dose, although the maximum plasma concentration of imidaprilat in subcutaneous infusion was one-eightieth times of that in oral administration. The action was also maintained 28 times longer than that in oral administration, indicating that subcutaneous infusion is useful as an administration route.

Other evidence, however, suggests that the cardiac chemoreflex is enhanced during HF. In the present study, we sought to determine whether HF alters the sensitivity of cardiac vagal chemosensitive endings to bradykinin (BK), an endogenous mediator that activates ventricular C fiber afferents. We measured the activity of cardiac vagal single fibers and compared the afferent responses to left atrial injections of BK and capsaicin in sham-operated and pacing-induced HF dogs. The capsaicin-sensitive endings did not respond to changes in cardiac pressures evoked by vascular snares and were C fiber endings (0.8-2.1 m/s). Most were located in the left heart. There was no difference in rate or pattern of resting discharge of the cardiac vagal fibers between HF and sham groups (1.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 impulses/s, respectively). The afferent response to BK (0.001-1 microgram/kg), but not capsaicin (1-10 micrograms/kg), was greater in HF compared with sham dogs. Captopril (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly enhanced resting discharge (P < 0.05) from cardiac chemosensitive vagal afferents in HF but not sham dogs. The afferent response to BK in both groups was significantly (P < 0.05) and similarly enhanced. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) significantly inhibited resting discharge (P < 0.05) and nearly abolished the afferent responses to lower doses of BK in HF, but did not affect resting discharge and less effectively attenuated responses to BK in sham dogs. Responses to capsaicin did not differ between HF and sham animals. From these results, we conclude that 1) resting discharge from cardiac vagal chemosensitive endings is not altered in HF, 2) these vagal endings exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to exogenous BK but not to capsaicin in the HF state, 3) angiotensin-converting enzyme activity inhibits resting discharge from these afferents in HF, and 4) the cyclooxygenase system contributes to the enhanced BK responsiveness of cardiac chemosensitive endings in HF.", 
    "526": "We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy prevents volume-overload hypertrophy in dogs with chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). Seven adult mongrel dogs receiving ramipril (R; 10 mg orally, twice/day) for 4 mo were compared with 11 dogs receiving no R (N) for 4 mo after induction of MR. Cine-magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) mass increased in the R-MR dogs [80 +/- 4 (SE) to 108 +/- 7 g, P < 0.01] and in the N-MR dogs (92 +/- 7 to 112 +/- 8 g, P < 0.001). LV myocyte cell length was greater in the R-MR and N-MR dogs (203 +/- 6 and 177 +/- 10 microns, respectively) than in normal (144 +/- 4 microns, P < 0.05) dogs. There was significant loss of the collagen weave pattern by scanning electron microscopy in both R-MR and N-MR dogs. LV ACE and chymase activities were significantly elevated in R-MR and N-MR compared with normal dogs. LV angiotensin II (ANG II) levels in the R-MR dogs (28 +/- 12 pg/g) were reduced to levels seen in normal dogs (28 +/- 4 pg/g) compared with N-MR dogs (72 +/- 11 pg/g, P < 0.05). Steady-state AT1-receptor mRNA levels decreased 66% in N-MR compared with normal dogs (P < 0.001) and increased 1.5-fold in R-MR compared with normal dogs (P < 0.01). Thus upregulation of the AT1 receptor in the R-MR hearts may provide a mechanism by which normal intracardiac ANG II levels could continue to mediate LV hypertrophy. However, the mechanism of dissolution collagen weave in both N-MR and R-MR hearts may be related to the stretch of volume overload.", 
    "527": "Quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with high affinity for cardiac ACE, prevents increases in both plasma and cardiac angiotensin II (ANG II) and development of cardiac hypertrophy after aortocaval shunt in rats. In contrast, enalapril, an ACE inhibitor with low affinity for cardiac ACE, only prevents the increase in plasma ANG II. In the present study, we assessed whether these differences between enalapril and quinapril reflect different inhibition of cardiac tissue ACE and local ANG II by measuring their effects on cardiac ACE mRNA. Treatment with enalapril (250 mg/l) and quinapril (200 mg/l in drinking water) was started 3 days before the shunt and sham surgery. After 1 wk of aortocaval shunt, the hearts were excised and the left ventricle and right ventricle were weighed and used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for ACE and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (internal standard). Quinapril, but not enalapril, inhibited the development of cardiac hypertrophy by aortocaval shunt. The shunt increased ACE mRNA in both left and right ventricles about twofold. In animals with aortocaval shunt, quinapril markedly further upregulated ACE mRNA in both ventricles, whereas enalapril did not cause significant changes. In sham rats, both ACE inhibitors increased ACE mRNA, but the increase was more pronounced by treatment with quinapril. These studies show that in vivo ACE inhibitors with low (enalapril) vs. high (quinapril) affinity for cardiac ACE differ in their effects on cardiac ACE mRNA. This difference is more pronounced in volume overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, presumably reflecting their different effects on cardiac ANG II.", 
    "528": "Hearts hypertrophied by pressure-overload are more susceptible to ischemia than nonhypertrophied hearts, which may result from the attenuation of self-protective responses. Because heat shock proteins (HSPs) are reported to protect against ischemic injuries, we hypothesized that HSP expression by coronary occlusion may be attenuated in hypertrophied hearts. We banded the ascending aorta to develop ventricular hypertrophy and put a snare around the left coronary artery in rats. After 4 wk, coronary occlusion was applied by tightening the snare for 5 or 10 min in rats with and without aortic banding. The hearts were excised 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after coronary occlusion. Ischemic and nonischemic myocardial tissues were obtained after the snare was tightly tied, and dye was infused from the aorta. The mRNAs and protein of 72-kDa HSP (HSP 72) and/or 73-kDa HSP (HSP 73) were detected by Northern and Western blot analyses. Protein and mRNA levels of HSPs expressed by 5-min coronary occlusion in hypertrophied hearts (left ventricular weight, 577 +/- 16 mg) were lower compared with those in control hearts (462 +/- 9 mg). A longer period of coronary occlusion (10 min) elevated the attenuated expression to a level similar to that in control hearts. Treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (cilazapril, 10-15 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 4 wk preserved HSP mRNA expression even in hearts with ascending aortic banding. In hypertrophied hearts, HSP 72 and 73 expression by coronary occlusion was attenuated and was modulated by the duration of coronary occlusion and by ACE inhibitor treatment.", 
    "529": "This study was undertaken to examine whether a sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, improves postischemic cardiac function and myocardial metabolism in the perfused working rat heart, and to elucidate the mechanism by which captopril protects the myocardium from postischemic damage. Isolated rat hearts were perfused by the working heart technique for 15 min. Ischemia was then induced for 30 min by lowering the afterload pressure and coronary flow to zero. After ischemia, hearts were reperfused for 30 min by returning afterload pressure to 60 mmHg. Captopril, a non-sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, or a type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, was added to the perfusate 5 min before ischemia, and the treatment was continued during the first 10-min period of reperfusion. In all groups there was no significant difference in pressure-rate product, coronary flow, tissue levels of ATP, total adenine nucleotides (TANs), energy charge potential (ECP), or creatine phosphate (CrP) before and during ischemia. During reperfusion following ischemia, captopril significantly improved the recovery of pressure-rate product, coronary flow, and tissue levels of ATP, TAN, ECP, and CrP, but neither enalapril nor DuP 753 had an effect. In conclusion, captopril improved postischemic cardiac function and myocardial metabolism in the perfused rate heart and its effect was independent of the blunting of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "530": "We investigated the possible effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril and angiotensin II antagonist saralasin on ovulation, ovarian steroidogenesis and ascites formation in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the rabbit model. OHSS was induced in rabbits by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and intermittent human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In the cilazapril group (n = 10), animals also received cilazapril 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 7 days. In the saralasin group (n = 8), animals received saralasin intraperitoneally 1 h before or 1 h after hCG administration. Control animals (n = 8), received intraperitoneal saline solution. Serial blood samples were drawn on days 1, 5, 7 and 9 to measure serum estradiol and progesterone levels. On day 9, all rabbits underwent surgical exploration. Peritoneal and pleural fluid formation, ovarian weights and number of ovulations were determined. The volume of the ascitic and pleural fluids after hyperstimulation were not statistically different between the control, cilazapril and saralasin groups. The weight gains and ovarian weights of animals were similar between treatment and control groups. Saralasin significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited ovulation, but cilazapril did not. Cilazapril and saralasin did not affect progesterone production. Only cilazapril significantly decreased estradiol production (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and angiotensin II antagonist saralasin did not prevent ascites formation in OHSS. The ovarian renin-angiotensin system may not be the only factor acting in ascites formation in the OHSS.", 
    "531": "Insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been reported to be involved in various cardiovascular diseases. We investigated prospectively whether the response to the ACE inhibitor imidapril varied according to the ACE genotype or plasma ACE activity in Japanese hypertensive patients. The study population consisted of 57 hypertensive patients. After a 4-week observation period, imidapril was administered at a dose of 5 mg/day and blood pressure was measured every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. The plasma ACE activity in patients with the DD or ID genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with the II genotype. Neither the reduction nor the percent reduction in systolic blood pressure was significantly different between patients with either the DD or ID genotype and patients with the II genotype (DD or ID v II, 18.8 +/- 2.4 v 20.2 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; P = NS, 10.9 +/- 1.4 v 11.7 +/- 1.9%; P = NS, respectively). However, both the reduction and the percent reduction in diastolic blood pressure tended to be higher in patients with the II genotype (DD or ID v II, 7.9 +/- 1.2 v 12.4 +/- 2.2 mm Hg; P = .0669, 8.1 +/- 1.2 v 12.4 +/- 2.2%; P = .0569, respectively). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with plasma ACE activity (r = 0.301, P = .0253). In conclusion, the response to imidapril in hypertensive patients is determined at least in part by the ACE genotype.", 
    "532": "The blood pressure lowering effect and tolerability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril combined with a very low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared with the selective betareceptor blocker atenolol in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Three hundred seventy-four patients were randomized into a triple-blind, parallel, active-controlled 12-week study period comparing enalapril/HCTZ (20/6 mg) with atenolol (50 mg) after a 4-week placebo baseline period. Blood pressure (BP), clinical and laboratory safety, and metabolic laboratory variables were assessed. Enalapril/HCTZ as well as atenolol reduced both sitting and standing diastolic and systolic BP (P < .001), but enalapril/HCTZ had a more pronounced effect than atenolol on sitting systolic BP (P = .019); there was a trend toward more patients achieving target diastolic BP (<90 mm Hg, P = .053). No clinically important differences in safety and tolerability were observed.", 
    "533": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relations between the plasma concentrations of spiraprilat (the active metabolite of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor spirapril) and its effects on plasma converting enzyme activity (PCEA), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and brachial blood flow (BBF), after a single oral administration of 6 mg of spirapril in eight patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Concentrations and effects were determined before and repeatedly during 48 h after drug intake. A sigmoid model was fitted to individual observations. Maximal effects, concentrations inducing half-maximal effects, and Hill coefficients were -99 +/- 2%, 3.9 +/- 1.9 ng/ml, and 2.4 +/- 0.7 for PCEA inhibition, -15 +/- 8 mm Hg, 11.8 +/- 9.2 ng/ml, and 2.6 +/- 1.3 for PCWP decrease, and 36 +/- 19 ml/min, 13.8 +/- 7.6 ng/ml, and 3.3 +/- 1.0 for BBF increase. In severe CHF, although a 14 ng/ml plasma concentration of spiraprilat may induce a 95% inhibition of PCEA, a 30 ng/ml plasma concentration is mandatory to normalize PCWP and BBF. This concentration corresponds to the peak achieved after a 6-mg oral dose of spirapril.", 
    "534": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of benazepril (10 mg) and low-dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) were assessed in 24 patients (mean age, 43.9 years) with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 and < or = 120 mm Hg)]. After 2 weeks of washout taking placebo, patients were randomized to receive the fixed combination or placebo, both administered once daily for 3 weeks, according to a double-blind, crossover design. Patients were checked at the end of the washout period and every 3 weeks thereafter. At each visit, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed by a noninvasive device (Spacelabs 90207); casual BP (by mercury sphygmomanometer), heart rate (HR), and body weight also were measured. The fixed combination significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and DBP values throughout the 24 h as compared with placebo, without affecting the normal BP circadian variability. The antihypertensive effect of the fixed combination could be observed to a similar extent during the day and night and was still significant 24 h after dosing. HR and body weight were not affected by the treatment. The fixed combination of benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine 2.5 mg was well tolerated, and no patient withdrew from the study because of side effects.", 
    "535": "The effect of enalapril on cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied in 11 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA II or III, dilated cardiomyopathy in 6 and old myocardial infarction in 5). CBF was evaluated by analyzing the Patlak-Plot curve obtained from radionuclide angiography with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTC-HM-PAO). Cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume (SV) were simultaneously measured by impedance cardiography. These measurements were performed before and at four weeks after daily administration of 5 mg enalapril. The stroke volume, cardiac index, and heart rate were not significantly changed after four weeks of enalapril administration. However, CBF was increased by 6.5% from 36.72 +/- 4.66 to 39.13 +/- 5.65 mL/100g/min (P < 0.05). These results suggest that enalapril increased cerebral blood flow, which was not related to increased cardiac output in congestive heart failure. Patlak-Plot analysis of radionuclide angiography using 99mTC-HM-PAO may be available for quantitative assessment of brain perfusion.", 
    "536": "Multiple risk factors are important predictors in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Once DN has developed, it progresses steadily to renal failure. To determine the rate of renal function decline and the parameters that influence the rate of decline, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with DN who had undergone dialysis or kidney transplantation at the Mayo Clinic from 1983 to 1993. Forty patients were found to have two or more iothalamate clearance (IothmCl) measurements where a slope of renal function decline over time, expressed as mL/ min/month/1.73 m2, can be calculated. The parameters examined included age of onset and duration of diabetes (DM); age at initial presentation, insulin dosage, glycosylated hemoglobin level, proteinuria, blood pressure (BP), number of antihypertensive medications (HTM), use of ACE inhibitors, creatinine, and initial IothmCl. The mean overall decline of clearance was 1.36 +/- 1.1 mL/min/month, corrected. Univariate regression analysis showed that only systolic and mean BP (p < 0.05), use of HTM (p = 0.02), and the number of HTM used (p = 0.0001) correlated with the rate of clearance decline. No other parameter was significant. The decline of IothmCl was 0.72 +/- 0.41, 1.20 +/- 0.9, and 2.34 +/- 1.38 mL/min/month, for patients taking no HTM, < 3 HTM, and > or = 3HTM, respectively. Of the eight patients on HTM who presented with initial IothmCl of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, seven (88%) had clearance of < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 within 1 yr. We conclude that hypertension is an important marker of DN progression, and that the more HTM required for control of BP, the faster the decline of renal function. We recommend that a suitable transplant candidate with DN who presents with hypertension requiring HTM and a clearance of < 30 mL/min should be placed on the transplant waiting list.",

Physiol. 83(2): 414-419, 1997.-Cardiovascular and renal effects of either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or vehicle were measured in chronically instrumented lambs in the presence (intact; n = 6) and absence of renal sympathetic nerves (denervated; n = 5) to determine whether there was an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and renal sympathetic nerves early in life. Captopril caused a similar decrease in mean arterial pressure (P < 0. 001) in intact and denervated lambs, predominantly through a decrease in diastolic pressure. Heart rate was increased from 177 +/- 34 to 213 +/- 22 (SD) beats/min during captopril compared with vehicle infusion in intact lambs. In denervated lambs, basal heart rates were elevated to 218 +/- 33 beats/min; there was no further increase in heart rate during captopril compared with vehicle infusion. Captopril infusion caused a decrease in renal vascular resistance but only in the absence of renal nerves.

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of IL-1beta (2 microg/kg) induced a marked fever of rapid onset. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration, immediately before IL-1beta injection, of a selective AT2 receptor antagonist, CGP42112A (5 or 20 microg), reduced the fever in a dose-related manner. Rats given an i.c.v. injection of PGE2 (200 ng) developed a monophasic fever response that was attenuated by i.c.v. treatment with CGP42112A (10 or 20 microg) in a dose-related manner. The IL-1beta (2 microg/kg i.p.)- and PGE2 (200 ng i.c.v.)-induced fevers were unchanged by the selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (60 microg i.c.v.). Treatment with exogenous Ang II (100 ng i.c.v.), which itself had no effect on resting body temperature, resulted in an enhancement of the PGE2 (50 ng i.c.v.)-induced fever. The administration of CGP42112A (2 and 5 microg) into the rostral hypothalamus (preoptic/anterior hypothalamic region) reduced fevers induced by IL-1beta (2 microg/kg i.p.) or intrahypothalamic (i.h.) PGE2 (100 ng). Moreover, i.h. injection of Ang II (25 ng) augmented the PGE2 (25 ng i.h.)-induced fever. Finally, the i.h. administration, 15 min before i.h.

    "558": "The present study is a prospective, controlled, blinded trial of enalapril therapy in experimental immune complex (IC)-mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) in the nonhuman primate (cynomolgus monkey [CYN]). Two groups of CYNs were studied: those with established GN (study A) and those in which GN was being induced (study B). In study A, 12 CYNs had GN established by 8 or 10 weeks of daily intravenous infusion of bovine gamma-globulin (BGG). These CYNs were then assigned to either 4 weeks of daily oral enalapril therapy (n = 6) or daily oral placebo therapy (n = 6). The daily BGG infusions were continued during the 4 weeks of enalapril or placebo therapy. At the start of the enalapril/placebo protocol, the two groups were similar with respect to proteinuria and level of precipitating antibody to BGG, which determined the daily BGG dose. Renal biopsy was performed in each CYN at the start and end of the 4-week period of enalapril/placebo protocol. In study B, 15 normal CYNs were immunized to BGG over a period of 4 weeks. The CYNs were then assigned to daily oral enalapril therapy (n = 8) or placebo therapy (n = 7) based on level of precipitating antibody to BGG. At this point, daily intravenous BGG was begun along with daily enalapril or placebo for 8 weeks. Renal biopsy was performed in each CYN before and at the end of this 8-week period. In study A, enalapril therapy was associated with a significant decrease in mesangial matrix volume (mean change, -27.7%; P = 0.031) and a trend toward decreased mesangial matrix deposits (mean change, -34.1%; P = 0.188). By contrast, in CYNs receiving placebo therapy, mesangial matrix volume increased compared with the enalapril group (P = 0.002) and mesangial deposits were unchanged. In study B, both the enalapril and placebo groups showed significant increases in mesangial matrix volume, mesangial deposits, mesangial cell volume, and capillary wall deposits during the 8 weeks of daily BGG infusion. However, none of the differences between the groups achieved statistical significance. Changes in mesangial cell volume and capillary wall deposits were also evaluated in study A and study B, but were not found to be different between the enalapril and placebo groups. In both study A and study B, blood pressure was lower in the enalapril groups. In conclusion, in the initial phase of IC-GN induction (0 to 8 weeks), enalapril therapy does not significantly influence the glomerular accumulation of mesangial matrix or immune deposits. However, in established IC-GN (after 8 weeks of GN induction), enalapril therapy significantly decreases the further accumulation of mesangial matrix and may decrease the further accumulation of mesangial deposits. Whether this benefit of enalapril therapy was related to lower blood pressure or to other effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was not determined in this study.", 
    "559": "As interactions between the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems have been suggested in the pathogenesis of hypertension, we wanted to investigate the effect of chronic renin-angiotensin blockade with losartan and enalaprilat on the sympathetic reactivity to hypotension and on the cardiac beta-adrenergic-coupled adenylyl cyclase pathway in 12-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both treatments, exerting equipotent shifts of angiotensin-pressure responses, lowered blood pressure and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy similarly in SHR. The nitroprusside-induced hypotension was similar in both strains, but the associated increases in plasma catecholamines and heart rate were higher in SHR. In SHR treated with losartan and enalaprilat, the nitroprusside-induced hypotension was greater and associated with markedly attenuated increases in norepinephrine and heart rate. The binding affinity of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was significantly lower, and beta2-adrenoceptor subtype was dominant in untreated SHR in contrast to WKY, in which beta1-adrenoceptor subtype was dominant. Enalaprilat treatment increased total beta-adrenoceptor density, whereas both treatments restored the binding affinity and beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor proportions to normal in SHR. Isoproterenol-, guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase reactivity was increased in SHR. Enalaprilat restored adenylyl cyclase reactivity to normal in SHR and reduced the sensitivity (EC50) of Gpp(NH)p-induced cAMP formation in both strains. The present study supports the possibility that functional alterations of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems are involved in hypertension in SHR. The antihypertensive action of losartan and enalaprilat in SHR may be partly mediated through the normalization of sympathetic hyperreactivity and the restoration of beta-adrenergic signaling pathway sensitivity.", 
    "560": "Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing the neointima formation found after denudation of the rat carotid artery by balloon injury. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.", 
    "561": "In view of the vasodilator potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition via prostaglandins and kinins, we asked why renin inhibition induces a larger renal vasodilator response than ACE inhibitors in healthy humans in earlier studies. One possibility was that there was a more complete blockade of the renin system, which could also be achieved by an angiotensin II antagonist, eprosartan. We measured the hormonal and renal hemodynamic responses to eprosartan doses, from 10 to 400 mg in 9 healthy young men in balance on a 10-mmol/d sodium intake. The threshold eprosartan dose to influence renal perfusion was <10 mg, and the 100-mg dose induced a near-maximal vasodilator response of 135+/-19.7 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m2. When the dose was increased to 400 mg, there was a modest additional increase of 147+/-57 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2). A highly significant dose-related fall in arterial blood pressure occurred (r=-.97; P<.001), with no indication of a maximal response at 400 mg. In 6 additional subjects, we compared responses to eprosartan on a high salt and a low salt diet. The renal response to 200 mg eprosartan on a high salt diet, 26.0+/-6.6 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), was significantly less than that seen with the low salt diet (P<.001). There was no renal partial agonist angiotensin-like effect of eprosartan. Eprosartan reduced sharply the pressor, renal vascular, and hormonal responses to exogenous angiotensin II. The renal vasodilator response to the angiotensin II antagonist eprosartan closely resembles responses to renin inhibition and exceeds previously reported responses to ACE inhibitors. Thus, eprosartan probably exerted its effect via the angiotensin receptor. More complete blockade of the renin system can be achieved by pharmacological interruption at this level, a finding that could have therapeutic implications.", 
    "562": "The onset and the mechanisms leading to Na+ retention in incipient congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been systematically investigated. To investigate renal Na+ handling in the early or mild stages of CHF, Na+ balance and renal clearances were assessed in 10 asymptomatic patients with idiopathic or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild heart failure (HF) off treatment (left ventricular ejection fraction, 29.7+/-2%) and in 10 matched normal subjects during a diet containing 100 mmol/d of NaCl and after 8 days of high salt intake (250 mmol/d). Six patients were studied again after 6 weeks of treatment with enalapril (5 mg/d P.O.). At the end of the high salt diet, in patients with mild HF the cumulative Na+ balance exceeded by 110 mmol that of normal subjects (F=3.86, P<.001). During high salt intake, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were similarly increased in both normal subjects and mild HF patients. In spite of comparable increases of filtered Na+ in the two groups, fractional excretion of Na+, fractional clearance of free water, and fractional excretion of K+ (indexes of distal delivery of Na+) increased in normal subjects and were reduced in patients with mild HF. During enalapril treatment, in the mild HF patients the cumulative Na+ balance was restored to normal; furthermore, enalapril significantly attenuated the abnormalities in the distal delivery of Na+. Our results indicate that a defective adaptation of Na+ reabsorption in the proximal nephron is associated with Na+ retention in response to increased salt intake in the early or mild stages of HF. These abnormalities of renal Na+ handling are largely reversed by enalapril.",

    "568": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonist, telmisartan, on hemodynamics, myocardial function and myocardial blood flow during the postresuscitation phase in a porcine model of CPR and to compare these to saline. After 4 min of ventricular fibrillation and 5 min of closed-chest CPR, defibrillation was performed in 16 domestic pigs to restore spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Ten minutes after ROSC, animals were allocated to receive either the ANG II antagonist, telmisartan, at a dose of 1 mg/kg (n = 8) or saline (n = 8). Hemodynamics, myocardial function and myocardial blood flow were measured prearrest and at 5, 30, 90 and 240 min after ROSC. Using a Swan-Ganz catheter with a fast responding-thermistor and a micromanometer tipped catheter, right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular contractility were 67 +/- 6 ml (mean +/- S.E.M.), 42 +/- 4 ml, 38 +/- 2%, 2036 +/- 77 mmHg/s in the telmisartan group and 82 +/- 2 ml (P < 0.05), 59 +/- 3 ml (P < 0.01), 28 +/- 2% (P < 0.01), 1596 +/- 82 mmHg/s (P < 0.01) in the control group, at 240 min after ROSC. No significant differences in mean aortic and pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index or myocardial blood flow between the two groups were found. We conclude that the ANG II antagonist telmisartan administered during the postresuscitation phase in pigs increases myocardial contractility without changing cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, or myocardial perfusion.", 
    "569": "We have previously shown that peripheral administration of bradykinin (BK) induces water intake in rats acutely pretreated with captopril, a kininase II inhibitor. We now show that BK-induced drinking is also observed in rats treated chronically with dietary captopril, and that this is reversed by Hoe 140, a BK receptor antagonist. Both acute and chronic captopril in combination with BK caused a large increase in plasma renin activity. Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-in used as a marker of cellular activation) was induced by BK + captopril in regions of the brain previously associated with action of angiotensin (Ang) II, including the circumventricular organs and the magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei. However, while water intake induced by peripheral administration of Ang I was potentiated by acute administration of captopril, it was suppressed by chronic captopril treatment. Fos-IR induced in brain by Ang I was not markedly affected by either acute or chronic treatment with captopril. The simultaneous occurrence of potentiated drinking to BK and inhibited drinking to Ang I following chronic treatment with captopril suggest that different mechanisms of action are involved. In order to further examine this possibility, rats were given lesions of the anterodorsal third ventricle region. Lesions that completely abolished the water intake following administration of Ang II only partly attenuated water intake induced by BK + captopril. Further, Fos-IR induced by BK + captopril was only partly (31%) reduced in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of lesioned rats compared with sham operated controls. We suggest that at least two mechanisms, one Ang-related, underlie drinking after BK+captopril.", 
    "570": "1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their cardiovascular effects not only by preventing the formation of angiotensin II (AII), but also by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin in or at the vessel wall. In addition, certain ACE inhibitors have been shown to augment the vasodilator response to bradykinin, presumably by an interaction at the level of the B2 receptor. We have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the B2 receptor. 2. Moexiprilat and ramiprilat (< or = 3 nM) enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin three to four fold. Captopril and enalaprilat were less active by approximately one and quinaprilat by two orders of magnitude. Moexiprilat and ramiprilat, on the other hand, had no effect on the constrictor response to AII or the dilator response to acetylcholine. 3. The bradykinin-potentiating effect of the ACE inhibitors was not mimicked by inhibitors of amino-, carboxy-, metallo- or serine peptidases or the synthetic ACE substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, at a concentration which almost abolished the residual ACE activity in the vessel wall. In contrast, angiotensin-(1-7) (10 microM), an angiotensin I metabolite, significantly enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin. 4. Ramiprilat did not alter the binding of [3H]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACE inhibitor-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the B2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells. 5. These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B2 receptor-mediated vascular effects of bradykinin. Their relative efficacy appears to be independent of their ACE-inhibiting properties and might be related to differences in molecule structure. Moreover, the potentiation of the biological activity of bradykinin by this class of compounds does not seem to be mediated by a shift in affinity of the B2 receptor or a prevention of its desensitization, but may involve an increase in the intrinsic activity of unoccupied B2 receptor molecules.", 
    "571": "1. We hypothesized that tissular renin-angotensin system (RAS) induces vascular hypertrophy in hypertensive Ren-2 transgenic rats (TGR; strain name TGR(mRen2)L27). This assumption was tested in cell cultures of vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) from both hypertensive TGR and control normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Planar cell surface area, protein synthesis, and protein content per cell were studied, the role for locally produced angiotensin II (AII) was evaluated and the possible pharmacological interference by different drugs was analysed. 2. By use of radioimmunoassay techniques, AII could be determined in TGR cultures (10.25 +/- 0.12 pg per 10(7) cells) while it could not be detected in SD ones. 3. Under serum-free conditions, VSMC from hypertensive TGR were hypertrophic when compared to SD VSMC, as they presented a higher protein content per cell (335 +/-18 and 288 +/- 7 pg per cell respectively; P<0.05) and increased mean planar cell surface area, as determined by image analysis (4,074 +/- 238 and 4,764 +/- 204 microm2, respectively; P < 0.05). 4. When exogenously added to cultured SD and TGR VSMC, AII (100 pM to 1 microM) promoted protein synthesis and protein content in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting DNA synthesis. Maximal effects were observed at 100 nM. At this concentration, AII effectively increased planar cell surface area in both SD and TGR cultures by approximately 20%. 5. Treatment of TGR cultures, in the absence of exogenous AII, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or the angiotensin AT1 receptors antagonist losartan (100 nM to 10 microM) reduced planar cell surface area in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, both captopril and losartan (10 microM), decreased protein synthesis by approximately 15%. 6. Treatment of SD VSMC, in the absence of exogenous AII, with both captopril and losartan had no effect either on planar cell surface area or protein synthesis. 7. Treatment with the Ca2+ antagonist nifedipine (100 nM to 10 microM) reduced cell size in both SD and TGR cultures. Maximal cell reduction reached by nifedipine averaged 906 +/- 58 and 1,292 +/- 57 microm2, in SD and TGR, respectively (P<0.05). In addition, nifedipine, nitrendipine and nisoldipine (all at 10 microM) decreased protein synthesis in both cell types by 15-25%. 8. We concluded that cultured VSMC from TGR are hypertrophic in comparison with those from SD. This cell hypertrophy can be the consequence of the expression of the transgene Ren-2 that activates a tissular RAS and locally produces AII, which acts in a paracrine, autocrine, or intracrine manner. Cell hypertrophy in TGR cultures could be selectively reduced by RAS blockade, while nifedipine decreased cell size and protein synthesis in both hypertrophic and non hypertrophic cells.",

The effects of 2-2-(1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)-[amino-oxopropyl]-6,7-dimethoxy- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3 carboxylic acid (moexiprilat), 17beta-oestradiol (E2), oestrone (ES) and angiotensin II (AII) on growth and activation of oestrogen receptors and the immediate-early gene egr-1 were investigated in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts of female and male origin. 2. In BrdU proliferation assays, oestrone (10(-7)- 10(-9) M) stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth in a concentration-dependent fashion (maximum at 10(-7) M, 4.0 fold +/- 0.14 in female and 3.1 fold +/- 0.06 in male cells, n=9, P<0.05), while E2 (10(-7)-10(-9) M) had no effect. Moexiprilat (10(-7)M) completely inhibited oestrone-induced cardiac fibroblast growth. 3. Angiotensin II (10(-7) M) induced cardiac fibroblast growth (female 4.1 fold +/- 0.1/male 3.9 fold +/- 0.2; n=9, P<0.05). Angiotensin II induced oestrogen receptor (maximum 21.8 fold at 60 min) and egr-1 (maximum 47.5 fold at 60 min) expression in a time-dependent fashion. 4. In immunoblot experiments, oestrogen activated oestrogen receptor (ES: 12.8 fold +/- 2.0; E2: 14.7 fold +/- 4.9; n=3, P<0.05) and egr-1 (ES: 5.1 fold, +/- 0.24; E2: 3.8 fold, +/- 0.25; n=3, P<0.05) expression. The induction of oestrogen receptor and egr-1 protein expression was time-dependent and inhibited by moexiprilat. 5. Our results show that oestrone and 17beta-oestradiol reveal a significant difference in their potential to activate cardiac fibroblast growth in female and male cells and that oestrone-stimulated growth is inhibited by moexiprilat. The inhibition of oestrone-stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth by moexiprilat may contribute to the beneficial effects seen in postmenopausal women with hypertensive heart disease treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "573": "Valsartan competitively and selectively inhibits the actions of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor subtype which is responsible for most of the known effects of angiotensin II. In clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension valsartan was as effective as losartan, lisinopril, enalapril, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Addition of the latter reduced blood pressure in patients who did not respond sufficiently to valsartan monotherapy. Preliminary data also suggest valsartan may be effective in patients with severe essential hypertension. The drug was as effective as lisinopril as treatment for mild to moderate essential hypertension in patients with renal insufficiency and did not worsen renal function. Headache, dizziness and fatigue were the most common adverse events in placebo-controlled studies; the incidence of these adverse events was not significantly different between placebo and valsartan recipients. Compared with ACE inhibitors, valsartan was associated with a significantly lower incidence of dry cough. Thus, valsartan is an effective treatment for mild to moderate essential hypertension and may be particularly useful in patients who experience persistent cough during ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "574": "Despite remarkable advances in cardiovascular therapeutics, sudden cardiac death remains a significant problem. In this review, data from clinical trials and other studies on antiarrhythmic therapies have been evaluated in order to determine effective strategies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in high risk patients. Overall, routine prophylactic use of class I antiarrhythmic agents in high risk patients, mostly survivors of acute myocardial infarction, is associated with increased risk of death [61 trials, 23,486 patients: odds ratio (OR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.27, p < 0.05]. Conversely, beta-blockers are associated with highly significant reductions in risk of death in postinfarction patients (56 trials, 53,521 patients: OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87, p < 0.00001). Overall data from the amiodarone trials on high risk patients, including postinfarction patients, patients with congestive heart failure or survivors of cardiac arrest, suggest that this agent is effective in reducing the risk of death (14 trials, 5713 patients: OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, p = 0.01) although further studies are needed to better define which types of patients will potentially benefit most from this agent. No benefits were seen with calcium channel blockers (26 trials, 21,644 patients: OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13, p = NS). The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a promising option for high risk patients, but definition of its role awaits the completion of ongoing clinical trials. Since causes of sudden death are heterogeneous, the clinician should pursue a multifactorial approach to its prevention. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiac ischaemia, through the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and maximising the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction, should lead to a future decrease in the incidence of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "575": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are common chronic conditions which frequently coexist. Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of elevated blood pressure in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Diabetic nephropathy, arterial sclerosis, obesity and association of essential hypertension can be the causes of hypertension in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has revealed that the nocturnal fall of blood pressure is blunted in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A blunted diurnal blood pressure variation is seen in microalbuminuric diabetic patients and even in some normoalbuminuric patients. Accumulating data suggest that normalisation of blood pressure in hypertensive IDDM patients is most important to minimise the loss of kidney function. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to be effective in postponing the development of nephropathy and in slowing its progression. Whether only ACE inhibitors have such beneficial renal effects on diabetic nephropathy is under discussion. While many studies have suggested that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are related to an elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients, there does not seem to be enough evidence to prove that insulin per se can raise blood pressure in humans. Neither an insulin infusion within a physiological range nor sustained hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance (e.g. patients with insulinoma, cystic ovary syndrome) have been associated with an elevated blood pressure. Insulin resistance in some hypertensive patients may be a consequence of a decreased blood flow due to an increased peripheral resistance. Preliminary evidence suggests that low birth weight or impaired fetal growth is related to hypertension and NIDDM. Familial clustering of diabetic nephropathy suggests the contribution of genetic susceptibility and/or environmental inheritance. The frequent association of nephropathy with hypertension has led to research on the genes related to hypertension (ACE, angiotensinogen). Nevertheless, to date no reliable and clinically useful genetic marker has been found. Attempts to correct the metabolic abnormalities derived from diabetes are a new topic in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. The effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (antihypercholesterolaemic drugs), aldose reductase inhibitors (inhibitors of the polyol pathway) and glycation inhibitors (inhibitors of formation of advanced glycosylation end-products) on diabetic nephropathy have been evaluated in animal studies and in some clinical trials. Thus far, results with HMG CoA reductase and aldose reductase inhibitors have been somewhat conflicting. The potential therapeutic role of glycation inhibition in the treatment of diabetes deserves further study.", 
    "576": "The performance of carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex (CSR) was characterized in chronically stressed rats by changing intracarotid sinus pressure (ISP) and constructing ISP-MAP (mean arterial pressure) relationship curve. The role of central angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors in the changes of CSR performance induced by chronic stress was determined. Rats were subjected to foot-shock stress for two weeks. The carotid sinus was isolated from the systemic circulation and the ISP changed in a stepwise manner. The results showed that in chronically stressed rats, ISP-MAP relationship curve shifted upward, the set point was significantly higher than that obtained from the unstressed group, and the reflex gain and the MAP range were significantly smaller than those in unstressed rats. After intracerebroventricular injection of saralasin (20 ng), MAP range was augmented and the set point decreased significantly. Injection of vehicle did not lead any significant differences between the parameters of the reflex measured before or after injection in either the stressed or the unstressed rats. Furthermore, administration of ANG II (10 microg) induced a significant increase in the set point and decrease in the reflex gain in the unstressed rats. The responses of CSR to ANG II were completely blocked by pretreatment of saralasin. These findings suggest that chronic stress could induce the decreased CSR function in the normotensives and central ANG II receptors involved in the resetting of CSR in the chronically stressed rats.",

    "591": "We postulated that nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelial function would be improved by acute and short-term treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in patients with type I diabetes mellitus, in whom endothelial function is depressed. Nine type I diabetic patients and eight healthy subjects underwent forearm blood flow measurement using strain gauge plethysmography during intraarterial infusion of incremental doses of endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine [ACh]) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside [SNP]) vasodilators. Pretreatment ACh responses were depressed in diabetic patients relative to the normal subjects (P < 0.05). No difference between the groups was evident in response to SNP. Acute ACE inhibition (with intrabrachial enalaprilat) enhanced ACh responses in the diabetic patients (P < 0.005), with a further improvement evident after 1 mo of oral therapy with enalapril (P < 0.001) when ACh responses were normalized.

We observed that under unstressed conditions the baseline values of PRA and plasma ANG II were no different in young versus old rats (1.8 +/- 0.2 versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 ng Al/ml/h and 18 +/- 3 versus 15 +/- 2 fmol/ml, respectively). Values of PRA in the present study were similar to those reported by others for old rats, but our young rat values were lower than usually reported. This probably reflects our use of an unstressed preparation. We also observed a blunted increase in PRA in old rats in response to acute converting enzyme inhibition. Overall, our observations suggest that old rats may lose their ability to increase PRA in response to acute stimuli, including perhaps, the stress of blood drawing in emotionally or surgically stressed preparations. We also observed that the MCR of ANG II increased with age, despite similar baseline plasma ANG II concentrations in young and old. This suggests that with aging, an increase occurs in the rate of synthesis of ANG II.

The data of 23 captopril treated patients in 3 dialysis units and data of 17 enalapril treated patients in 2 dialysis units were used as the basis of the study. The difference between the average daily doses of captopril applied at the different hemodialysis units was significant (111, 61 and 26 mg/day). However the difference between the average doses of enalapril was not significant (18 and 12.9 mg/day). The correlation was found to be significant between the dose of captopril and the number of simultaneously used antihypertensive agents: r = 0.46, p < 0.05. The correlation was also significant between the dose of enalapril and the number of combinations of other antihypertensive agents: r = 0.50, p < 0.05. These relations and the analysis of antihypertensive therapy of 4 patients, receiving the largest doses of captopril suggest that larger doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used in the more resistant hypertensive patients, where more antihypertensive agents were needed to be administered to control the blood pressure.",

In this study, we measure for the first time ANG I and ANG II levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF) space of the heart. ISF and aortic plasma ANG I and II levels were obtained at baseline, during intravenous infusion of ANG I (5 microM, 0.1 ml/min, 60 min), and during ANG I + the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (cap) (2.5 mM, 0.1 ml/min, 60 min) in six anesthetized open-chested dogs. ISF samples were obtained using microdialysis probes inserted into the left ventricular myocardium (3-4 probes/dog). ANG I increased mean arterial pressure from 102+/-3 (SEM) to 124+/-3 mmHg (P < 0.01); addition of cap decreased MAP to 95+/-3 mmHg (P < 0.01).

The finding of very high ANG I and ANG II levels in the ISF vs. intravascular space that are not affected by IV ANG I or cap suggests that ANG II production and/or degradation in the heart is compartmentalized and mediated by different enzymatic mechanisms in the interstitial and intravascular spaces.", 
    "631": "We estimated the cost effectiveness of adding the ACE inhibitor ramipril to conventional treatment in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These estimates were based on the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study and on complementary Swedish healthcare resource use data for a subset of patients. The average follow-up period was 15 months (minimum 6 months, maximum 3.8 years). The perspective of the analysis was that of the county councils (third-party payers), and we focused on the cost of drugs and hospitalisation. The marginal cost effectiveness of the treatment was estimated over 3 treatment periods: 1, 2 and 3.8 years. The cost-effectiveness ratios varied between SEK14,148 and SEK33,033 per life-year gained ($US1 = SEK7.70. Pounds 1 = SEK12.40) for the 3 treatment periods. Adding ramipril to conventional treatment for heart failure after acute myocardial infarction is therefore cost effective, and compares favourably with the cost effectiveness of other common medical therapies in the cardiovascular field.", 
    "632": "Recent studies have shown that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). While these trials have obvious clinical implications, the widespread introduction of a new treatment for a condition as common as MI also has clear cost implications. The results of the post-MI studies with ACE inhibitors suggest that restricted use of treatment-in high-risk patients-is likely to be most cost effective, whereas treatment of all MI survivors, many of whom are at low risk, will be least cost effective. An approach somewhere in between may maximise clinical benefit at an acceptable cost. Economic analysis may help in deciding how these drugs might be best used after MI. We have conducted a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study, which reported the benefit of ACE inhibitors in intermediate-risk patients. Assuming all MI survivors require measurement of left ventricular function before selection for treatment (the approach used in the SAVE study), the incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG), over 4 years, using prophylactic captopril is approximately 10000 pounds sterling (Pounds) [1994 to 1995 values]. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is similar. These incremental cost per LYG and cost per QALY ratios compare favourably with other commonly used symptomatic and prophylactic treatments, and argue for extending post-MI use of ACE inhibitors to intermediate-as well as high-risk patients.",

Type of diabetes, time elapsed since its manifestation, actual antidiabetic therapy, period of existence of the hypertension (newly discovered vs known and treated for a time) were independent from the point of view of entering the study. Initial dose of benazepril was 5-10 mg/day depending on the blood pressure level, followed by a stepwise dose elevation according to the control investigations (at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 casual blood pressure control, at weeks 4 and 12 ambulantory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM as well) to a maximal daily dose of 20 mg. In the majority of patients benazepril was given in a morning single dose, in some cases because of a better tolerability divided into two parts. 20 patients received benazepril in monotherapy, 3 patients combined with other antihypertensive preparations. Parameters indicating severity of hypertension-hypertonic time index, hyperbaric impact-showed significant improvement already at week 4 when analysed in the total of patients and the moderately hypertonic group respectively.

The morphometric and ultra-structural analyses revealed that isoproterenol induced cardiomyocite hypertrophy and augmented the content of the type I collagen in the cardiac interstitium.",

    "657": "The capacity of the results of clinical studies to lead to changes in clinical practice is controversial. The treatment of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represents an increasingly important challenge for the physician. The decreasing mortality rate for AMI in the general population is countered by an increasingly high mortality rate among the elderly. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of the results of clinical studies on the treatment of AMI in community hospitals, and to highlight any differences in treatment and prognosis depending on age.", 
    "658": "123 patients with AMI were divided into two groups: (1) young patients (61.2%) aged under 75 (76 patients of whom 64 were male, with a mean age of 61.08 +/- 9.63) and (2) elderly patients (38.8%) aged over 75 (47 patients of whom 26 were male, with a mean age of 81.77 +/- 3.94). All patients were monitored for at least 12 months after discharge.", 
    "659": "The percentage administration of fibrinolytics (60.5%), aspirin (80.3%), beta-blockers (oral 40.8%; i.v. 32.9%) and anticoagulants (97.4%) showed that young patients were treated according to the indications reported in the literature. Thrombolysis was more frequently performed in young patients than in the aged (60.5% vs 10.6%; p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, Killip's class and time at hospitalization were variables predicting the exclusion from fibrinolysis. During hospitalization the elderly group received oral beta-blockers less frequently (8.5% vs 40.8%; p = 0.0001); on discharge, they less frequently received ACE-inhibitors (14.9% vs 46.1%; p = 0.0004), aspirin (48.9% vs 77.6%; p = 0.001), beta-blockers (12.8% vs 44.7%; p = 0.0002). The elderly group revealed a higher mortality rate both during hospitalization (19.1% vs 3.9%; p = 0.01) and follow-up (44.7% vs 11.0%; p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed a direct correlation between ventricular arrhythmia and Killip's class and hospital mortality, whereas smoking and time at hospitalization were inversely correlated. Mortality during follow-up was directly associated with Killip's class and inversely to the use of ACE-inhibitors during hospitalization, and beta-blockers and diuretics on discharge. Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show any differences in the survival rate of the two groups, but the first year after AMI was particularly critical for elderly patients among whom 40% of all deaths were recorded.", 
    "660": "This study confirms the application in clinical practice of the results of clinical studies also in community hospitals, and shows that elderly AMI patients are high-risk patients. The high mortality in the latter group is correlated to the fact that they are less eligible to undergo fibrinolytic therapy and have a lower probability of receiving drugs of proven efficacy as a means of increasing survival after AMI. Further clinical studies are required to reduce mortality after AMI in a population that is increasingly widely represented in community hospitals.", 
    "661": "Nitrates remain largely prescribed in heart failure. Their haemodynamic effects, a consequence of venous vasodilatation, have been clearly demonstrated in the acute situation, where they induce a fall in pulmonary pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, associated, at high doses, with an arterial vasodilator effect. Haemodynamic escape phenomena are observed during chronic administration and the peripheral vasodilator effect, in particular, tends to fade. Although, together with depletion of sulfhydryl radicals, activation of vasoconstrictor neuroendocrine systems, associated with haemodillution, plays an important role in this escape, coprescription of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or diuretics has been shown to be unable to prevent these effects. The effects of nitrates on the exercise capacity remain controversial, although the combination of isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine induced a significantly greater increase of maximal oxygen consumption than enalapril, together with a more marked increase in the ejection fraction. No trial has assessed the effects on mortality of nitrates, used as the only vasodilator agent, in heart failure, but in studies V-HeFT 1 and 2, the combination of isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine significantly improved survival, with a 38% reduction of mortality at one year compared to placebo or prazosin groups. However, this reduction remained less than that obtained with enalapril. In the case of contraindication or impossibility of using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, a combination of high doses of nitrates and hydralazine may be justified. On the other hand, when angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are already prescribed, nitrates can only be considered to improve symptoms in the case of persistence of dyspnoea. However, due to the hypotension which they can induce, their use should not interfere with the administration of the high doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor required. The dose of nitrates should then be determined as a function of their efficacy on symptoms and the blood pressure tolerance, while allowing an intervel of at least ten hours in order to attenuate the escape phenomenon.", 
    "662": "Several trials clearly demonstrate the importance of correcting hypertension and proteinuria in slowing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) progression. The relationship between hypertension and CRI is at least partly the consequence of impaired renal hemodynamics, mainly mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. Two classes of drugs have so far been shown to have an antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect, in addition to their antihypertensive action: ACE inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers (at least the non-dihydropyridines) which also interfere with the actions of angiotensin II. The same should be true for the newest angiotensin II receptor antagonists. To find conclusive evidence about the superior renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor antagonists) or calcium-channel blockers, we need well-designed, prospective, controlled and randomized long-term trials; the pharmacological rationale for combining the two classes of antihypertensive drugs is supported by the clinical need to reach a target blood pressure (120/80 mmHg) in CRI patients with proteinuria.", 
    "663": "Tamsulosin, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, has recently been approved to treat patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostatic receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate other agents' antihypertensive activity. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate how coadministration of tamsulosin would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril, and atenolol. Each study enrolled 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was being controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (study 1), enalapril (study 2), or atenolol (study 3). All 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomly assigned to either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin therapy (0.4 mg/d for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/d for 7 days) in addition to continuing their maintenance antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored over a 24-hour period on study days 4, 11, and 19. Coadministration of tamsulosin in these small studies had no clinically significant effects on the pharmacodynamic action of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol; it produced no clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter electrocardiographic or Holter monitoring results, and did not cause increased side effects. Coadministration of tamsulosin with the three antihypertensive agents studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies indicate that the dose of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol did not require adjustment in patients given tamsulosin, which may give tamsulosin an advantage over other alpha-blocking agents used to treat patients with BPH. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use may confirm these findings.", 
    "664": "Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure and has demonstrated its cardiovascular effects in experimental animal models, healthy volunteers and patients. The aim of this study was to find out whether or not differences in the pharmacokinetic profile and the haemodynamic response of a 100-mg single oral dose of captopril appeared between subjects of both sexes. Twenty-four young healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females) took part in the trial. Blood samples to assess captopril plasma concentrations, determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as well as haemodynamic variables, were obtained before and at different times following drug intake. Pharmacokinetic parameters did not show significant sex differences. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure exhibited a statistically significant decrease between 0.5 and 8 h in both sexes. No significant sex-related differences were found. The drug exhibited a good tolerability.", 
    "665": "We evaluated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on metabolic changes in myocardial organelles, myocardial hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis in the early stage of hypertension. An ACE inhibitor, imidapril (2.5 mg/kg per day), a calcium-channel blocker, diltiazem (30 mg/kg per day), or vehicle was given to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from 10 to 18 weeks of age. Single myocytes were isolated enzymatically from the left ventricles of these SHRs and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls at 18 weeks of age. In single ventricular myocytes, enzyme activities in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the sarcolemma (SL) and the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR) were determined. In 18-week-old SHRs receiving vehicle, myocardial hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis developed, and SR Ca2+ AT-Pase activity and the mitochondrial RCR were significantly lower and SL Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity was significantly higher than in age-matched WKYs. However, compared with diltiazem, imidapril was better able to prevent the development of myocardial hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, to improve SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and the mitochondrial RCR, and to increase SL Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity. These results suggest that ACE inhibition can prevent the development of morphologic changes associated with hypertension-induced left ventricular remodeling, such as myocardial hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, and can counteract ongoing dysfunction of organelle metabolism early in the development of hypertension.", 
    "666": "Renal artery stenosis is an important and potentially curable cause of hypertension. Captopril renography is now recognized to have a high sensitivity and specificity in its diagnosis. Ultimately, however, the result is of little benefit if it does not lead to a change in patient management. To assess how patient management was changed following the result of a captopril renogram, we reviewed the notes of 95 patients who had undergone this test over a 5 year period to identify renal artery stenosis. Of these patients, significant renal artery stenosis was suggested in 16 (17%), of whom only 9 (56%) underwent a change in management (7 proceeding to angiography with or without angioplasty, 2 having alterations in medication). In the 67 patients who had a negative renogram, 16 (24%) had an alteration in management (13 angiography, 3 altered drug treatment). Finally, of the 12 patients who had a non-diagnostic renogram, 7 (60%) had a management change (3 angiography, 4 altered drug therapy). Our results suggest that, despite evidence from the literature that captopril renography is both sensitive and specific for renal artery stenosis, clinicians still rely on other factors when determining who has significant stenosis and, therefore, who should proceed to a further investigation or have a change in medication. Ultimately, this reduces the clinical value of the test at present.", 
    "667": "Large scale observational studies have conclusively demonstrated that systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are linearly related to the incidence of cerebrovascular diseases and that high blood pressure is an important risk factor for both primary and secondary development of stroke. Interventional studies have shown that blood pressure lowering by antihypertensive treatment reduces the incidence of stroke in hypertensive patients without a history of previous stroke. Whether this is the case also for the secondary prevention of cerebral ischemic attacks has not been unequivocally shown, however. The PROGRESS (\"Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study\") study has been designed and is under way to collect information on this important issue of the antihypertensive treatment, its purpose being to evaluate the blood pressure lowering effects with an ACE-inhibitor on recurrent stroke in an overall population of 6000 patients with a positive history of previous cerebral ischemic attacks or stroke.", 
    "668": "Patients recovering from alcohol and other drug addiction have unique medical and pharmacological needs. Careful selection of medications call decrease the risk of relapse. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel-blocking medications are excellent choices to treat hypertension. Most gastrointestinal problems resolve with abstinence and can be treated nonpharmacologically. In managing pain, physicians should avoid narcotics and use nonpharmacological treatment whenever possible. Treating recovering patients with HIV can be challenging because of the side effects of many of the antiviral medications. The newer antiviral agents have fewer side effects and contraindications. Commonly used remedies for colds and cough can cause a relapse to drug use. Patients with diabetes mellitus need to be monitored very closely in early recovery to prevent hypoglycemia. Frequently a team approach is helpful in managing the medication needs of patients in recovery.", 
    "669": "Several well-controlled trials in patients with heart failure have shown that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in combination with a diuretic, causes a reduction in mortality and morbidity, which seems to be mainly due to a reduction in fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Our aim was to determine whether 249 consecutive patients discharged from hospital with a primary diagnosis of heart failure were routinely being treated with an ACE inhibitor at an appropriate dose. At the time of admission to hospital, 91 (36.5%) were receiving a combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor, 129 (51.8%) were receiving a diuretic alone, and 29 (11.6%) had not previously received either a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor. At the time of discharge from hospital all patients were on a diuretic and 144 (57.8%) were also receiving an ACE inhibitor. Although 41 patients (16.5%) had a relative or absolute contraindication for the use of an ACE inhibitor, 64 patients (25.7%) with no contraindication were not receiving an ACE inhibitor. Many of the patients who were prescribed an ACE inhibitor were given it at an inappropriate dose; only 24 patients (16.7%) were on the dose that was used in the clinical trials showing a reduction in mortality. These results show that in one in four patients admitted to hospital with heart failure who should be receiving an ACE inhibitor by the time of discharge, are not. The average age of these patients was 76 years. Whilst it has been shown that the benefit of ACE inhibitors does not appear to be age-related, most published studies have not included many patients over the age of 80. Specific studies looking at the effect of ACE inhibitors in elderly patients would be helpful, as well as studies to determine the optimum treatment regimen for this age group.", 
    "670": "New methods for docking, template fitting and building pseudo-receptors are described. Full conformational searches are carried out for flexible cyclic and acyclic molecules. QXP (quick explore) search algorithms are derived from the method of Monte Carlo perturbation with energy minimization in Cartesian space. An additional fast search step is introduced between the initial perturbation and energy minimization. The fast search produces approximate low-energy structures, which are likely to minimize to a low energy. For template fitting, QXP uses a superposition force field which automatically assigns short-range attractive forces to similar atoms in different molecules. The docking algorithms were evaluated using X-ray data for 12 protein-ligand complexes. The ligands had up to 24 rotatable bonds and ranged from highly polar to mostly nonpolar. Docking searches of the randomly disordered ligands gave rms differences between the lowest energy docked structure and the energy-minimized X-ray structure, of less than 0.76 A for 10 of the ligands. For all the ligands, the rms difference between the energy-minimized X-ray structure and the closest docked structure was less than 0.4 A, when parts of one of the molecules which are in the solvent were excluded from the rms calculation. Template fitting was tested using four ACE inhibitors. Three ACE templates have been previously published. A single run using QXP generated a series of templates which contained examples of each of the three. A pseudo-receptor, complementary to an ACE template, was built out of small molecules, such as pyrrole, cyclopentanone and propane. When individually energy minimized in the pseudo-receptor, each of the four ACE inhibitors moved with an rms of less than 0.25 A. After random perturbation, the inhibitors were docked into the pseudo-receptor. Each lowest energy docked structure matched the energy-minimized geometry with an rms of less than 0.08 A. Thus, the pseudo-receptor shows steric and chemical complementarity to all four molecules. The QXP program is reliable, easy to use and sufficiently rapid for routine application in structure-based drug design.", 
    "671": "The efficacy of spirapril, 6 mg once daily, was compared with enalapril, 5-20 mg once daily, in the control of mild-to-moderate hypertension in a placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A total of 251 patients participated in the study, all of whom underwent a 4-week washout period on placebo. Thereafter, 100 patients were randomized to spirapril, 6 mg once daily, 101 patients to enalapril, 5-20 mg once daily, and 50 patients remained on placebo. Sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured at 2-weekly clinic visits. Blood pressure profiles during peak and trough plasma drug concentrations (2-4 hours and 24-26 hours postdose, respectively) were determined at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks after starting the double-blind phase. Compared with placebo, treatment with both spirapril and enalapril resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.001) in DBP and SBP. DBP was reduced to a greater extent with spirapril than with enalapril both at peak (-17.4 mmHg vs. -14.8 mmHg) and trough (-14.7 mmHg vs. -12.4 mmHg). Thus, although the trough/peak DBP ratios for spirapril and enalapril were very similar (84% vs. 82%), actual reductions in DBP were different. Spirapril and enalapril treatment resulted in similar reductions in SBP at both peak and trough levels. Both drugs were well tolerated, and there were very few adverse events or changes in hematological or biochemical parameters during the study. In conclusion, spirapril, 6 mg once daily, as the initial and maintenance dose, is at least as effective and well tolerated as enalapril individually titrated.", 
    "672": "Treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) remains a major medical problem. Although in the last decades the benefits of several therapies in different patient populations with left ventricular dysfunction have been established, morbidity and mortality of CHF patients are high. Consequently, in the last decade improvement of survival has become the primary therapeutic endpoint in CHF studies, and the evaluation of the influence of (new) drugs on mortality has become crucial. In the present article an overview of the large mortality trials is given, and the shifts and alterations in the drug treatment strategy of CHF are discussed.", 
    "673": "After the ischemia-reperfusion process in extracorporeal cardiac surgery there are, among several phenomena, some reperfusion arrhythmias which are influenced by a varied series of mechanisms. These arrhythmias have been related to the release of oxygen-derived free radicals during the first moments of reperfusion. Thus, a previous administration of free-radical scavengers might be beneficial, among which captopril has been included with good results in human studies in vitro and in animals in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pretreatment with captopril on the prevention of reperfusion arrhythmias in patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery.", 
    "674": "30 patients were randomly allocated to pretreatment with either captopril (CTP group, n = 15) or without captopril (CON group, n = 15). Exclusion criteria (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, evidence of angiographic coronary disease, prior myocardial infarction and preoperatory myocardial infarction). The dose of captopril administered was 12.5 mg every 8 hours orally, from 24 hours before surgery. A Holter register was used to analyze the ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles, salvos, tachycardia and fibrillation) during the first hour of reperfusion. The need for cardioversion was examined and the number of shocks needed. These events were related to changes in blood analyses from coronary sinus samples to determine creatine phosphokinase, activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, before aortic clamping and after the heart was rewarmed.", 
    "675": "No significant differences were found in the number of ventricular arrhythmias. 60% of the patients with captopril and only 40% of the patients without it (non significant) had spontaneous defibrillation without electric shock; in those cases in which it was necessary, the number of shocks was less in the captopril group (p < 0.05). Excepting the significant correlation (p < 0.01) that we have found between ventricular fibrillation and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate increase, there is no significant correlation between the other arrhythmias and the analytical data studied.", 
    "676": "These data suggest that captopril, given before cardiac surgery, has little or no protector effect on reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias in extracorporeal cardiac surgery, though in patients treated with captopril there is a greater possibility of spontaneous defibrillation and fewer shocks necessary for defibrillation, without negative effects.", 
    "677": "Experimental data suggest that aldosterone has harmful effects promoting myocardial fibrosis and disturbing autonomic balance. There has been no evidence of these potential effects in intact man.", 
    "678": "We report the findings in 31 patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF) who were treated with spironolactone (50-100 mg/day) or placebo in addition to diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In a controlled randomised double-blind study, we found that spironolactone treatment reduced circulating levels of procollagen type III N-terminal amino peptide, a marker of vascular collagen turnover, and in addition increased time-domain parameters of heart rate variability (n = 24). These latter parameters suggest a parasympathomimetic effect for additional spironolactone. Spironolactone significantly reduced heart rate (prolonged RR interval) particularly during the dawn hours (06.00-09.00 h). In this unbalanced study it was not possible to provide a detailed diurnal assessment of the impact of spironolactone on heart rate variability, but the preliminary data suggest that there may be an interaction with the autonomic nervous system which varies in time.", 
    "679": "These are the first human data to show that use of the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, can positively improve time-domain heart rate variability and reduce myocardial collagen turnover, as reflected by further reductions in serum procollagen peptide, despite concurrent ACE inhibitor treatment. Residual aldosterone after ACE inhibitor treatment may therefore have a role promoting arrhythmia and cardiac death by two mechanisms. Effects of additional spironolactone on slowing heart rate (and potentially the detrimental effect of aldosterone) were most prominent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. when cardiac death is also known to be most prominent.", 
    "680": "We have studied gut mucosal perfusion in 24 infants, aged 0.7-45 weeks, requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Group 2 patients (n = 12) had received the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril 0.8-0.9 mg kg-1 orally, 45 min before induction of anaesthesia. Group 1 infants were of similar age and size and required a similar duration of CPB, but did not receive any preoperative medication. An orogastric tonometer allowed intermittent calculations of gastric intramucosal pH (pHi), and rectal mucosal perfusion (\"flux\") was monitored using laser Doppler flowmetry. Measurements of arterial base deficit and lactate and pyruvate concentrations were made intermittently. We found no significant difference in femoral arterial pressure between the groups at any time before, during or after surgery. Similarly, we found no significant differences in our measures of regional or global tissue perfusion between the groups at any time before, during or after surgery. We conclude that preoperative administration of captopril produced no beneficial effect on gut mucosal perfusion in infants undergoing hypothermic, non-pulsatile CPB.",

    "685": "The effects of three commonly used antihypertensive agents (captopril, hydralazine, and terazosin) on tissue antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY rats) were studied by analysis of antioxidant enzyme specific activities and lipid peroxidation levels in control and drug-treated animals. In the myocardium, changes in some of the enzyme activities between normotensive WKY and hypertensive SHR rats were mitigated by treatment of the SHR rats with an antihypertensive drug. Thus, all three drugs caused significant increases in myocardial Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (up to 133% of SHR control activity) and decreases in glutathione peroxidase (down to 59% of SHR control activity) to values that were closer to those in untreated WKY rats. Captopril also increased Mn superoxide dismutase activity, and hydralazine and terazosin decreased catalase activity towards untreated WKY values. Hydralazine was the only drug to alter the lipid peroxidation level in the myocardium of SHR rats (a 28% decrease), but in WKY rats all three drugs caused significant decreases in myocardial lipid peroxidation levels. In WKY rats, none of the drugs affected myocardial Mn and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activities, although glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased by hydralazine and terazosin treatment and catalase activity was increased by captopril treatment. Enzyme activity changes in liver and skeletal muscle indicated that such changes were often tissue specific. No pattern was found for coordinated changes in antioxidant enzyme expression as a result of the drug treatments, and the changes in antioxidant enzyme specific activities did not correlate generally with changes in lipid peroxidation levels.", 
    "686": "Alterations in lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats have suggested a pathophysiologic role for angiotensin II (AII) in pulmonary vascular remodeling. ACE inhibitors suppress MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension; however, losartan, an angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, was without impact. The present study examined AII receptor binding characteristics by radioligand binding during the development of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension. Saturation binding isotherms for [125I]AII binding to membrane preparations from rat lung were performed at 4, 10, and 21 days following a single injection of MCT (60 mg/kg) or saline vehicle. Right ventricular hypertrophy, an index of pulmonary hypertension, increased at 21 days post-MCT. Saturation binding isotherms revealed a single, high affinity site for [125I]AII binding in lung membranes from MCT-treated and control rats, with no change in receptor affinity or density during the development of pulmonary hypertension. Competition displacement binding demonstrated that the AT1 receptor predominates in lung membranes from control rats, with no alterations in AII receptor subtype distribution following MCT treatment. In summary, these results suggest that the AT1 receptor subtype predominates in rat lung and does not contribute to the development of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "687": "We investigated the efficacy of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme [ACE] inhibitor on daytime and night-time blood pressure in 55 male hypertensive patients with moderately severe to severe obstructive sleep apnea. We resolved to determine if treatment oriented towards the reduction of hypertension would be successful, despite persistent repetitive hypoxemia and sleep-disordered breathing. The study was a randomized, double-blind, single daily dose, placebo-controlled protocol, with 8 days drug intake (placebo or 2.5 mg Cilazapril) and monitoring on the final day of drug administration. Subjects underwent continuous 24-h arterial blood pressure monitoring during baseline and treatment conditions. Polysomnography was performed at night during the 24-h arterial monitoring period. Cilazapril (2.5 mg) lowered systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, despite persistence of repetitive obstructive apneas during sleep and the associated repetitive hypoxemia. The lowering of blood pressure occurred without a significant change in heart rate, and was noted during nocturnal sleep, performance testing and graded exercise.",

A 12-week dose-titration period, randomized 3:1 temocapril: atenolol, preceded 40 weeks long-term treatment. An intent-to-treat population of 472 patients was analysed for efficacy after 12 weeks dose-titration. Sitting DBP fell significantly (p < 0.001) in both groups, by mean +/- standard deviation (SD) 15.9 +/- 5.7 mmHg on temocapril and by 16.6 +/- 5.9 mmHg on atenolol. Therapeutic equivalence was demonstrated using the two one-sided t-tests procedure according to Schuirmann (equivalence interval [theta 1 - theta 2] < or = 5 mmHg). Responders (DBP < or = 90 mmHg) represented 89.9% of temocapril and 94.0% of atenolol patients. The lower doses were effective in 70.9% of temocapril patients (10 or 20 mg) and in 63.7% of atenolol patients (25 or 50 mg), these doses being continued after the dose titration period. No clinically relevant changes in haematological, biochemical and urinalysis variables occurred. Adverse events were few, largely unrelated to treatment and comparable between groups. In conclusion, temocapril and atenolol proved to be therapeutically equivalent antihypertensives.",

More patients with angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors had complaints of odynophagia (p < 0.02), whereas only patients with non-ACE inhibitor causes of angioedema presented with pruritus (p < 0.02). Furthermore, patients presenting with an acute reaction within 24 h of exposure to the causative agent were more likely to require inpatient monitoring (p < 0.05).

    "693": "The author takes the characteristic hemodynamic features and neurohumoral factors associated with heart failure as the starting point for the discussion. He specifies fundamentals of the current strategies and goals of the management of heart failure. Treatment with vasodilatator and ACE inhibitors has paved novel way for treatment of heart failure, because it is not only able to alleviate the symptoms, but also to improve hemodynamic parameters and increase survival. Initiation of treatment at early stage (silent ventricular dysfunction) is able to prevent the development of manifest signs of heart failure. Captopril, a classical ACE inhibitor, is suitable for modern treatment of heart failure, as well for prevention of myocardial remodelling following acute myocardial infarction.",

    "695": "After the brief description of the most important hypertensive pathophysiological processes (renin, angiotensins) which are closely related to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as well as to the mechanisms of action of captopril, author summarizes the essential clinical findings from the international and Hungarian literature. A short guideline for the administration of captopril to hypertensive patients is also given.", 
    "696": "The authors of the present report reviewed the literature of various bioanalytical methods for the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of captopril and present their own results obtained in bioanalytical and pharmacokinetic studies. The authors performed a detailed comparative clinical, pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence study, in Hungary, with 3 different captopril tablets, 50 mg each, namely with Tensiomin (EGIS Pharmaceuticals Ltd.), as test preparation and Capoten (E.R. Squibb & Sons, Inc.) and Lopirin (Squibb Pharma GmbH) as reference preparations. Bioequivalence study of Tensiomin and Capoten preparations both containing 100 mg of captopril was carried out in the United States. Relative bioavailability and comparative pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in 24 and 25 healthy volunteers, respectively, in single-dose, randomised studies of three-way (50 mg) or two-way (100 mg) cross-over design. The individual pharmacokinetic parameters determined for the test and reference preparations with different active principle content were tmax, Cmax, AUCOo-t, AUCo-infinity t beta 1/2, Cmax/AUCo-infinity. Statistical evaluation of the results of bioequivalence studies was made using confidence interval calculation and the Test/Reference ratio (50 and 100 mg), and by Schuirmann's, Hauck-Anderson's, Westlake's, Wilcoxon's methods (50 mg) and power test (100 mg). All the above tests indicated statistical equivalence between the test and reference preparations. The test and reference preparations of different strengths had identical relative bioavailability. Accordingly, the clinical and biological equivalence of 50 mg and 100 mg Tensiomin tablets with 50 mg and 100 mg Capoten tablets and 50 mg Lopirin tablet have been demonstrated in two independent comparative bioequivalence studies.", 
    "697": "The physical chemical properties, stability and incompatibility of captopril (the active ingredient of Tensiomin tablets) have been discussed. Captopril has two polimorphic crystal modifications, the form I. of higher melting point is applied in the therapy. Captopril has a better stability in solutions below pH 4, the degradation is accelerated by metallic ions (Cu, Fe). In solid phase the degradation is accelerated by the humidity of the air. No incompatibility was found with the tabletting excipients but stearic acid and sodium-carboxymethyl-starch. Under compaction at higher pressure captopril itself shows tendency for lamination. The dissolution rate of the Tensiomin tablets can meet the requirement of USP if direct tabletting method was used. In this case the breaking strength of the tablets has no influence on the dissolution rate. The main properties (weight uniformity, content uniformity, tensile strength, friability, disintegration time, dissolution time) of the Tensiomin tablets of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of captopril meet the requirement of USP not only after manufacturing but after the accelerated stability test of three month as well.", 
    "698": "In order to determine the compliance of Canadian physicians with evidence-based hypertension guidelines, a self-administered questionnaire survey was distributed to a stratified random sample of 473 physicians in Central Alberta, Canada in December 1995. Excluding non-deliverable questionnaires, a response rate of 67% was obtained. Twenty-five per cent of respondents routinely used the fourth Korotkoff sound to define diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Investigations recommended for the initial workup of a patient with mild hypertension included serum creatinine (90%), electrolytes (72%), glucose (50%), cholesterol (44%), electrocardiogram (65%), and urinalysis (76%). The non-pharmacologic treatment advice routinely advocated for patients with mild hypertension included salt restriction (87%), weight loss (100%), and regular aerobic exercise (92%). While 46% of respondents recommended antihypertensive therapy for an otherwise healthy patient with an average DBP of 95 mm Hg, 76% recommended therapy for patients with the same BP plus target organ damage or other cardiovascular risk factors. Medication choices varied, although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were chosen by 46% for patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension and 67% for patients with other cardiovascular risk factors, and beta-blockers were the most frequently chosen first-line agents (56%) for the patient with target organ damage. There was considerable variability in the self-reported practice patterns, and concordance was greater for those recommendations which were consistent across the currently available guidelines. Consistent with the principle underlying all of the current hypertension guidelines, respondents were more aggressive in their treatment of hypertensive patients with other cardiovascular risk factors or target organ damage.", 
    "699": "1. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the degradative enzyme for atrial natriuretic peptide, was studied in vitro and in vivo using a previously characterized NEP inhibitor radioligand, 125I-labelled RB104. 2. SCH 42354, the active di-acid of the ethylester prodrug, SCH 42495, caused a concentration-dependent displacement of 125I-labelled RB104 from rat renal NEP. The concentration of SCH 42354 that displaced 50% of radioligand bound to the enzyme NEP (IC50) was 3.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/l (mean +/- SEM). Enalaprilat, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, did not displace 125I-labelled RB104 in concentrations up to 10 mumol/l. 3. In adult normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats, oral SCH 42495 (3-300 mg/kg) caused significant inhibition of renal NEP (P < 0.001). SCH 42495 had no effect on renal or plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity, but high-dose SCH 42495 (300 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in plasma renin activity (P < 0.01). 4. In a time course study, oral SCH 42495 (30 mg/kg) caused rapid (within 30 min) and significant inhibition of renal NEP for up to 48 h (P < 0.001). No changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide or plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity were seen. 5. These data provide evidence that short-term administration of the NEP inhibitor SCH 42495 results in inhibition of renal NEP and does not inhibit the circulating or the tissue renin-angiotensin system. The NEP inhibitor radioligand 125I-labelled RB104, is a useful tool to study tissue NEP inhibition after administration of NEP inhibitors.", 
    "700": "Benazepril (BP), an angiotensin convertive enzyme inhibitor, was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks to 31 dogs with mild to moderate (NYHA functional classes II and III) congestive heart failure caused from mitral insufficiency (MI). There were no significant changes in clinical signs, electrocardiogram findings, radiographical observations and plasma biochemical results in 11 dogs treated with placebo for 4 weeks. In 31 dogs treated with BP, appetite increased, and mean scores of heart failure signs, such as activity, exercise tolerance, cough and respiratory effort, were significantly improved. No dog displays signs suggesting systemic hypotension. One dog died suddenly on the 26th day of treatment with BP. This dog had good vigor and appetite till the evening before the death, and cough and exercise tolerance had been gradually improving. The heart rate and ECG parameters of BP treated dogs did not change significantly, but length of long axis of the heart decreased. In plasma biochemical tests, plasma urea nitrogen (UN) levels did not change significantly, and plasma creatinine (CRE) levels increased slightly within the normal ranges during BP trial. Two dogs had higher plasma UN levels with slightly higher plasma CRE levels, but had normal general condition and other biochemical results. Plasma ACE activity decreased to 57.3% of pre-treatment level at 4 weeks after BP treatment. It is concluded that BP monotherapy was efficacious at least in dogs with relatively low grade congestive heart failure caused by MI.", 
    "701": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the angiotensin II-induced contractions in the isolated aorta and iliac artery of the rabbit, with respect to the role of arachidonate metabolites. Furthermore, the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril was studied on the responses to angiotensin II in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. After 12 weeks of cholesterol diet (0.3%), endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were significantly fewer compared with control (30.2 +/- 5.9% vs. 73.0 +/- 1.7%) in the aorta but not in the iliac artery of the rabbit. The angiotensin II- and methoxamine-induced contractions were also significantly lower compared with control in the aorta (101.4 +/- 6.7% vs. 60.9 +/- 4.2% and 160.2 +/- 5.7% vs. 135.8 +/- 8.0%, respectively) but not in the iliac artery. The lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) selectively attenuated the angiotensin II-induced contractions in rabbit aortic rings from the control group only in the presence of the endothelium, whereas it had no effect on the responses to angiotensin II in the cholesterol group (with or without endothelium). In the iliac artery, NDGA inhibited the responses to angiotensin II in both the control and cholesterol groups. Treatment with ramipril (0.33 mg/kg/day) significantly improved the maximal angiotensin II-induced contraction in the aorta of rabbits fed a cholesterol diet for 16 weeks to 61.0 +/- 7.3% (vs. 32.7 +/- 9.0% in the cholesterol group). We conclude that hypercholesterolemia leads to a reduction of angiotensin II-induced contractions in the aorta and not in the iliac artery of the rabbit. This reduction might be related to loss of endothelium-dependent lipoxygenase products and is partially reversed by ramipril.", 
    "702": "Bradykinin (Bk), which is produced locally in the heart, exhibits potent cardioprotective effects. However, these effects appear to be limited by rapid degradation of the peptide. To determine the mechanism of Bk metabolism in the coronary circulation, [3H]Bk was perfused through the isolated rat heart via the aorta in the presence and absence of specific peptidase inhibitors. The radiolabeled metabolites were collected from the pulmonary artery and then separated, identified, and quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by using a radioactive flow detector. In the absence of inhibitors, only 45 +/- 2% of the radioactivity eluted from the coronary circulation as intact [3H]Bk. The chromatograms suggested that Bk was being hydrolyzed at the Arg1-Pro2 bond by aminopeptidase P and at the Pro7-Phe8 bond by angiotensin-converting enzyme. When the aminopeptidase P inhibitor, apstatin (200 microM), was coperfused with [3H]Bk, cleavage at the Arg1-Pro2 bond was blocked and the amount of intact [3H]Bk in the perfusate increased to 57 +/- 5% (p < 0.05 vs. control). Coperfusion with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramiprilat (0.5 microM), alone blocked cleavage at the Pro7-Phe8 bond and increased intact [3H]Bk to 75 +/- 3% (p < 0.001 vs. control). When both apstatin and ramiprilat were present, almost all of the radioactivity (96 +/- 1%) eluted as intact [3H]Bk (p < 0.01 vs. ramiprilat alone). The results indicate that the degradation of Bk in the rat coronary circulation can be fully accounted for by aminopeptidase P (approximately 30%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (approximately 70%).", 
    "703": "The structure and function of small arteries of different vascular beds in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) are altered relative to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats, and these differences may be blunted under treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. To determine whether this effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was caused by the interruption of the renin-angiotensin system, our experiments were conducted with an AT1 angiotensin-receptor antagonist to evaluate its ability to induce regression of hypertrophy of resistance arteries in SHRs. The result of treatment of SHRs with losartan, an orally active selective angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist was examined at a low (20 mg/kg/day) and a high (60 mg/kg/day) oral dose in SHRs once blood pressure had been elevated for some time. SHRs were treated for 12 weeks with losartan. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by losartan treatment from 210 +/- 2 mm Hg in untreated SHRs to 181 +/- 1 mm Hg (low dose) and 156 +/- 4 mm Hg (high dose) (p < 0.01). Cardiac and aortic hypertrophy were dose-dependently reduced in treated SHRs. Coronary, renal, mesenteric, and femoral small arteries (luminal diameter, 200-250 microm) studied on an isometric wire myograph and pressurized mesenteric small arteries examined under isobaric conditions exhibited significant hypertrophy and inward remodeling in SHRs in comparison to WKY rats. Losartan treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the media thickness and mediato-lumen ratio in small arteries from the four vascular beds studied on the wire myograph and in pressurized mesenteric small arteries. Endothelium-dependent relaxation studied in pressurized arteries was enhanced, and acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent contractions studied on the wire myograph were abolished in losartan-treated SHRs relative to untreated SHRs. In WKY rats, treatment had no effect. These results demonstrate that treatment with the selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, even at doses that reduce blood pressure only moderately, induces regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy and of endothelial dysfunction in genetic hypertension in the rat.", 
    "704": "Balloon angioplasty has become an important intervention in clinical cardiology; however, the technique is associated with a high incidence of restenosis, requiring repeated procedures. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), specifically through its action on ET(A) receptors, has been implicated in the cell proliferation and subsequent neointimal formation that leads to restenosis. Therefore we examined a potent antagonist of the ET(A) receptor, A127722.5, in a pig model of balloon angioplasty in iliac and carotid arteries. Ten pigs received A-127722.5 (7.5 mg/kg b.i.d.) orally, starting 3 days before angioplasty and continuing for 4 weeks; 10 additional pigs were treated with the same dosing regimen of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (3.0 mg/kg b.i.d.), while a third group of 10 animals received placebo. At 2 and 4 weeks after the start of treatment, these doses of the ET(A) receptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor blocked the presser responses induced by big ET-1 and angiotensin I, respectively. In the iliac arteries, neointimal formation, neointimal/medial ratio, and maximal neointimal thickness were all significantly reduced, and the residual lumen area was significantly increased in pigs treated with the ET(A) receptor antagonist compared with placebo and captopril-treated groups. Medial collagen content, collagen deposition, and medial growth also were significantly reduced relative to the placebo group. Beneficial effects also were observed in the carotid arteries, although the results were less striking. Captopril was ineffective in protecting against the effects of balloon angioplasty in both vessels. Our results indicate that an orally active and potent antagonist of the ET(A) receptor inhibits cell proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix in pigs and may provide an important therapeutic approach to the prevention of restenosis.", 
    "705": "To examine the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors such as captopril and idrapril on the P-450 system, these compounds were administered 100 mg/kg i.p. for 4 days to spontaneously hypertensive (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; thereafter, the principal hepatic and renal microsomal monooxygenase activities were determined. In all the rat strains used, both captopril and idrapril decreased only the P-450 2C11, (as determined by immunoblotting) and its linked activities such as 16alpha-, 2alpha- and 17-testosterone hydroxylases. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease of blood testosterone levels both in normotensive and, more markedly, in hypertensive rats and by a reduction of systolic blood pressure, but only in SHRs. Only in SHRs as well, the renal immunodetectable P-450 4A content and the P-450 4A-dependent activities, such as the (omega)-lauric acid hydroxylase, diminished after captopril or idrapril treatment. These data suggest that the decrease of increased blood pressure in hypertensive SHRs by the ACE inhibitors may be linked to the downregulation of the circulating testosterone level, the renal P-450 4A expression, and the related formation of the potent vasoconstrictor (omega)-hydroxy arachidonic acid.", 
    "706": "Parasympathetic nervous activity (PSNA) is an important determinant of the risk of sudden death and outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease, so the effects of drug therapy on PSNA may be of prognostic importance in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the only drugs that are reasonably accepted to improve prognosis in such patients. Accordingly we determined PSNA by heart-rate variability (HRV) analysis in nine patients (four women and five men, aged 73.6 +/- 6 yrs) with heart failure (NYHA Classes II-III) and in sinus rhythm. HRV was determined during 20-40 min supine rest at baseline and then at 2-weekly intervals during incremental dosing of oral captopril, 12.5 mg b.i.d., 25 mg b.i.d., and 50 mg b.i.d. Poincar\u00e9 plot and conventional time- and frequency-domain measures were used to analyze the data. Low-dose captopril (12.5 mg b.i.d.) resulted in an increase in SD delta RR (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 22.0 +/- 9.1 ms; p < 0.05). We previously validated this as a measure of PSNA. Higher dose captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) also produced an increase in PSNA activity (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 18.7 +/- 7.8 ms), although this failed to reach statistical significance. However, the highest dose of captopril (50 mg b.i.d.) reduced PSNA activity to near-baseline values, as shown by measures of HRV in both the time and frequency domains. These data suggest that only a low dose of captopril augments PSNA in patients with heart failure. Dosing of ACE inhibitors may be important in optimizing their benefit in CHF.", 
    "707": "The effect of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, enalapril maleate and captopril, on the progression of atherosclerosis was investigated. Golden Syrian hamsters were divided into five groups: controls (C), fed a standard chow diet; hypercholesterolemic animals (HH) induced by supplementing the diet with 3% cholesterol and 15% butter; HH treated with enalapril (20 mg/kg/day); HH treated with captopril (60 mg/kg/day) and HH treated simultaneously with enalapril and a calcium channel blocker, diltiazem (45 mg/kg/day). The drugs were administered for one month, concomitantly with the atherogenic diet. As compared to controls, in HH group a significant increase in serum cholesterol (approximately 5 fold) and ACE activity (approximately 3 fold) was found. In HH-treated animals, both drugs maintained the serum ACE activity within the normal values. However, the effect upon serum cholesterol was different: enalapril and its combination with diltiazem had a significant hypocholesterolemic effect (128.8 +/- 25 mg/dl), whereas captopril had no effect on the cholesterol values (326.6 +/- 41.48 mg/dl). Electron microscopical examination of the coronary arteries and aortic valve in all experimental groups indicated a good correlation between the high levels of cholesterol, ACE activity and the development of the atherosclerotic lesions. Captopril treatment inhibits the early phases of atherosclerosis at level of the coronary artery but has no influence upon the lesion development in the aortic valve. By comparison, enalapril and enalapril-diltiazem co-administration impede the development of fatty streaks by decreasing the accumulation of lipids and calcium deposits in the lesion-prone areas examined. These data indicate that: 1) captopril does not have a hypocholesterolemic potential and cannot prevent atheroma formation in heart valves; 2) enalapril, especially combined with diltiazem, has a hypocholesterolemic effect and impedes the development of atheromatous plaque; 3) the anti-atherosclerosis therapy may benefit from the co-administration of an ACE-inhibitor with a calcium antagonist.", 
    "708": "This trial evaluated the effects of epoprostenol on patients with severe left ventricular failure. Patients with class IIIB/IV congestive heart failure and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction were eligible for enrollment if angiography documented severely compromised hemodynamics while the patient was receiving a regimen of digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We randomly assigned 471 patients to epoprostenol infusion or standard care. The primary end point was survival; secondary end points were clinical events, congestive heart failure symptoms, distance walked in 6 minutes, and quality-of-life measures. The median dose of epoprostenol was 4.0 ng/kg/min, resulting in a significant increase in cardiac index (1.81 to 2.61 L/min/m2), a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (24.5 to 20.0 mm Hg), and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (20.76 to 12.33 units). The trial was terminated early because of a strong trend toward decreased survival in the patients treated with epoprostenol. Chronic intravenous epoprostenol therapy is not associated with improvement in distance walked, quality of life, or morbid events and is associated with an increased risk of death.", 
    "709": "Patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction exhibit increased adrenergic activity but blunted adrenergic responsiveness. We studied patients enrolled in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, examining exercise responses of heart rate (HR) and plasma norepinephrine (PNE). Eighty-seven patients were studied before randomization; 65 of these were examined 1 year after randomization to placebo or enalapril. Compared with prevention trial (asymptomatic) patients, patients in the treatment trial (symptomatic) had higher resting HR and PNE levels and less increase in HR with a greater increase in PNE with exercise. Acute administration of enalapril increased the resting HR in patients in the prevention trial only but had no significant effect on PNE. After 1 year of therapy, patients in the prevention trial exhibited no change. Within the treatment trial, the placebo group displayed both a higher peak PNE and increase in PNE with exercise than did the enalapril group, whose HR response was maintained in spite of a reduction of exercise PNE. We conclude that (1) compared with asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction manifest greater resting and exercise adrenergic activity, with blunted HR response; and (2) in symptomatic patients, 1 year of enalapril treatment effected an augmented HR response to adrenergic stimulation, supporting an interaction between the renin/angiotensin and adrenergic nervous systems. Normalization of adrenergic tone and response likely contributes to the benefits of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.", 
    "710": "The present study evaluated the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor concentration and on proliferation in two lines of human mammary ductal carcinoma cells in culture: T-47D (ER+/PR+) and Hs578T (ER-/PR-). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine, validated by cell count, served as an index of proliferation. Compared to control cells, T-47D cells incubated for 48 hrs in 1, 2, or 5 mM captopril (but not in 0.5 mM) exhibited a reduction in ER from 130 +/- 6 to 32 +/- 32 fmol/mg cytosolic protein, and an increase in PR from 1780 +/- 120 to 2740 +/- 400 fmol/ mg protein (p < 0.05). Western analysis confirmed these drug-induced changes in the concentration of immunoreactive receptor proteins. Captopril also induced the appearance of low but detectable PR in the Hs578T cells at concentrations as low as 50 microM. Captopril inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by both cell types during a 48 hr incubation, although Hs578T cells were 2-3 times more resistant than were T-47D cells. This cytostatic effect of captopril was not due to cytotoxicity as indicated by 51Cr release, and was not accompanied by significant changes in cell cycle distribution as determined by flow cytometry. The incorporation of [3H]uridine (RNA synthesis) and [14C]alanine (protein synthesis) also were inhibited by captopril, suggesting a general antimetabolic effect of the drug in the ductal carcinoma cells. These are novel actions of a common antihypertensive agent. In contrast, the nonthiol ACE inhibitor lisinopril, and penicillamine, a thiol compound with virtually no ACE inhibitory activity, had no effect on any of these endpoints.", 
    "711": "The use of cyclosporine in solid organ transplantation has been shown to be associated with the development of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Several mechanisms, including endothelin-mediated systemic vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation secondary to reduction in nitric oxide, and altered cytosolic calcium translocation, have been proposed to underlie cyclosporine-induced hypertension. In addition, other studies have shown activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, as well as abnormalities in prostaglandin metabolism, as culpable mechanisms. Hemodynamic features of cyclosporine-induced hypertension consist of elevated peripheral vascular resistance, ventricular vascular uncoupling contributing to left ventricular hypertrophy, and abnormalities in the diastolic function of the allograft. Combined calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used for this treatment of this clinical problem, and they achieve blood pressure control in 65% of patients. Moreover, these agents may also be beneficial in preventing development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a long-term nemesis in cardiac transplantation.", 
    "712": "The effects of maternal administration of either an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (GR138950) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were investigated in chronically catheterized ewes and their fetuses during late gestation. From 127 +/- 1 days of gestation until parturition at 145 +/- 2 days, each ewe received daily i.v. injections of GR138950 (3 mg kg-1, n = 10 animals) or captopril (3 mg kg-1, n = 6) or an equivalent volume of vehicle solution (0.9% NaCl, n = 10). On the first day of treatment, plasma renin concentrations in the pregnant ewe increased within 2 h of administration of either GR138950 (median change followed by lower and upper quartiles (25%, 75%): +38.3 ng ml-1 h-1 (15.6, 80.7); P < 0.05) or captopril (+22.1 ng ml-1 h-1 (19.2, 28.8); P < 0.05). Maternal plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (AII) also increased by 871 pg ml-1 (555, 1340; P < 0.05) in the GR138950-treated ewes. In the fetuses of both groups of drug-treated animals, an increase in plasma renin concentration was observed within 2 h of maternal treatment with either GR138950 (+11.6 ng ml-1 h-1 (1.2, 18.6); P < 0.05) or captopril (+59.3 ng ml-1 h-1 (41.7, 74.6); P < 0.05). These short-term changes in circulating renin and AII concentrations observed in the pregnant ewe were sustained after 1 week of GR138950 administration. In addition, 1 week of GR138950 treatment decreased plasma angiotensinogen (Ao) concentrations in both the ewe (-0.36 microgram ml-1 (-0.58, -0.16); P < 0.05) and the fetus (-0.43 microgram ml-1 (-0.59, -0.09); P < 0.05). A long-term reduction in maternal plasma AII, and an increase in fetal plasma renin concentration, were associated with 1 week of captopril administration. Neither drug had any consistent effect on plasma ACTH or cortisol concentrations in the pregnant ewe or fetus. These findings show that, during ovine pregnancy, antagonism of maternal AII activity, either by blockade of the AT1 receptor or by inhibition of AII synthesis, induces changes in the circulating components of the RAS in the mother and fetus. In both the pregnant ewe and fetus, the RAS is shown to be activated by suppression of AII activity.",

Although the doses of captopril (but no enalapril) decreased afterload, inhibition of IZ collagen was less, IZ bulging and global LV dilation were less and systolic function was better with captopril than with enalapril. In all three MI groups, deaths over the seven weeks correlated with greater infarct size, LV volume and dysfunction and lower IZ collagen.",

To test the hypothesis that this persistent effect involves a shift in the pressure-natriuresis relation, we performed experiments in male, anesthetized SHR at 18 wk of age with fixed neural and hormonal influences on the kidney. Renal function was assessed at various levels of arterial pressure using standard clearance techniques. Enalapril (25 mg.kg-1.day-1 in drinking water) was administered from 4 to 14 wk of age and again 3 days before renal function studies. The following four groups of SHR were studied: 1) 10-wk treatment, 2) 10-wk + 3-day treatment, 3) 3-day treatment, and 4) untreated. Groups 1 and 4 had an intact renin-angiotensin system; groups 2 and 3 had the renin-angiotensin system blocked. Mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg; means +/- SE) under Inactin anesthesia was 139 +/- 4 (n = 9), 109 +/- 3 (n = 8), 149 +/- 1 (n = 9), and 181 +/- 7 mmHg (n = 9) for each of the four groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate was similar in all groups at resting levels of MAP, whereas renal blood flow was elevated in all treatment groups when compared with that in untreated SHR. Pressure-natriuresis, pressure-diuresis, and pressure-fractional sodium excretion curves for the 10-wk treatment group and 3-day only treatment group were shifted leftward to significantly lower pressures by approximately 25 mmHg, compared with the untreated group. The curves for the treated +3-day group were shifted an additional 30 mmHg to the left. The relationship between renal artery pressure (RAP) and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure was also shifted 25-30 mmHg but only in rats that received the long-term treatment with enalapril. Three-day enalapril had no significant effect on this relationship. These data indicate that the persistent effect of long-term enalapril treatment on arterial pressure in SHR is the result of a shift in the pressure-natriuresis relationship. The mechanism for this effect involves hemodynamic changes that act to improve transmission of RAP to the interstitium, resulting in enhanced sodium excretion for a given level of RAP.", 
    "718": "In anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, intermittent bilateral carotid artery traction (BilCAT) caused a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 28 +/- 3 mmHg and led to a progressive increase in sodium excretion (UNaV) that nearly doubled 45-90 min after initiation of the repetitive application of BilCAT (P < 0.001). This natriuresis was accompanied by an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 2.70 +/- 0.3 to 3.2 +/- 0.3 ml/min (P < 0.001), no change in renal plasma flow [clearance of p-aminohippurate (PAH)], and an increase in the fractional excretion of lithium. Rats with bilateral renal denervation exhibited neither natriuresis nor an increase in GFR in response to BilCAT despite similar vasodepression caused by the maneuver. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats responded to BilCAT like Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibited an exaggerated vasodepressor response to BilCAT (-51 +/- 3 mmHg) without increasing either UNaV or GFR. Separate groups of WKY and SHR were treated from 4 wk of age with captopril added to the drinking water at a concentration of 1 g/l. At 12-14 wk, both groups had lower MAP compared with untreated animals. Captopril treatment did not alter either the natriuretic response or the increase in GFR seen in untreated WKY after BilCAT, and the maneuver produced equivalent degrees of vasodepression as in controls. However, treated SHR now responded to BilCAT with increases in both UNaV and GFR that closely resembled the responses seen in Sprague-Dawley and WKY rats. These results suggest that BilCAT produces natriuresis through a pathway dependent on the renal nerves. This pathway does not function in untreated SHR despite similar vasodepression. Long-term treatment with captopril restores this reflex pathway in SHR, lending support to the concept that angiotensin II is critically linked to heightened sympathetic nerve activity and abnormal sodium metabolism in this strain.", 
    "719": "1. Functional recordings of smooth muscle tension and biochemical experiments on membrane fractions were performed to characterize angiotensin II (AII) formation in human isolated bladder smooth muscle. 2. A novel human chymase inhibitor CH 5450 (Z-Ile-Glu-Pro-Phe-CO2Me) and a recently developed human chymase substrate Pro11-,D-Ala12)-angiotensin I, claimed to be resistant to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase, were used. 3. Angiotensin I (AI) (0.3 microM) induced a contractile response amounting to 58 +/- 5% (n=12) of the initial K+ (124 mM)-induced contractions. This response was reduced to 36 +/- 3% (n=8) by the ACE-inhibitor enalaprilat (10 microM), while pretreatment with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI 200 microg ml(-1)) or CH 5450 (10 microM) had no effect. However, the combination of enalaprilat and STI reduced the AI-induced contractions to 19 +/- 5% (n=6), and the combination of enalaprilat and CH 5450 caused an almost complete inhibition of the AI-induced contractions to 1+/-1% (n=6). 4. The substrate (Pro11-,D-Ala12)-AI (3 microM) produced contractions which amounted to 57 +/- 4% (n=13) of the initial K+ (124 mM) contractions. These contractions were not affected by enalaprilat (10 microM). On the other hand, STI (200 microg ml(-1)) and CH 5450 (10 microM) added separately, depressed the (Pro11-,D-Ala12)-AI-induced contractions to 34 +/- 5% (n=6) and 24 +/- 4% (n=6), respectively. The combination of enalaprilat and STI or enalaprilat and CH 5450 did not produce any further inhibition. 5. Experiments with detrusor membrane fractions incubated with AI (50 microM) were performed. In the presence of enalaprilat (100 microM), carboxypeptidase inhibitor CPI (10 microg ml(-1)) and aprotinin (15 microM), CH 5450 (10 nM-1 microM) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of AII formation. 6. The results confirm that AII is a potent contractile agent in the human isolated detrusor muscle. They also indicate that the serine protease responsible for AII formation in the human bladder in vitro is human chymase or an enzyme similar to human chymase."
