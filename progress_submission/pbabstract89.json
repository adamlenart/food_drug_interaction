    "0": "A comprehensive analysis of the reporting of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events has been conducted on 2,010 patients treated with quinapril hydrochloride. An analysis of all events (from both double-blind and open label studies combined) showed no increase in the incidence of events reported in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients compared to hypertensive patients. When the data for all studies were combined, an age analysis showed no increase in the total reporting of adverse events in the 379 elderly patients studied. The incidence of events was lower in those patients who did not take concomitant diuretic therapy. A comparison of the double-blind phases showed quinapril to have a lower incidence of adverse events than captopril, enalapril, or chlorthalidone. An analysis of the onset of events, or withdrawals, did not show an increase with time on quinapril therapy, and no dose-relationship. A review of serious adverse events did not reveal an unexpected occurrence or a high incidence of serious events considered to be related to quinapril therapy. The proportion of patients who experienced \"first-dose\" hypotension, or symptomatic hypotension was similar to captopril or enalapril. Quinapril, a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, has been extensively studied and is equally well tolerated in the young and elderly for the treatment of hypertension and CHF.", 
    "1": "The results of this multicenter double-blind comparative study in 172 patients with moderate to severe hypertension indicate that twice daily quinapril (20-80 mg/day) is significantly more effective than captopril (50-200 mg/day) at reducing blood pressure. Following a minimum of four weeks of treatment, the results in evaluable patients showed a significantly greater reduction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the quinapril group than in the captopril group (18.6 vs 15.3 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). An intent-to-treat analysis using blood pressure data from all patients having values within an eight-to-sixteen-hour postdose treatment window showed quinapril to produce a significantly greater reduction in DBP than captopril (18.2 vs 14.8 mm Hg, respectively, p = less than 0.05). Throughout the course of the six-week study, quinapril consistently showed efficacy superior to captopril despite a faster captopril dose titration.", 
    "2": "Quinapril HCl is a novel, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The Study Group evaluated its efficacy (20, 40, 80 mg daily with forced dose titration determination at trough blood pressure) once daily versus twice daily versus placebo, as well as its tolerability and safety, in 270 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO Stages I and II, sitting diastolic blood pressure [DPB] greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg), for twelve weeks. Reductions in DBP of up to 13 mm Hg were obtained, and in full dosage more than 65% of patients achieved a reduction in DBP of 10 mm Hg or more from baseline or reduced their DBP to 90 mm Hg or less. Quinapril was well tolerated, and reported adverse effects were scarcely more frequent than in the placebo group. Once daily doses of quinapril were as safe and effective as twice-daily doses. Quinapril is likely to exhibit good therapeutic utility in the management of essential hypertension.", 
    "3": "Quality of life issues have become increasingly important in tailoring antihypertensive therapy to individual patients. The application of quality of life data to the practice setting is frequently difficult, however. The effective use of this information requires an understanding of its definition and measurement, as well as of study methods. Quality of life findings may be specific to particular disease states, patient populations, and pharmacologic agents. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to concurrent methyldopa, propranolol, or captopril therapy has been reported to reduce patients' overall sense of well-being. beta-Adrenergic blockers may exert either positive or negative effects on quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have positive effects on quality of life; however, the cost of therapy is an important consideration. Information on calcium antagonists is limited. The findings of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) may eventually provide comparative quality of life data on the four first-line antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "4": "The pharmacologic therapy of mild primary hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 105 mm Hg) has effectively reduced hypertensive arteriolar end organ disease such as cerebrovascular accidents, congestive heart failure, and nephropathy, but there has been no convincing evidence that coronary heart disease (CHD) or its complications, acute myocardial infarction or angina, have been reduced. The risks of therapy with certain antihypertensive drugs may outweigh their treatment benefits as it relates to CHD. The optimal treatment strategy should be to reduce all CHD risk factors, reverse the hemodynamic abnormalities present by lowering the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), preserving cardiac output (CO) and perfusion, and to select the best antihypertensive drug for concomitant medical diseases or problems while maintaining a good quality of life. Antihypertensive drugs that have favorable or neutral effects on CHD risk factors include alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, central alpha agonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On the other hand, diuretics and beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have unfavorable effects on many CHD risk factors. Baseline and serial evaluation of the effects of these drugs on serum lipids, lipid subfractions, glucose, uric acid, electrolytes, exercise tolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, blood pressure, SVR, CO, perfusion, concomitant diseases, and side effects is necessary to evaluate overall cardiovascular risk.", 
    "5": "Between 45 and 60% of elderly persons have mild to moderate hypertension. In those with combined systolic/diastolic hypertension, blood pressure reduction significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Secondary causes of hypertension, particularly renovascular, should be considered in elderly patients with a recent history of hypertension. Because of their proven efficacy and low cost, low-dose thiazide diuretics remain an important first-line therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blocking agents have also been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in the elderly. Increased attention is being paid to adverse drug effects and to the overall effect of antihypertensive therapy on quality of life. ACE inhibitors are particularly attractive in the elderly due to their possibilities in this area. In the elderly, the combination of a low-dose thiazide diuretic with an ACE inhibitor enhances antihypertensive efficacy while blunting the adverse metabolic effects of the diuretic.", 
    "6": "The effect of a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, calcium (-)-N-[(S)-3-[(N-cyclohexylcarbonyl-D-alanyl)thio]-2-methylpropionyl+ ++]-L- prolinate (MC-838, altiopril calcium), on systemic blood pressure (SBP) and tissue ACE activity has been examined in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). MC-838 (3 mg kg-1) given orally to SHRs elicited a long-lasting hypotension lasting over 24 h. With the development of the hypotension, MC-838 significantly reduced ACE activity in the lung, kidney and aorta, but not in the brain and heart. Suppression of plasma ACE and rise of plasma renin activity occurred only transiently at an earlier stage.", 
    "7": "1. Isolated perfused male Sprague-Dawley rat tail artery segments were used to investigate interactions between the alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist, doxazosin, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, using phenylephrine (PE) as the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist. 2. In concentrations of up to 10(-5) mol/L, enalaprilat had no effect on arterial responses to PE. 3. Doxazosin produced a concentration-dependent competitive alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism, yielding a mean pA2 value of 8.72. 4. In the continuous presence of 10(-6) mol/L enalaprilat, doxazosin with a pA2 value of 9.10 was a 2.4-fold more potent alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist than in the absence of enalaprilat. 5. These results are interpreted to indicate that endogenously produced angiotensin II can modulate the activity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "8": "1. Changes in heart rate were monitored in response to supramaximal electrical stimulation of the spinal sympathetic cardiac nerves in the pithed rat. 2. Submaximal positive chronotropic responses of the heart to stimulation (0.1-1.0 Hz) were inhibited after intravenous injection of the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonists B-HT 920 and xylazine, but not after the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist methoxamine. 3. The alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine or idazoxan but not the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, given intravenously, reduced the inhibitory effect of B-HT 920 on positive chronotropic responses to cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation. Neither yohimbine, idazoxan nor prazosin had any effect on positive chronotropic responses to nerve stimulation. 4. Desmethylimipramine (DMI) potentiated the increased heart rate during continuous stimulation of the cardiac nerves at 0.2 Hz. Responses to stimulation, at this frequency, were unaffected by yohimbine, either in the absence or presence of the neuronal uptake inhibitor, DMI. 5. Intravenous infusion of the angiotensin antagonist saralasin or injection of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had no significant effect, either on positive chronotropic responses to stimulation or on the inhibitory effects of B-HT 920. Positive chronotropic responses to stimulation were also unaffected by yohimbine in the presence of captopril, indomethacin, or indomethacin plus captopril. 6. Although presynaptic effects of alpha 2-agonists and their antagonists on cardiac nerve function were demonstrated, no evidence was obtained that prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoreceptors modulate transmission during continuous supramaximal firing at constant frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "1. The interaction between the vascular renin-angiotensin system and presynaptic beta-adrenoreceptors was examined in male and female normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, using the in vitro perfused mesentery preparation. 2. Enhancement of the pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation by isoprenaline was shown to be significantly greater in preparations from male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to corresponding preparations from normotensive Wistar rats. 3. In preparations from normotensive and hypertensive animals, the potentiating effect of isoprenaline was prevented by pretreatment with propranolol or ICI 118 551, but not atenolol, implicating a beta 2-adrenoreceptor. 4. Angiotensin II enhanced the responses to peripheral nerve stimulation in preparation from normotensive and hypertensive animals. Enhancement was significantly greater in preparations from hypertensive animals. 5. The potentiation caused by isoprenaline was blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist [Sar1-Ile8] angiotensin II, and by captopril. The potentiation following angiotensin II was unaffected by ICI 118 551. 6. These results suggest that stimulation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoreceptors activates a localized angiotensin II system. No significant differences in this facilitatory system were observed between male and female animals, but the potentiation caused by activation of this system was considerably greater in the spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "10": "In a 3-month prospective, single-blind, controlled trial, 38 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV were assigned to group E (n = 19): enalapril 5 mg/day in addition to the previous therapy with digitalis and diuretics, or group C (n = 19): continuation of the previous therapy. In group E, 79% of the patients improved by at least one NYHA functional class after 3 months. In group C, the functional class did not change and four patients died. The echocardiographically determined end-diastolic diameter of the left ventricle decreased in group E from 72 +/- 8 mm to 63 +/- 6 mm (p less than 0.001), and the scintigraphically determined ejection fraction of the left ventricle increased from 33 +/- 18% to 40 +/- 19% (p less than 0.002). In contrast, no significant change was found in group C. Plasma-renin activity increased in group E from 8.2 +/- 1.8 ng/ml h to 29.7 +/- 14 ng/ml h (p less than 0.001), and plasma aldosterone decreased from 47.7 +/- 7.6 ng/dl to 19.9 +/- 4.8 ng/dl (p less than 0.01). In group C no significant change occurred. Comparing the actual changes (deltas) of the NYHA functional class (p less than 0.02), end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction of the left ventricle, plasma-renin activity, and plasma aldosterone (p less than 0.0001), a significant difference between the two groups was found. Thus, low-dose enalapril resulted in a significant improvement of the NYHA functional class in patients with severe chronic heart failure, accompanied by an improvement in left ventricular function and a decrease in secondary aldosteronism.", 
    "11": "The effect of microbial status and presence of food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract on absorption of an orally administered antihypertensive drug [14C]-enalapril (1 mg/10 microCi/kg body weight) was studied in non-fasted and fasted germ-free (GF) and microbially-associated (MA) rats. The absorption was evaluated from blood samples taken 0.5, 2 and 4 h after the administration of enalapril. Drug levels in the lungs, liver, and duodenal mucosa were also measured by counting [14C]-radioactivities at 4 h after the drug administration. During the 4 h monitoring period enalapril was poorly absorbed in non-fasted rats as compared to fasted animals. In non-fasted rats, the absorption of enalapril was slightly slower in GF than in MA rats. In fasted rats, no difference was found between GF and MA animals. The results show that food in the GI tract substantially lowers or retards the absorption of enalapril in rats. The GF status of the GI tract, however, did not substantially affect the absorption of the ester-type drug enalapril.", 
    "12": "Since certain non-vascular angiotensin II (AII) receptors may be activated by angiotensin I (AI), and since sustained increase in AI levels accompanies chronic treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) which block conversion of AI to AII, the question of whether AI has significant biological effects is of clinical relevance. We therefore sought to develop an in vitro culture system in which effects of angiotensin I, independently of its conversion to AII, could be studied in cloned aortic vascular endothelial cells (VEC). This was complicated by peptide degradation during the period of observation, both by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on the surface of VEC and by angiotensinases in either the serum component of culture media or associated with the cell monolayer. Accordingly, we examined the half life of AI under relevant cell culture conditions, with and without confluent fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells (FBAEC). Factors assessed included (1) fetal calf serum: commercial source, concentration in culture media, effects of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI: MK422) and/or heat inactivation (superimposed on the commercially performed process); and (2) effect of FBAEC in monolayer culture, with and without CEI. Results showed that (1) in the absence of cells, loss of AI in culture media, when present, was solely due to the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) and showed a dose dependent response; (2) FCS from differing sources may vary dramatically in capacity for AI breakdown; and (3) serum related AI disappearance included a heat resistant ACE like component (inhibitable by CEI) and a heat sensitive/CEI resistant component dominant at concentrations of FCS exceeding 5%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "To assess the suitability of therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for older hypertensives, a randomised double blind two group comparison of enalapril (10 to 40 mg daily) with hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 100 mg daily) was carried out in 32 untreated and independently living subjects aged 63 to 82 years with pressures on screening greater than 100 mmHg diastolic or greater than 180 mmHg systolic and after two weeks on placebo greater than 90 mmHg diastolic or greater than 160 mmHg systolic. Twenty-five subjects completed the ten weeks of active treatment with the majority in both groups reaching target blood pressures. Four subjects on enalapril and three on hydrochlorothiazide withdrew because of side effects. Eighteen of the 32 patients volunteered troublesome symptoms they attributed to therapy, which in some instances were alleviated by reductions in drug dosage. Small but significant falls in plasma potassium and sodium and increases in plasma urea and uric acid were seen on hydrochlorothiazide only. It was concluded that although in most cases good blood pressure control can be achieved by enalapril with some advantages over other drugs in the elderly, the potential for adverse effects remains significant. Halving usual starting doses of this and other antihypertensives may help to minimise problems in older subjects.", 
    "14": "Using a prospective randomised double-blind crossover design, the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril compared to a placebo was studied in 18 normotensive, normoalbuminuric Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic children. Each patient had a high normal or clearly elevated glomerular filtration rate (145 ml.min-1.1.73 m2 or higher) in the 6 months prior to the study. Enalapril, 0.5 mg.kg-1.day-1, was given for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks, or vice versa. At the end of each period, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and converting enzyme activity were determined. Enalapril caused significant reduction (p = less than 0.001) in blood pressure and converting enzyme activity and a rise in plasma renin activity. A slight but not significant rise in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction was observed. These data suggest that the renin angiotensin system is not involved in the glomerular hyperfiltration of Type 1 diabetes, and can be interpreted as showing no evidence for the presence of intraglomerular hypertension in these patients.", 
    "15": "We have developed marmoset models for the in vivo evaluation of primate-specific inhibitors of human renin. After acute intravenous administration to normotensive sodium-depleted marmosets, renin inhibitors of different structural types induced a maximum hypotensive response of a magnitude similar to that induced after angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The response was prevented by pretreatment with an ACE inhibitor. A close relationship between the inhibition of plasma renin activity (PRA) and the fall in blood pressure was observed with most of the inhibitors. CGP 29,287, a synthetic renin inhibitor, and R-3-36-16, a monoclonal antibody, both induced a selective increase in renal blood flow similar to that induced by an ACE inhibitor. A sustained reduction in blood pressure was observed during continuous administration of CGP 29,287 or R-3-36-16 over 14 days, despite an increase in immunoreactive renin and an apparent recovery of PRA. A similar blood pressure fall and an increase in plasma renin was observed during continuous administration of an ACE inhibitor. The renin inhibitor CGP 29,287 also lowered blood pressure after acute administration to hypertensive marmosets with normal PRA. Our studies demonstrate that renin inhibitors have similar haemodynamic effects to ACE inhibitors, and indicate that they may have a similar antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "16": "MK-0521 and captopril were orally administered to acute (6 to 8 days after unilateral renal artery constriction) and chronic (2 to 2.5 months after the constriction) 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs for 7 to 21 days. MK-0521 lowered the blood pressure to similar extents in the acute and chronic stages of hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of MK-0521 was dose-dependent and persistent even after its cessation. Captopril also produced an antihypertensive effect, although the effect in the chronic stage of hypertension was less prominent than that in the acute stage of hypertension. MK-0521 was more inhibitory on the renin-angiotensin system than captopril. In the acute stage of hypertension, the dogs treated with MK-0521 had increased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, while they had decreased plasma angiotensin II level and elevated plasma angiotensin I level and plasma renin activity. These results clarified the inhibitory effect of MK-0521 on ACE. In contrast, in the chronic stage of hypertension, MK-0521 showed no depression of plasma angiotensin II. There were no significant changes in daily urinary volume, and renal clearances of sodium, potassium and creatinine. These results suggest that the major mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of MK-0521 in 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs is an inhibition of the ACE. In addition, the different effects in the acute and chronic hypertensive dogs suggest that some differences exist in the mechanisms of maintaining blood pressure between the two stages of 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs.", 
    "17": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of MK-0521 in dogs and the effects of its single oral administration on blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin system in 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs were compared with those of captopril and MK-421. MK-0521 at 0.001-0.1 mg/kg, i.v., or 0.01-1 mg/kg, p.o., attenuated the pressor effect of angiotensin I without affecting that of angiotensin II and augmented the depressor effect of bradykinin. The potency of MK-0521 to reduce the pressor effect of angiotensin I was 9.8 times that of captopril by intravenous administration, and by oral administration, it was 15.9-32.1 times that of captopril and approximately 3 times that of MK-421. When administered orally, the onset of action and the time to peak effectiveness were more rapid than those of MK-421, but slower than those of captopril. Duration of the action of MK-0521 was longer than that of captopril and equal or longer than that of MK-421. The inhibition of ACE was well correlated with serum MK-0521 levels. MK-0521 produced a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect in 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs at over 0.3 mg/kg, p.o., without affecting the heart rate. The antihypertensive effect of MK-0521 was persistent and approximately 3 times more potent than that of captopril. MK-0521 inhibited the serum ACE activity and increased the plasma renin activity, while it had a tendency to decrease plasma aldosterone level. These changes were parallel to the time course of the antihypertensive effect. These results suggest that the main mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of MK-0521 is the suppression of angiotensin II production due to the inhibition of the ACE.", 
    "18": "N-alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-lysyl-L-proline (MK-0521) is a new non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The present investigation describes its ACE and other enzymes inhibitory properties and compares it to those of captopril, MK-421 and MK-422 in vitro. MK-0521 inhibited rat pulmonary ACE by 50% (IC50) at a concentration of 3 nM and was 6.13 times more potent than captopril. The IC50 values of MK-421 and MK-422 against ACE were 2,000 nM and 3.5 nM, respectively. MK-0521 had practically no inhibitory activities against carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase B, leucine aminopeptidase, papain, pepsin and trypsin. The kinetic study on the inhibitory activity of M-0521 against ACE using Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that MK-0521 exerted competitive ACE inhibition. The dialysis study conducted on the ACE-MK-0521 complex revealed that the inhibitory effect of MK-0521 against ACE was reversible. In the guinea pig ileum, MK-0521 potentiated the contractile effect of bradykinin and depressed the contractile effect of angiotensin I. These effects on bradykinin and angiotensin I were 33.11 and 2.63 times more potent than that of captopril, respectively. The present results suggest that MK-0521 may show a potent hypotensive effect in vivo.", 
    "19": "1. Enalapril was given in the drinking water (300 mg/L) for 4.5 days to normotensive (N) and genetically hypertensive (GH) rats on zero sodium intake. An intraperitoneal NaCl load was given 12 h after enalapril was started. 2. Enalapril did not increase the maximum rate of sodium excretion, but caused the rats to excrete more than the load in the first 24 h and then to have a slow fall in body sodium while on a sodium-free diet. 3. In terms of the Strauss et al. (1958) concept of body sodium, enalapril appears to lower the basal level. However, in addition it causes a slow leak of sodium which becomes apparent when sodium intake is very low.", 
    "20": "1. The pharmacokinetics of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in rat heart and lung was evaluated in vitro and ex vivo. 2. Radioinhibitor [125I]-351A binding displacement was used to assess the relative potency of six ACE-inhibitors (CI906, CGS14831, S9780, 351A, MK521, SQ27519) in rat heart and lung homogenates, and estimate equilibrium association constant (Ka). 3. Following oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg of Quinapril (CI928) specific binding of [125I]-351A to ACE was measured in rat heart. 4. Ka for binding to ACE of each inhibitor was significantly higher in right and left atrium than in lung (P less than 0.05) or the right and left ventricle (P less than 0.005). These differences did not affect the degree or time course of inhibition in vivo in the rat myocardial ACE following Quinapril treatment. 5. Rank order of potency of the ACE inhibitors tested was CI906 = CGS14831 greater than S9780 greater than 351A greater than MK521 greater than SQ27519", 
    "21": "The de novo hypertension, which develops in most cardiac transplant recipients within the first postoperative months, is multicausal, though toxic side-effects of cyclosporin A seem to play a key role. In order to analyze the circadian behavior of arterial blood pressure and heart rate after cardiac transplantation (HTX) and to evaluate the effect of an antihypertensive regimen on these parameters, 24-h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring was performed in 10 hypertensive cardiac transplant recipients on cyclosporin A (mean age 42.3 +/- 11.2 years, 14.3 +/- 8.3 months after HTX) before antihypertensive therapy and after introduction of an antihypertensive regimen with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril plus furosemide alone or combined with verapamil. The study demonstrated a complete loss of the usual nocturnal decline in blood pressure in cardiac transplant recipients (mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 149 +/- 8 and 102 +/- 7 mm Hg during daytime and 152 +/- 8 and 104 +/- 9 mmHg at night). Antihypertensive therapy lowered the blood pressure level effectively, but did not influence the circadian pattern (mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 121 +/- 8 and 81 +/- 4 mmHg during daytime and 121 +/- 9 and 83 +/- 3 mmHg at night, all p less than or equal to 0.001). Heart rate, in contrast, showed a significant, though in comparison to normal, a blunted decrease at night (mean heart rate 94 +/- 6 beats per min during daytime and 84 +/- 8 beats per min at night, p less than or equal to 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was localized in perfused trout gills by measuring gill extraction of two radiolabeled ACE inhibitors, 125I-351A (an iodinated derivative of lisinopril) and 3H-RAC-X-65, and by autoradiography of gills perfused with 125I-351A. A 125I-351A pulse was preferentially extracted by the arterio-arterial (AA) pathway (61.7% +/- 1.8% extraction; mean +/- SE, N = 4); the arteriovenous (AV) pathway extracted an additional 10%. Extraction by either pathway was reduced by simultaneous perfusion with 10(-5) M unlabeled lisinopril. AA extraction of RAC-X-65 during continuous perfusion was maximal (75% +/- 5%, N = 6) during the first few minutes of perfusion and decreased steadily to 38% +/- 9% by 20 min and to less than 10% by 40 min. AV extraction of RAC-X-65 was negligible. Autoradiography of gills continuously perfused with 125I-351A showed that the radiolabel was concentrated in the respiratory lamellae. The highest grain density was associated with the pillar cells nearest the medial (inner) lamellar margin. Afferent filamental arteries and afferent lamellar arterioles were labeled to a lesser extent. Relatively little label was found on the efferent lamellar arterioles or efferent filamental arteries. 125I-351A binding was not evident in AV vessels. These findings support the hypothesis that the gill is an important site for formation of plasma angiotensin II and they suggest that enzymes associated with mammalian endothelial cells are also common to gill pillar cells.", 
    "23": "1. We have investigated the effects of the non-renin-mediated actions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the progression of chronic renal failure accelerated by hypertension. For this purpose, we studied the effects of captopril (a thiol-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), enalapril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor without a thiol group) and cysteine (a thiol-containing amino acid which has no angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory action) in adriamycin-treated rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension, in which the renin-angiotensin system was suppressed. 2. There were no significant differences in blood pressure between these groups and the control group [adriamycin-treated group with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt loading, 206 +/- 7 mmHg (27.4 +/- 0.9 kPa) at week 10]. 3. Massive proteinuria occurred in all groups. At the end of the experiment (at week 10), urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced in the captopril and cysteine groups compared with the control group. No manifest improvements appeared in the enalapril group. 4. Levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increased progressively. At week 10, the increases in the serum levels of creatinine were less in the captopril (87 +/- 16 mmol/l) and cysteine (80 +/- 19 mmol/l) groups than in the control group (124 +/- 27 mmol/l) (P less than 0.01). No marked differences were found between the control and enalapril groups. 5. Captopril and cysteine caused more than a three-fold reduction in the focal glomerulosclerosis score when compared with that in the control group, but enalapril did not decrease the score. The extent of tubulointerstitial change was parallel with the focal glomerulosclerosis score. 6. We conclude that the thiol group is possibly involved in the mechanism of the beneficial effects of some angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the progression of chronic renal failure exacerbated by hypertension.", 
    "24": "We have previously demonstrated that thiol-containing collagen antagonists (penicillamine) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Captopril and CL242817) ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in irradiated rat lung. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the non-thiol ACE inhibitor CGS13945 also modifies radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats sacrificed 2 months after a single dose (0-30 Gy) of 60 Co gamma rays to the right hemithorax. The CGS13945 was administered in the feed continuously after irradiation at a regimen of 30 mg (kg body weight)-1 day-1. Four markers of lung endothelial function were monitored: ACE activity, plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. Right lung ACE and PLA activities decreased with increasing radiation dose, and CGS13945 significantly ameliorated both responses. Dose-reduction factors (DRF) for the inhibitor were 1.80 for ACE activity and 1.41 for PLA activity (p less than 0.05). In contrast, lung PGI2 and TXA2 production increased with increasing radiation dose, and CGS13945 did not influence either response significantly. Thus the ACE inhibitor CGS13945 modifies radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats, indicating that the presence of a thiol group is not essential for therapeutic efficacy in this class of compounds. On the other hand, CGS13945 exhibits a differential sparing of radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, as does penicillamine. A structure-function analysis of the present and previous data indicates that all of the ACE inhibitors tested (Captopril, CL242817 and CGS13945) spare the radiation-induced suppression in lung ACE and PLA activity; all of the thiol compounds tested (penicillamine, Captopril and CL242817) spare the radiation-induced elevation in lung PGI2 and TXA2 production; and the thiol ACE inhibitors (Captopril and CL242817) spare all four endothelial responses. These data confirm a novel and potentially important application for ACE inhibitors as modifiers of radiation-induced lung injury, and suggest that there are at least two components to their mechanism of therapeutic action in this model.", 
    "25": "This twenty-eight-week double-blind study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension showed quinapril (10, 20, and 40 mg/day) to be similarly effective to enalapril at the same doses in producing clinically significant reductions in sitting DBP. Hydrochlorothiazide could be safely added to quinapril therapy in nonresponders. Quinapril and enalapril were well tolerated. Both agents can safely be administered as first-line therapy.", 
    "26": "Quinapril is converted to quinaprilat, a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and is currently being studied for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In studies of healthy volunteers, single quinapril doses of 0.625 mg to 80 mg inhibited plasma ACE activity for up to forty-eight hours. Dose-related inhibition of angiotensin I pressor response occurred after administration of quinapril doses of 0.625 mg to 20 mg. In addition, plasma renin activity increased and aldosterone and angiotensin II concentrations decreased following single or multiple doses of quinapril. Subsequently, dose-ranging studies were conducted in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and congestive heart failure. Pilot studies suggested that 5 mg of quinapril given once daily had minimal antihypertensive effect. Therefore, a definitive, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 5, 10, and 20 mg once daily doses of quinapril was performed. Quinapril doses of 10 mg and 20 mg were statistically significantly superior to placebo (p less than 0.05) in lowering sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP), whereas 5 mg of quinapril had only marginal clinical effectiveness. A twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring study indicated that quinapril administered once or twice daily effectively lowered DBP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This study suggested, however, that some patients may not achieve sustained reductions in DBP over the entire twenty-four-hour interval with quinapril administered once daily and may require twice daily therapy. In studies of patients with refractory congestive heart failure, acute favorable hemodynamic effects were demonstrated after the administration of quinapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Quinapril is an orally active, non-peptide, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that acts potently and specifically to interrupt the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in both plasma and tissue. Quinapril is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active diacid form quinaprilat. Quinapril is efficacious in hypertensive models exhibiting both high (renal hypertensive rats, diuretic-treated dogs) and normal (spontaneously hypertensive rats) plasma renin activity. Quinapril does not prevent the development of hypertension when plasma renin activity (PRA) is markedly suppressed as in the deoxycorticosterone-saline treated rat. Hemodynamic studies in dogs indicate that quinapril decreases total peripheral and renal vascular resistance. Quinaprilat produces natriuresis and mild diuresis at doses that do not alter mean arterial blood pressure. Quinapril has the potential to affect plasma lipids beneficially or at least be \"lipid neutral.\" Oral absorption of quinapril is rapid in rats, dogs, and monkeys. There is rapid and extensive distribution of radiolabel to most tissues except brain. Plasma radiolabel concentration-time profiles exhibit polyexponential decay with a prolonged terminal phase at low concentrations in all species. Metabolism to compounds other than quinaprilat is not extensive. Quinapril is excreted primarily as quinaprilat and to a lesser degree as quinapril. Quinapril is well tolerated in a variety of pharmacologic safety screens and its toxicity profile is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Quinapril does not adversely affect reproduction; it is not teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The quantity of protein in the diet modulates glomerular function. To study the effect of dietary protein intake on glomerular eicosanoid production, rats were randomized to either a high- (40%) or low- (8.5%) protein isocaloric diet. Ten to fourteen days later glomeruli were isolated and incubated in the absence (basal) and presence (stimulated conditions) of arachidonic acid, and production rates of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha, and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were determined by direct radioimmunoassay. Under basal conditions, glomerular production of all three eicosanoids was significantly greater in rats ingesting the high-protein diet. Glomerular production of PGE2 and TxB2 was also greater in animals fed the high-protein diet in the presence of arachidonic acid, suggesting that glomerular cyclooxygenase activity was augmented. In contrast, ingestion of a high-protein diet was not associated with a significant increase in eicosanoid production by renal papillae or in TxB2 release by clotting blood. To investigate the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system in the dietary protein-induced modulation of glomerular eicosanoid production, rats ingesting a high- or low-protein diet were randomized to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or no therapy. Enalapril attenuated the dietary protein-induced augmentation in glomerular eicosanoid production. This effect occurred only when administered in vivo, since the active metabolite enalapril did not alter PGE2 production by isolated glomeruli when added in vitro. Dietary protein intake also modulated glomerular eicosanoid production in three models of experimental renal disease in the rat (streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, Heymann nephritis, and partial renal ablation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "A peptidyl dipeptidase-4 (bacterial PDP-4) was purified to near homogeneity from a supernatant of Pseudomonas maltophilia extracellular medium. Bacterial PDP-4 is a single-polypeptide-chain enzyme, 82 kDa, with an alkaline isoelectric point. Peptides susceptible to hydrolysis by bacterial PDP-4 include angiotensin 1, bradykinin, enkephalins, atriopeptin 2, and smaller synthetic peptides. N-acylated tripeptides are hydrolyzed, but free tripeptides are not. A free carboxy terminus is required for hydrolysis. Peptides with ultimate and penultimate Pro residues are not hydrolyzed. The enzyme does not require an anion for activity. Bacterial PDP-4 was inhibited by EDTA and the dipeptide Phe-Arg. Thiorphan was an inhibitor only at levels well above those required for inhibition of neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme for which thiorphan is specific. A second NEP and thermolysin inhibitor, phosphoramidon, did not inhibit bacterial PDP-4. The potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril was not inhibitory. Bacterial PDP-4 is distinguished from a similar enzyme from Escherichia coli, which is not susceptible to EDTA inhibition, and one from Corynebacterium equi, which hydrolyzes free tripeptides. These data indicate that the bacterial PDP-4 catalytic site is unlike those of other enzymes that function either wholly or in part as peptidyl dipeptidases.", 
    "30": "Short-term therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension is effective and well tolerated, and compared with beta blockers, may cause fewer adverse reactions. Furthermore, enalapril has been observed to have a greater effect on systolic blood pressure than beta blockers. We therefore decided to compare the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the beta blocker atenolol as monotherapy in a double-blind study of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "31": "After a four-week placebo run-in period, 162 patients were allocated randomly to receive atenolol (50 to 100 mg daily) or enalapril (20 to 40 mg daily) for 12 weeks. To assess the influence of these drugs on quality of life, a series of psychologic tests was performed, and a subset of patients also underwent treadmill exercise and pulmonary function tests.",

The modest blood pressure response to atenolol was not due to poor compliance. A target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or less was achieved by 35 percent of enalapril-treated atenolol (p less than 0.01). The frequency and severity of adverse effects with the two drugs were similar, and few important differences emerged from the quality-of-life assessments.",

    "34": "Patients with normal- or high-renin non-modulating essential hypertension fail to shift their adrenal sensitivity on a low sodium diet in response to an infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II). In a prior study, 72 hours of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) partially corrected this subnormal aldosterone response to Ang II in patients with non-modulating hypertension. Since it was uncertain whether the failure to restore normal adrenal responsiveness reflected a continued abnormality or an insufficient duration of CEI, the present study was performed wherein subjects were studied before CEI and then 72 hours and 6 weeks after CEI. Adrenal and renovascular responses were assessed in 13 subjects with normal- or high-renin hypertension in response to an infusion of Ang II (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 ng/kg/min) in balance on a 10 meq Na+/100 meq K+ diet. Eight of 13 had a normal plasma aldosterone increment above control levels (greater than or equal to 15 ng/dl) and were classified as modulators; the remaining subjects (five of 13) were classified as non-modulators. Enalapril was then administered for 72 hours and 6 weeks, and the assessment of the Ang II dose-response relations was repeated. In the modulators, there was no change compared with levels before CEI in the aldosterone dose-response curve or threshold sensitivity to infused Ang II at either 3 days or 6 weeks after CEI administration. In the non-modulators, CEI for 72 hours partially restored aldosterone responsiveness, but more prolonged CEI for 6 weeks completely corrected the defect, restoring aldosterone responsiveness on a sodium-restricted diet to that seen in modulators and in normotensive control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "35": "In order to study long term changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in chronic heart failure, plasma ANP levels were determined in rats after myocardial infarction due to coronary artery ligation and in sham-operated controls. In addition, effects of oral captopril treatment and sodium loading on plasma ANP were studied. In accordance with earlier reports plasma ANP paralleled both infarct size and signs of cardiac dysfunction. The highest plasma ANP levels were found in rats having over 45% of their left ventricle infarcted while rats with mild-to-moderate-size infarcts had only slightly elevated plasma ANP levels as compared with controls. These differences in plasma ANP levels between experimental and control groups remained remarkably stable during the three-month observation period. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated in infarcted rats but no differences could be found between rats with varying infarct sizes. Captopril treatment decreased the high plasma ANP levels in rats with the largest infarcts, probably by unloading the failing heart. During increased sodium intake, plasma ANP levels increased in sham-operated controls but not in rats with heart failure. Thus, sodium loading, as compared with cardiac insufficiency, appears to be a weak stimulus for ANP release in rats. I conclude that plasma ANP is a sensitive marker, better than PRA, in long term follow-up of cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "36": "A patient with congestive heart failure and mild renal impairment developed exfoliative dermatitis following the addition of captopril to her therapy. The skin reaction responded to drug withdrawal and the administration of corticosteroids, though the patient subsequently succumbed to the complications of an incidental myocardial infarction. Recognition and prompt treatment of this potentially fatal dermatological crisis is stressed. The newer generation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a lesser propensity for cutaneous complications.", 
    "37": "Renal function was studied before and after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in 79 patients. In a prospective study of 28 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, renal function was similar during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and after PTRA. In 37 patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses, 9 patients with solitary kidneys and renal artery stenoses and 5 patients with transplant renal artery stenoses, there was no statistical difference in the renal function before and after PTRA. Of the 79 patients studied, 50 had normal renal function before PTRA. In 5 of these renal function decreased, requiring temporary hemodialysis in 1. Of 29 patients with impairment of renal function due to renal artery stenosis, improvement was noted in 14, stabilization of renal function in 11, and decrease of renal function in 4. It is concluded that PTRA is a safe technique that can make life-long drug treatment unnecessary in antihypertensive patients. It can restore or stabilize renal function in renal insufficiency caused by renal artery stenosis. It has to be kept in mind that contrast medium toxicity and cholesterol embolization can induce severe renal insufficiency after PTRA.", 
    "38": "Left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension is associated with a decrease of coronary vascular reserve. We have previously shown that chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition prevents cardiac hypertrophy and improves coronary vascular reserve when the treatment is started before appearance of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). However, the effects of starting chronic ACE inhibition when hypertension was already developed is not known. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of chronic ACE inhibition on coronary vascular reserve and on the morphology of the coronary microvasculature when treatment was started after hypertension had developed. For this purpose, one group of SHR was treated from 3-8 months of age with cilazapril, a new ACE inhibitor, and compared with a group treated by placebo. At the end of treatment, cardiac hypertrophy, coronary vascular reserve, density and cross-sectional surface area of the myocardial capillaries (normalized for the myocardial mass) and wall/lumen ratio of the coronary arterioles were determined. Chronic ACE inhibition with cilazapril reduced cardiac hypertrophy and improved by more than 50% coronary vascular reserve in the left and right ventricles. In the left ventricle, the improvement was more pronounced in the subendocardium than in the subepicardium. Cilazapril increased the density and the cross-sectional surface area of the myocardial capillaries and decreased the wall/lumen ratio of the arterioles of the left ventricle. We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition can improve coronary vascular reserve, increase capillary density and capillary cross-sectional surface area and decrease the thickness of the media of coronary arterioles in SHR even when treatment is started after development of hypertension.", 
    "39": "We studied the acute and long-term effects of ramipril and captopril in 12 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure using an open, parallel design. Drug doses were titrated. Compared with baseline values, maximal haemodynamic and humoral effects after the first dose of both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were similar, but the effects of ramipril (5 mg) demonstrated a slower onset of action and a significantly longer duration than captopril (12.5 mg). After 3 months of treatment a single dose of 5 mg ramipril showed the same 24-hour haemodynamic profile as after the first dose, but the hypotensive effect was less marked. There was no plasma accumulation of ramiprilat. Serum creatinine and potassium remained stable, except for one patient whose renal function deteriorated on captopril treatment. Complex ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients and were unaffected after treatment with ramipril or captopril. Two patients died suddenly during ramipril therapy and one patient during captopril therapy. In summary, ramipril is an effective, long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, producing long-term haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure. Using an individualised dosage scheme, neither long-lasting hypotension nor deterioration of renal function occurred. No effect on ventricular arrhythmias was seen.", 
    "40": "Changes of neurohumoral factors including vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGs) were investigated in an experimental model of moderate low-cardiac-output status induced by rapid right ventricular pacing (240 beats/min). After 7 days of pacing, we studied the response of renal, hormonal, and hemodynamic parameters to cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin and the effects of the renin system by converting-enzyme blockade in addition to the inhibition of PG synthesis. Lowering cardiac output increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide. Plasma renin concentration was suppressed, despite a fall in cardiac output and blood pressure and a stimulation of sympathetic nerve activity. Urinary excretion of PGE2 was increased (P less than 0.04); plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were unchanged as measured in blood from the renal vein, pulmonary artery, and aorta. During low cardiac output, we found a significant decrease of glomerular filtration rate, whereas renal blood flow and renal and peripheral vascular resistances were unchanged. Administration of indomethacin decreased plasma and urinary PGs significantly, markedly reduced renal blood flow, and increased renal vascular resistance without affecting peripheral vascular resistance. The additional blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril showed mainly a vasodilator effect on peripheral arterial resistance vessels, resulting in an increase of cardiac output. Our results suggest that, in moderate low-cardiac-output status, renal blood flow is maintained by renal vasodilator PGs, which counterbalance vasoconstrictor mechanisms like the activated sympathetic nerve activity. We indirectly showed the importance of angiotensin II in preserving glomerular filtration rate, which declines when renin secretion is suppressed, as it may be the case in moderate heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Blood gaseous composition, mechanisms controlling hemoglobin affinity to oxygen and hemoglobin effects of a single captopril dose were assessed in 124 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). CHF-associated hypoxemia was shown to be mixed, with the circulatory component prevailing. Hemoglobin affinity to oxygen is increased in CHF, stage IIA, and reduced in CHF, stages IIB-III. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is the principal regulator of hemoglobin affinity to oxygen its blood level increasing progressively as CHF aggravates. Hemoglobin affinity to oxygen may be reduced by captopril in patients with CHF of stages I-IIA.", 
    "42": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular function were measured by means of the lithium clearance technique in 14 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) and eight patients with essential hypertension (EH) before and after oral administration of captopril 25 mg. In RVH captopril reduced 51-Cr-EDTA clearance (67.3 (median) to 47.5 ml min-1, P less than 0.01), proximal absolute reabsorption of fluid (53.9 to 41.5 ml min-1, P less than 0.01) and distal absolute reabsorption of sodium (2195 to 1402 mumol min-1, P less than 0.01), whereas proximal fractional reabsorption increased slightly (77.5 to 80.2%, P less than 0.02). In EH, however, these parameters were practically unaffected by captopril. In both RVH and EH plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were reduced after captopril, but atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma and urinary excretion rate of prostaglandin E2 were unchanged. Blood pressure decreased after captopril in both groups, but the maximum fall in systolic BP was more pronounced in RVH (22%) than EH (13%). It is concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition markedly reduced absolute reabsorption in both the proximal and distal tubules in RVH, in contrast to EH, predominantly due to fall in the GFR, and that the slight increase in proximal fractional reabsorption may be attributed to a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure in the peritubular vessels.", 
    "43": "The only effective management of life-threatening hypervolemia in course of terminal renal failure is dialysis or hemofiltration. Nonetheless we succeeded in attenuating hypervolemic pulmonary edema utilizing low doses of Captopril in three patients awaiting entry into the maintenance hemodialysis program. The drug added to diuretic and, in two cases, digitalis therapy enabled pharmacologic management of patients volume overload for 12-25 days before the dialysis treatment could be started. No further decline in renal function or other side effects of Captopril were encountered. We conclude that Captopril may be life-saving in settings requiring pharmacologic relief of uremic pulmonary edema.", 
    "44": "The tissue distribution of rat renin mRNA was examined. Sensitive RNase protection analyses demonstrated that renin mRNA are produced by the extra-renal tissues such as adrenal, brain, liver, lung, pituitary and testis. In response to sodium depletion and captopril treatment, the expression of mRNAs encoding rat renin were in a tissue-specific manner. The level of kidney renin mRNA remarkably increased in sodium-depleted rats treated with captopril, whereas that of brain renin mRNA definitely decreased. No significant change in the level of liver renin mRNA was observed after the same treatment. These results suggest that the expression of cerebral renin is regulated by physiological stimuli independent of its extra-cerebral expression.", 
    "45": "We have identified a substance in the rat heart which inhibits ACE. This substance was characterized to be a sulfhydryl (SH) protein, the SH moiety being essential for the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity disappeared when the extract was boiled, or the ultrafiltrate(mol.wt.less than 10,000) was used, or when the extract was pretreated with the SH-blocking agent 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitro benzoic acid) at 0.5mM or the SH oxidizing agent diamide at 1mM. This substance was fractionated with Thiopropyl Sepharose affinity chromatography, precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate saturation and high performance liquid chromatography. The mode of inhibition was competitive. In the presence of 20 micrograms/ml of this substance, the contraction of rat aortic strips induced by 5 x 10(-8)M ANG I was inhibited by 60%. This endogenous inhibitor of ACE may modulate the activity of ACE in the heart, in response to alterations in the oxidation-reduction balance in the tissue.", 
    "46": "BW-175 is a newly synthesized renin inhibitor which is a nonpeptidic, norleucine analog. Its IC50 values for renin activity in human, squirrel monkey, marmoset, dog, hog, rabbit and rat plasma were 3.3, 6.6, 2.4, 42, 110, 86 and 3500 nM, respectively, and 26 microM for cathepsin D. Pepsin and angiotensin converting enzyme were hardly inhibited at 10(-4) M. BW-175 showed an oral bioavailability of 2.8% at 10 mg/kg and 9.7% at 30 mg/kg in rats. In normotensive, furosemide-treated high-renin marmosets, BW-175 (30 mg/kg p.o.) caused an intensive reduction in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I formation, associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10-20 mm Hg for 2 hours.", 
    "47": "The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in heart failure provide an explanation of why drugs often fail to improve the prognosis while providing symptomatic relief. An understanding of these mechanisms should allow a more rational approach to therapy.", 
    "48": "An effect of enalapril maleate on the activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic reactivity, erythrocyte prostaglandin and sodium levels as well as blood beta-endorphin was investigated in 28 patients with the essential arterial blood hypertension. It was found that enalapril maleate significantly increased plasma renin activity, decreased plasma norepinephrine and its 24-hour excretion, and decreased erythrocyte beta-endorphin and sodium levels. Blood epinephrine and aldosterone levels and their daily excretion remained unchanged similarly to prostaglandins. The above results suggest that a decrease in sympathetic system activity and intracellular sodium concentration may play a role in the hypotensive action of enalapril maleate related to the inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "49": "Perindopril, a perhydroindole compound and a novel class of angiotensin convertase inhibitor, after oral administration leads to an active metabolite by de-esterification of an ethyl ester. Routine biological measurements are currently done using a radioimmunological assay, but a mass fragmentographic method was developed using plasma spiked with the drugs, which were then derivatized to the isobutyl ester heptofluorobutyramide and assayed using ammonia negative chemical ionization. Levels of 100 pg/ml were assayed. However, isobutanol derivatization provoked partial transesterification of the ethyl ester of the parent drug into the diisobutyl ester derivative, which corresponds to the active metabolite. A second method of derivatization to stable trimethylsilyl esters preserved the original ethyl ester of the parent drug. Despite the lower ionization yields, the mass fragmentographic method was sensitive and accurate enough to work satisfactorily at the 2 ng/ml level in spiked plasma, which is the level found currently in patients.", 
    "50": "Hypertension was developed in 5-week-old male rats fed a low calcium diet, which evokes hypocalcemia and nutritional hyperparathyroidism, for 2 weeks. Blood pressure returned to normal after changing to a normal calcium diet. These changes of blood pressure were preceded by changes of calcium levels in plasma. In parathyroidectomized rats receiving a normal calcium diet, blood pressure did not rise, though the plasma calcium level decreased to a similar extent as in rats fed the low calcium diet. These findings seem to indicate that hyperparathyroidism, not hypocalcemia, is involved in the elevation of blood pressure in rats fed a low calcium diet. The elevated blood pressure was reduced by a calcium antagonist, nifedipine, but not by an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, captopril. This may indicate that hypertension due to nutritional hyperparathyroidism responds to the calcium antagonist nifedipine and calcium supplementation, and is not dependent on renin.", 
    "51": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like indomethacin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors like captopril have contrasting effects on compensatory changes in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow following partial nephrectomy. Conjoint treatment has been little studied. Effects of 7 days of treatment with captopril, indomethacin, or captopril + indomethacin in drinking water were studied in 50% nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats. Urinary protein excretion, glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), mean arterial pressure, renal vascular resistance, and remnant kidney weight were measured. Renal clearance studies were performed using a double-isotope, single-injection method, in conscious rats infused with either saline or saline + prostaglandin E1. Indomethacin induced significant (p less than 0.05) increases in renal vascular resistance (RVR) which were attenuated by either concurrent treatment with captopril or infusion of PGE1 at the time of study. Compensatory growth of the remnant kidney appeared not to be dependent on increments in renal blood flow; captopril decreased RVR and increased ERPF but had no effect on kidney weight, while indomethacin had no effect on ERPF and augmented remnant kidney weight. It appears effects of captopril and indomethacin on intrarenal hemodynamics in the residual kidney were counteractive, and that conjoint therapy in renal disease should be approached with caution.", 
    "52": "Captopril, an angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was evaluated for potential antidepressive activity on the forced swim-induced behavioral despair (immobility) test in mice. Captopril (10.0 and 30.0, mg/kg ip) significantly reduced immobility and mimicked the effects of the antidepressants imipramine (30.0 mg/kg, ip) and mianserin (3.0, 10.0, and 30.0 mg/kg, ip). Captopril increased the motor activity of mice at these same dosages. Naloxone (2.0 mg/kg, ip) blocked the effects of captopril (30.0 mg/kg, ip) in the swim test. These data suggest that captopril has potential antidepressive activity. However, the conclusion is guarded, as the positive effects may be related to motor stimulation. The blockade of the captopril effects by naloxone suggests that brain opioid peptides play a role in this behavioral effect of captopril.", 
    "53": "In a group of 269 untreated hypertensive patients the effect of a single oral dose of captopril (25 mg) on blood pressure was studied for 90-120 minutes. The systolic blood pressure decreased by more than 20% in 9.5% and by more than 30% in 1.1% of the patients. In 22.6% the diastolic blood pressure decreased by more than 20%; in 4.5% it fell more than 30%. The calculated mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by more than 20% in 12.3% of the patients and by more than 30% in 3%. Three patients showed transient neurological deficits. Factors related to a strong blood pressure drop were: renal artery disease and resistant hypertension. However, a potentially dangerous fall in blood pressure, i.e. an acute fall of MAP of over 30%, was also observed in the absence of these risk factors. Therefore not all patients at risk can be identified in advance, and treatment with ACE-inhibitors has to be started under well-controlled circumstances especially in elderly patients.", 
    "54": "To investigate the pharmacokinetics of benazepril hydrochloride in special populations, single or multiple doses between 5 and 20 mg of the new drug were given, and the pharmacokinetics of unchanged benazepril and its pharmacologically active metabolite benazeprilat were compared with those in healthy male volunteers. In elderly subjects and patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency, there was little change in the kinetics of benazepril or benazeprilat. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min), benazeprilat elimination was slowed, which resulted in greater accumulation after repeated dosing. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, the kinetics and bioavailability of benazeprilat were not affected. Therefore dose adjustment is unnecessary because of the patient's age, mild or moderate renal impairment, or hepatic cirrhosis. Dose reduction is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min.", 
    "55": "The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs requires evaluation in clinical trials, the design of which must minimize variability (observer or patient) and order effects, eliminate bias, and include sufficient numbers of patients (i.e., have sufficient power) to allow real differences in blood pressure between patient groups to be detected at conventional levels of statistical significance. The crossover design of trial requires the successive examination of different treatments. This may result in a lengthy trial for the participant and an increase in the dropout rate. Therefore the parallel group design is usually performed for a comparison of several active drugs or drugs and placebo. This design avoids the potential problems of order and carryover effects, and when of a long duration, takes into account short-term and longer term responses to drugs. Crossover trials with limited periods of treatment for each phase can be carried out with fewer numbers of subjects and are more economical of patient resources. However, care must be taken to correct for order effects by appropriate design and to exclude carryover effects. Usually such a design only allows the investigator to comment on short-term blood pressure responses. The extrapolation of such information for longer term use of the drugs in clinical practice requires much caution.", 
    "56": "We introduce a new method for determining pharmacophore or active site geometries by analysis of the structures of a series of active compounds. The method, constrained search, and the key concepts on which it is based, is described and illustrated by its application to 28 potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The data set is one utilized by Mayer et al. [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 1 (1987) 3-16] to determine a unique geometry for the active site. Our experiment validated the previously reported results, obtained by a systematic search, while reducing the computer time requirement by more than two orders of magnitude. The experiment also identified a previously unrecognized alternative active site geometry for the ACE series.", 
    "57": "Since the therapeutic advances prolong survival of many patients suffering from cardiovascular pathology--the prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF) had just doubled, being a common entity in a world whose individuals present a great increase in longevity. These considerations justify the renewed interest in this particular syndrome. Concepts, pathophysiology and compensatory mechanisms are briefly summarized, putting emphasis on the advantage of pharmacologically interrupt the vicious loop of the compensatory mechanisms, that could play a deleterious role in the syndrome. Neurohormonal responses and the \"pivotal\" role of angiotensine II in CHF pathology are also discussed, emphasizing the benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) when treating patients presenting heart failure. Questions addressed to its prescription at an early stage, (classes II and III of NYHA--to prevent the progressive exhaustion of the failing heart) are also considered. When approaching the preventive measures in a wide perspective, primary, secondary and tertiary types of preventive options are described. ACEI use for the least advanced clinical stages of CHF (class II and III) would represent a tertiary type of CHF prevention.", 
    "58": "The writhing reaction in mice induced by kaolin, a factor XII activator, was studied. An intraperitoneal injection of kaolin clearly induced a writhing reaction in a dose-dependent fashion, and the reaction disappeared about 10-15 min later. The writhing reaction reached a peak at 5-10 min after the injection of kaolin (0.5 ml/mouse, i.p.; 5 mg/ml saline). A simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 2.5 mg/mouse) almost completely suppressed the writhing reaction caused by kaolin (2.5 mg/mouse) for the first 10 min. The kaolin-induced writhing reaction was markedly potentiated by a simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of captopril (50 micrograms/mouse). At 60 min after kaolin injection during the disappearance of the writhing reaction, the reaction reappeared when captopril was injected, but reactions observed at this later stage were completely blocked by SBTI. Indomethacin, ibuprofen and alminoprofen inhibited the writhing reaction dose-dependently. Kaolin thus induces a clear and reproducible writing reaction, which might be mainly dependent on the action of bradykinin via activation of factor XII, and should prove to be a simple and convenient model of bradykinin-induced pain for the assessment of analgesic actions.", 
    "59": "The antihypertensive effects of nisoldipine, a calcium channel blocker, and atenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, were compared in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs produced significant reductions in blood pressure from the 8th week through the end of the 12-week treatment period. The hear rate decreased significantly in the atenolol group but not in the nisoldipine group. Following oral administration of 50 mg of captopril, the rise in plasma renin activity was significantly smaller in both treatment groups than in normotensive controls. The magnitude of the pressor response during a hand-grip test tended to be smaller in both groups of patients than in the controls, with no significant difference between the treated groups. Although the plasma catecholamine concentration rose significantly in the control and nisoldipine groups, there were no significant intergroup differences in these parameters. The hemoglobin, GOT, creatinine, total cholesterol and serum sodium and potassium concentrations all decreased significantly in the nisoldipine group, although the values remained within normal limits. These results indicate that both nisoldipine and atenolol significantly suppress both plasma renin activity and the pressor response to stress leading to reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "60": "The therapeutic effect of captopril in treating mild to moderate arterial hypertension has been evaluated in 20 patients. During 15 days patients underwent a washout period. Patients then received a single dose of 50 mg of captopril by mouth per day during 4 weeks. Before and after treatment, blood pressure (BP) was continuously monitored during 24 hours by a Pressure Holter (Spacelabs Monitor 5300). Mean baseline 24 hour record BP was 152 +/- 24/94 +/- 17 mmHg and after one month treatment both diastolic and systolic pressures significantly decreased to 145 +/- 16/87 +/- 13 mmHg (p less than 0.001). No adverse effects were reported during treatment.", 
    "61": "The mechanism involved in the genesis of the rat paw oedema caused by intraplantar (IPL) injection of Bothrops jararaca venom (BJV) has been investigated. IPL injection of BJV (1 to 30 micrograms/paw) caused a dose- and time-related oedematogenic effect. Oedema was maximal within 1 h after BJV injection, was partially reduced at 6 h and disappeared completely within 24 h. No systemic effect was observed. Previous heating of BJV at 100 degrees C for 3 to 30 min caused a significant inhibition (25%) of its oedematogenic activity. Daily IPL injections of BJV (10 micrograms/paw) for 4 days attenuated BJV-induced oedema (26%), but did not influence oedema-induced by PAF-acether, serotonin (5-HT) and histamine (His), indicating the absence of cross desensitization. In the paw desensitized by daily IPL injections of PAF-acether, BJV induced a full oedematogenic response also indicating absence of cross desensitization. Different groups of drugs including alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin and yohimbine), inhibitors of both cyclo- and lipo-oxygenase (indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid), inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (dexamethasone and mepacrine) caused marked inhibition of BJV-induced rat paw oedema, whereas antagonists of 5-HT, PAF-acether and H1-histamine receptors were less effective. Pre-treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, a Ca2+ channel blocker and a H2-histamine antagonist failed to affect BJV-induced oedema. Pre-treatment of the animals with captopril did not interfere with BJV-induce oedema, suggesting that kinins are not insolved in the genesis of oedema. Association of BJV with 5-HT and PAF did not potentiate the BJV-induced oedema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "The role of endogenous renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of spontaneous myocardial fibrosis in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats was examined by long-term inhibition of endogenous angiotensin II production. For this purpose captopril, angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), was given at 30 or 100 mg/kg/day mixed with commercial powdered standard diet (CE-2, Japan Clea Co., Tokyo) for 52 weeks. Myocardial lesions consisting of focal fibrosis and minute necrotic foci of muscle cells intermingled with monocytic infiltration appeared preferentially in the subendocardial areas of the left ventricle. The incidence of myocardial fibrosis was very low in female rats, but in male rats, the incidence and severity of the lesion was significantly reduced in the captopril-treated groups than in the control group. These findings suggest that endogenous angiotensin II acts as a facilitatory effect on the pathogenesis of spontaneous myocardial lesion which can be effectively reduced by long-term administration of nontoxic dose of ACEI. The authors speculate that ACEI may have a therapeutic use in clinical cases of idiopathic myocarditis.", 
    "63": "A 25 year old male had an abdominal aortic aneurysm involving bilateral renal arteries. Aortography revealed no irregularity in the aortic wall but a slight kinking at the tenth thoracic level followed by a fusiform aneurysm. Computed tomography (CT) showed an enlarged aortic lumen with an intraluminal thrombus. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was markedly increased (11 ng/ml/h), and the administration of captopril caused a further increase in PRA with a significant reduction in blood pressure, indicating the presence of renovascular hypertension. Abdominal aneurysm in a young adult is very rare. The etiology of the aneurysm appears to be idiopathic.", 
    "64": "1. Six competitive bradykinin (Bk) antagonists were tested for their agonistic properties on the rat uterus. Five of these peptides showed agonistic effects only at concentrations at least two orders of magnitude higher than those of bradykinin. 2. The antagonistic potency of Lys-Lys-3-Hyp-5,8-Thi-7-DPhe-Bk (B4310) in the rat uterus (pA2 = 7.24) and in the rat duodenum (pA2 = 7.31) was very similar to that determined in an earlier study for the antagonism of the bradykinin-induced stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in the rabbit iris sphincter muscle preparation (pA2 = 7.59). 3. The fall in mean arterial blood pressure induced by i.a. injections of bradykinin was greatly reduced during an i.a. infusion of B4310, but not 10 min thereafter, which indicates a rapid inactivation of B4310 in vivo. Bacitracin possibly interferes with the enzymatic cleavage of B4310 but seems to have no effect on the degradation of bradykinin. 4. An i.a. infusion of captopril greatly enhanced the potency of bradykinin in inducing a fall in arterial blood pressure, confirming the important role of angiotensin converting enzyme in the cleavage of bradykinin. However, the design of this experiment did not allow conclusions about the effect of captopril on the degradation of B4310. 5. B4310 incubated with rat lung tissue disappeared from the incubation medium within a few minutes, i.e. as fast as bradykinin, which explains its short duration of action in vivo. Captopril partially inhibited the cleavage of both bradykinin and B4310. 6. The present results show that the bradykinin antagonists available at present are useful tools for the investigation of the biological role of bradykinin. However, the susceptibility to enzymatic degradation may limit their usefulness in animal experiments or in clinical studies.", 
    "65": "The use of captopril in heart failure and hypertension is becoming increasingly accepted. Captopril has a sulphydryl group in its molecular structure. We wondered if this might confer free radical scavenging activity on the drug and have investigated this in an in vitro system. Results show that captopril is a free radical scavenger and we suggest that this action might be relevant in its use in heart failure and other vascular diseases.", 
    "66": "1. Thirty-eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (seated diastolic 95-110 mm Hg) were randomized double-blind to treatment with either zofenopril (n = 19) or hydrochlorothiazide (n = 19) over a period of 12 weeks. 2. Office blood pressure, heart rate, side effects and metabolic changes were assessed at the end of the run-in period on placebo and after 4, 8, 12 weeks treatment at the same time, 22-24 h after the last dosing. Ambulatory recordings over 14 h (8 h to 22 h) were performed at the end of placebo period and after active treatment for 12 weeks. 3. The two regimes reduced office blood pressures equally with minimal additional effect seen on increasing the dose. Both zofenopril and hydrochlorothiazide lowered average baseline ambulatory blood pressure, but zofenopril had greater efficacy in reducing BP during some working hours. 4. Adverse reactions were mild and transient with both drugs. There were no significant changes in laboratory values. 5. Thus hydrochlorothiazide and zofenopril given once daily at low dosage both reduce office and ambulatory blood pressures and are well tolerated.", 
    "67": "The physiological role of inactive renin, especially the question of whether and how a conversion to active renin takes place in vivo, remains controversial. In order to show the dynamic alterations from inactive to active renin following acute ACE-inhibition, both forms of renin were investigated in both renal veins and the peripheral circulation of 20 patients with essential hypertension and 20 patients with renovascular hypertension before and 1 h after 25 mg of captopril. Active and inactive renin were determined indirectly as plasma renin activity (PRA, unit: ng/ml x h). In vitro activation of inactive renin was achieved with trypsin (1 mg/ml plasma), followed by a further determination of PRA (= total renin). Subtraction of the active renin from the total renin yields the amount of inactive renin. In patients with essential hypertension, the mean values of active renin increase equally in both renal veins (1.4 and 1.3 before, 1.9 and 1.8 after captopril) and the peripheral circulation (0.9 and 1.3) (p less than 0.002), whereas the inactive renin decreases correspondingly. Renal veins: 7.6 and 8.2 before, 7.2 and 7.6 after captopril; peripheral circulation: 7.7 before and 7.0 after captopril (p less than 0.05). In all patients with renovascular hypertension, there is basally a marked lateralization of active renin (6.4 vs 3.5; p less than 0.01) and inactive renin (20.5 and 18.9, p less than 0.03) towards the side of the ischemic kidney. After captopril, the values for total renin and active renin increase (p less than 0.001), and the side difference for active renin becomes still more pronounced (33.0 vs 14.2; p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "In a double-blind controlled study, six infants with congestive heart failure were given captopril to observe the effect on blood pressure. There was a significant fall in systolic (P less than 0.02) and diastolic (P less than 0.01) blood pressure at 90 minutes after the first dose. There was no correlation with plasma renin activity or plasma sodium concentration. The need to monitor blood pressure after introduction of captopril therapy for the treatment of heart failure in infants is demonstrated.", 
    "69": "Hypertension increases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Studies have shown that treatment of even mild hypertension can reduce the occurrence of these adverse cardiovascular events--particularly stroke, congestive heart failure, and progression to more severe hypertension. Patients with newly diagnosed hypertension can be treated pharmacologically with thiazide-type diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers. Nonpharmacologic therapy such as weight reduction can also play an important role in treatment. Additional study is needed to identify optimal drug treatment regimens and to clarify the association between treatment of hypertension and the occurrence of adverse effects from ischemic heart disease.", 
    "70": "We have studied the influence of a beta adrenergic blocking agent and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor on cerebral blood flow (CBF) during general anaesthesia before surgery. Nine patients served as controls and received no special pretreatment. Two other groups were allocated randomly to receive either metoprolol 0.07 mg kg-1 i.v. (nine patients) at the time of induction or captopril 1 mg kg-1 by mouth (11 patients) 1.5 h before induction. There was no significant difference in CBF or CBF values corrected for changes in PaCO2 (CBF corr.) between the metoprolol group and controls. In the group pretreated with captopril, CBF corr. values were significantly lower compared with the metoprolol group. Low CBF corr. in association with low mean arterial pressure was observed in two patients treated with captopril. These findings suggest that treatment with ACE-inhibitors should be discontinued before anaesthesia.", 
    "71": "The effect of varying doses of captopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, on renal hemodynamics, systemic arterial pressure, and the progression of chronic renal disease in conscious, three-quarter nephrectomized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was studied. Six weeks following nephrectomy (Week 0), rats were randomly divided into five groups. Group 2 (n = 8), 3 (n = 8), 4 (n = 9), and 5 (n = 5) were given 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg captopril, respectively, daily in drinking water. Group 1 (n = 7) and sham-operated controls (n = 7) were given water only. On Weeks -6, 0, 2, and 4, renal function was assessed by 24-hr urinary protein excretion and plasma creatinine. Systolic blood pressure was measured at these times by the tail cuff method. Following Week 4, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were measured in conscious rats by single injection clearance of [3H]inulin and [14C]tetraethylammonium bromide, respectively. Group 1 had significantly higher (P less than 0.05) 24-h urinary protein excretion, plasma creatinine, and systolic pressure compared with Group 5 and controls by Week 4, whereas values for these parameters for Groups 2-4 ranged between these extremes. Although systolic pressures were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05), Group 2 had significantly lower proteinuria than Group 1 (P less than 0.05) at Week 4. Total kidney glomerular filtration rate was similarly decreased in Groups 1-5 compared with control rats. Total kidney effective renal plasma flow was higher in captopril-treated groups than in Group 1, whereas systolic blood pressure was similar or lower, indicating that captopril reduced renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, unlike Groups 1-3, the groups receiving higher doses of captopril (4 and 5) did not develop anemia associated with chronic renal disease. In conclusion, captopril attenuated renal functional deterioration in a dose-related manner. The effect on proteinuria was evident at low doses of captopril which did not significantly reduce systemic blood pressure and was accompanied by an increase in effective renal plasma flow and a decrease in renal vascular resistance.", 
    "72": "The value of the captopril test as a screening test for identifying renovascular hypertension has been outlined by several studies performed in populations with a high prevalence of renovascular disease (20% to 50%). We prospectively assessed the value of the test in 103 hypertensive patients referred to our center for evaluation of their hypertension. They had taken no diuretics and no converting-enzyme inhibitors for more than four days. The interpretation of the results of the test was done according to the criteria defined by Muller et al. All patients underwent a digital venous angiography and when positive or doubtful, a conventional angiography. Eleven patients (10%) had unilateral or bilateral artery stenosis greater than 70%. The sensitivity of the test was 73% with a specificity of 84% and a positive predictive value of 35%. The three patients with a false negative test underwent a surgical treatment or a transluminal angioplasty of the stenosis but remained hypertensive. Thus, the captopril test is a useful screening test for identifying patients with renovascular disease, even in a population with a low prevalence of the disease.", 
    "73": "Although early studies suggested little role for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in older hypertensive patients, more careful evaluation has confirmed their efficacy and good tolerability. Although the elderly tend to have low plasma renin levels, the fall in blood pressure after ACE inhibitors is at least as great (and in several studies greater) than in younger age groups. Because several ACE inhibitors, including captopril and enalaprilat, are eliminated by the kidneys, there are predictable age-related effects on pharmacokinetics. Reduced renal clearance will contribute, at least in part, to the enhanced intensity and duration of action seen in elderly patients. However, not all the effects of age on the kinetics and dynamics of ACE inhibitors are predictable. Studies with perindopril and benazepril in the elderly confirm the efficacy of this group of drugs but highlight other pharmacokinetic differences. ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing blood pressure and can be considered for wider use in elderly hypertensives.", 
    "74": "This article emphasizes the importance of testing baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor control of circulation during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in hypertensives, because removal of angiotensin II-dependent stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system could impair reflex blood pressure homeostasis. In essential hypertensive subjects, the sympathetic vasoconstriction that occurs in skeletal muscle after deactivation of cardiopulmonary receptors was reduced after short-term or prolonged administration of the ACE inhibitor, captopril. However, another sympathetic target of the cardiopulmonary reflex, that is, renin release, was unaltered by both short-term and prolonged administration of captopril. Furthermore, the blood pressure and heart rate influences of arterial baroreceptors were preserved or even enhanced after administration of captopril. Thus important reflex mechanisms for cardiovascular homeostasis are not adversely affected by ACE inhibition, which preserves blood pressure levels during gravity challenges or exercise. Preliminary data suggest that this may be even more evident for benazepril.", 
    "75": "Benazepril was shown in preclinical studies to be a potent and specific inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme with a benign toxicologic profile. Its onset and duration of action and the dose-response relationship of its antihypertensive effect have been evaluated. The results of these studies show that 20 mg of benazepril once daily lowers blood pressure by a clinically important amount, which was statistically superior to placebo in three double-blind studies. Doses as low as 10 mg once daily may be effective in individual patients. Doses of 40 and 80 mg once daily have been evaluated and provide small further reductions beyond those seen with the 20 mg dose. Adverse effects are uncommon and generally not dose related. Thiazide diuretics add to the antihypertensive action of benazepril, which has little effect on blood chemistry, apart from a slight rise in serum potassium.",

Plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased from 2.39 +/- 1.1 to 3.78 +/- 1.4 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.05, n = 17) after VSD but not after sham procedure. The change in PRA was positively correlated with the amount of left-to-right shunt through the VSD (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05). Inhibition of angiotensin II effect with saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min) or angiotensin II production with captopril (2 mg/kg) lowered systemic resistance (Rs) by 14% and 34%, respectively (p less than 0.05), and raised pulmonary resistance (Rp) by 35% and 77%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Thirty minutes following captopril, the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow (Qp/Qs) decreased from 3.31 +/- 0.18 to 2.15 +/- 0.18 (p less than 0.05) while total pulmonary flow fell from 7.15 +/- 0.38 to 5.92 +/- 0.34 l/min/M2 (p less than 0.05, n = 11). Systemic flow increased from 2.17 +/- 0.14 to 2.86 +/- 0.33 l/min/M2 (p less than 0.05) despite a reduction in left atrial pressure (17.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.01). Reinfusion of angiotensin II (0.02 micrograms/kg/min) into the central aorta after captopril returned the hemodynamics to baseline including a rise in Rs and fall in Rp.

Its low alpha-blocking action prevents orthostatic hypotension and improves first dose tolerance. The present study evaluates the efficacy and safety of dilevalol comparing it with captopril and nifedipine. Fifty-eight mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients were studied. After a 2 to 3 week placebo lead-in phase, patients with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 105 mmHg were included., Patients were randomly assigned to one of the 3 study drugs for a 4-week period. Initially, 15 patients received dilevalol 200 mg qd and 15 captopril 100 mg bid; afterwards, 14 received dilevalol 200 mg qd and 14 nifedipine 40 mg bid. In the first group dilevalol decreased mean blood pressure (MBP) from 118.0 +/- 1.3 to 107.3 +/- 2.7 mmHg at week 4 and captopril from 117.8 +/- 1.2 to 108.6 +/- 2.7 (p less than 0.05). When dilevalol and nifedipine were compared, the former decreased MBP from 116.0 +/- 2.0 to 104.3 +/- 3.2 mmHg and the latter from 115.0 +/- 1.4 to 106.0 +/- 3.0 (p less than 0.05).

    "79": "An estimated 58 million Americans are at increased risk of morbidity and premature death due to high blood pressure (BP) and require some type of therapy or systematic monitoring. This article focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension, new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of secondary hypertension, and current views of the most appropriate nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy for essential hypertension. In view of the extremely high prevalence of the disorder, emphasis is placed on efficient and cost-effective strategies for diagnosing and managing the hypertensive patient. Recent evidence indicates that nonpharmacologic therapy, including dietary potassium and calcium supplements, reduction of salt intake, weight loss for the obese patient, regular exercise, a diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and saturated fats, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol consumption produces significant sustained reductions in BP while reducing overall cardiovascular risk. Accordingly, nonpharmacologic antihypertensive therapy should be included in the treatment of all hypertensive patients. In persons with mild hypertension, nonpharmacologic approaches may adequately reduce BP, thereby avoiding the expense and potential side effects of drug therapy. In patients with more severe hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, used in conjunction with pharmacologic therapy, can reduce the dosage of antihypertensive medications necessary for BP control. Patients treated with nonpharmacologic therapy only should be followed closely, and if BP control is not satisfactory, drug therapy should be added. The large number of drugs available for use in hypertension treatment, coupled with our rapidly expanding knowledge of the pathophysiology of hypertension and of the adverse effects of these drugs in individual patient groups, make it possible to individualize antihypertensive treatment. When used as monotherapy, most agents effectively lower BP in the majority of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Thus, a single agent from one of four classes: diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers, usually provides effective BP control with minimal side effects in most patients. Therapy should be initiated with the agent most likely to be effective in BP lowering and best tolerated. If the initial agent is ineffective at maximal recommended therapeutic doses or has undue side effects, an alternative agent from another class should be tried. When monotherapy is unsuccessful, a second agent, usually of a different mechanism of action, should be",

    "81": "To elucidate the antihypertensive mechanisms of alacepril (DU-1219), the drug itself and its metabolites, desacetylalacepril (DU-1227) and captopril, were examined both in vitro and in vivo for their effects on the sympathetic nerve which innervates the peripheral vessels. 1. In isolated perfused mesenteric preparations from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, DU-1227 (10(-6)-10(-5) mol/l) attenuated dose-dependently the increases in perfusion pressure and in norepinephrine (NE) overflow which were induced by electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves (15 Hz). Captopril (10(-6)-10(-5) mol/l) caused a similar attenuation, though to a lesser degree, of the perfusion pressure but did not inhibit the increase in NE overflow. 2. The sympatho-inhibitory effect of DU-1227 in the above experiment was shown to be caused by DU-1227 per se, since no captopril was detected in either the perfusate or tissues perfused with DU-1227. 3. In pithed SHR, alacepril (3 mg/kg) caused as potent an inhibitory effect as captopril (3 mg/kg) on the pressor response to the electrical sympathetic nerve stimulation (3 Hz) at an oral dose about half as that of captopril on the molar basis. The effect of alacepril tended to last longer than that of captopril. However, at higher oral dose levels, the inhibitory effect of alacepril (30 mg/kg) was of the similar extent to that of captopril (30 mg/kg). 4.

    "82": "Phosphate, borate, and Tris inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), but HEPES buffer is inert. Measurements of substrate inhibition were made in HEPES buffer at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Substrate inhibition was marked and goes to completion. A new equation for substrate inhibitions enables one, under favorable circumstances, to determine whether there is cooperativity in the binding of substrate to the inhibitory and active sites. Cooperativity does occur with ACE using Hipp-His-Leu as substrate. The kinetic parameters were measured (Km = 0.21 mM, K* = 0.65 mM at 37 degrees C). The enzyme concentration (1.94 X 10(-8) M) was determined by titration with lisinopril so that kcat (5 X 10(3) at 37 degrees C) could be determined. Using this value and the molecular weight the specific activity of ACE was calculated for different common buffers. The specific activity in HEPES calculated from Vmax was 33.7 units/mg at 37 degrees C.", 
    "83": "Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that systolic and systodisystolic hypertension constitute major risk factors for damaging or fatal cardiovascular accidents in the elderly as well as the young. Furthermore reducing the blood pressure also reduces the risk. In 1983 Fleckenstein investigated the Ca++ and MG++ contact of human arteries and clearly demonstrated that titres of both but especially Ca++ in the arterial wall increased progressively with age. The Authors themselves caused calcinosis of the arterial wall in rats treated with Vitamin D3 and Dihydrotachysterol and were able to prevent the occurrence with Verapamil. It is against this background that the present study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two anti-hypertensive drug groups in the calcium antagonists and the ACE inhibitors (Enalapril Maleate) used individually on two groups of elderly hypertensives. A group of 123 out patients with a mean age of 73 and all suffering from slight-to-moderate hypertension were monitored for 6 months being subjected to the following examinations: clinical assessment including blood pressure measurements lying and standing, biohumoral tests, remote heart X-rays, echocardiography (to establish the Reichek systolic wall stress index) and ECG. The clinical examination and ECG were repeated every 2 weeks for the first 6 months and once a month thereafter. The heart X-rays, echocardiogram and biohumeral tests were performed every 6 months. The patients were divided into two groups I and II and assigned to the selected treatment.

    "84": "The effects of enalapril were evaluated in a double-blind, controlled study during 8 weeks, in patients with stable, congestive chronic cardiac insufficiency (functional classification II and III of the NYHA), in sinus rhythm, treated with digitalis and diuretics. 20 patients were randomly divided in two groups: one group continuing the digoxin (group A: 10 patients) and one group where enalapril was substituted for digoxin (group B: 10 patients). Patients from group B presented less clinical aggravation during the study. The left ventricular stroke volume (SV) is significantly decreased in group B at rest (0.21 +/- 0.06 at 50; 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 54; p less than 0.05), while it remained stable during stress. No variations of the SVs were noted at rest and during stress in group A.

This was associated with a significant improvement in NYHA functional class and subjective well being (P less than 0.05 ANOVA) with a concomitant reduction in body weight (P less than 0.05 ANOVA). It significantly increased pulse pressure during forearm isometric exercise (P less than 0.05 ANOVA), but the Valsalva's manoeuvre and the orthostatic response were unchanged.", 
    "87": "1. To test the hypothesis that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors potentiate the tissue effects of bradykinin, the thickness of weals produced by intradermal injections of bradykinin was measured in 17 hypertensive subjects whose antihypertensive regimen included an ACE inhibitor, and in 12 whose treatment did not. 2. Weal thickness increased linearly with the logarithm of the bradykinin dose in both groups (P less than 0.0001). 3. The patients receiving ACE inhibitors showed a mean response of 1.18 +/- 0.08 mm (mean +/- s.e. mean), compared with a mean response of 0.75 +/- 0.08 mm for patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor (P = 0.002). Mean weal response (1.08 +/- 0.9 mm) was not significantly different in patients taking captopril (n = 11) compared with that (1.29 +/- 0.12 mm) in patients taking enalapril (n = 9). 4. Facial flushing during the experiment occurred in six patients taking ACE inhibitors but none who were not. 5. Dermal responses to bradykinin are enhanced in patients taking ACE inhibitors as routine antihypertensive therapy. This study supports the hypothesis that bradykinin may be responsible for some of the adverse effects of these drugs.", 
    "88": "A 63-year-old white male with a 25-year history of hypertension experienced the onset of intermittent diplopia and gait disturbance 24 hours after a change in antihypertensive medication from atenolol 50 mg/d to enalapril 5 mg bid. Three weeks later, the patient was admitted with a worsening of symptoms. Cerebral arteriography revealed significant bilateral vertebral artery stenosis. Symptoms continued to progress in the hospital, and at the time of posterior circulation revascularization the patient had a persistent bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and right ptosis. The need for a neurovascular workup and adjustment of therapy in patients with antihypertensive-associated cerebral ischemia is discussed.", 
    "89": "Patients with severe hypertension and/or congestive heart failure (n = 281) who were unresponsive to other therapies and intolerant to captopril received enalapril treatment (mean dose 19.5 mg/day) under study conditions as part of a Compassionate Use Program. Many of these patients had serious concurrent disorders known to predispose them to a greater risk of adverse experiences and death. The mean duration of enalapril treatment was 29 weeks, with a range of 1 day to approximately 3.5 years. Enalapril was generally well tolerated, and the estimated long term probability of patients terminating enalapril therapy because of adverse effects was low. 20 patients had discontinued captopril treatment because of low white blood cell counts; during subsequent enalapril treatment these reactions resolved in 14 patients, persisted in 2 patients, and could not be evaluated in 4 patients. Captopril-related proteinuria improved or resolved in 9 and persisted in 2 of 15 patients, taste disturbances resolved in 35 and persisted in 2 of 38 patients; and rash resolved in all but 7 of 178 patients during enalapril treatment. 18 patients (6%) discontinued enalapril treatment because of lack of efficacy; 6 of these 18 patients died due to a progression of heart failure, and another 11 patients died for other reasons. The deaths were considered unrelated to therapy with enalapril. Adverse reactions were the reason for discontinuation of enalapril treatment in 53 patients (19%). The most common adverse experiences that resulted in discontinuation of enalapril were: impairment of renal function (5%), hypotension (2%) and rash (2%). No neutropenia, proteinuria, or new taste disturbances were recorded as reasons for discontinuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "Serial determinations of protein excretion rate and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were made in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) uninephrectomized (UNX) at six weeks of age and given tap water (CON), or water with hydrochlorthiazide, hydralazine and reserpine (HHR), captopril (CAP) or enalapril (ENP). Compared to CON, significant hypertension was prevented, kidney weight was lower and there was less proteinuria in HHR, CAP and ENP rats followed for 30 weeks after UNX. Morphologic studies of these four groups revealed that antihypertensive therapy reduced the incidence of glomerular sclerosis in UNX SHR by 50%. Despite complete absence of systemic hypertension, there was striking medial thickening of lobular arteries and arterioles of rats given the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. These vascular abnormalities were present to a lesser degree in rats given ENP, but were entirely absent in untreated animals or in those ingesting the HHR combination. Micropuncture studies performed five weeks after UNX in four additional groups of CON, HHR, CAP and ENP rats revealed that glomerular capillary pressure was elevated in CON and reduced by all three drug regimens. These studies support the hypothesis that glomerular capillary hypertension and/or nephron hypertrophy predispose to glomerular injury in this model of hypertension and reduced renal mass. ACE inhibitors and HHR are equivalent in their ability to prevent glomerular hypertension and damage in these rats, but the former, and in particular captopril, produce abnormalities of cortical vessels via a mechanism not dependent on the presence of systemic hypertension.", 
    "91": "The acute effect on the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, was studied in normotensive volunteers and in hypertensive patients. Baseline CBF was measured using xenon-133 inhalation tomography, and changes in CBF were measured using the arterio-venous oxygen difference method. Cerebral blood flow autoregulation was studied in two separate normotensive groups, one group of 12 volunteers serving as a control, and one group of 12 volunteers studied after the administration of captopril 50 mg. In a group of seven hypertensive patients CBF autoregulation was studied before and 1 h after the administration of captopril 25 mg. In the normotensive volunteers the median lower limit of CBF autoregulation was 83 and 74 mmHg in the untreated and the captopril-treated group, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups. In five of the hypertensive patients the lower limit of CBF autoregulation was lowered by captopril, in median by 22 mmHg. However, in two patients it was increased, by 3 and 13 mmHg, respectively. It is proposed that the shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation seen in some of our cases, and which has previously been documented in experimental studies, may be dependent on the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "92": "In the case presented, enalapril is implicated as the causative agent of a major depressive episode. Previous depressive episodes associated with propranolol and atenolol may well have been seen as indicators that this patient was susceptible to any therapeutic agent that possessed central nervous system effects.", 
    "93": "The interaction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was investigated in six supine, sodium-replete, normal volunteers who received captopril (10 mg i.v. bolus followed by 10 mg/hr constant infusion) or vehicle superimposed on background 3-hour, constant, low-dose (1.5 pmol/kg/min) infusions of human ANF (99-126). Plasma converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited but this had no effect on endogenous plasma ANF concentrations. ANF infusions, with or without captopril, caused similar increases in plasma ANF concentrations, and calculated metabolic clearance rates for ANF were unchanged. Similarly, blood pressure, heart rate, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and renal electrolyte excretion, including ANF-induced natriuresis, were unaffected by captopril. The combination of ANF plus captopril produced a significant increase in plasma aldosterone (79 +/- 8 vs. 60 +/- 6 pmol/l, p less than 0.05), cortisol (406 +/- 52 vs. 265 +/- 29 nmol/l, p less than 0.01), adrenaline (119 +/- 21 vs. 76 +/- 10 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), and noradrenaline (319 +/- 49 vs. 215 +/- 38 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with time-matched placebo data. Converting enzyme inhibition, in the absence of major changes in blood pressure or renal blood flow, has little effect on ANF metabolism or renal bioactivity. However, ACE inhibition and ANF combined may interact to increase activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system by unknown mechanisms.", 
    "94": "Seventeen patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension were evaluated with baseline spirometry followed by determination of bronchial reactivity by challenge with methacholine. There were nine coughers and eight noncoughers in the study. Among the nine coughers, eight demonstrated bronchial hyperreactivity. Conversely, none of the noncoughers disclosed bronchial hyperreactivity. Eight of the nine coughers were rechallenged two to six months following cessation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Six of these eight showed persistent bronchial hyperreactivity. We conclude that cough is associated with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with underlying bronchial hyperreactivity. The findings indicate caution in administration of ACE inhibitors in asthmatic patients and those with known bronchial hyperreactivity.", 
    "95": "Benazepril hydrochloride is a nonsulfhydryl, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is orally effective. This study was designed to determine the acute hemodynamic effects of this agent in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Twenty-six patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35%, cardiac indexes less than 2.1 L/min/m2, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures greater than 12 mm Hg were given 2 or 5 mg benazepril hydrochloride. All does produced significant (p less than 0.05) increases in cardiac output (26.7% to 31.6% above control) and heart rate (5.4% to 11.2% above control) and decreases in systemic (27.1% to 32.0% below control) and pulmonary (34.8% to 55.5% below control) vascular resistances, mean pulmonary (25.3% to 30.3% below control) and systemic (13.4% to 18.5% below control) arterial pressures, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (46.9% to 51.1% below control). Twenty-four hours after an initial dose, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery wedge pressures remained below control levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity fell by 67.8% +/- 6.4%, with a 15.8% +/- 7.6% decline in aldosterone levels. Thus benazepril hydrochloride is an effective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that produces hemodynamic effects that persist for 24 hours after a single oral dose.", 
    "96": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are of benefit in the management of heart failure. In some studies in patients with heart failure, a decline in renal function occurred more frequently in patients treated with enalapril maleate, a longer-acting agent, than in those treated with captopril, a shorter-acting drug. Patients experiencing a decline in renal function had a number of predisposing hormonal and hemodynamic factors. In one report, these factors included an initial fall in blood pressure that was sustained, lower cardiac output, and a relatively high fixed dose of enalapril that contributed to renal impairment. In a second study, the decline in renal function was most severe in patients with a lower systemic arterial pressure in whom glomerular filtration may have been dependent on angiotensin II. In a third study, intravascular volume depletion and an activated renin-angiotensin system led to reduced renal function. Reduction of angiotensin II level in plasma and tissues by ACE inhibitors decreases systemic vascular resistance and efferent arteriolar tone, which tends to decrease glomerular filtration rate. If compensatory increases in cardiac output are inadequate or preexisting renal impairment or volume depletion is present, renal function will deteriorate. Long-acting ACE inhibitors prolong the decreased efferent arteriolar tone and may compromise cardiac muscle response to catecholamines. The use of shorter-acting agents in patients who exhibit deterioration in renal function may be preferable.", 
    "97": "Activation of the renin angiotensin system is important in the development of accelerated hypertension and progression to acute renal failure in scleroderma and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity may effectively control blood pressure and ameliorate renal insufficiency. To our knowledge, we describe the first reversal of dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency by enalapril maleate and recovery and maintenance of near-normal renal function in a patient suffering from undifferentiated connective tissue disease with sclerodermatous features. The pathophysiologic mechanisms and long-term treatment implications with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in this setting are discussed.", 
    "98": "To determine whether acute effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril are maintained during long-term therapy, 19 patients were studied using right-sided heart catheterization before an initial randomized dose of lisinopril and again after 12 weeks of maintenance lisinopril therapy. During initial evaluation, lisinopril produced significant decreases in mean systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and concomitant increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index. After 12 weeks of therapy with lisinopril, the dosage of which was titrated to produce optimal relief of symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), repeat hemodynamic studies revealed persistent significant reductions in baseline systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. However, the increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index were not statistically significant. To determine if further acute hemodynamic changes occur during long-term therapy, the patients were readministered a dose of lisinopril. This caused further decreases in systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and mean right atrial pressure, and an increase in cardiac index. Lisinopril did not change stroke work index at either initial or rechallenge study. This study indicates that in patients with CHF treated with lisinopril, acute hemodynamic effects persist after 12 weeks of therapy, and acute hemodynamic response continues to occur upon drug readministration.", 
    "99": "Since only a minute proportion of total angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is present in plasma, the reliability of conventional in vitro measurements of ACE activity has been questioned. Data presented here demonstrate that the definition of ACE inhibition depends on the methodology used, with different results obtained with different substrates. We have developed a method that provides accurate and precise determinations of \"true\" angiotensin levels and in vivo ACE activity was estimated by measuring the plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio. Since the initial interruption of angiotensin II production by an ACE inhibitor stimulates renal renin release, the response can be quantitated by measuring changes in plasma levels of angiotensin I. The actual state of the renin-angiotensin system during ACE inhibition is represented by the plasma angiotensin II level. When ACE inhibition is no longer complete, increased angiotensin I levels bring the system back toward initial angiotensin II concentrations.", 
    "100": "Fosenopril sodium, a prodrug, is converted to its active diacid during and after intestinal absorption. Its excretion is equally divided between hepatic and renal routes. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study evaluated the efficacy and safety of fosenopril compared to propranolol, at rest and during exercise, on blood pressure, plasma potassium, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone. Exercise testing utilized bicycle ergometry, and individual subjects underwent an identical exercise protocol on placebo and on active treatment. The fosenopril group comprised nine subjects who were matched to nine subjects on propranolol. Blood pressure fell significantly and equally at rest (fosenopril--157/103 to 141/95 mmHg, p less than 0.005; propranolol--159/100 to 149/90 mmHg p less than 0.005) and during exercise in both groups. Plasma potassium fell significantly at rest (4.25 to 3.98 mmol/l, p less than 0.05) and during exercise (5.18 to 4.87 mmol/l, p less than 0.05) on fosenopril, but rose in subjects on propranolol during exercise (4.99 to 5.44 mmol/l, p less than 0.01). Plasma renin activity rose on fosenopril and fell on propranolol. Plasma aldosterone was uninfluenced by either drug. Fosenopril was well tolerated and its antihypertensive profile is similar to that of beta blockers and other ACE inhibitors.", 
    "101": "Not much is known about alterations in electrical activity in the healthy part of a heart made hypertrophic as a result of local ischaemia, yet such an investigation might allow us to predict the stages leading to cardiac failure and so aid its prevention. We therefore studied the electrophysiological changes which occurred in rats in which ligation of the left coronary artery had produced hypertrophy of the non-infarcted myocardium. One month after the intervention the overall degree of hypertrophy of the ventricles reached 15.3%. This was accompanied in the healthy part of the left ventricle (septum) by altered electrical activity consisting of a lengthening of the action potentials at 25, 50, 75 and 90% of repolarisation. Myocardial hypertrophy was absent after chronic treatment of the animals with perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, given orally at 2 mg.kg-1 body weight, and the electrophysiological alterations induced by the infarct were partially eliminated: phase 2 of the myocardial action potential was shortened and phase 3 completely restored. We postulate that angiotensin may have a direct effect on the cardiac cell.", 
    "102": "The effects of renal perfusion pressure and reflex sympathetic nerve stimulation on sodium excretion were studied in six conscious foxhounds on a normal sodium diet. This was done before, during common carotid occlusion (CCO), and during a recovery period following CCO. Three protocols were used 1) control (n = 6), 2) converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI, n = 6), and 3) CEI combined with a constant renal artery pressure (RAP, n = 5). In protocol 1, CCO increased RAP markedly (140.5 +/- 5.1 vs. 103.0 +/- 4.4 mmHg; P less than 0.001) along with a considerable natriuresis (128.4 +/- 20.1 vs. 86.3 +/- 15.1 mumol Na+/min; P less than 0.05). In protocol 2, CEI increased control sodium excretion but did not impair the natriuresis by CCO. Maintaining RAP at control levels in protocol 3 lead to an antinatriuresis (53.1 +/- 16.8 vs. 128.3 +/- 32.2 mumol Na+/min; P less than 0.05). Creatinine clearance was unaffected by all procedures. In conclusion, a change in ANG II formation shifts but does not impair the natriuretic response to CCO. A moderate sympathetic activation has a pronounced pressure-independent antinatriuretic effect, which is not mediated by angiotensin II.", 
    "103": "Captopril has not yet been included in the list of drugs causing hypersensitivity lung disease. We report a patient with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure who, when rechallenged with captopril, developed upper lung field infiltrates associated with productive cough and striking peripheral eosinophilia. Gallium scan, transbronchial biopsy histologic findings, and direct immunofluorescent study were consistent with an immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. There was no other etiology discovered for the patient's eosinophilia, nor was there evidence for an infectious etiology to explain his presentation.", 
    "104": "To discover the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial long-term effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we investigated the systemic and peripheral effects of short- and long-term ACE inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure. After assessing the short-term effects and dose titration with cilazapril, a new long-acting ACE inhibitor, 21 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or the ACE inhibitor. Seventeen patients completed the 3-month treatment. Central hemodynamic output, femoral blood flow (measured by thermodilution), oxygen saturation, and lactate and norepinephrine levels were determined simultaneously in the femoral vein and radial artery during treatment and after a 3-month rest and during symptom-limited bicycle exercise. Short-term ACE inhibition improved rest and exercise hemodynamic output, but it did not alter peak femoral blood flow, calculated leg oxygen consumption, or systemic oxygen uptake during exercise, despite significant reduction in femoral norepinephrine extraction and arterial angiotensin levels during exercise. In contrast, long-term ACE inhibition further improved exercise cardiac output and increased leg blood flow (from 2.3 to 2.9 l/min, p less than 0.05), leg oxygen consumption (from 277 to 403 ml/min, p less than 0.05), and systemic oxygen uptake (from 1,133 to 1,453 ml/min, p less than 0.05), whereas these variables remained unchanged with placebo treatment (p less than 0.02 between groups). Moreover, a moderate but significant increase in femoral oxygen extraction occurred after long-term therapy (ACE inhibitor: from 76% to 83%, p less than 0.05; placebo: from 75% to 74%, NS; p less than 0.01 between groups). We conclude that long-term ACE inhibition is clinically beneficial in that it improves blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise over time. The long-term effects of ACE inhibition are, in part, probably related to peripheral (vascular) mechanisms, for example, by reversing the inability of peripheral vessels to dilate and by improving oxygen utilization.", 
    "105": "An in vivo study was done to determine whether angiotensin II is directly formed by kallikrein or kallikrein-like proteases. Dogs were bilaterally nephrectomized 24 hours before ligation of the coronary artery. This acute coronary artery occlusion led to a regionally increased acidic state in the ischemic tissue and resulted in an elevation of immunoreactive angiotensin II (IR-Angiotensin II) levels in the coronary sinus blood, but not in systemic aortic blood. Elevation of the IR-Angiotensin II level was specifically inhibited by aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor. It was not affected by either captopril, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or by pepstatin, a renin inhibitor. The concentrations of immunoreactive angiotensin I (IR-Angiotensin I), plasma renin activity and angiotensin converting enzyme activity remained unaltered in the presence of coronary artery occlusion. These results suggest that IR-Angiotensin II in the ischemic heart may be generated directly by kallikrein or kallikrein-like proteases, independently of the systemic renin angiotensin system.", 
    "106": "The effects of the neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the changes in airway opening pressure (PaO), pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), and weight induced by intravascular administration of substance P were examined in isolated perfused and ventilated guinea pig lungs. Administration of 1 nmol substance P without enzyme inhibitors resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in the peak PaO during ventilation from 12.4 +/- 0.5 to 22.4 +/- 2.2 cmH2O; there were small statistically insignificant increases in Ppa. The changes in PaO peaked approximately 30 s after peptide infusion and returned to preinfusion values by 5 min. In the presence of combined thiorphan (5.6 microM) and captopril (7.7 microM) the magnitude of the Pao response at 30 s (41.5 +/- 3.8 cmH2O) and at 5 min (40.0 +/- 3.6 cmH2O) after peptide infusion was significantly greater than in control lungs (P less than 0.05). The effects of substance P on PaO in the presence of the various inhibitors were not related to amount of peptide recovered in the lung effluent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of [3H]Pro2,4 substance P perfused through the lungs demonstrated that the major products were consistent with intact substance P, substance P 1-4, and smaller peptides; only minor amounts of products consistent with substance P 1-7, 1-9, or 3-11 were identified. These data support our previous findings showing that the physiological effects of intravascular substance P are limited by peptide degradation; the latter process, once begun, proceeds rapidly to nearly complete peptide degradation.",

    "108": "The response to different therapeutic schedules in arterial hypertension in the elderly is studied and compared with response to treatment in younger patients. Blood pressure in the elderly was best controlled with non pharmacologic measures and low doses of diuretics; there were no differences between both groups with respect to complications and side effects. The response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is also evaluated, presenting good results on blood pressure control without side effects in the elderly, although efficaciousness was higher in younger patients. The possible therapeutic schedules in arterial hypertension in the aged are discussed.", 
    "109": "Lisinopril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied hemodynamically in 55 patients. The response to 2.5-, 5- and 10-mg doses showed significant increases in cardiac index and significant reductions in pulmonary artery wedge, right atrial, pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial pressures, as well as in systemic vascular resistance. Significant changes in most parameters were present at 24 hours. A dose-response relation for most parameters was noted. Over a 3-month period, 47 patients were followed up, with improvement in functional capacity and symptomatic status. Metabolic parameters did not change over time, although 26% showed evidence of reversible renal dysfunction. Only 3 patients (6.4%) required discontinuation because of adverse effects. A subgroup of patients reassessed at 3 months demonstrated maintenance of hemodynamic effects. The present study demonstrates that (1) the hemodynamic effects of lisinopril are of relatively long duration; (2) within certain limits, a dose-response relation can be defined; and (3) the drug has an acceptable long-term tolerability profile.", 
    "110": "This report reviews the tolerability profile of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. Data have been collected from 546 patients treated with enalapril for up to 9 months in clinical trials other than the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study. Results in patients treated with enalapril (n = 193) or placebo (n = 195) in double-blind, controlled clinical trials show that the incidences of death, serious adverse experiences, and adverse experiences requiring discontinuation of double-blind therapy, as well as the overall incidence of such experiences, were similar in the 2 groups. However, certain adverse experiences that are related to the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors were seen more often after enalapril than after placebo treatment. Dizziness and hypotension were the most frequent adverse experiences reported in patients with heart failure treated with enalapril. The most frequent laboratory adverse experiences were increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. hyperkalemia was also seen in patients receiving enalapril. It is possible to identify patients at risk of these experiences before initiating treatment with enalapril and to take certain measures (such as withholding or reducing the dose of diuretic drugs and discontinuing potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretic drugs) to reduce the likelihood that hypotension, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, or hyperkalemia will occur. Angioedema, a recognized adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, was not seen in the clinical trials reviewed here.

The study was discontinued prematurely for ethical reasons because of the much lower mortality among the patients receiving enalapril (n = 50) than among those receiving placebo (n = 68) (p less than 0.003). The important reduction in mortality was observed among patients dying from progressive heart failure. Follow-up ranged from 1 day to 20 months (average 188 days). The reduction in mortality was associated with general improvements in the symptoms and signs of left and right ventricular heart failure, reduction of heart size, improvements in New York Heart Association classification, reduction of concurrent cardiovascular medication, and reduction of hospital admissions and days spent in the hospital. The overall withdrawal rate was low, and was comparable in the 2 treatment groups (16%; enalapril, n = 22, placebo, n = 18). Symptomatic hypotension was observed in 17% (n = 21) of the enalapril group vs 0% of the placebo group. Hypotension was the reason for withdrawal of enalapril therapy in 7 patients. After the initial dose of enalapril was reduced to 2.5 mg in high-risk patients, hypotension necessitated withdrawal in only 3.2% of the patients.

The patients received optimal treatment with digitalis and diuretics for 2 to 4 weeks. Thereafter, they were randomly assigned to receive either enalapril plus diuretics (n = 72) or digoxin plus diuretics (n = 70). After 8 weeks of treatment, a significant improvement in classification was observed in 22 of 63 patients (35%) in the enalapril group and in 17 of 61 (28%) in the digoxin group (difference not significant [NS]).

Moreover, a question has arisen as to whether a once- or twice-daily dosing schedule is preferable. To address these issues, a multicenter trial was conducted with the objective of obtaining long-term (48 weeks) experience with enalapril in 142 patients with CHF. A subgroup of patients (n = 88) were randomized to receive enalapril in a dosing schedule of either 20 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily. Of the overall group, 96 patients completed the 48 weeks of follow-up. Improvement in New York Heart Association functional class, exercise duration and left ventricular ejection fraction was observed. Improvement in clinical status was seen in 68% of all patients, whereas conditions in 5% worsened with enalapril therapy. The most frequent adverse experiences were dizziness and hypotension.

    "114": "A multicenter, randomized, double-blind assessment of 130 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV) was undertaken to assess the therapeutic efficacy of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. All the subjects received concurrent therapy with digoxin and diuretics. Assessments performed periodically over 12 weeks revealed that the active treatment was associated with significant improvements in treadmill exercise time, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction, functional status and clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. Lisinopril exhibited a mild first-dose effect on blood pressure that was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The incidence of adverse experiences was not markedly different in the 2 study groups, with only mild hypotension and dizziness occurring more frequently in association with the active medication.", 
    "115": "The clearance and production rates of plasma angiotensinogen of normal dog, nephrectomized dog and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) administered dog were calculated. Plasma angiotensinogen was measured by adding excessive dog renin to the plasma sample. The clearance rate was 4.4, 4.0 and 3.8 ml/kg/hr and the production rate was 9.6, 21.6 and 7.6 micrograms/kg/hr, respectively. After nephrectomy, the clearance rate of angiotensinogen decreased only 10 percent but the production rate increased more than twice. These results mean that the kidney does not play an important role in the clearance of angiotensinogen but has some influence on its production. This increase in production rate due to nephrectomy may mean that the kidney has some inhibitory effect on the secretion of angiotensinogen from the liver but this phenomenon is not able to explain by much less hydrolysis of angiotensinogen. By the administration of ACEI, not only the clearance rate but also the production rate of plasma angiotensinogen decreased as compared with control dog, but the balance between them resulted in the decreased plasma angiotensinogen concentration. These results show that the decreased production rate was greater than the decreased clearance rate in ACEI administered dog.",

Effective control of blood pressure can be achieved in some patients with a single agent and in many of the remainder with combination therapy. The ideal combination regimen is one that is at least as effective as a single agent, has minimal or no side effects, has a wide therapeutic index, is simple to administer, and is effective in a wide variety of patient populations. When used in combination, the thiazide diuretics and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve blood pressure reduction over either drug used alone. In addition, the combination is effective in a wide range of patient populations (blacks and whites, young and old) and is accompanied by fewer adverse metabolic effects than the thiazides alone. Finally, the combination has a more positive impact on quality of life than other combinations involving the thiazide diuretics.",

CL242817 was administered in the feed continuously after irradiation at a regimen of 60 mg/kg/day. Pulmonary endothelial function was monitored by lung ACE activity, plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. Pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated by lung hydroxyproline (HP) content. Lung ACE and PLA activities decreased with increasing radiation dose, and cotreatment with CL242817 significantly ameliorated both responses. CL242817 dose-reduction factors (DRF) were 1.3-1.5 for ACE and PLA activity. Lung PGI2 and TXA2 production increased with increasing radiation dose, and CL242817 almost completely prevented both radiation responses. The slope of the radiation dose-response curves in the CL242817-treated rats was essentially zero, precluding calculation of DRF values for PGI2 and TXA2 production. Lung HP content also increased with increasing radiation dose, and CL242817 significantly attenuated this response (DRF = 1.5). These data suggest that the ability of ACE inhibitors to ameliorate radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction is not unique to captopril [Ward et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

In the metabolic evaluation (cycloergometry) captopril increased significantly exercise tolerance (means VO2-uptake at maximal exercise: CP = 0.81 vs Pl = 0.73 1/min), associated with a slower heart rate and higher O2-pulse at maximal exercise. In the hemodynamic study, when the effects of Cp and Pl were compared, the mean values of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were similar at rest, but significantly lower during exercise, after captopril (means PAP Cp = 41.3 vs Pl = 51.2 mmHg; XPVR Cp = 278 vs Pl = 392 dyn. sec. cm5). There were similar systemic hemodynamic effects after Cp, but these were more intense in the pulmonary circulation (lower PVR/SVR ratio post-Cp in relation to post-Pl, during exercise).

It has been postulated that the antihypertensive effect of peripherally acting vasodilators is masked, by counter regulatory mechanism e.g. activation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone (RAA) axis. The present work was undertaken to study the effect of blockade of RAA axis using captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on the blood pressure lowering activity of nifedipine. Pretreatment with captopril in a dose of 25 mg. bd was carried out for 4 weeks in one group of 10 patients before administering nifedipine 10 mg bd for 4 weeks. The other matched group of 10 patients received nifedipine alone in the same dose. It was observed that although captopril by itself had no appreciable effect on blood pressure in the dose used, it significantly enhanced the blood pressure lowering activity of nifedipine. It appears that counterregulatory mechanisms play an important role in determining the net antihypertensive effect of peripheral vasodilators.",

Captopril (12.5 to 100 mg daily, mean 34 mg) was administered for a month and was effective as monotherapy in all patients. The supine arterial pressure changed from: 177 +/- 19 mm Hg to 141.7 +/- 7.7 mm Hg systolic and 106 +/- 7.6 mm Hg to 87.3 +/- 5.3 mm Hg diastolic; and upright: from 162.7 +/- 16 mm Hg to 139 +/- 11.4 mm Hg systolic and from 101.7 +/- 11.6 mm Hg to 87.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg diastolic.

No alterations in serum creatinine, HbA1 (glycohemoglobin), urinary excretion rate of albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, glomerular filtration rate were observed during follow-up. No important change in plasma aldosterone was found, while plasma renin activity was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) as expected. No side effects were reported during the therapy.

After six weeks therapy, captopril produced significant antihypertensive effects one to six hours after dosing but these did not persist at eleven to twelve hours. Plasma renin concentration was increased for twelve hours after captopril but inhibition of angiotensin II activity was lost by twelve hours. During the period when captopril reduced blood pressure significantly, effective renal plasma flow and hepatic blood flow were unchanged although renal vascular resistance was reduced. There was no evidence that captopril altered plasma sodium, potassium or magnesium concentrations following bendrofluazide. Thus, in thiazide-treated patients, captopril 25 mg produces significant blood pressure reduction for at least six hours after dosing, without impairing renal or hepatic blood flow. However, twice-daily low-dose captopril does not adequately control blood pressure throughout the dosage interval.",

With chronic captopril treatment bicyclo-PGEm remained elevated for 12 h after the last dose after 1 and 2 months (75.5 +/- 5.5; p less than 0.05 and 72.1 +/- 6.3 pg/ml; p less than 0.05, respectively). Upon readministration of captopril during chronic captopril treatment the significant increase of bicyclo-PGEm in response to captopril was sustained, as were changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and blood pressure. Plasma catecholamines were unchanged with captopril or decreased slightly, vasopressin remained moderately increased throughout.

Six weeks of perindopril treatment was associated with a significant reduction of ambulatory blood pressure and a significant increase in forearm blood flow. Whilst the haemodynamic responses to Valsalva's manoeuvre, tilt, isometric forearm exercise and cold pressor testing were unaffected by perindopril, significant augmentation of the bradycardia during facial immersion was seen after chronic therapy. Sino-aortic baroreceptor-heart rate reflex resetting was apparent within 2 h of the first dose; this effect persisted throughout the active treatment period. Withdrawal of treatment was associated with a persisting hypotensive effect and an increase in heart rate which was not accompanied by an increase in plasma catecholamines. We conclude that perindopril, in a dose of 8 mg once daily, was an effective antihypertensive agent. We postulate that chronic therapy was associated with a sustained increase in parasympathetic tone.",

    "145": "Essential hypertension is associated with increased intrarenal resistance that may go undetected unless the fractional distribution of cardiac output to the kidney is measured. Several hypotensive drugs induce a transient reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate due to the reduction in renal perfusion. This may represent an untoward effect especially in subjects already presenting a clinically relevant reduction of renal function. Loop diuretics, cardioselective and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) beta-blockers, calcium entry-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors either do not significantly reduce or even increase renal perfusion. This is one more reason for considering these agents as first choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension.",

Control of hypertension was similar with both antihypertensive regimens. Clearance of inulin and of paraaminohippuric acid increased during the first 3 months of captopril therapy and remained stable thereafter. Moreover, the decline in the reciprocal of serum creatinine over time observed during triple drug therapy was arrested during therapy with the ACE inhibitor. If the salutary effects of captopril are sustained, the results obtained in the current studies would suggest that control of hypertension by ACE inhibition may be effective in slowing progression of renal failure. Future studies to answer this important question are necessary.",

To determine if the effects of captopril were dependent on the pathophysiological consequences of heart failure, we also studied a group of noninfarcted rats treated with captopril. In noninfarcted rats treated with captopril, left ventricular (LV) systolic and mean aortic pressures decreased from 132 +/- 12 to 107 +/- 15 mm Hg and 122 +/- 1 to 100 +/- 2, respectively (p less than 0.01). In noninfarcted rats, captopril decreased LV weight, LV weight/body weight, and total heart weight/body weight but produced no effects on the peripheral venous circulation.

    "148": "This review updates some recent advances of a new and exciting developments in basic and clinical cardiology: a) the role, in the congestive heart failure (CHF), of the neurohormonal systems (NHS) which act to maintain circulatory homeostatic equilibrium, and b) the therapeutic implications of such a role. Six NHS, acting in CHF, have presently been identified: three of them induce vasoconstriction and sodium retention (sympathetic nervous systems, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and arginine-vasopressine system); the remaining three offset or balance the former ones, acting, therefore as \"counterregulators\" (prostaglandins--PGE2 and PGI2--, dopaminergic system and atrial natriuretic factor). Each one of these NHS influences the \"compensatory\" mechanisms of heart failure, acting on the target-organs both by direct effects and by interaction with other NHS; consequently, in heart failure, all the NHS are stimulated with the respective increase in the plasma levels of their agents. In asymptomatic stages of ventricular dysfunction the stimulation of the vasodilator-and-natriuretic systems appears to be predominant and able to maintain circulatory equilibrium. However, as the heart dysfunction increases and becomes symptomatic, the vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining forces appear to predominate; this phenomenon becomes increasingly apparent as the functional class becomes more advanced. The hyperstimulation of these last systems has an extremely important role in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure, as well as in its prognosis. Therefore, the attempts to correct these neurohormonal imbalance in patients with heart failure has a sound rational basis, not only to improve the symptoms and the exercise capacity but also to increase the survival of these patients. At the present time, amongst the potential pharmacological interventions acting on NHS in CHF, the blockade of the SRA system with ACE-inhibitors is generally accepted as the most feasible, the safer and the most effective therapeutic tool. In fact, its application has broadened from an earlier use in severe CHF to other symptomatic stages of cardiac failure, including the milder forms. In addition, preliminary data strongly suggest its unique usefulness in asymptomatic phases of ventricular dysfunction. Looking back at the medical therapy of heart failure, it can be concluded that we are starting a new era. Throughout 200 years (since the introduction of digitalis) the therapeutic goal in CHF has been the improvement of symptoms. With the developments of the present decade, a new and exciting goal is being offered to these patients, called by Packer \"the second frontier\", that is, the prolongation of their lives.", 
    "149": "The rationale for the use of new drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension is based on the knowledge that these drugs can both achieve the same goals as old drugs and offer additional advantages. Available data indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are as effective in reducing blood pressure as thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, and that they maintain their effect without the development of tolerance. Therefore they may be expected to achieve at least the same prevention of target organ damage (heart failure, cerebral strokes, and arterial nephrosclerosis) as achieved by previous drugs and also to be effective when target organs have already been damaged. Moreover ACEIs seem to offer two possible advantages: cardioprotection and a favorable influence on the quality of life. Many experimental but indeed few clinical data suggest that these drugs can exert primary cardioprotection and that they might exert a beneficial therapeutic effect in hypertensives with coronary heart disease. Owing to the quality of their hypotensive effect, to the lack of detrimental effects on physical, psychical, and sexual activity, and to the positive influence on the sense of well-being, ACEIs seem to be better tolerated than previous drugs. However, although available data suggest that ACEIs can be considered a further advance in the treatment of hypertension, more extensive information is needed to confirm these promising results.", 
    "150": "It has been suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) may play a role in the metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and that ANP may interfere with angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction. This has been investigated within the forearm vascular bed during local ANP infusion and ACE inhibition. Six normotensive volunteers were studied, each on two occasions. On both occasions, after saline infusion, volunteers were given initially a 20 min infusion of ANP at 0.1 microgram/min via the brachial artery. This was followed, after 20 min, by a second infusion of ANP at the same dose, co-infused with enalaprilat (5 micrograms/min) on one occasion, and placebo (saline) on the other (in random order). Forearm blood flow was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography with mercury-in-silastic strain gauges. Blood flow in the cannulated arm increased significantly during the first ANP infusion; by 52 +/- 15% before placebo (P less than 0.05), and by 41 +/- 8% before enalaprilat (P less than 0.005). This increase was similar with the second ANP infusion during co-infusion of either placebo (40 +/- 10%) or enalaprilat (45 +/- 11%). Enalaprilat did not affect the half-life of vasodilatation produced by ANP (t1/2 = 5 min). These studies in healthy subjects demonstrate no effect of local ACE inhibition on resting blood flow, or on the vasodilatation produced by ANP in the human forearm, and provide no evidence of a role of ACE in the metabolism of ANP in this vascular bed.", 
    "151": "Although headache is sometimes regarded as a symptom of severe hypertension, its relationship to blood pressure is not clear. In 11,710 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension we have found that headache was common and may be reduced by treatment. We found a clear relationship between the frequency of reports of headache and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure irrespective of treatment or the type of drug used to treat hypertension. Calcium antagonists appeared most likely to be a cause of headache in hypertensive patients.", 
    "152": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a daily low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril or enalapril, in mild essential hypertension. Nine men with seated diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 104 mm Hg on placebo participated in the study. After one month of placebo, captopril 25 mg was administered; blood pressure, heart rate, ACE activity and plasma renin activity were measured hourly for 4 hours. Each patient then received captopril 50 mg once daily for 8 weeks and similar measurements were made 24 hours post-dose every 2 weeks. After another month of placebo, the identical protocol was repeated after enalapril 5 mg. Although blood pressure and ACE activity decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) within 2-4 hours of the acute doses of each inhibitor, neither captopril or enalapril produced significant reductions 24 hours after the small daily dose. Thus, neither ACE inhibitor alone was adequate to control blood pressure in mild hypertension when given once daily during 8 weeks of treatment.",

To ensure the specificity of the results the dependence of ACE activity on specific inhibitors was evaluated. Enzyme activity found in tissues of the male genital tract was considerably higher than that in serum and other tissues. ACE in human seminal plasma is synthesized by the testis, epididymis and prostate in different amounts.",

The pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, were studied in an open, randomized, balanced, two-period, crossover design in 12 in-patients with stable, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). 2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lisinopril in CHF, lisinopril was administered orally (10 mg) and intravenously (5 mg) in each patient. Each dose was followed by a 72 h period with frequent blood sampling and fractional urine collections for radioimmunoassay of lisinopril. 3. Mean urinary recovery of lisinopril was 15 and 88% following oral and intravenous administration, respectively; absorption/bioavailability of lisinopril based on urinary recovery ratios was 16%, less than that found in normal subjects. 4. Serum concentrations of lisinopril following intravenous administration were higher in this study than those previously observed in normal subjects. 5. The results of this study suggest a reduced absorption of lisinopril in CHF and altered disposition, possibly associated with age as well as the disease state.", 
    "155": "1. Seventeen normal subjects were tilted on a tilt table and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and renal function were monitored in the absence of drug treatment; the same measurements were repeated during treatment with enalapril in eight of these subjects. 2. In the absence of drug, tilting of the whole body to the 45 degree head up position caused an antidiuresis, antinatriuresis and antikaliuresis; the antinatriuresis resulted from a transient fall in glomerular filtration and from a sustained increase in the tubular reabsorption of sodium, as reflected by a prolonged fall in fractional sodium excretion. 3. Enalapril caused a reduction in blood pressure in the upright position; there was no effect on heart rate. The antinatriuresis of tilt was significantly blunted by enalapril. This resulted from blunting of the transient fall in creatinine clearance and of the increase in tubular sodium reabsorption. Urinary potassium excretion during tilting was not altered by enalapril. 4. These findings are consistent with a direct intrarenal action of angiotensin II, mediating some of the alterations in renal function apparent on assumption of the upright position.", 
    "156": "Recent intervention trials failed to show a significant decrease in mortality of ischemic heart disease in hypertensive patients given pharmacological treatment. These results led to a reassessment of cardiovascular risks of antihypertensive drugs per se and particularly diuretics. Captopril and Enalapril, antihypertensive drugs acting as converting enzyme inhibitors, might have some theoretical advantage over other antihypertensive drugs. The chronic ACE inhibitors therapy does not compromise glucose, lipid and urate and it seems not to be persistent in long-term administration.", 
    "157": "Blood pressure responses to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril were investigated in rats with salt-dependent hypertension. In both one- and two-kidney deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-NaCl hypertension, enalapril (50 mg/kg p.o.) caused a similar, slight blood pressure fall, which passed off with continuation of the treatment. Changes in the salt concentration of the drinking fluid (from 1% NaCl to 0.2% NaCl in the one-kidney rats and from 1% NaCl to 2% NaCl in those with intact kidneys) did not alter the depressor effect of enalapril. Plasma renin activity in all DOC-NaCl hypertensive groups was negligible. Our results indicate that in DOC-NaCl hypertensive rats, the presence of intact kidneys vs. one kidney has no influence on the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition. The blood pressure-lowering effect of enalapril may result from local converting enzyme inhibition in tissues.", 
    "158": "Enalapril provides significant haemodynamic, symptomatic and clinical improvement when added to maintenance therapy with digitalis and diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure [NYHA (New York Heart Association) classes II to IV]. These effects are not attenuated during long term therapy. More significantly, a clinical study demonstrated that enalapril reduces mortality when added to established therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV) refractory to digitalis, diuretics and other vasodilators. Thus, ACE inhibitors such as enalapril offer a significant advance in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Because these drugs improve symptoms in patients with classes II to IV failure, and reduce mortality in patients with severe heart failure, they should be considered as first choice adjuvant therapy when a vasodilator is needed in addition to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics.", 
    "159": "Eight infants aged between 4 days and 12 weeks with severe heart failure that was refractory to optimal conventional treatment with diuretics were treated with enalapril. The starting dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day, increasing according to response to 0.12-0.43 mg/kg/day. One infant with severe myocarditis did not tolerate enalapril because of hypotension and later died of intractable heart failure. Six of the remaining patients had congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts and one had a simple aortic coarctation. Two weeks after starting enalapril the clinical features of heart failure had improved in all the infants, the mean (SEM) plasma sodium concentration had increased from 129 (2.4) to 136 (1.1) mmol/l and plasma urea concentration had fallen from 7.0 (0.85) to 2.9 (0.85) mmol/l.

After 10 days, T4 increased (P less than .01) heart rate, left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and LV weight/body weight, but did not alter LV systolic pressure (SP) or enddiastolic pressure (EDP). Compared to treatment with T4 alone, captopril plus T4 decreased LV SP (P less than .05) and LV EDP (P less than .01); however, heart rate, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged. Treatment with T4 plus propranolol decreased heart rate and LV EDP (P less than .05) compared to T4 alone; however, LV SP, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged (P greater than .05). Hydralazine did not alter (P greater than .05) heart rate, LV SP, LV EDP or prevent the development of increased LV weight/body weight when given with T4; however, LV dP/dt was slightly decreased (P less than .05).

A-II infusion increased (15-25%) both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the normal state and during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, whereas the increase during diuretic-stimulated renin-angiotensin system function was less. The plasma RS concentration was measured by both direct and indirect RIA. The mean basal plasma RS levels, measured with direct assay, were 1516 +/- 150 (SE) in the normal state, 1566 +/- 150 after diuretic administration, and 1650 +/- 133 nmol/L after enalapril administration. The corresponding mean basal plasma RS levels measured with the indirect assay were 1073 +/- 100, 1031 +/- 57, and 902 +/- 78 nmol/L, respectively. Plasma RS levels did not change during or after the A-II infusions, whereas PRA decreased significantly in all experimental conditions. The results suggest that A-II exerts no direct stimulatory effect on hepatic release of RS. Thus, A-II appears not to be important in the short term regulation of plasma RS levels.", 
    "162": "To assess angiotensin (ANG II) dependence of evolving neonatally induced coarctation hypertension (NICH) in inbred pups, we randomized sex-matched littermates to high-dose converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI: MK-421, 3 mg/kg) or placebo from the time of neonatal aortic banding (coarcted) vs. no banding (control). During phase 1 studies over 4 mo postbanding during ad libitum Na+ intake (Bagby and Fuchs, Hypertension Dallas in press). CEI failed to prevent evolution of proximal blood pressure (BP) excess or to impair renal function. Phase 2 studies examine, in the same pups, responses to low Na+ (LS) diet superimposed on chronic CEI at 4 mo, timed to allow development of BP increase in untreated NICH. The present report details metabolic handling and balances of Na+, K+, and fluid for 3 days before (normal Na+ intake) and daily for 11 days after initiation of LS diet, a companion paper describes BP, renin-angiotensin (RA), and renal functional responses. In no case did metabolic responses of coarcted pups to LS diet differ from those of controls, whether on CEI or placebo, whereas responses to LS diet and to CEI reveal positive findings of independent interest. LS diet induced expected renal and fecal Na+ conservation, no net effect on K+ balance, and, despite unexpected free-water diuresis, mild hyponatremia. Chronic CEI impaired maximal renal (but not fecal) Na+ conservation during LS diet, caused exaggerated free-water diuresis but no change in fluid balance, and thus, with the larger Na+ deficit, accounted for greater hyponatremia. CEI caused no net effect on K+ balance. Results indicate normal renal handling of fluid, Na+, and K+ in evolving NICH and provide no evidence for selective intrarenal RA activation or exaggerated ANG II dependence. Findings also suggest that, during LS diet, ANG II is 1) essential for maximum renal Na+ conservation and normal free-water handling, and 2) not essential for fecal Na+ and water conservation or for maintenance of normal water and K+ balances. Results are also compatible with a CEI-induced thirst stimulation and/or osmotic insensitivity and with functional vasopressin deficiency during LS diet.", 
    "163": "To assess the renin-angiotensin (RA) dependence of evolving neonatally induced coarctation hypertension (NICH) in inbred pups, we randomized sex-matched littermates to a high dose of converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI:MK-421) or placebo from the time of neonatal aortic banding (coarcted) vs. no banding (control). In phase 1 studies, pups were examined serially on normal diet (Bagby and Fuchs, Hypertension In press.): chronic CEI lowered systolic blood pressure (BP) equally in coarcted and controls and failed to prevent systolic BP excess in coarcted dogs. In phase 2 studies, the same pups were exposed to a low sodium (LS) diet at 4 mo of age, a time when the untreated NICH model exhibits increased forelimb systolic BP. Measurements of systolic BP, RA components, renal function, and extracellular volume (ECV) were made before and serially during 12 days on the LS diet. Responses of coarcted and control pups to the LS diet were similar, with or without CEI, providing no evidence for exaggerated angiotensin II (ANG II) dependence in evolving NICH. Independently of coarctation status, chronic CEI significantly modified RA and renal functional responses to the LS diet: a greater renin rise but abnormal renin substrate fall, thus no rise in ANG I or ANG I generation rate; a greater rise in creatinine and a trend toward a greater fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Despite these findings compatible with sustained ANG II deficit, chronic CEI unexpectedly failed to impair maintenance of systolic BP during a superimposed LS diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "164": "Ten daily injections of gentamicin, 40 mg/kg/d intraperitoneal (IP), produced a marked reduction in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) of virgin female Munich-Wistar rats without eliciting significant reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or single nephron (SN)GFR. A similar gentamicin-induced decrease in Kf was seen in midterm pregnant (day 12) rats and the normal gestational increase in GFR and SNGFR was blunted by gentamicin. Concomitant converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) (MK 421, 50 mg/L drinking water) completely prevented the gentamicin-induced decrease in Kf in virgin females, thus confirming that the gentamicin-induced decline in Kf is mediated by angiotensin II (ANG II). These studies indicate that pregnancy neither exacerbates nor ameliorates gentamicin-induced glomerulotoxicity and also that glomerular ANG II responsivity is not diminished in midterm pregnant rats.", 
    "165": "The safety of 738 high-risk patients treated with enalapril under various clinical programs was evaluated. High risk was defined as the presence of a collagen vascular disease; a renal disease, including renovascular hypertension; or either hypertension or refractory cardiac failure with serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl at baseline. Essential hypertension was the primary diagnosis in most of these patients. Treatment with enalapril in these patients usually continued without interruption for the length of the particular protocol. The incidence of adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of treatment was comparable to that observed with other standard antihypertensive therapies in patients with milder forms of disease. No enalapril-related neutropenia, proteinuria, dysgeusia or ageusia were reported in these high-risk patients. The incidence of discontinuation due to rash was less than 0.5%. Resolution and/or improvement of captopril-related adverse effects was observed in many patients crossed over to treatment with enalapril. In patients with collagen vascular diseases and those with severe impairment of renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl), the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse experiences or death as well as the profile of reported adverse experiences was similar to those for the total group of high-risk patients. The data suggest that enalapril is efficacious and well tolerated by the high-risk patients.", 
    "166": "In inbred dogs with neonatally induced coarctation hypertension, prior serial studies during the first year after aortic banding showed extracellular volume excess with normal plasma renin activity (PRA). The present studies test the hypothesis that slowly evolving aortic constriction in this model will yield intrarenal angiotensin II excess, peripherally undetectable, with continuous slightly positive sodium balance, and thus that chronic blockade of angiotensin II formation will prevent generation of hypertension. Accordingly, we used MK421 (enalapril, 3 mg/kg twice daily), a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or placebo, administered orally, from the time of banding through 4 months after banding in sex-matched littermates randomly assigned to one of four groups: coarcted/MK421; control/MK421; coarcted/placebo; control/placebo. Results indicate that MK421 caused identical lowering of absolute forelimb systolic blood pressure in coarcted and control pups but failed to modify evolution of a significant (p less than 0.005) systolic blood pressure difference in coarcted versus control dogs. Thus, neither temporal course nor final magnitude of relative hypertension was altered by MK421. Efficacy of MK421 was documented by 83% inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I at nadir of drug effect and by sustained increases in angiotensin I and renin concentration throughout the period of study. Coarcted and control pups responded similarly to MK421 for all measured variables. Glomerular filtration rate and extracellular volume (measured by [14C]inulin disappearance) did not differ among groups. Thus, chronic administration of MK421 failed to prevent hypertension and did not impair maintenance of normal renal function in the evolving phase of neonatally induced coarctation hypertension. We conclude that, although angiotensin II may participate in the untreated model, it does not appear essential to generation of hypertension. We propose that the renal pressure-natriuresis mechanism regulates distal pressure, that stenosis-related resistance independently determines the proximal-distal difference, and that chronic converting enzyme inhibition lowers the set point of the former without influencing stenosis evolution, thus secondarily lowering proximal pressure by an equal degree.", 
    "167": "In clearance studies, we analyzed the effect of Ca2+ entry blockade with nitrendipine treatment (20 mg b.i.d. for 4 days) and of converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril treatment (20 mg b.i.d. for 4 days) on renal response to atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (25 micrograms bolus followed by an infusion of 0.03 microgram/kg/min for 90 minutes) in six healthy volunteers who were taking 300 mmol sodium daily. In a control study ANF was administered without Ca2+ entry blockade or converting enzyme inhibition. Natriuresis rose from 239 +/- 38 to 605 +/- 137 mumol/min in the control study (p less than 0.05), from 330 +/- 53 to 943 +/- 152 mumol/min with Ca2+ entry blockade (p less than 0.05), and from 236 +/- 22 to 344 +/- 39 mumol/min with converting enzyme inhibition (NS). ANF induced a rise in maximal free water clearance, inulin clearance, and in the excretion of multiple electrolytes except potassium. Fractional lithium reabsorption fell. In general, these effects were stronger during Ca2+ entry blockade and blunted during converting enzyme inhibition. p-Aminohippurate clearance tended to decrease during the control study (NS), remained constant during Ca2+ entry blockade, and decreased significantly when ANF was infused during converting enzyme inhibition (p less than 0.05 vs. control and vs. Ca2+ entry blockade study). Blood pressure was lowered by Ca2+ entry blockade and, to a somewhat greater extent, by converting enzyme inhibition, but ANF administration induced no additional fall except for a short-term drop during Ca2+ entry blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "168": "The influence of chronic treatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, kidney function, and survival was examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP that were fed a Japanese rat chow plus a 1% NaCl drinking solution beginning at 7-8 weeks of age developed severe hypertension and stroke; 14 of 18 untreated control SHRSP died by 14 weeks of age and exhibited evidence of cerebrovascular lesions. When enalapril (15 mg/kg/day) was included in the drinking solution of 15 SHRSP, blood pressure was initially reduced by only a slight degree, whereas survival improved markedly; only one of 10 SHRSP died before the rest were killed at 18 to 21 weeks. The remaining five enalapril-treated SHRSP lived beyond 36 weeks and on histological examination exhibited no evidence of cerebrovascular lesions. Chronic enalapril treatment also prevented the greater urinary excretion of protein and severe renal lesions observed in untreated SHRSP but did not affect urinary salt and water excretion. In anesthetized rats, glomerular filtration rate and tubular reabsorption of water were lower in untreated control SHRSP when compared with enalapril-treated SHRSP. Mean arterial pressure was comparable in both groups. These data support a possible role for ACE inhibition in the prevention of stroke and maintenance of kidney function independent of any marked change in blood pressure of SHRSP. Whether the protective effects of ACE inhibition relate to reduced angiotensin II formation, increased tissue kinins, or another mechanism remains to be determined.", 
    "169": "We have studied the effects of long-term treatment with different antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure and mesenteric resistance vessel structure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), both during treatment and after withdrawal of treatment. Young SHR were treated from 4 to 24 weeks with five different drugs: perindopril (1.5 mg/kg per day), captopril (60 mg/kg per day), hydralazine (25 mg/kg per day), isradipine (42 mg/kg per day) and metoprolol (130 mg/kg per day). At 24 weeks, 24-h mean blood pressures (MBP), measured invasively, were 121 mmHg (perindopril), 137 mmHg (captopril), 140 mmHg (hydralazine), 149 mmHg (isradipine) and 146 mmHg (metoprolol), compared to control values of 177 mmHg (SHR) and 132 mmHg (Wistar-Kyoto rats, WKY). Mesenteric resistance vessel structure, measured as media:lumen ratio (m:l), was also reduced to different extents: to WKY-level by perindopril (m:l = 4.4%), to midway between SHR- and WKY-levels by captopril, hydralazine and isradipine (m:l = 5.9%), and not at all by metoprolol (m:l = 6.8%). When treatment was discontinued, low MBP (ca 151 mmHg) persisted for 12 weeks in rats treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril and captopril), but rose rapidly in rats which had received the other treatments. At 3-12 weeks after withdrawal of treatment vascular structure was closely correlated with the blood pressure expected from the SHR- and WKY-control values, as were the left ventricle: body weight ratios. The results suggest that the ability of a drug to control vascular structure during treatment is not in itself a predictor of a persistent effect on blood pressure after withdrawal of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "170": "This study primarily sought to determine whether the role of vasopressin (VP) in maintenance of arterial blood pressure is enhanced in awake, chronically instrumented baboons after 68-72 h of dehydration. This question was approached by pharmacologically blocking vasopressin V1-receptors in euhydrated and dehydrated baboons with or without a normally functioning renin-angiotensin system (RAS). VP blockade during dehydration produced a rapidly occurring (within 5 min), statistically significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 5 +/- 1 mmHg in the RAS-intact condition and an identical decline in MAP (5 +/- 1 mmHg) during blockade of the RAS by captopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor. At 15 min after induction of VP blockade, heart rate was elevated by 9 +/- 2 beats/min in the RAS-intact condition and by 20 +/- 5 beats/min in the RAS-blocked condition. In addition, VP blockade in the dehydrated state produced small and equal increases in hindlimb vascular conductance in RAS-intact and RAS-blocked conditions. None of these cardiovascular changes were produced by VP blockade in the euhydrated state. RAS blockade produced modest declines in MAP in both hydration states, but the fall was larger by 7 +/- 4 mmHg in the dehydrated state. Thus both VP and the RAS contribute to the maintenance of arterial blood pressure during dehydration in the conscious baboon.", 
    "171": "The microvasculature is known to be a source of a number of vasoregulatory prostanoids. In the kidney, these prostanoids have been proposed to influence vascular, tubular, and glomerular function. A rapid method for isolation of large numbers of preglomerular renal microvessels (interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles) from the rabbit kidney has recently been developed in this laboratory. In the current report, we describe methods to culture endothelial cells derived from these isolated renal microvessels. Endothelial cells in primary and continuous cultures were grown in monolayers on culture dishes and plates. These cells demonstrated morphology consistent with that described for other endothelial cells in culture including the presence of Weibel-Palade bodies as seen by electron microscopy. The presence of factor VIII immunofluorescence and angiotensin converting-enzyme activity was also observed. The cultured endothelial cells synthesized a number of common prostanoids under in vitro conditions and the hierarchy of biosynthesis was PGE2 greater than PGF2 alpha greater than PGI2 greater than TxA2. The ratio of the in vitro biosynthesis of PGI2:PGE2 was approximately 1:5, as compared with a 3-5:1 ratio seen in freshly isolated intact microvessels. Prostanoid biosynthesis increased in the cultured endothelial cells in the presence of arachidonic acid (1 and 10 microM), A23187 (10 microM), thrombin (5 U/ml), or bradykinin (1 microM) and decreased with mepacrine (10 microM)-or indomethacin (100 microM), suggesting that these cells were metabolically responsive to a variety of prostanoid stimulators and inhibitors. In summary, endothelial cells can be cultured from freshly isolated preglomerular renal microvessels and have the ability to produce a number of vasoregulatory prostanoids under in vitro conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "172": "Frequently reported adverse inflammatory skin and airway reactions have been reported in subjects being medicated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. Intradermally evoked wheal and flare reactions to ovalbumin, capsaicin and bradykinin, in ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs, was previously demonstrated to be enhanced by pretreatment with the ACE-inhibitor MK 422 (the active parent diacid of enalapril). In vitro results from this study demonstrate that the ACE-inhibitor MK 422 degranulated guinea pig lung and skin mast cells as well as human basophils, and enhanced allergen-evoked histamine release. Local capsaicin pretreatment in vivo of guinea pig skin decreased spontaneous and allergen-triggered release of histamine in vitro from skin mast cells. No clear enhancing effect of MK 422 was seen on the allergen-triggered histamine release in vitro from capsaicin pretreated skin, and the spontaneous release was unaffected by the ACE-inhibitor. The allergen-triggered wheal and flare reaction in ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs was potentiated by MK 422 and the late phase reaction of the inflammatory response was especially augmented. Capsaicin pretreatment of the guinea pigs abolished this late phase reaction as well as the inflammatory enhancing effect of MK 422. Our in vitro results from capsaicin pretreated skin indicate that the reduced inflammatory response in vivo in capsaicin pretreated skin is due not only to capsaicin induced depletion of neuropeptides from sensory nerves, but also to secondary degranulation of mast cells by one or more of these peptides.",

The second group of 23 patients (HCTZ) was given 20 mg/day enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day and, when necessary, 50 mg).

    "174": "The effects of perindoprilat on renal hemodynamics and the elimination of water and electrolytes were studied acutely in the anesthetized dog. Two groups of animals were compared, one on normal sodium and water, the other on an acutely restricted sodium and water diet. In all cases, perindoprilat injected into renal artery (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) reduced blood pressure. In the animals on a low sodium diet, perindoprilat increased renal blood flow from 2.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min/g and decreased the filtration fraction; the decrease in renal vascular resistance predominated on the efferent arteriole of the glomerule (45% decrease), preferential site for the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II. In the animals on a normal sodium diet, renal blood flow was also increased from 4.1 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 0.6 ml/min/g but without the filtration fraction being affected. The renal vascular resistance was decreased at both pre- and post-glomerular levels (respectively, 50 and 25% decrease). After sodium and water restriction, but not in animals on a normal sodium diet, perindoprilat increased the fractional elimination of water and electrolytes. This salidiuresis might be accounted for by the hemodynamic effect of converting enzyme inhibitor and the decrease it elicits in filtration fraction, modifying sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule.",

In 27 pigs, ischemia was induced by 60-min occlusion of the left coronary artery. Four pigs died of ventricular fibrillation during ischemia, and six others died within 24 h due to pump failure. Of the 17 survivors, eight pigs developed a sustained (greater than 30 s) monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (sVT) after programmed electrical stimulation. In nine noninducible pigs, an AII infusion (0.6 microgram/kg/min) caused inducible sVT in three animals and nonsustained VT in two animals (greater than 10 reentrant beats). In two of the remaining four animals, spontaneous premature ventricular beats appeared during the infusion. In a group of five healthy pigs, the electrophysiological effects of AII were evaluated. Infusion of AII caused a rapid and sustained increase in arterial blood pressure to 161 +/- 6.4% (p less than 0.001). The sinus cycle length decreased to 74 +/- 5.2% (p less than 0.02). The effective refractory period of the right ventricle decreased significantly to 82 +/- 5.5% (p less than 0.05). These results show that modulation of the renin-angiotensin system after myocardial infarction influences the inducibility of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as shown by the increased inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia. This may be related to a decreased ventricular refractoriness. Therefore, it is suggested that C can reduce malignant ventricular tachycardia late after myocardial infarction by preventing the deleterious arrhythmogenic effects of AII.", 
    "176": "A method is described for the extraction of a phosphonic acid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor from either urine or plasma, and subsequent quantitation using high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis and post-column o-phthalaldehyde reagent derivatization. The compound cannot be quantitatively extracted from the body fluids, but use of a fluorinated internal standard allowed for the computation of accurate results. With the use of an internal standard, excellent precision, linearity, and recovery were obtained for analyte response in both urine and plasma. In urine a working range of 0.2-10 micrograms/ml was found, with a limit of detection of 0.1 micrograms/ml. For plasma the working range was found to be 2-500 ng/ml, and the limit of detection was established as 1 ng/ml. Due to the non-polar character of the analyte at low pH values, it was possible to use novel extraction (solid-phase C8 column) and HPLC [poly(styrenedivinyl benzene) HPLC column] conditions to separate and quantitate the compound from plasma and urine.", 
    "177": "In mammals, dihydroorotase is part of a trifunctional protein, dihydroorotate synthetase, which catalyzes the first three reactions of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Dihydroorotase catalyzes the formation of a peptide-like bond between the terminal ureido nitrogen and the beta-carboxyl group of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate to yield heterocyclic L-dihydroorotate. A variety of evidence suggests that dihydroorotase may have a catalytic mechanism similar to that of a zinc protease [Christopherson, R. I., & Jones, M. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3358-3370]. Tight-binding inhibitors of the zinc proteases, carboxypeptidase A, thermolysin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme have been synthesized that combine structural features of the substrates with a thiol or carboxyl group in an appropriate position to coordinate a zinc atom bound at the catalytic site. We have synthesized (4R)-2-oxo-6-thioxohexahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylate (L-6-thiodihydroorotate) and have found that this analogue is a potent competitive inhibitor of dihydroorotase with a dissociation constant (Ki) in the presence of excess Zn2+ ion of 0.17 +/- 0.02 microM at pH 7.4. The potency of inhibition by L-6-thiodihydroorotate in the presence of divalent metal ions decreases in the order Zn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Ni2+; L-6-thiodihydroorotate alone is less inhibitory and has a Ki of 0.85 +/- 0.14 microM. 6-Thioorotate has a Ki of 82 +/- 8 microM which decreases to 3.8 +/- 1.4 microM in the presence of Zn2+. Zn2+ alone is a moderate inhibitor of dihydroorotase and does not enhance the potency of other inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "178": "The effect of the selective kinin B1 receptor agonist des-Arg9-BK was studied on blood pressure and on the in vitro aorta of rabbits pretreated 18 h earlier with lipopolysaccharide from E. coli, an infusion of bradykinin or with one of three angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril, enalapril or teprotide. The hypotensive response in vivo and contractile response seen on the in vitro aorta was selectively increased to des-Arg9-BK in all pretreated groups compared to controls, effects which were blocked by the selective competitive kinin B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9-[Leu8]BK. Dexamethasone given to lipopolysaccharide pretreated rabbits had no effect on the increased hypotensive response seen with des-Arg9-BK. The skin vascular permeability response to des-Arg9-BK, bradykinin and histamine remained unchanged in the groups pretreated with lipopolysaccharide or captopril compared to controls. The possible mechanism(s) whereby angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce this effect and the possible relevance to the inflammatory side-effects seen with this group of drugs is discussed.", 
    "179": "This study evaluated the overall efficacy and safety of two specific vasodilators--the alpha-blocker prazosin and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril--in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Because the current approach to antihypertensive treatment should consider possible drug-related changes in circulating lipid fractions, the present study investigated the effects of these two drugs on lipid parameters as well. Used either as single agents or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, both drugs effectively reduced high blood pressure. Neither drug had adverse effects on the lipid profile in general, although there were significant differences between the effects of prazosin and captopril on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B.",

After eight weeks of placebo administration, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with prazosin or enalapril and then treated with the alternate drug after a second eight-week placebo washout period. The dose was titrated from 1 mg to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily of prazosin and from 2.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg twice daily of enalapril to achieve a reduction in diastolic blood pressure to less than 85 mm Hg, with a decrease of at least 10 mm Hg based on clinical measurements of blood pressure. Patients received maintenance therapy with each medication for at least eight weeks. The response to therapy was then evaluated with two-hour periods of automated blood pressure monitoring. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressures for all patients during these two-hour monitoring periods decreased by 10.3 +/- 1.9/8.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg during prazosin therapy and by 9.0 +/- 5.1/5.8 +/- 3.4 mm Hg during enalapril therapy. All patients responded to one of the two drugs, but only 50 percent responded to both. Side effects were generally mild and transient, and no significant metabolic effects were observed. Both prazosin and enalapril were effective and well tolerated in this population of elderly patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "181": "In small series of selected hypertensive diabetic patients the short-term benefit of antihypertensive treatments is well documented. The purpose of this study was to analyse the management of arterial hypertension in a cohort of 612 insulin-treated diabetic out-patients routinely and consecutively examined in a diabetologic clinic between January 1, 1985 and April 1, 1986. The prevalence of arterial hypertension (i.e. patients with blood pressure values greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg or on antihypertensive treatment) was 38 per cent (232 patients). One hundred and eighty-two patients (29.7 per cent) received an antihypertensive treatment (one drug 78 per cent, two drugs 17 per cent, three drugs 5 per cent). In decreasing order of frequency these drugs were: beta-blockers, diuretics, central acting agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists. In treated hypertensive diabetic patients the mean +/- SD systolic blood pressure (157.1 +/- 19.1 mmHg) and diastolic pressure (85.3 +/- 9.3 mmHg) remained higher than in patients without antihypertensive treatment (133.4 +/- 17.2 and 77.8 +/- 8.3 mmHg respectively). One hundred and forty-two diabetic patients still had blood pressure values greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg during visits; 92 were on antihypertensive treatment, 50 were untreated. In hypertensive diabetic patients the mean total glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) level was higher than in normotensive diabetic patients (9 +/- 1.6 versus 8.6 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.05). Hypertensive insulin-treated diabetics are the most seriously ill patients, they are under inadequate care. Wrong choice of antihypertensive drugs, incorrect goals of blood pressure reduction, lack of information and education to improve compliance were the main reasons for the poor results of this study.", 
    "182": "Relationship between blood pressure and brain renin was studied in four groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY); as controls (n = 5), administered captopril (n = 5), trichlormethiazide (n = 5) and atenolol (n = 5). 1) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of captopril-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and captopril-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and striatum of captopril-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and captopril-administered WKY. 2) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of trichlormethiazide administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and trichlormethiazide-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and midbrain of trichlormethiazide-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and trichlormethiazide-administered WKY. 3) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of atenolol-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and atenolol-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and midbrain of atenolol-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and atenolol-administered WKY. These results suggest that the production and/or activation of renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain and striatum play an important role in the initiation and/or development of hypertension of SHR by the local generation of angiotensin II.",

We therefore studied the effects of ambulatory treatment with captopril on pulmonary function and on nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in 15 hypertensive subjects. Lung volumes, expiratory flows and nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to methacholine using doses up to 64 g/L were measured before and four and eight weeks after captopril treatment was started. Throughout the study the subjects recorded respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates. In four subjects a persistent cough developed related to the use of captopril, but this was not associated with the development of airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The mean provocative concentration of methacholine that resulted in a 20% fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 43.6 +/- 1.8 g/L after eight weeks of captopril treatment compared with 61.6 +/- 1.2 g/L at the baseline evaluation. We concluded that there was no significant change in lung function during treatment with captopril. The development of a cough related to this medication is not associated with the development of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness.", 
    "184": "The cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy is defined as the costs of treatment less the savings from the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction, relative to the therapeutic effectiveness of treatment. Since antihypertensive therapy actually increases the dollar cost of medical care, the use of more expensive agents needs to be justified in terms of better blood pressure control, improved quality of life, and reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Data from the clinical trials have not shown the more expensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers to be superior to the less expensive agents such as diuretic drugs in reducing blood pressure or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Poor compliance may reduce both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Physicians must play an active role in prompting compliance by assuring the patient's ability to incorporate the prescribed dosage regimen into daily routine, by actively monitoring compliance, by modifying the regimen appropriately to remove the cause of noncompliance, and by switching medication if it is ineffective or if adverse effects occur.", 
    "185": "Although it is a common belief that all antihypertensive agents are equally effective in reducing blood pressure, there is some evidence to the contrary, both in the general population and when specific patient demographics are considered. In black patients, beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be less effective at reducing blood pressure than the thiazide diuretics. After age 60, the percentage of responders to beta blockers is less than with calcium antagonists, and a higher percentage of elderly patients also achieve normotensive blood pressure levels with diuretic therapy than with beta blockers. When a thiazide diuretic is added to an ACE inhibitor, beta blocker or calcium antagonist, the number of normotensive responders increases significantly. Combinations of some other agents (i.e., an ACE inhibitor plus a beta blocker) may not, however, improve efficacy. Diuretics, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are all generally well tolerated, with a 9 to 10% incidence of subjective side effects. The use of calcium antagonists and especially the centrally acting adrenergic inhibitors may result in more frequent adverse effects. Data from long-term, diuretic-based clinical trials do not support the statement that diuretic therapy results in sustained elevations in lipid levels. These trials have shown cholesterol levels to be at or below baseline after long-term diuretic therapy. The use of beta blockers, on the other hand, may result in long-term elevation of triglyceride levels and a slight decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors do not affect lipid levels, and alpha blockers may actually lower cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "186": "Calcium ionophore A23187 (0.3-0.4 microM) elevated cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE) 2-7-fold after 48 h incubation with bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture. Cycloheximide (0.1 micrograms/ml) blocked the elevation in ACE produced by A23187. The increase in ACE was inhibited by 0.2 mM EGTA, 50 microM verapamil and 50 microM nifedipine, and was not associated with changes in cellular cAMP. Melittin, a phospholipase A2 activator, or addition of exogenous arachidonic acid failed to reproduce the elevation, and indomethacin only partially blocked the A23187 effect. The elevation of ACE was also inhibited by the calcium-calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium. Thus, we postulate that the ionophore A23187 elevates ACE in endothelial cells through a calcium-dependent mechanism other than phospholipase A2 activation. The elevation depends on new protein synthesis and involves calcium-calmodulin-dependent cellular mechanisms.", 
    "187": "Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was hypothesized to be a potential scavenger of free radicals because of the presence of a thiol group. The scavenging action of captopril was examined against superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (OH.), hypohalite radical (HOCL) either generated biochemically, or derived from activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Our results indicate that captopril is an extremely potent free radical scavenger, scavenging power being as effective as superoxide dismutase (SOD) against O2-, or dimethylthiourea against OH., but better than allopurinol against OCL. plus HOCL. Free radical scavenging action of captopril against PMN-derived free radical is equivalent to the combined effects of SOD, catalase and allopurinol.", 
    "188": "Mean arterial blood pressure was measured over a 24-hour period from the femoral artery of conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats. Oral administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617 significantly lowered mean arterial pressure. In contrast, both the thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 and the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13505 lacked an antihypertensive action in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. When administered concurrently, the thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 potentiated the antihypertensive action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617. This effect was not observed with the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13505. In addition to CGS 16617, CGS 12970 also potentiated the hypotensive effect of two structurally dissimilar angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, benazapril HCL and captopril. Indomethacin blocked the thromboxane synthase inhibition-induced potentiation of the antihypertensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 had no effect on the hypotension induced by hydralazine, indicating that the hypotension is not a nonspecific action related to the fall in blood pressure. These results may suggest that converting enzyme inhibition augments the levels and actions of a hormone that stimulates prostaglandin formation. It is well established that thromboxane synthase inhibitors eliminate the formation of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 and allow reorientation of eicosanoid production toward the formation of vasodilating prostaglandins, which could enhance the antihypertensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

The study concerned 26 patients (pts), 72.5 +/- 8.1 years old, with a severe congestive heart failure (NYHA Class IV). Before treatment serum creatinine was slightly increased and the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) - Captopril 58.9 +/- 17.3 mg/j or enalapril 9.2 +/- 4.4 mg - impaired renal function from 132.0 +/- 50.7 mumol/l to 183.5 +/- 139.3 mumol/l (n = 26; p less than 0.05).

The cause of heart failure was an ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 15 patients (chi 2 test, p less than 0.05), a dilated cardiomyopathy in 4 pts and an aortic or mitral valvular regurgitation in 2 pts.

The disposition of both compounds was studied in rat, dog and baboon after peroral and intravenous dosing of 14C-labelled preparations (2.5-3 mg/kg). Perorally dosed benazeprilat was poorly absorbed in rats, whereas benazepril.HCl was well absorbed in all species. Onset of absorption of benazepril.HCl was fast. Plasma concentrations of radioactivity indicated a prolonged absorption process. Upon intravenous benazepril.HCl, plasma levels declined rapidly in all species but showed a slow terminal elimination phase. Distribution to all organs and tissues occurred rapidly and was typical for an acid compound. Passage of the blood-brain barrier and of the placenta occurred to a minimal extent. No accumulation was observed after repeated dose. Radioactivity was rapidly and completely eliminated; biliary excretion was important. In the rat, benazepril was completely hydrolysed by first pass metabolism to the pharmacologically active benazeprilat.

While post-treatment of TMT-treated rats with captopril brought about a significant improvement in 3 out of 25 trials, pre-treatment of rats for 3 weeks with captopril did not reverse the behavioural deficits produced by TMT in the Morris maze test. Captopril treatment did not block the characteristic hyperactivity or the deficits in passive avoidance behaviour of TMT-treated animals.",

The acute and chronic effects of ACE-I on renal function are reviewed in this paper. The kidney is an important target organ of essential hypertension and some antihypertensive drugs have been shown to decrease renal haemodynamic parameters. In hypertensives with normal renal function, ACE-I were demonstrated to be safe drugs: after acute and chronic administration of these drugs, the drop in blood pressure was accompanied by unchanged or increased GFR and RPF, with decreased renal vascular resistance. Only in patients with renovascular hypertension, with bilateral stenosis or solitary kidney, was there a deterioration in renal function.", 
    "194": "The effect of captopril on urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2 and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was studied in 13 healthy volunteers during normal and low sodium diet. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition led to marked increase in plasma renin activity during both dietary periods without significant modification of plasma aldosterone during normal sodium diet. Prostaglandin E2 significantly increased after captopril during both sodium intakes. Captopril did not change significantly urinary excretion of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2. The results indicate that the hypotensive response to captopril in normal subjects is related to the state of sodium balance. Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is the major contributor to this response, it is possible that prostaglandin E2 mediates at least partly the hypotensive and diuretic response to captopril.",

As controls, seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were involved in the study.

The above-mentioned therapy was completed with daily 3 x 12.5-mg or 3 x 25-mg oral Captopril doses. Significant improvement proved by chest X-ray, echocardiography, and clinical data was observed in four of the ischaemic heart disease patients and three of the dilated cardiomyopathic patients. In other two patients each the improvement was temporary, after 6 weeks of therapy deterioration of the disease was observed. Notable change was not observed in response to Captopril in one ischaemic and two primary cardiomyopathic patients. Tensiomin may be considered as one of the drugs of primary importance in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure.",

We asked whether ACE inhibition decreases IOP through effects on CA-dependent flow of aqueous humor (AH) and whether ACE inhibitors decrease other CA-dependent secretions. We show in anesthetized rabbits (a) that topical inhibitors of ACE decrease both IOP and AH flow as much as systemic inhibitors of CA; (b) that the maximal effects of ACE and CA inhibition are not additive, therefore these treatments may affect one or more components of a single system for fluid production; and that (c) ACE inhibitors do not work through inhibition of CA. Looking at other fluid production systems, we find (d) that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production is increased after ventriculocisternal perfusion with a potent ACE inhibitor and (e) that flow of pancreatic juice (PJ) is increased after systemic ACE inhibition.", 
    "197": "Baroreceptor reflex plays an important role in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Experiments in dogs could demonstrate that after complete denervation of sinoaortic and cardiopulmonar baroreceptors a long-lasting hypertension with labile blood pressure behavior occurred. The sympathetic tone was enhanced significantly when studied in denervated rats. In patients with essential hypertension no comparable conditions to the \"neurogenic hypertension\" of animals exist. Therefore, studies in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation are of interest because those patients develop severe hypertension even if cyclosporine is not administered. Preliminary results reported here support a participation of baroreceptors in hypertension of transplanted patients. A further reason of essential hypertension is found on baroreceptor resetting. Changed ion concentrations and/or wall thickness of the respective blood vessels could be the cause. The sympathetic system influences the renin-angiotensin-system and baroreflex activity by central and peripheral mechanisms. It, for example, attenuates Ang-II and the baroreflex via central actions. Converting-enzyme-inhibitors (CEI) act in part as peripheral vasodilators without affecting the heart rate significantly. This effect is possibly due to lacking Ang-II that is able to increase the sensitivity of baroreceptors. In the past it has been shown that the inhibition of tissue-converting enzyme is more responsible for the antihypertensive effects of CEI than that of plasma-converting enzyme. The cardioprotective effects of CEI are suggested to be an important advantage in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. These cardioprotective actions are partly due to accumulated bradykinin, just as are the hypotensive effects of CEI. The interactions between CEI and the sympathetic system should be differentiated into pre- and postsynaptic actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Nevertheless they have established a role as first line therapy in patients with asthma and diabetes.", 
    "199": "There is increasing evidence that a slight elevation of blood pressure values may have a deleterious effect on diabetic angiopathy. Hypertensive diabetic patients are prone to suffer clinical and/or biological side effects of antihypertensive agents. More recently calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have proved effective and better tolerated in hypertensive diabetic patients. New data from the literature and from our group are reviewed. In patients with incipient or clinical nephropathy, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduces urinary albumin excretion and preserves glomerular filtration rate. The effects of treatment of hypertension on blood pressure control obtained in small groups of selected and motivated patients are at variance from those obtained in routine practice. Poor compliance is the major problem in hypertensive diabetic patients. The rationale exists to provide early aggressive antihypertensive treatment in this population but we must develop new drugs that are more effective and better tolerated. We have also to improve health care delivery, information and education for these patients.",

Preejection period (PEP), left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and the contractility index PEP/LVET were polycardiographically determined++. Left ventricular end diastolic volume (DVol), and systolic volume (SVol), ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume index (SVI) and cardiac index (CI) were estimated using two-dimensional echocardiography. Obtained data indicate, that in patients with chronic, congestive heart failure, a single dose of captopril lowers blood pressure at rest without significant changes of hemodynamic parameters, but improves left ventricular function during physical effort.",

SOD-1 activity, platelets MDA concentration and degree of platelets aggregation were estimated before and after 1.5 and 24 hours of administration of 12.5 mg captopril single dose. Values of evaluated parameters significantly changed after 1.5 hours of captopril administration: SOD-1 activity increased whereas MDA concentration and platelets aggregation decreased; after 24 hours of drug administration values returned to initial ones.

The control group consisted of 18 healthy persons, 5 patients were in I, 12 in II and 8 in III WHO class. Monotherapy with 150 mg per day of captopril had been performed for 3 weeks. Patients were 3 times examined: 1--before therapy, 2--after 24 hours of treatment, 3--after 3 weeks of captopril therapy. It was proved, that captopril lowers arterial pressure with coexisting PRA increase and induces changes in kinins system such as: decrease of kininogen+ concentration and increase of serum prekallikrein level in comparison with their pretreatment values. Maximum PRA increase and blood pressure decrease were observed after 24 hours of captopril administration, whereas changes in kinins system were taking place during the whole observation period. Presented studies indicate that antihypertensive action of captopril is related to Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System as well as to plasma kinins one.",

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) captopril and enalapril act by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I. They cross the placenta. No teratogenic effect has been proved for either drug. A high rate of fetal mortality has been reported in several animal species for captopril but the available clinical data are not sufficient to assess the role of the ACE inhibitors in perinatal mortality, intrauterine growth retardation, and fetal distress in humans. The fetal hemodynamic parameters may be affected by captopril administration to the mother: blood pressure falls, plasma renin activity increases, ACE activity decreases. As for most antihypertensive drugs, available information on the consequences of clonidine and ACE inhibitors in the neonate and the infant now seem sufficient to appreciate the risk in maternal therapy. In contrast, they are still insufficient considering their known effects on fetal hemodynamics, cardiovascular adaptation, and brain tolerance, with or without hypoxia, as well as for their possible long-term adverse effects.", 
    "206": "It is known that inbred Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats carry a different renin allele than inbred Dahl salt-resistant (R) rats. The levels of, and responses of, renal renin and renal renin mRNA to sodium deficient diet and to sodium deficient diet plus Captopril treatment were compared in S and R rats. S rats had lower renal renin and lower renal renin mRNA than R rats on control (1% NaCl) diet. Sodium deficient diet caused a modest increase, and sodium deficient diet plus Captopril caused a very large increase in both renal renin and renal renin mRNA in both strains. In general, both S and R strains appeared to regulate renin similarly in response to provocative stimuli.", 
    "207": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) constitute a safe and effective therapeutic class for the treatment of hypertension. However, they have been incriminated in the development of certain adverse effects, the most frequently reported being alteration in renal function, development of hypotension and cough. This justified the evaluation of renal function after short-term and long-term treatment with perindopril in hypertensive subjects. In patients with normal renal function, during short-term treatment (1 and 5 days), perindopril induced an increase in renal plasma flow without any modification of the glomerular filtration rate. During long-term administration (up to 18 months of treatment), no significant variation in plasma creatinine was observed. In elderly hypertensive patients or patients with chronic renal failure, the glomerular filtration rate was also preserved, apart from a few rare cases of decreased creatinine clearance, particularly after the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. A slight increase in plasma potassium, with no clinical significance, was observed when perindopril was used as single-agent therapy. Symptomatic hypotension was rarely reported with perindopril (0.2% of cases), even under conditions of salt and water depletion. Amongst the other adverse effects of ACEIs, cough, more recently identified, was investigated in detail. Its frequency was determined in a double-blind study comparing perindopril (1.2%) and captopril (2.4%). It was also evaluated in a long-term study in 632 hypertensive patients (391 treated for 1 year); its incidence was 2.9% and it was responsible for discontinuation of treatment in 8 cases. In this study, 36 patients stopped treatment prematurely because of an adverse effect (5.7%). No harmful drug interactions were reported. The combination of a thiazide diuretic potentiates the antihypertensive effect of perindopril and is perfectly tolerated. The favorable safety profile of perindopril should be related to the correct determination of effective doses.", 
    "208": "The efficacy and safety of perindopril in hypertension (HT) in the elderly have now been clearly demonstrated. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted in 34 patients with a mean age of 84 years, we observed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 10% (p less than 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 9% (p less than 0.01) in the perindopril group. In the placebo group, the reduction observed was 5% and 4% respectively, although the difference between the two groups was not significant. The clinical and laboratory safety was satisfactory. However, in the treated group, there was a significant increase in serum potassium (p less than 0.01), which nevertheless remained within normal limits. An open study conducted in 91 patients with a mean age of 79.1 years, followed over a period of 6 months, confirmed the very good acceptability of the drug, despite the transient reduction in creatinine clearance observed in one female patient. The efficacy, evaluated less reliably in an open study, appeared to be excellent as 92.5% of patients were controlled by the end of treatment. In a study in healthy subjects, Reid observed a more intense effect on blood pressure (BP) in elderly subjects, which could be partly explained by a higher blood pressure level and by earlier and more prolonged converting enzyme inhibition (not significant). The practical value of this angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, related to its efficacy and safety, is reinforced by a theoretical value: its action on arterial compliance, its beneficial effect on cardiac function, its potential action on the renin-angiotensin system of the brain, the structural modifications induced in the arterial wall open extremely stimulating prospects in the field of aging.", 
    "209": "Right cardiac catheterization studies have demonstrated an improvement in cardiac hemodynamics in patients with heart failure following the administration of perindopril (per): reduction in ventricular filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure) and systemic resistance and an increase in cardiac output. The intensity and duration of these modifications were frequently insufficient after 2 mg, but were significant over 24 hours after 4 mg. A randomized, double-blind multicenter study versus placebo (pla) was conducted for 3 months, following a preinclusion period of 15 days, in 103 heart failure patients (stages II and III of the NYHA classification) treated with diuretic +/- digitalis. The following parameters were evaluated before (be), after 1 month (1m) and after 3 months (3 m) treatment: duration of stress test (DST) (sec), clinical severity score (SS), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), serum creatinine (Cr) (mumol/l), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mm Hg) in the supine (s) and erect (e) positions. 50 patients received per and 53 received pla; 46 patients in each group completed the double-blind period. Perindopril was administered at doses of 2 mg (n = 6) and 4 mg (n = 40). The following results were obtained: (table; see text) Three cases of acute heart failure occurred in the placebo group compared with none in the peridopril group. The efficacy of perindopril in heart failure was demonstrated by the improvement in effort capacity and severity score and by the reduction in cardiothoracic ratio. The variation in SBP and serum creatinine, in particular, reflected the good safety.", 
    "210": "The antihypertensive efficacy and acceptability of perindopril (P) were compared to those of captopril (C), atenolol (A) and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (D), in 3 double-blind parallel multicenter studies involving 165, 173, and 165 patients, respectively. Patients with essential hypertension and a supine DBP between 95 and 125 mmHg (mean 103.9, 106.2, and 105.2 mmHg, respectively) after a 1-month placebo period were randomized to P 4 mg once daily (o.d.) and either C 25 mg twice daily, or A 50 mg o.d. or D (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg o.d.) and treated for 3 months, with visits at monthly intervals. If necessary, treatment was adjusted at each visit to control BP (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg): firstly by doubling the dose and secondly, one month later, by the addition of a second drug, a diuretic in the studies versus C or A, a beta-blocker in the study versus D. At 3 months, BP control on monotherapy in the three studies was achieved in the following proportion of patients: 49% with P vs 49% with C; 55% with P vs 48% with A; 72% with P vs 72% with D. Most of the patients controlled by P received 4 mg, about 15% were controlled with 8 mg. A further percentage of patients was controlled with combination therapy, the combination with a diuretic being more effective with P than with C (26 vs 8%) or A (23 vs 10%) and the combination with a beta-blocker being less effective with P than with D (5 vs 13%). The total percentage of patients controlled was greater with P than with C (75 vs 57%, p = 0.016) or A (78 vs 58%, p = 0.006) and there was no significant difference between P and D (78 vs 84%). The drop-out rate due to side-effects was up to 6% with P, similar to that observed with C (4%), A (5%) and D (5%). Most of the complaints reported with P were minor and non-specific, their incidence being similar to that observed with the other drugs. Cough was reported with both P (1%) and C (2%) as well as with A (1%) and D (1%). Compared to these drugs, the biological acceptability of P was good, no case of renal failure being observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "211": "We studied the effect of perindopril, administered for a period of 9 months, on renal function, albuminuria and glycemic control of diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. After 1 month of placebo, 40 insulin-treated patients were divided into 3 groups based on the level of albuminuria. Group I had normal albuminuria (less than 15 mg/24 hr), group II had pathological microalbuminuria (15-150 mg/24 hr) and group III had macroproteinuria (greater than 150 mg/24 hr). They were given perindopril (4 or 8 mg) once daily. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized within the first 3 months in 80% of the patients. Twenty-nine of these patients (13, 9 and 7 from groups I, II and III, respectively) were followed for a total treatment period of 9 months. They were matched for age, duration of diabetes and hypertension, daily insulin dose, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and quality of glycemic control. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 14 and 17% at 1 and 9 months, respectively. Heart rate was not significantly modified. At 3 months, the angiotensin converting enzyme activity was markedly inhibited, while plasma renin activity was increased. In patients in group II, microalbuminuria was reduced from 59 +/- 13 to 32 +/- 6 mg/24 hr after 1 month and this effect was maintained at 9 months. Despite similar decreases in blood pressure, no significant change in the albumin excretion rate was observed in patients in groups I and III. Creatinine clearance remained stable and glycemic control did not change throughout the study in the 3 groups. We conclude that perindopril normalizes blood pressure in a large majority of hypertensive diabetic patients without affecting the quality of diabetes control. It also induces a marked and sustained reduction in microalbuminuria in patients at risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "212": "Ambulatory blood pressure measurements are better at predicting the outcome of hypertension than single measurements. Since cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are mainly related to large artery damage in hypertensive patients, non-invasive indices of arterial distensibility, such as pulse wave velocity, have been proposed for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk. Indeed, pulse wave velocity is positively correlated with blood pressure (BP) when measured by ambulatory recordings, while there is no correlation with clinical mercury sphygmomanometer readings. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as perindopril not only reduce high blood pressure, but also increase arterial compliance and distensibility. This latter effect could lead to a more marked decrease in systolic blood pressure than diastolic blood pressure following long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors. This has been demonstrated using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril for three months. The correlation coefficient between ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure before (r = 0.82) and after (r = 0.76) perindopril was significant. Comparison of the corresponding slopes indicated that, for any given value of diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower after perindopril than before perindopril. The action of the drug on the arterial wall may therefore explain the more marked effect on systolic blood pressure than on diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "213": "This review of the pharmacological effects of perindopril based on data in the literature, consists of three approaches: i) demonstration of the antihypertensive effect; ii) characterization of converting enzyme inhibition; iii) understanding of the mechanisms of action. The antihypertensive effect of perindopril has been demonstrated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and in renovascular hypertension (1 clip-2 kidney or 1 clip-1 kidney). Its intensity and duration are dose-dependent; they are increased in the presence of stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (renovascular hypertension, sodium depletion). Peripheral vascular resistance is decreased, while cardiac output and heart rate are not increased. This vasodilatation is predominant in the renal vascular bed and is accompanied, in the salt and water restricted dog, by increased sodium excretion. These effects are accompanied by inhibition of the converting enzyme activity. In vitro, perindoprilat (the principal active diacid metabolite of perindopril) is a potent (IC50: 1.5 to 3.2 nM) and relatively specific competitive converting enzyme inhibitor. In vivo, perindopril competitively inhibits the pressor response to angiotensin I. Following a dose of 1 mg.kg-1, the plasma converting enzyme activity is significantly inhibited for 24 hours in the rat and for a longer period in the case of low-salt diet. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, the antihypertensive effect of perindopril lasts longer than plasma converting enzyme inhibition. This dissociation of the pharmacological effects suggests a role of tissue converting enzyme inhibition, demonstrated in various tissues, including the rat kidney and aorta. Inhibition of the presynaptic effects of angiotensin II on the transmission of sympathetic impulses--demonstrated in pithed rats--and potentiation of the effects of bradykinin--observed in vitro and in vivo--may also be involved in the antihypertensive effect of perindopril.", 
    "214": "Renin plays a major role in the control of blood pressure and water and electrolyte metabolism and it is clear that blocking of this system is particularly effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and heart failure. A large number of converting enzyme inhibitors have been synthesized. Converting enzyme inhibitors are remarkably active in heart failure and they reduce microalbuminuria and possibly maintain glomerular function. Blocking of the renin-angiotensin system by converting enzyme inhibitors is not accompanied by hypotension or reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Converting enzyme inhibitors represent a major therapeutic advance in the field of cardiovascular and renal disease but the long-term effects of decreased angiotensin II levels are unknown. There are other ways to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. The recent discovery of orally-active non-peptide angiotensin II antagonists opens a range of fascinating prospects. Another approach consists in inhibiting the reaction of renin on angiotensinogen, which is remarkably selective. Although it is too early to know whether these new approaches will be less active, more active or as active as current converting enzyme inhibitors, they may constitute a progress in relation to currently available treatments.", 
    "215": "1. The primary action of the converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent the formation of angiotensin II can explain a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance in patients with elevated, but not in those with normal or reduced plasma renin levels. 2. The inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin will potentiate the vasodilator properties of the endogenously produced peptide. These include direct relaxation of certain vascular smooth muscle, production of vasodilator prostanoids and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The greater release of the latter in the kidney could exert a negative feedback on the release of renin. 3. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors may directly (by a prejunctional effect) and indirectly (by curtailing the production of angiotensin II) reduce the release of noradrenaline in the blood vessel wall. 4. Converting enzyme inhibitors may also directly reduce the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor stimuli (e.g. alpha-adrenoceptor activation). 5. The different effects of these therapeutic agents may concur to induce peripheral vasodilatation.", 
    "216": "1. The circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) contribute importantly to cardiovascular homeostasis. Systemic and/or local activation of the RAS is seen in many pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system (e.g. hypertension and congestive heart failure). Increased angiotensin production participates in the pathophysiology of these and other disease states. Accordingly, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system have a broad spectrum of therapeutic efficacy. 2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective antihypertensive agents that do not adversely affect serum lipid levels. In addition, they reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. 3. ACE inhibitors cause coronary vasodilation and reduce ventricular work and wall stress. They have been shown to reduce experimental infarct size and to increase anginal threshold in humans. 4. After experimental or human myocardial infarction that results in significant left ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibitors prevent ventricular dilatation and development of congestive heart failure, and may improve survival. 5. ACE inhibitors can prevent ventricular fibrillation and contractile impairment (stunned myocardium) associated with reperfusion injury after experimental myocardial ischaemia. 6. ACE inhibitors reduce preload and afterload, improve exercise capacity, reduce ventricular arrhythmias, and improve patient survival in clinical cardiac failure. 7. Taken together, inhibition of the RAS may potentially result in primary as well as secondary protective effects on the cardiovascular system.", 
    "217": "1. The identification of a vascular wall renin angiotensin system and of angiotensin converting enzyme on the luminal surface of the endothelium in many tissues, including the brain, has stimulated research on the influence of the renin angiotensin system on regional blood flows. 2. In experimental studies inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme shifts the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation towards lower blood pressure values. 3. In patients with chronic arterial hypertension and in patients with chronic heart failure cerebral blood flow is not changed by acute or chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, despite in some cases pronounced reductions in the mean arterial blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition does not change ischaemic regional cerebral blood flow in acute stroke. 4. It is concluded that following angiotensin converting inhibition cerebral blood flow is maintained at an unchanged level. The mechanism may include inhibition of locally produced angiotensin II leading to a selective dilation of larger cerebral arteries with a compensatory constriction of the smaller cerebral arteries.", 
    "218": "1. Coronary artery reperfusion has become the treatment of choice for evolving myocardial infarction. 2. While there is no question that timely restoration of coronary blood flow is essential for the salvage of ischaemic myocardium, coronary reperfusion has also been associated with potentially deleterious consequences. Specifically, the viable tissue salvaged by reperfusion remains 'stunned'--i.e., exhibits prolonged abnormalities in contractile function--for hours to days following reflow. Furthermore, it has been suggested that reperfusion per se may lethally injure some myocytes that were only reversibly injured prior to restoration of blood flow. 3. ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril have been shown to reduce indices of myocardial injury (infarct size, creatine kinase release) and enhance contractile function of stunned myocardium in experimental models of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. These effects of ACE inhibitors have largely been attributed to the reduction in myocardial O2-demand and increase in myocardial blood flow associated with blunting of angiotensin II formation. 4. Recent studies suggest that the effects of some ACE inhibitors--particularly captopril--may not solely be explained on the basis of ACE inhibition. In fact, sulphydryl (-SH) containing ACE inhibitors such as captopril appear to act as scavengers of oxygen-derived free radical species thought to be important in the pathogenesis of both postischaemic contractile dysfunction and ischaemia/reperfusion induced myocyte necrosis. 5. Thus, -SH containing ACE inhibitors--which both inhibit ACE and scavenge cytotoxic free radicals--may offer a suitable form of treatment for myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.", 
    "219": "1. Myocyte loss, reactive hypertrophy, dynamic ischaemia with 'stunning', and ventricular wall remodelling are all involved in the initiation and progression of myocardial failure which is ischaemic in origin. 2. The effects of ACE inhibitors to reduce preload and afterload has potentially salutary effects in these settings. Moreover, sulphyl containing ACE inhibitors may have further actions in reducing free radicals and their damage in the acute phases of these events. 3. These promising initial studies warrant further exploration.", 
    "220": "1. From a morphologic standpoint, the myocardium has three compartments: cardiac myocytes; intramyocardial coronary arteries with a microcirculation; and an interstitium composed largely of fibrillar collagen. As long as intercompartmental equilibrium exists, myocardial mechanics and energetics and myocyte viability will each be preserved. 2. The hypertrophic process seen with left ventricular pressure overload secondary to renovascular hypertension alters this equilibrium because of the adverse remodelling of intramural coronary arteries and fibrillar collagen. The pathogenetic mechanism(s) responsible for the observed myocardial fibrosis, having reactive and reparative components, remains to be elucidated. 3. Attractive circumstantial evidence, however, has been obtained to incriminate circulating angiotensin II in this process. Five lines of evidence favouring the role of angiotensin II in promoting the reactive perivascular and interstitial fibrosis and the reparative fibrosis are presented, including the potential cardioprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "221": "1. The pharmacokinetics of most ACE inhibitors have been evaluated indirectly by the measurements of plasma ACE activity and circulating levels of angiotensin I and II. 2. Although plasma ACE activity is very useful to study the degree and the time-course of ACE inhibition, one has to be aware that very different results can be obtained depending on the substrate employed in the assay. It is therefore impossible to compare the results of different inhibitors unless an identical methodology is used. 3. A clear dissociation between plasma angiotensin II levels and the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors has been reported. This observation is in part linked to problems with the measurement of angiotensin II. New methods of determination of plasma angiotensin II have now allowed demonstration of the complete disappearance of plasma angiotensin II following acute ACE inhibition. During chronic treatment, however, angiotensin II generation is effectively blocked only during part of the day, but blood pressure remains controlled permanently. 4. Among the different pharmacokinetic characteristics of ACE inhibitors presently available, the route of excretion and to a lesser degree the half-life appear to be the most clinically relevant. However, the importance of the ability of ACE inhibitors to inhibit tissue renin-angiotensin systems remains to be defined.", 
    "222": "Role of the kallikrein-kinin system in inflammation has been studied in rat model of inflammation, such as paw edema and pleurisy. Previous works suggested involvement of HMW-kininogen and activation of plasma kallikrein system in the carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy at early phase. This study clearly demonstrates the involvement of HMW-kininogen in carrageenin-induced rat paw edema and carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy by using congenitally deficient rat strain in plasma HMW-kininogen. Conclusion is the followings: 1. Significantly less reactivity was noticed in the deficient strain, B/N-Ka, in comparison with normal strain, B/N-Ki, when carrageenin-paw edema or carrageenin- and kaolin-pleurisies were induced. 2. Pretreatment with captopril enhanced the paw swelling as well as pleural fluid accumulation in normal strain but no enhancement was observed in the deficient strain. These results indicate that HMW-kininogen is responsible to inflammatory exudation. 3. T-kinin may not be involved in these inflammations, since the deficient strain owns normal plasma level of T-kininogen.", 
    "223": "In the treatment of patients suffering from therapy-resistant hypertension the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril seems to be one of the most promising drugs of the past decade. The authors examined and followed the effect of captopril (Tensiomin) for one year in 13 severe therapy-resistant hypertensive patients. The average arterial blood pressure of 12 patients suffering from essential hypertension and 1 patient with renal hypertension was, before the introduction of captopril therapy, 215/120 mmHg (SD +/- 23/18). At the end of the one-year examination period the average blood pressure was 186/111 mmHg (SD +/- 25/19). The acute effect of captopril was found to be very favourable, and the required blood pressure fall could be obtained during its long-term use even in cases of renal failure. Except for one case multiple combination therapy had to be applied in all patients for the moderation of blood pressure (in 5 cases 4, in 2 cases 5, in 1 case 6 drugs). The long-term use of the drug did not influence notably the serum potassium-carbamide-creatinine and SGOT values or the white blood cell count. On the basis of their results the authors emphasize that the therapeutic effectivity of captopril monotherapy is not sufficient in severe therapy-resistant hypertension cases, its adjuvant action may be expected in drug combinations. With daily doses lower than 200 mg demonstrable side-effects did not occur.", 
    "224": "The effect of captopril on the response of plasma aldosterone (PA) and plasma renin activity (PRA) to 10 mg metoclopramide i.v. was studied in 9 normal subjects. In the same conditions the prolactine response was studied in 6 healthy males. Metoclopramide induced a significant increase of PA during control study, as well as after treatment with captopril. The maximal increase of PA was of similar magnitude and occurred 15 mn after injection of metoclopramide on both occasions. PRA did not change appreciably after metoclopramide neither during control study nor during captopril. The prolactin response to metoclopramide was blunted by treatment with captopril. In conclusion, captopril did not alter the aldosterone response to metoclopramide, which suggests that dopaminergic control of aldosterone secretion is independent of modifications in the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "225": "To verify if exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is able to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and if endogenous angiotensin II plays a role in this eventual PGE2-induced stimulation of vasopressin, increasing doses of PGE2 were infused in 6 normal volunteers before (PGE2 study) and after the administration of 100 mg of captopril (captopril study). PGE2, even at an infusion rate of 40 and 60 ng/kg/min, did not modify blood pressure when it was infused alone; a significant fall of blood pressure was observed, in contrast, in the captopril study. PGE2 alone doubled the plasma levels of ADH. One hour after the subjects had been pre-treated with captopril, plasma levels of ADH fell by about 38%, then they increased by about 60% during the infusion of PGE2. These results suggest that in normal man endogenous angiotensin II is an important non-osmotic regulator of plasma ADH and that exogenous PGE2 can stimulate maximally the release of ADH only when the renin-angiotensin system is not impaired.", 
    "226": "1. The effects of captopril, epicaptopril and fosenopril were compared with codergine mesylate in a number of tests which may be predicative of potential n\u00f6otropic activity. None of the drugs tested protected against KCN induced hypoxic seizures. However, in the acute atropine sulphate induced hyperactivity test, in which the behaviour of the mice in the 'open field' apparatus was assessed, both captopril and codergine mesylate were found to reverse the atropine induced hypermotility. The effect of captopril would not appear to be a direct reflection of its angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity as fosenopril is also a potent ACE inhibitor. 2. Only codergine mesylate was found to reverse the atropine sulphate induced amnesia in a one trial avoidance task, captopril and its analogues being inactive in such a test. 3. Chronically administered codergine mesylate, captopril and its analogues reversed the hypermobility in the 'open field' apparatus that occurred following the injection of a single dose of the neurotoxin trimethyltin. 4. None of the changes in locomotor activity would appear to be due to adverse effect of the drugs on motor coordination. 5. It is concluded that captopril may be worthy of more detailed studies as a potential n\u00f6otropic agent.", 
    "227": "Renin inhibitors represent an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) for the treatment of hypertension. They inhibit the renin-angiotensin system at its first and rate limiting step, the renin-angiotensinogen reaction. Passive administration of angiotensinogen or renin antibodies lowers blood pressure in primates to the same extent as ACEI. Chronic active immunization against renin decreases blood pressure markedly in normotensive marmosets. Renin can be inhibited by peptides derived from its prosegment. The design of compounds based on pepstatin and on angiotensinogen sequence has led to very potent and specific human renin inhibitors. Such inhibitors are active by the IV route in primates but still lack of good oral activity.", 
    "228": "The effects of converting enzyme inhibitor have been studied on the functions and structure of the arterial wall, and in both models of renovascular and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The arterial wall functions have been studied in terms of active vasomotricity, passive elasticity and transparietal convexion transport of proteins. Whatever the model used, hypertension was associated with significant changes in arterial wall functions: increase in smooth muscle cell tone, decrease in compliance, and decrease in transparietal filtration rate of proteins. These modifications could be reported to the increase in thickness of the media secondary to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle cell and to the increase in collagen network density. The effects of converting enzyme inhibitors on these phenomenons could depend on the experimental model used and the duration of treatment. In renovascular hypertensive animals, one month of treatment with perindopril normalized blood pressure and active compliance of the arterial wall. This functional benefit could be easily reported to the complete regression of the smooth muscle cell hypertrophy observed after treatment. By contrast, the increase in collagen network density was not regressed by treatment. By contrast, the increase in collagen network density was not regressed by treatment. By contrast, the increase in collagen network density was not regressed by treatment with trandolapril and thus the transparietal filtration rate of proteins remained decreased. In spontaneously hypertensive rats a perindopril treatment of long duration (3 months) partially regressed the functional change in compliance. This effect, once again, could be easily reported to the partial regression of medial hypertrophy which was associated, in this experimental condition, with a significant decrease in collagen network density.", 
    "229": "There are now numerous angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors under development, clinical trial or in clinical use for cardiovascular disease, a situation analagous to the beta blockers. They currently vary in their chemical and physical structure, whether they contain a sulphydril group or are pro-drugs, and in their pharmacokinetics. Whether these differences will convey any special or particular clinical advantages to individual ACE inhibitors has yet to be established. Further research is necessary to determine whether tissue ACEs are merely isoenzymes or whether they differ in their functional properties. Different bioavailability in tissues of the individual ACE inhibitors could confer differing pharmacodynamic properties. ACE inhibitors have been a major advance in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. In heart failure they have been shown to improve the haemodynamics, to improve symptoms, and most recently, to prolong survival. In hypertension, ACE inhibitors have some physiological advantages over current antihypertensive agents. They have several favourable cardiovascular effects without metabolic disadvantages which provide a theoretical basis for cardio-protection in hypertensive patients.", 
    "230": "Hypertonic saline resuscitation (HR, 7.5% NaCl, 4 ml/kg) effectively reverts severe hemorrhage, but a central neural component is probably involved in the survival response. This experiment examines the role of central angiotensinergic pathways in hemorrhage-hypertonic resuscitation interaction. Severely bled (43 +/- 2 ml/kg) pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with chronically implanted cerebral ventricular cannulae were resuscitated with 4 ml/kg 7.5% NaCl, iv 10 min after intracerebroventricular injection of 0.5 ml normal saline (CT), 150 micrograms saralasin (in 0.5 ml saline, SR), or 10 mg captopril (in 0.5 ml saline, CP). All 10 SR-treated dogs died 2-6 h after HR. Their arterial pressure and cardiac index initially recovered to near pre-hemorrhage levels, but gradually decreased thereafter, base excess remaining at severe metabolic acidosis levels throughout. All CT- and 8/10 CP-treated dogs survived indefinitely, with near normal arterial pressure, cardiac index and base excess levels. It is therefore concluded that the inhibition of central angiotensinergic sites with the competitive antagonist saralasin effectively prevents survival after HR, whereas inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by captopril in cerebrospinal fluid is virtually ineffective.", 
    "231": "30 hypertensive patients were treated in outpatients conditions for a 6 month period with captopril \"Pharmachem\". The patients were classified in accordance with the degree of the arterial hypertension into three groups: light hypertension--II patients, moderate hypertension 13 patients and severe hypertension--6 patients. Captopril was applied the first two weeks in a dose of 25 mg 3 times daily. When there was no effect the dose was increased every two weeks with 25 mg daily up to a 150 mg daily dose. A very good result was achieved in 11 patients (36.7%) and in 15 patients (50%) the result was considered good. In 4 patients the arterial pressure fell to normal after the addition of chlorthalidone. The following side effects were observed: decrease of the leucocyte number in reference ranges, insignificant increase of the uric acid in reference ranges, proteinuria below 1 gr/24 h. Captopril \"Pharmachem\" applied alone or in combination with a diuretic is a very efficient drug for the treatment of all stages of arterial hypertension.", 
    "232": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are being increasingly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Not only are they efficacious but the incidence of serious adverse events with ACE inhibitors is similar to that with placebo. 'First-dose hypotension' mainly affects the renin-dependent patient. Neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported rarely for the nonsulfhydryl compounds. Comparative safety data are provided for captopril, enalapril, and quinapril, a new nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor that has been investigated extensively in over 2,000 patients. Results show that the proportion of patients reporting associated adverse events was lower with quinapril (11%) than with captopril (17%) or enalapril (15%). Similarly, there was a lower proportion of patients withdrawn due to adverse events with quinapril.", 
    "233": "Contrary to popular belief, the primary directive for the release of renin is not the preservation of circulatory homeostasis, since activation of this hormonal system in patients with chronic heart failure results in deleterious rather than beneficial effects on cardiac performance. Instead, renin appears to be released by the kidneys to maintain glomerular filtration rate when renal perfusion pressure is reduced. The renin-angiotensin system carries out this beneficial action by exerting a constrictor action on the efferent arteriole. In doing so, renal blood flow declines, but filtration fraction increases and thus, glomerular hydraulic filtration pressure (and renal function) is preserved, despite severe renal hypoperfusion. When the formation of angiotensin II is inhibited during converting-enzyme inhibition, the beneficial action of this hormone on the efferent arteriole is lost, and renal function may deteriorate. This sequence of events is most likely to be seen when four risk factors are present: hyponatremia; high-dose diuretic therapy; diabetes mellitus; and the use of long-acting converting-enzyme inhibitors. In randomized studies, renal insufficiency developed more frequently with enalapril and lisinopril than with captopril. This risk of worsening azotemia is particularly high in patients with the most severe (class IV) heart failure.", 
    "234": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with chronic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, enalapril, and quinapril, have been shown to improve hemodynamics, reduce symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea, increase exercise capacity, correct hyponatremia, reduce diuretic requirements and ventricular arrhythmias, and conserve potassium and magnesium. ACE inhibitors reduce circulating levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone and may reduce plasma norepinephrine and vasopressin levels. They are equally effective in patients with mild to moderate heart failure and in patients with severe cardiac impairment. ACE inhibitors are at least as beneficial as digitalis in patients with mild heart failure, and they may even be considered as first-line therapy. Promising results have also been obtained in patients with myocardial infarction, in whom long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors has prevented an increase in heart size. ACE inhibitors improve prognosis in patients with severe heart failure and in patients with hyponatremia; the question of effect on survival in mild to moderate heart failure has yet to be answered.", 
    "235": "The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has had an appreciable impact upon the treatment of hypertension in Europe, although acceptance of these new agents has not been uniform in all countries. In order to arrive at an understanding of the place of ACE inhibitors in the management of the hypertensive patient, the attitudes of four parties must be considered: the prescriber, the patient, the manufacturer, and the regulatory agency. Physicians in Britain, Germany, and Scandinavia have lagged behind their counterparts in France and Italy in prescribing ACE inhibitors, due to restrictions placed by national regulatory agencies on the first-line use of these agents in hypertension therapy.", 
    "236": "The failure of recent antihypertensive trials to document clearly a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease (nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) has important clinical implications. Although the causes of this phenomenon are unknown, it is possible that lipid and metabolic side effects of the antihypertensive drugs used in these studies negated the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are lipid neutral and associated with few metabolic side effects, and may be considered over agents that cause adverse effects on such parameters as serum cholesterol, glucose, potassium, and uric acid levels. ACE inhibitors are now emerging in the United States as important first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "237": "The radioimmunological determinations of immunoreactive 'angiotensin II' do not truly reflect angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide levels, and thus cannot provide an accurate reflection of the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Elaborate methods are necessary to measure specifically the octapeptide angiotensin II. This methodology confirms that ACE inhibitors reduce circulating angiotensin II and that tolerance to the angiotensin II-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors does not develop, even after prolonged administration. Furthermore, a marked reduction of angiotensin II levels can be shown even in patients with primary aldosteronism. At peak blockade of ACE, the level of plasma angiotensin II is still related to circulating active renin and angiotensin I. The possible independent role of tissue renin-angiotensin systems in determining vasomotor tone is an interesting hypothesis. However, any discussion of whether tissue or plasma renin determines the pharmacologic effect of ACE inhibitors should be based on the simultaneous measurement of angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide under steady-state conditions in tissue and plasma.", 
    "238": "With several angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors currently in clinical use for the treatment of hypertension, and many others under development, potential applications of these drugs have expanded. When ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure they do not induce tachycardia. Contrary to expectations, ACE inhibitors have been found extremely useful in treating hypertension in the elderly and also patients with heart failure. Plasma renin assay is not always helpful in determining the optimum dosage range. While no evidence has yet been found for differential effects of these drugs in man, tissue-sensitive ACE inhibitors could be of considerable clinical interest.", 
    "239": "1. Studies were performed in normal subjects and in rats to assess the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the kallikrein-kinin system. As ACE is identical to kininase II, one of the enzymes physiologically involved in bradykinin degradation, bradykinin may be expected to accumulate during ACE inhibition. 2. A competitive antagonist of bradykinin was used to explore in unanaesthetized rats the contribution of circulating bradykinin to blood pressure control under ACE inhibition. 3. No evidence was found for a role of this vasodilating peptide in the blood pressure lowering effect of acute ACE inhibition. 4. The plasma activity of carboxypeptidase N (= kininase I), another pathway of bradykinin degradation, remained intact during a 1 week course of treatment with an ACE inhibitor in normal subjects. This therefore indicates that bradykinin formed during ACE inhibition can still be metabolized.", 
    "240": "In pithed rats intravenous administration of serotonin (5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 and 50.0 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure. The pressor response to serotonin was significantly reduced by captopril (1.0, 5.0 and 50.0 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. Captopril did not attenuate the response of the isolated tail artery to serotonin (5-HT) and did not amplify the dilator effect of serotonin in pithed rats pretreated with ketanserin (1.0 mg/kg). These data suggest that the action of captopril does not depend on its influence on serotoninergic receptors in blood vessels.", 
    "241": "Captopril is the first oral inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which has a strong effect on patients with hypertonic states. The influence of the preparation was studied on liver drug-metabolizing enzymic systems of rats in two ways of oral administration-single and a 10-day treatment with a dose of 75 mg/kg. The effect on the levels of microsomal cytochrome B5 and P450 as well as on that of hem was investigated. The activities of some enzymes from the first and second phases of biotransformation were determined. There no changes in the examined parameters 1 h after single oral treatment with 75 mg/kg of captopril. Induction of some of the examined enzymes was observed after a 10-day treatment with 75 mg/kg r. o. of captopril once daily: there was statistically significant elevation of the level of cytochrome P450 as well as of the activity of ethylmorphindelethylase and HA-DPH-cytochrome-C-reductase. The results show that there is probably induction at the first phase of phenobarbital type of drug metabolism.", 
    "242": "We studied the acute effect of oral captopril (25mg) and clonidine(300 micrograms) on blood pressure (BP) in patients with essential hypertension successively maintained on a low (LSD) and high (HSD) salt diet. Seven patients were salt sensitive (SS) and seven were salt resistant (SR). The maximal decrease in diastolic BP caused by captopril in patients on the LSD was greater in SS than SR individuals. Baseline urinary norepinephrine levels did not change from LSD to HSD (p greater than 0.05) in SS patients and decreased in SR patients (p less than 0.05). The maximal decrease in mean BP during the clonidine test was the same for both diets (p greater than 0.05) in SS patients and was lower (p less than 0.05) for the HSD in SR patients. SS patients on the HSD presented a higher decrease in systolic BP than SR patients (p less than 0.05) during the clonidine test. These data suggest overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system in SS patients on the LSD and of the sympathetic nervous system in SS patients on the HSD and that the clonidine test could be a good indicator for identifying SS and SR patients.", 
    "243": "The present study characterized the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the responsiveness of pithed rats to pressor stimuli. Intravenous infusions of SNP produced a dose-related inhibition of the pressor responses to stimulation of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord. The site at which SNP affected the vasoconstrictor response appeared to be post-junctional because norepinephrine responses were also attenuated, as were blood pressure increases to angiotensin II and vasopressin. Responsiveness to all of the pressor stimuli was restored when the infusion of SNP was terminated. The effects of SNP could not be attributed simply to observed reductions in baseline blood pressure because pretreatment of the pithed rats with captopril, which produced an initial hypotensive effect equivalent to that seen after SNP, did not alter the pressor responses to angiotensin II or vasopressin. However, like SNP, captopril did attenuate the blood pressure increments to spinal cord stimulation and norepinephrine. These results suggest that a part of the hypotensive potency of SNP may result from its ability to antagonize vasoconstriction mediated by norepinephrine, angiotensin II and vasopressin.", 
    "244": "Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril, cilazipril, and quinipril have all been documented to induce cough with an estimated frequency of at least 15% of treated patients. Common descriptors include tickling, dry, nonproductive, and persistent. Onset usually occurs during the first week of therapy and lasts as long as the drug is taken, remitting within a few days after the agent is discontinued. Alternative angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors replicate the cough. The mechanism seems related to stimulation of lung afferent C fibers, perhaps by prostaglandin E2. It may also be related to decreased breakdown of substance P, the neurochemical mediator of the cough reflex released in response to stimulation of C fibers and metabolized by ACE. The possible role of prostaglandins is supported by two anecdotal reports of cough disappearing in patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Future trials should recognize cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy, and prospective determination of its true frequency and cross-occurrence are necessary.", 
    "245": "Changes in serum lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoproteins including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions following administration of captopril in patients with hypertension were studied. Captopril (25 mg twice daily) was administered over a 12-week period to 17 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Captopril was observed to significantly reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as to increase HDL2- cholesterol (HDL2-C) and to decrease HDL3-cholesterol (HDL3-C); however, no significant changes in total HDL-C were recognized. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apo A-II, apo B, apo C-II, apo C-III, and apo E did not change significantly. It is suggested that captopril monotherapy produces a favorable effect on HDL subfractions.", 
    "246": "1. Angiotensin II (AII) acts as a potent pressor agent directly, by virtue of its vasoconstrictor activity and indirectly, by the volume expansion resulting from stimulation of aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, leading to sodium and water retention. Various approaches of interfering with the enzymatic cascade leading to the production of AII have been made in an attempt to define therapeutic agents for the control of hypertension and heart failure. 2. AII receptor antagonists, to date, lack oral activity and have a relatively short duration of action, limiting their clinical usefulness. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme block AII production, are orally active and have been used successfully in the control of hypertension and in the treatment of congestive heart failure. 3. An ideal approach to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is the inhibition of renin, an enzyme with only one known substrate (angiotensinogen) which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the RAS. Early attempts to discover a renin inhibitor focused on immunologic inhibitors of renin, fragments of the prorenin sequence and compounds related to pepstatin, a potent pentapeptide inhibitor of pepsin and less potent inhibitor of renin. None of these approaches proved feasible for a variety of reasons including poor absorption, short duration of action and weak activity. 4. Substrate analogs offer the greatest promise for clinically useful renin inhibitors. Most recently, synthesis of compounds mimicking the enzyme transition state, the condition of greatest binding affinity, has resulted in renin inhibitors with potencies in the nanomolar range, which have shown hypotensive activity. These compounds contain at least one peptide bond and have limited oral activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "247": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is important in the regulation of body fluids. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which forms angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is known to be present in human ocular tissue. In rabbits, some topically applied ACE inhibitors including captopril have been shown to reduce IOP with a magnitude and duration comparable to that of topical 0.5% timolol. Captopril in a 50mg single oral dose, which had a significant effect on blood pressure, had no significant effect on IOP over a 4 hour period.", 
    "248": "Administration of captopril to animals with two-kidney, one clip, renovascular hypertension (RH) lowers the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the clipped kidney. The authors therefore tested the hypothesis that a decrease in GFR after captopril administration would identify patients with RH. Total GFR was measured by the plasma disappearance of Tc-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) after bolus injection and single-kidney GFR from renal uptake of DTPA assessed by renography. The authors studied six patients with arteriosclerotic RH who had strongly lateralizing renal vein renin levels and greater than 80% stenosis of the renal artery to that kidney. Results were contrasted with those of six patients with essential hypertension (EH) with a similar mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). Captopril (50 mg orally) increased total GFR (ml/min) in all patients with EH (102 +/- 8 to 120 +/- 12, P less than 0.005). However, GFR decreased in patients with RH (73 +/- 8 to 61 +/- 9, P less than 0.05) after captopril. Although the single-kidney GFR of patients with RH decreased in all six stenotic kidneys (27 +/- 4 to 21 +/- 5, P less than 0.02), it did not change consistently in the contralateral kidneys (45 +/- 8 to 40 +/- 6, N.S.). Clonidine (0.3 mg) also lowered MABP in patients with RH but, unlike captopril, it did not reduce total kidney GFR (75 +/- 10 to 79 +/- 11, N.S.). In conclusion, short-term captopril administration increases GFR in patients with EH, but decreases it in those with RH. This action is unrelated to its depressor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "249": "To examine whether a hypotensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was mediated partly by a potentiation of endogenous bradykinin, a newly synthesized competitive antagonist of bradykinin (B 4147) was used in anesthetized rats. The injection of B 4147 alone (50 and 100 micrograms) elicited significant increases in blood pressure. Although the administration of captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), the injection of the kinin antagonist (50 and 100 micrograms) after the captopril produced an increase in MAP by an average of 42 and 47% of the initial fall induced by captopril, respectively. The hypertensive effect of B 4147 was enhanced in magnitude and duration after the captopril. These results suggest that an accumulation of endogenous kinins by captopril contributes partly to the acute hypotensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitors in anesthetized rats.", 
    "250": "A crossover study was planned in order to compare the effects of captopril and slow channel calcium entry blocker (Ca antagonist) on urinary protein excretion in 7 hypertensive patients with renal diseases, including 4 with IgA nephropathy, 2 with lupus nephritis and 1 with benign nephrosclerosis. Captopril decreased urinary protein excretion by 52% without any change in creatinine clearance, while Ca antagonist was having a slight effect on proteinuria even though the drug showed an equivalent antihypertensive effect as captopril. These results suggest that the attenuation of proteinuria induced by captopril may be related to an inhibition of angiotensin II formation and/or a direct action of this drug on protein permeability of glomerular basement membrane.", 
    "251": "Severe dietary sodium restriction initiated early in life is required to prevent development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Moderate sodium restriction does not affect hypertension development. This relative insensitivity to sodium restriction may be related to compensatory increases in other pressor mechanisms, specifically the renin-angiotensin system. We evaluated this possibility by measuring plasma renin activity, the blood pressure response to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril as well as blood pressure responsiveness to exogenous angiotensin II in SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) raised from birth until 6 or 16 weeks on control (101 mumol Na+/g food), moderate (26 mumol/g) or two severe (17 or 9 mumol/g) sodium-restricted diets. Moderate sodium restriction did not affect development of hypertension, but also did not cause significant increases in PRA or the blood pressure response to captopril in SHR or WKY. In contrast, severe sodium restriction blunted or prevented the development of hypertension in SHR and was associated with (1) marked increases in plasma renin activity (2) increased maintenance of blood pressure by the renin-angiotensin system (as assessed by captopril), and (3) a marked decrease in the blood pressure response to angiotensin II. We conclude that the relative insensitivity of hypertension development in SHR to dietary sodium restriction does not relate to a compensatory increase in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The moderate sodium restriction employed (26 mumol/g) may rather represent the lower end of the normal range.", 
    "252": "The treatment of scleroderma is determined by the stage of the disease, associated organ involvement, or the presence of features overlapping those of other connective tissue disease. Raynaud's phenomenon is responsive to vasoactive medication, but recently heat and plasma exchange have been shown to be more effective, reducing the need for systemic medication. In stages II and III of the disease, administration of non-toxic penicillamine in low doses for 2 to 4 years is the preferred treatment. Plasma exchange may offer some hope in the early stages. The treatment of the renal crisis of scleroderma with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has reduced mortality from this complication. These drugs are currently the preferred treatment for the hypertension of renal scleroderma. The symptomatic treatment of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and soft tissue complications of scleroderma is also discussed.", 
    "253": "The increase in plasma renin activity induced by captopril is used in the clinical evaluation of renovascular hypertensive patients. This increase in plasma renin activity could result from either the concomitant fall in systemic pressure or other effects of captopril, such as the removal of an angiotensin II inhibitory effect on renin release, the increased production of bradykinin or prostaglandins, etc. To examine the effect captopril has on plasma renin activity, independent of changes in systemic pressure, captopril (5, 10 and 50 micrograms/kg iv) was administered to conscious dogs before and following the development of 1 clip-2 kidney Goldblatt hypertension. Plasma renin activity, under normal conditions remained unchanged, while during hypertension it increased 2.0, 2.8 and 3.5 fold respectively in response to the three doses of captopril. These results suggest that the development of renovascular hypertension sensitized the kidney to release renin when challenged by captopril and that the effect is independent of changes in systemic pressure.", 
    "254": "1. The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) and caerulein, an amphibian decapeptide structurally related to CCK-8, are inconsistent in the rat. We have therefore investigated the possibility that enzymatic degradation could be responsible for the lack of activity of CCK-8 seen in some studies on food intake. 2. Injections of CCK-8 at doses of 2.5 nmol and 25 nmol into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats did not reduce the intake of a highly palatable diet whereas injections of the same doses of caerulein reduced food intake potently and dose-dependently. 3. Co-administration of CCK-8 with a combination of the peptidase inhibitors bestatin (70 nmol), captopril (100 nmol) and thiorphan (120 nmol) resulted in an inhibition of feeding similar to that seen after the injection of caerulein alone. The peptidase inhibitors alone did not affect food intake. 4. When caerulein was injected i.c.v. in combination with bestatin, captopril and thiorphan the effect of caerulein was potentiated, suggesting that enzymatic breakdown of caerulein does occur. 5. It is concluded that the effect of centrally administered CCK-8 on food intake is dependent on the activity of cleaving enzymes in the brain. It is emphasized that the action of brain peptidases is a major factor which has to be considered when investigating the role of peptides in the central nervous system.", 
    "255": "The records of 18 consecutive patients referred to a Veterans Administration Hospital nuclear medicine service for renal scintigraphic tests to rule out renovascular hypertension were reviewed. The men were elderly (mean age, 62 years), and risk factors for untoward reactions, including long-standing hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and recent diuretic use were present. Despite these risks, there was no test morbidity, and the authors conclude that the renal scintigraphic test with captopril enhancement is well tolerated and deserves continued application and evaluation.", 
    "256": "Eight infants had paired measurements of plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity while being treated for congestive heart failure. There is parallelism with aldosterone and renin activity in the presence of a hyperactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Six patients had plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone measured after commencing captopril and we have shown biochemical blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "257": "Diagnostic interventions in nuclear medicine may be defined as the coadministration of a nonradioactive drug or application of a physical stimulus or physiologic maneuver to enhance the diagnostic utility of a nuclear medicine test. The rationale for each interventional maneuver follows from the physiology or metabolism of the particular organ or organ system under evaluation. Diagnostic inference is drawn from the pattern of change in the biodistribution of the tracer in response to the intervention-induced change in metabolism or function. In current practice, the most commonly performed interventional maneuvers are aimed at studies of the heart, genitourinary system, hepatobiliary system, and gastrointestinal tract. The single most commonly performed interventional study in the United States is the stress Thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scan aimed at the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The stress portion of the study is accomplished with dynamic leg exercise on a treadmill and is aimed at increasing myocardial oxygen demands. Areas of myocardium distal to hemodynamically significant lesions in the coronary arteries become ischemic at peak stress due to the inability of the stenotic vessel to respond to the oxygen demand/blood flow needs of the myocardium. Ischemic areas are readily recognized as photopenic defects on scans obtained immediately after exercise, with \"normalization\" upon delayed imaging. Diuresis renography is aimed at the differential diagnosis of hydroureteronephrosis. By challenging the urinary tract collecting structures with an augmented urine flow, dilated, unobstructed systems can be differentiated from systems with significant mechanical obstruction. Obstructed systems have a low ability to respond even after effective diuresis, resulting in a characteristic prolonged retention of the radiotracer. Hepatobiliary interventions are most commonly employed in the clinical setting of suspected acute cholecystitis. Administering a cholecystogogue before a hepatobiliary tracer promotes visualization of the gallbladder by causing it to go through a contraction/filling cycle in which the filling phase occurs during maximum exposure to the radionuclide. This maneuver can convert a false positive study that suggests the presence of acute cholecystitis to a true negative study. Other gastrointestinal interventions are aimed at enhancing the detection of gastroesophageal reflux and gastrointestinal bleeding. Many new interventions have been developed that are currently aimed at research problems rather than clinical problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "258": "Twelve patients with essential hypertension receiving captopril monotherapy or captopril in conjunction with a diuretic had their 24-h blood pressure profiles monitored using an automatic, non-invasive ambulatory method. The study examined the efficacy of once a day versus twice a day administration of the ACE inhibitor in controlling blood pressure. Six untreated subjects with borderline hypertension were also studied using the same monitoring equipment and with the same frequency, to act as controls because of the possibility of repeated use of the device causing a 'familiarisation' effect. The results obtained indicated that if anything, the once daily dosing produced marginally better blood pressure values. The amplitude of the diurnal blood pressure variation was reduced on a 'second-wearing' of the monitoring equipment suggesting some degree of familiarisation with the apparatus.", 
    "259": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), introduced in clinical practice in 1980, are a relatively new class of drugs. They have been useful in the treatment of hypertension, where they are effective monotherapy in 40% to 50% of the patients and in combination therapy in up to 90%. They are also useful in the symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement and in decreasing mortality of patients with congestive heart failure. In this respect, they appear to be superior to other vasodilators. The clinical success of the marketed compounds and the expected increase in market share of these drugs, estimated to approach one billion dollars in the next few years, has created great interest among clinicians and within the drug industry. The emerging differences among the three marketed ACEIs and promising new agents that are expected to be marketed in the next few years are the subject of this review.", 
    "260": "Microalbuminuria in insulin-dependent diabetics appears to indicate early renal damage rather than susceptibility to it, yet a series of relatively small, short-term intervention studies in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients have already demonstrated reduction in albumin excretion rates or arrest in the increase of fractional clearance of albumin. Treatments have ranged from the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aimed at lowering BP to the use of diets restricted to 0.5 to 0.6 g/kg protein and strict blood glucose control by intensified insulin treatment. Large, long-term intervention studies of cohorts of insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients with microalbuminuria are now needed to assess the effects of the different modalities of care on the development of persistent proteinuria, end-stage renal disease, and cardiovascular mortality as well as associated quantitative changes in the renal structure.", 
    "261": "Continuous therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been shown to have a glomerular vasodepressor effect in the newly diabetic rat and to largely prevent the subsequent development of a severe, sclerosing glomerular injury. Preliminary studies in humans with established diabetic glomerular injury (DGI) reveal that ACE inhibitor therapy has an antiproteinuric effect and may also show the decline in glomerular filtration rate that usually attends this disorder. Although promising, the human studies are inconclusive because of short duration and other limitations in experimental technique and study design. Additional trials are needed to confirm a specific effect of ACE inhibitor therapy to ameliorate human diabetic glomerular injury.", 
    "262": "In 14 patients with severe congestive heart failure, the effects of captopril on the forearm circulation were evaluated with strain gauge plethysmography. Changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, epinephrine, bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations were also measured. To determine whether the prostaglandins contribute to the peripheral hemodynamic response to captopril, the hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were repeated after pretreatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Ninety minutes after administering a single dose of captopril (25 mg), mean blood pressure and venous pressure decreased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), forearm blood flow and maximum venous volume increased (p less than 0.05 for both), and forearm vascular resistance and forearm venous tone decreased (p less than 0.05 for both). Captopril also improved forearm venous distensibility (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with oral indomethacin (50 mg) significantly blunted all of these captopril-induced hemodynamic changes. The blockage of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril was unaltered by indomethacin pretreatment. Captopril significantly increased plasma bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (p less than 0.05 for each). Indomethacin pretreatment did not affect the captopril-induced increase in bradykinin, but it did completely eliminate the increase in the prostaglandins. Plasma catecholamines did not change with captopril. These data suggest that the vasodilator prostaglandins play a significant role in captopril's peripheral vasodilative effects in congestive heart failure.", 
    "263": "We studied 11 hypertensive patients by a radionuclide technique using Gates' method with [99mTc]DTPA to investigate the acute effects of captopril on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Five patients had hypertension with unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) angiographically documented and six patients had essential hypertension (EH). Total and split GFR were determined under control conditions and after oral administration of captopril (50 mg). In the patients with RAS, captopril induced a significant decrease of GFR in the stenotic kidneys (from 42.4 +/- 4 to 29.6 +/- 3 ml/min, p less than 0.01), while no changes were observed in the nonstenotic kidneys (from 61.2 +/- 3 to 61.6 +/- 5 ml/min, NS). Total GFR was 103.6 +/- 5 ml/min under control conditions and decreased to 91.8 +/- 6 ml/min after captopril (p less than 0.05). No significant changes of GFR were detected after captopril administration in patients with EH. In a separate group of ten patients with EH, good correlation between 24-hr creatinine clearance and fractional uptake of [99mTc]DTPA was obtained. Good reproducibility of this radionuclide technique was also shown. This study demonstrates that the computed radionuclide GFR determination coupled with the captopril test allows one to unmask angiotensin II-dependent renal function and hemodynamic changes. This technique can be useful in clinical practice for identifying patients with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "264": "The effects of lifetime oral captopril treatment on baroreflex control of heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity were measured in 19-21-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The sensitivity of baroreflex control of heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity were determined by the slopes of the relation between the change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mm Hg) versus the change in pulse interval (msec/beat) and the change in MAP versus the percent change in nerve activity, respectively. Untreated SHR had significantly higher MAP than WKY (157 +/- 3 vs. 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and exhibited a decreased baroreflex control of heart rate. Lifetime treatment with captopril prevented the development of hypertension in SHR (MAP = 110 +/- 5 mm Hg) and increased the sensitivity of baroreflex function. The gains of the baroreflex control of heart rate for captopril-treated SHR and control SHR when MAP was raised or lowered by phenylephrine or nitroprusside were 2.38 +/- 0.49 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.33 msec/mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 0.74 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.09 (NS) msec/mm Hg, respectively. The sensitivity of the baroreflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity was greater in captopril-treated SHR than in control SHR when MAP was increased or decreased (-1.03 +/- 0.26 vs. -0.38 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.05; -0.84 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.04 +/- 0.58 (NS) mm Hg-1, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "265": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) suppression by angiotensin II (Ang II), the \"short feedback loop,\" has been shown to be blunted in essential hypertension. Non-modulators comprise 50% of normal- and high-renin essential hypertensive individuals and are defined by their abnormal adrenal and renal responses to infused Ang II. This study sought to determine if the abnormal Ang II suppression of PRA in essential hypertension is specific to non-modulators. We measured PRA suppression during infusion of Ang II in 22 normotensive and 32 hypertensive (16 modulators and 16 non-modulators) subjects. A significant correlation between basal PRA and the fall in PRA in response to Ang II infusion was seen in the normotensives (r = -0.934, p less than 0.001) and modulators (r = -0.831, p less than 0.001) but not in the non-modulators (r = -0.275, p = 0.304). However, after 3 days of converting enzyme inhibition therapy, the correlation between basal PRA and decrement in PRA was significant in the non-modulators (r = -0.762, p less than 0.01). Thus, the abnormal PRA suppression documented previously in hypertensive individuals is a defect specific to non-modulators and is corrected with converting enzyme inhibition therapy.", 
    "266": "The occurrence of neurologic abnormalities is described in a series of nine infants with chronic hypertension, in whom antihypertensive therapy decreased BP markedly and for a prolonged period, although to levels often within the normal range. All infants had mean systolic BPs greater than 113 mm Hg and elevated renin values to a mean of 134 +/- 128 ng/mL/h. Antihypertensive therapy, such as captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, consistently lowered the systolic BP by 20% from baseline per dose. However, the nine infants exhibited a total of 17 episodes of striking decreases in systolic BP of greater than 40% from baseline; the markedly decreased systolic BP values were usually within the normal range for corrected age. Seven of the 17 episodes were characterized by marked decrease in systolic BP, ie, decreased by 57% +/- 10%, and were prolonged, ie, remained at the lower values for 17 +/- 6 hours despite therapeutic interventions. These seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/h) and neurologic abnormalities (ie, seizures). In the remaining ten episodes, the systolic BP decreased by 50% +/- 8%, but the decreases were relatively brief, ie, remained at the lower values for 2.8 +/- 2 hours. These briefer episodes were not accompanied by renal or neurologic signs. These data indicate a particular vulnerability of the cerebral and renal circulation in premature infants with chronic hypertension to decreases in systolic BP to levels that would otherwise be considered in the normal range. The findings suggest that adaptive responses in both cerebral and renal blood flow are altered by chronic hypertension in such infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "267": "Human lung membrane-bound neutral metallo-endopeptidase (NME; EC 3.4.24.11) has been purified; this enzyme occurred in two forms, NME-I and NME-II. The total NME activity was purified 2,143-fold with the final specific activities for NME-I and NME-II being 750 and 1,124, respectively. The two NME forms were resolved in the final purification step involving ion exchange; in all earlier steps including gel filtration and affinity chromatography (phenyl sepharose) both forms behaved similarly and eluted simultaneously. NME-I and NME-II both had a Mr value of 97,000, and neither form dissociated into subunits. Catalytic actions of NME-I and NME-II upon bradykinin were identical; the Gly4-Phe5 and Pro7-Phe8 bonds of bradykinin were cleaved with the final hydrolytic products for each enzyme being the tetrapeptide, Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly, the tripeptide, Phe-Ser-Pro, and the dipeptide, Phe-Arg. The intermediate products were the heptapeptide, Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro, and the pentapeptide, Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg. Neither NME-I nor NME-II were inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Both enzymes were inhibited by phosphoramidon, dithiothreitol and EDTA. Other peptidase inhibitors and heavy metals were not effective NME inhibitors. Both NME-I and NME-II cleaved angiotensin-I at the Pro7-Phe8 bond, and substance-P at the Glu6-Phe7 bond, with the latter being much slower than the former.", 
    "268": "The list of nephrotoxic drugs is long. The kidney is particularly susceptible to the nephrotoxic action of drugs, because of its functional properties, including: a) the high volume of renal blood flow, which brings large amounts of toxin; b) the large area in contact with the drug, either in the glomerulus or the tubule epithelium, which enables toxin interaction or uptake; c) the kidney's ability to transfer active substances, which provides specific transfer mechanisms that mediate cellular uptake; d) drug breakdown, which may occur in renal tubules and lead to the formation of toxic metabolites from non-toxic parent substances; e) the kidney's concentrating mechanisms, which can increase urinary and interstitial concentrations of non-absorbed products; f) the high metabolic rate of tubule cells required for normal function, which is subject to perturbation. Indeed, nephrotoxins affect every aspect of renal pathology, from acute renal failure due to functional alterations to that resulting from tubule cell necrosis. These anomalies may occur suddenly or after a long period of exposure to the toxic agent. They may be localized in the cortex or the medulla and affect all parts of the nephron: the glomeruli, the tubules, the interstitium or the vessels. How then is the topic of a brief expose to be chosen? It was made based upon the results of a questionnaire addressed to French nephrologists.", 
    "269": "The evaluation of the dose-antihypertensive effect relationship of a drug is essential for the rational determination of the effective dose. The efficacy and safety of the dose of 4 mg of perindopril in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension were demonstrated by means of two double-blind studies conducted according to a rigorous methodology. This efficacy was still present 24 hours after the last dose of perindopril. The dose of 2 mg appeared to be insufficient to exert a significant antihypertensive effect. In the case of inadequate efficacy of the dose of 4 mg of perindopril, the dose of 8 mg is able to exert a greater antihypertensive effect without any major harmful effects. The antihypertensive efficacy is parallel to the percentage of converting enzyme inhibition induced by perindopril. The contribution of the automated method of blood pressure recording using the Dinamap method to establish a dose-effect relationship with reference to the classical sphygmomanometric method is clearly illustrated.", 
    "270": "The new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril was evaluated in normotensive men. Doses of 2 to 16 mg were given once a day for up to one week. Single oral doses of perindopril were found to blunt the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I in a dose-dependent manner. The drug-induced ACE inhibition, as estimated by the measurement of plasma ACE activity, was maximal 4 to 8 hours post drug intake. ACE activity was still markedly reduced 24 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone decreased significantly, whereas plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I levels rose during peak ACE inhibition induced by the 4 and 8 mg doses. However, circulating levels of angiotensin II returned to baseline values 24 hours after dosing, both on the first day of treatment and after one week of administration. ACE inhibition with perindopril did not consistently affect blood pressure and heart rate. There was no evidence for drug accumulation during repeated administration. The novel ACE inhibitor was well tolerated and produced no change in routine laboratory tests. The long-acting ACE inhibitor perindopril therefore appears to be effective when given orally in a dose range of 4 to 16 mg.", 
    "271": "Perindopril has been studied in groups of normal young and elderly subjects, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in hypertensive patients. Plasma concentrations of perindoprilat are increased and renal clearance reduced in elderly subjects, resulting in an increase in the acute pharmacodynamic effect of perindopril. Compensated hepatic cirrhosis does not have any independent effect on the pharmacokinetics of perindopril. After intravenous administration, perindoprilat concentrations show multiexponential decay with a terminal half-life of over 30 hours, associated with sustained inhibition of ACE. During repeated dosing, there is little accumulation of the drug and no evidence of increased hemodynamic effect after chronic treatment in hypertensives. The therapeutic consequences of these findings are: (1) Binding of perindoprilat to ACE prolongs the hemodynamic effect, giving the option of once daily administration. (2) Despite the long terminal elimination half-life of the drug, significant accumulation is not a problem during chronic treatment. (3) Increased plasma concentrations of active metabolite in the elderly and reduced renal elimination may require reduced doses to be used. (4) Further dose adjustment in compensated hepatic cirrhosis is not routinely necessary.", 
    "272": "The effects of renovascular hypertension and its treatment by a converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) on the structure and function of large arteries were studied in the Goldblatt 1 clip--2 kidney rat. One month after the surgical operation, the hypertensive animals (n = 24) and the sham operated animals (n = 24) were divided into two groups receiving either 1 mg/kg per day of perindopril or distilled water for four weeks. At the end of treatment, the hemodynamic parameters, including blood pressure and instantaneous blood flow measured by Doppler, were measured in anesthetized rats. The mechanical properties of the carotid artery were studied by in situ measurement of the carotid compliance in response to imposed pressures. Lastly, morphometric parameters of the thoracic aorta, including the thickness of the media, the density of elastin, collagen and nuclei and the area of the nuclei were studied by an automated image analysis system. Hypertension was associated with an increase in the characteristic impedance of the aorta (14,479 +/- 5,171 vs 9,022 +/- 4,071 dyne.sec/cm5; p less than 0.01) and a reduction in systemic arterial compliance (2.41 +/- 0.96 vs 3.92 +/- 1.15 x 10(-3) ml/mmHg; p less than 0.01) or carotid arterial compliance (6.31 +/- 1.85 vs 8.38 +/- 3.14 x 10(-2) mm3/mmHg; p less than 0.05). Treatment with perindopril normalized systolic and diastolic blood pressure and completely inverted the markers of rigidity of the large arteries. Morphometric analysis of the aortic wall allowed these functional modifications to be attributed to structural modifications of the wall. The thickness of the media was increased by hypertension (122.3 +/- 3.7 vs 97.5 +/- 4.4 microns; p less than 0.01). This thickening was attributed to hypertrophy of the smooth muscle cells as evidenced by the increase in the nucleus size (8.58 +/- 1.54 vs 7.38 +/- 0.78 microns 2; p less than 0.01). It was accompanied by an increase in the density of collagen (8.6 +/- 3.6 vs 7.3 +/- 2.4%; p less than 0.01) and a decrease in the density of elastin (31.9 +/- 8.3 vs 38.6 +/- 12.8%; p less than 0.01). Treatment with perindopril normalized the thickness of the media (103.0 +/- 4.8 microns) by reducing cellular hypertrophy. The short duration of treatment did not allow regression of the modifications in the density of the proteins of the interstitial matrix. In conclusion, renovascular hypertension severely alters the functional and structural properties of large arteries. Treatment with perindopril normalizes the properties of the vessel wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "273": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on children is not well documented. A recent increase in popularity of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has resulted in an increased availability in the home with resulting heightened probability of accidental ingestion of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors by children. In response to this we did a retrospective study of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ingestions in children (ages 1-5 years) from two regional poison centers certified by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. The records of the Delaware Valley Regional Poison Control Center and the New Jersey Poison Information Education Systems were reviewed for 1986 and 1987. Forty-eight angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor exposures in children 1-5 were identified. Twenty exposures (12.5-300mg captopril, 5-15mg enalapril) were managed with syrup of ipecac in a hospital emergency room. All 20 remained asymptomatic for their stay. None required admission to the hospital. Seven exposures (12.5-75mg captopril, 5-10mg enalapril) were managed at home with syrup of ipecac and 1-, 4-, 24-hour follow up by telephone. All 7 remained asymptomatic. 16 exposures (12.5-100mg captopril, 5-30mg enalapril) were managed by phone at home with observation alone and 4-6 hour follow up. All 16 remained asymptomatic. Five exposures were lost to follow up. A larger series is needed to determine risk, but home monitoring seems adequate for children ingesting no more than the therapeutic dose for adults (12.5-100 mg captopril, 5-30 mg enalapril).",

The purpose of the project is to develop a methodology for documenting the applications of new drugs and recording adverse drug reactions (ADR). The primary goal is to quantify adverse drug reactions and to discover previously unknown ADR. Participating physicians record their treatment of the patient and atypical events, which are then analysed for suspected ADR.

Forty-six hypertensives who were on these medications performed a histamine inhalation test (to assess bronchial reactivity) and a further 36 of these individuals participated in the citric acid test (to assess cough threshold). A control cohort consisting of 25 age-matched, drug-free subjects also performed the citric acid test. The incidence of bronchial hyperreactivity was not significantly different between the ACE-I monotherapy regimen and the beta 1-antagonist monotherapy regimen (Chi-squared = 0.248). However, when the monotherapy regimens were pooled and compared with the ACE-I and beta 1-antagonist combination regimen, the combination regimen was found to be associated with a significantly higher incidence of bronchial hyperreactivity (Chi-squared = 6.69). No difference was observed between the age-matched controls and the hypertensive patients in terms of their cough threshold.", 
    "276": "A study was made of the effect of a single intake of captopril on the neurohumoral mechanisms of the regulation of renal circulation in 25 patients with essential hypertension (EH). Captopril induced an increase of the effective renal blood flow (ERB) and of the effective renal plasma flow along with a considerable lowering of the renal vascular resistance. No relationship was found between these changes and the time course of changes in the activity of plasma renin, aldosterone and vasopressin concentration in blood plasma. The relationship was established between the changes in the ERB and the time course of changes in baroreceptor sensitivity that significantly increased in the majority of EH patients under the effect of captopril.", 
    "277": "Xamoterol 200 mg twice daily was given for 2 months to nine patients with severe heart failure already being treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 28 to 13 mmHg and end-systolic volume fell from 115 to 106 ml m-2; indices of contractility improved and ejection fraction rose from 33 to 38%. The time constant of ventricular relaxation, T1, improved from 62 to 44 ms. Exercise tolerance improved. Thus, in this group of patients with severe heart failure, xamoterol produced benefits in systolic and diastolic function. There were no adverse effects.", 
    "278": "1. Current therapy of heart failure leaves much to be desired. Not all patients respond, and many agents lose their effects with time. 2. Newer agents may be effective but toxic, and some which have a beneficial action when given intravenously have proved disappointing when used orally. 3. The value of digoxin in patients in sinus rhythm is open to debate, and diuretics, although useful acutely in reducing fluid overload, do not appear to improve prognosis. 4. Vasodilators increase effort capacity and reduce symptoms, possibly conferring some long-term benefit, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve symptoms and decrease mortality in a wide range of patients. 5. Positive inotropes may be effective in the short term, but they increase myocardial oxygen demand and show tachyphylaxis with no prognostic benefit. 6. Xamoterol (Corwin, Carwin, Corwil, Xamtol, ICI 118,587) is a partial sympathetic agonist with approximately 50% of the activity of a pure agonist, which provides inotropic support at rest, and protection against excess sympathetic activity on exercise. 7. It is compatible with other therapies and has shown no serious toxicity. 8. It should be considered at present as an adjunct to diuretic and/or ACE inhibitor therapy, although it may be useful alone; its role will become clearer as its effects on mortality are established.", 
    "279": "1. Although heart failure is commonly associated with depressed systolic function, there is increasing evidence that impaired diastolic performance is also universally present and might be a key determinant of symptoms, physical capacity and even survival in some subsets of patients. 2. Reduced diastolic distensibility increases cardiac filling pressure not only at rest, but even more during exercise when diastolic filling time is reduced. The increases in filling pressure and diastolic wall stress lead to pulmonary congestion and subendocardial ischaemia, it also triggers myocardial hypertrophy and a detrimental remodelling of the ventricular cavity. Perhaps even more importantly, impaired ventricular distensibility limits the use of the Frank-Starling mechanism, impairing systolic pump function and cardiac output adaptation during exercise. Therapies able to improve the distensibility of the ventricle are, therefore, desirable in heart failure. 3. Nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics may indirectly increase left ventricular chamber compliance by their effects on the right side of the heart. Cardiac glycosides do not improve myocardial relaxation and may even cause diastolic contracture at toxic doses. The new beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, xamoterol, on the other hand, consistently lowers left ventricular filling pressure at rest and during exercise, and produces an increase in left ventricular dynamic compliance through the direct lusitropic effect of beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. These beneficial effects are maintained during prolonged therapy and also appear sufficient to slow the remodelling of the ventricular cavity. The improvement in symptoms and in exercise tolerance observed during xamoterol (Corwin, Carwin, Corwil, Xamtol, ICI 118,587) therapy might, therefore, be related to the improvement in left ventricular diastolic distensibility induced by this drug.", 
    "280": "1. Cardiac failure is a clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs, which can be confirmed by imaging or invasive haemodynamic techniques. It may be caused by systolic or diastolic dysfunction, but systolic dysfunction rarely occurs alone. It is important to ascertain the degree to which each contributes, and the precise aetiology of the condition, particularly in relation to surgically correctable lesions. 2. Non-pharmacological approaches including weight loss, salt restriction and lifestyle changes may be beneficial in some patients, and diuretics, which reduce the load on the heart, are the traditional baseline therapy. 3. Digitalis has been used where problems with contractility predominate, but its beneficial effect has been disputed, and expectations of improvement in patients in sinus rhythm should not be too high. 4. Vasodilators have been considered as the next line of treatment. Arteriolar dilators tend to increase cardiac output, but have little effect on pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and venodilators tend to have the opposite effect. Probably both actions are necessary and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have both, have proved effective in terms of symptoms and survival. 5. Various other inotropic agents have been tried. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors improve exercise tolerance, but may increase the probability of serious arrhythmias, already a significant cause of sudden death. beta 1-partial adrenoceptor agonists such as xamoterol have shown some promise, and anti-arrhythmic therapy has also been considered. 6. Drugs which prevent progression of myocardial damage would prove a great advance, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers appear to have considerable potential in this area.", 
    "281": "We have studied the contribution of neurohumoral and structural factors to pressor responsiveness and peripheral resistance in mild/moderate hypertension. Pressor responses to intravenous infusions of phenylephrine (an alpha1 agonist) and angiotensin II were studied in groups of patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment, for 6 weeks with either nifedipine (20 mg bid), enalapril (20 mg daily) or doxazosin (2 mg daily). All drugs lowered blood pressure to a similar extent. Pressor responsiveness to both phenylephrine and angiotensin II showed wide intersubject variation when expressed as the dose of agonist required to raise mean arterial pressure by 20 mmHg (PD20). A group of age-matched normotensive controls showed a similar PD20 for phenylephrine to hypertensives. Angiotensin 11 sensitivity was greater in hypertensives. Drug treatment had different effects in hypertensive patients. Doxazosin, an alpha blocker, reduced the responsiveness to phenylephrine but had no effect on responses to angiotensin II. Nifedipine attenuated responses to both agonists while treatment with enalapril increased responsiveness to both phenylephrine and angiotensin II. We have not found evidence of systematic differences in alpha 1 receptor responses in hypertensives and different \"vasodilator\" drugs can lower blood pressure with widely different effects on adrenergic and non-adrenergic vascular responses.", 
    "282": "Essential hypertension is a major health care problem in the elderly and requires effective treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The traditional stepped-care approach to therapy consisted of diuretics; sympatholytic agents, or beta-blockers for all age groups. Indeed, initial therapy with these agents is effective in 50 to 60 percent of elderly patients but may produce adverse effects. A high incidence of adverse responses, including sexual dysfunction and central nervous system impairment, has been reported with diuretic or beta-blocker therapy, and a reduction in several measures of quality of life has been noted during therapy with methyldopa or propranolol. Administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is as effective as the traditional stepped-care approach without producing the ill effects associated with diuretics, sympatholytics, or beta-blockers. The combination of an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic produces additive antihypertensive effects while minimizing diuretic-induced metabolic alterations. Orthostatic hypotension with the first dose can be minimized by making sure that patients are not hypovolemic from previous diuretic therapy. Nevertheless, in controlled trials, the combination of ACE inhibitor and diuretic has been effective in up to 85 percent of patients. In addition, the use of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in the hypertensive patient with concomitant congestive heart failure. Most important, the patient's quality of life is maintained during therapy with an ACE inhibitor alone or in combination with a diuretic. Thus, an ACE inhibitor plus a diuretic is a valuable alternative to traditional antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients.", 
    "283": "The effects of intravenous captopril and intravenous digoxin given separately and in combination on rest and exercise hemodynamics were studied in 16 patients with severe heart failure and sinus rhythm. When given separately, both captopril and digoxin decreased the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by, respectively, 24% (p = 0.003) and 34% (p = 0.004) and systemic vascular resistance by 23% (p = 0.09) and 20% (p = 0.03). Only digoxin increased cardiac index by 23% (p = 0.03) and stroke work index by 52% (p = 0.01). During maximal exercise, captopril alone decreased systemic vascular resistance by 28% (p = 0.0002) and increased cardiac index by 33% (p = 0.02). Digoxin alone decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 11% (p = 0.04) and increased stroke work index by 44% (p = 0.01). The combination of captopril and digoxin resulted in a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index both at rest and during exercise that was greater than values observed with either drug given alone. Cardiac index response to the combination of captopril and digoxin correlated with baseline serum aldosterone concentration (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0002). A significant decrease in norepinephrine concentration was noted after digoxin was administered alone or added to captopril. These findings demonstrate that in patients with severe heart failure, the acute administration of captopril and digoxin has an independent salutary hemodynamic effect. The combination of these agents, however, has an adjunctive effect on cardiac function at rest and during exercise.", 
    "284": "Reduced parasympathetic activity has been reported in essential hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibition seems to increase parasympathetic tone. In order to evaluate the effects of enalapril on parasympathetic control of heart rate, the authors studied ten mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients (7 F, 3 M), treated for 2 weeks with placebo and for 1 month with enalapril. Compared to placebo, enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.005 at least, both systolic and diastolic), without any change in heart rate. Enalapril enhanced parasympathetic activity as judged by the increased variation of heart period (VHP) during regular breathing. VHP was derived during continuous ECG recording by the difference between the mean of all maximum and minimum R-R intervals, taken as a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia: the higher the VHP, the higher the parasympathetic cardiac influence and vice versa. The response to exercise, used as an index of sympathetic stimulation, was not modified by enalapril: the heart rate peak reached during either static (hand grip) or dynamic (bicycle ergometer) exercise and the slope of the increase in blood pressure were unchanged. Therefore, enalapril appears to increase parasympathetic tone in essential hypertension, without any interference with sympathetic adaptation to stress.", 
    "285": "In a previous study (1) we could show a significantly more pronounced reversal of LVH with metoprolol than with gallopamil, whereas the combined therapy with atenolol and nifedipine was even more effective.

    "287": "Many studies have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Initially, the hemodynamic changes that occur with these agents were attributed solely to the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in plasma. Further research suggested other mechanisms were operable as a relationship was not always evident between hemodynamic changes and inhibition of the plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. A relationship between the pharmacodynamics of these agents and the inhibition of vascular and tissue renin-angiotensin systems, however, has been observed. Mechanisms less likely to contribute to the actions of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are increases in bradykinin and prostaglandin concentrations, or inhibition in the renin-angiotensin system within the central nervous system. Ancillary cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors offer possible new therapeutic gains. An understanding of these mechanistic controversies and newly-defined cardiovascular actions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are important to clinicians using these agents.", 
    "288": "The tissue distribution of Perindopril, a new potent inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), was studied after in vivo intravenous injection into rabbits of tracer amounts of the tritiated drug either alone (no modification of the renin angiotensin system) or along with a pharmacologic dose of 10 mg/kg unlabelled Perindopril. Lung and kidneys were the most densely labelled tissues. Kidney distribution of tritiated Perindopril was studied either by histo-autoradiography or by measurement of radioactivity in the homogenates of dissected kidney zones. A close parallelism was found between the distribution patterns of ACE and radioactivity throughout the kidney. Tritiated-Perindopril binding was inhibited by concurrent treatment of the animals with the unlabelled drug or pretreatment with Captopril. Autoradiographic study of kidney slices after the administration of tracer amounts of Perindopril showed an intense labelling of the glomerular mesangium and of endothelial structures of blood vessels, and a lack of labelling of tubular epithelial cells. The possible occurrence of two pools of \"ACE-like\" activity in the kidney is discussed, namely i) one pool which is labelled by tritiated Perindopril, located in glomerular mesangium and endothelial structures which may be involved in the pharmacological action of ACE inhibitors; and ii) a second pool located in the proximal-tubule cell brush-border, remaining unlabelled by Perindopril, for which the high amount of neutral endopeptidase present at this site may be responsible.",

The overall recoveries of AII were 95.2 +/- 15.8% (means +/- SD) when 10 pg of this peptide was added to 1 ml of human plasma. The coefficient of variation for within-assay precision was 10% (n = 6). The plasma AII, measured by this method, of normal male pentobarbital-anesthetized rats was 53.0-141.6 pg/ml (mean: 103.9 +/- 29.7 pg/ml). The plasma AII of rats fed a sodium deficient diet was 300.0 +/- 100.6 pg/ml, while that of rats given oral Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for 1 week was 35.7 +/- 28.0 pg/ml. The plasma AII of bilaterally nephrectomized rats was 2.7 +/- 2.9 pg/ml 24 hours after nephrectomy and below the detection limit 48 hr after nephrectomy. This method, therefore, can be used to study AII in different pathophysiological states or after treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.", 
    "290": "We compared the natriuretic and diuretic effect of an intravenous infusion of 1-28 human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) (0.1 micrograms/kg/min over 30 min) in 10 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and in 10 control subjects of similar age and sex. In the controls, urine volume rose from 36.8 +/- 8.55 to 115.6 +/- 34.2 ml/30 min and urinary sodium excretion from 4.55 +/- 0.8 to 11.2 +/- 2.24 mEq/30 min before and during the infusion of ANP, respectively. In patients, baseline urine volume and sodium output were similar, however, rise in urine volume and urinary sodium was greatly reduced during the infusion of hANP. In patients with CHF, baseline plasma ANP levels (604.1 +/- 135.3 vs. 39.4 +/- 5.85 pg/ml; p less than 0.005) and urinary excretion of cyclic GMP (cGMP) (41.8 +/- 5.22 vs. 15.2 +/- 4.19 nmol/30 min; p less than 0.05) were significantly elevated compared to controls. The absolute and relative rise in cGMP excretion, however, was blunted in patients with CHF. In the controls, angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalapril significantly reduced the urinary output of sodium and water after ANP infusion. Plasma ANP levels and urinary cGMP remained unaltered by ACE inhibition. Furthermore, treatment with enalapril resulted in a rise in renin and a drop in aldosterone levels. The reduction of plasma renin and serum aldosterone by ANP was maintained after ACE inhibition. In the patient group, administration of enalapril (3 X 2.5 mg every 6 h) reduced ACE activity in the serum from 84.7 +/- 16.9 to 2.13 +/- 0.88 U/l. Arterial blood pressure was lowered from 114.7 +/- 6.69 to 106.1 +/- 7.25 mm Hg systolic and from 76.9 +/- 3 to 69.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg diastolic. However, natriuresis and diuresis and creatinine clearance following infusion of ANP remained unaltered.", 
    "291": "1. Antihypertensive agents normalize blood pressure and restore depressed endothelium-dependent relaxations in experimental models of hypertension, but little is known regarding whether antihypertensive agents themselves can directly modulate responses to agonists of endothelium-dependent or independent relaxations, or contractions. 2. Normal rats were treated with either tap water, captopril, hydralazine or enalapril in their drinking water for 2 weeks, following which endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations were tested with acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively, in aortic rings suspended in organ chambers. 3. All antihypertensive agents caused slight but similar potentiation of sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxations. However, their effects on acetylcholine-induced relaxations were quite different: captopril had a marked potentiating effect, hydrazaline a slight potentiating effect, and enalapril had no significant effect on these relaxations. 4. The relaxations induced by acetylcholine and potentiated by captopril were not altered when indomethacin was included in the tissue bath. However, pyrogallol, an inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), markedly inhibited these relaxations suggesting that captopril's effect may involve EDRF. 5. SQ 14,534, a stereoisomer of captopril which is 100 fold less potent in inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, also significantly enhanced acetylcholine induced relaxations. Thus the effects of both captopril and SQ 14,534 upon EDRF appear independent of the effects of these compounds on the angiotensin converting enzyme. 6. We conclude that certain antihypertensive agents may modulate endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to agonists, and that these properties may be of therapeutic importance in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "292": "1. Seven drugs (captopril, zofenopril, enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril, fosinopril, and SQ 29,852) were compared in vitro in homogenates of aorta, brain, heart, lung, and kidney and in sera of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) both with respect to potencies of their active moieties as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and, where applicable, rates of hydrolysis of their prodrug ester functions. 2. In ex vivo dose-response and time-course studies, the inhibitory effects of the seven drugs on tissue ACEs and their relative distributions to SHR tissues were compared following oral administration. 3. The relative potencies of the inhibitory moieties of the drugs (in parentheses) and the normalized 'equiactive' oral doses employed for time-course studies were: SQ 29,852 (1.0), 100 mg kg-1; captopril (3.5), 30 mg kg-1; enalapril (12), 20 mg kg-1; fosinopril (13), 25 mg kg-1; zofenopril (20), 10 mg kg-1; lisinopril (24), 10 mg kg-1; and ramipril (51), 5 mg kg-1. 4. Following oral administration of the drugs to SHR, the degree and duration of ACE inhibition in aorta and lung correlated with the antihypertensive actions, with ramipril, lisinopril, and zofenopril producing effects of the greatest magnitude and duration. 5. Ramipril and enalapril did not inhibit brain ACE ex vivo; captopril and zofenopril had modest but short-lasting effects; and fosinopril, lisinopril, and SQ 29,852 had long-lasting inhibitory actions, which, with the latter two, were delayed in onset. 6. All of the drugs produced significant inhibition of kidney ACE, with ramipril and fosinopril having somewhat weaker effects, perhaps due to biliary routes of excretion. 7. Captopril, fosinopril, and particularly zofenopril inhibited cardiac ACE ex vivo with degrees and durations that were marked compared with those of the other drugs; preliminary studies with isolated hearts suggest a possible relationship between inhibition of cardiac ACE and preservation of cardiac function subsequent to ischaemia.", 
    "293": "To assess the mechanism by which inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) lower blood pressure, we evaluated the role of endogenous angiotensin II in the antihypertensive effect of MK 421, a long-lasting ACE inhibitor, in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of norepinephrine or vasopressin. The hypertensive effect of norepinephrine (1.8 mg/kg/day, ip) or vasopressin (7.2 U/kg/day, ip) was inhibited by the simultaneous administration of MK 421 (6 mg/kg/day, ip). Additional administration of angiotensin II at a subpressor dose (36 micrograms/kg/day, ip) did not revert the antihypertensive effect of MK 421 in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of norepinephrine or vasopressin. The present results suggest that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors may depend on a reduced sensitivity of the vasculature to vasoconstrictor substances. In addition, it is also suggested that the suppressed angiotensin II may not be essential for the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of norepinephrine or vasopressin.", 
    "294": "We investigated, with use of a technique of feedback analysis, the dynamic changes in and around the renin-angiotensin system in vivo induced by ACE inhibition. Prolonged studies were performed over a half year on rabbits, which were treated by daily injections of saline or one of the inhibitors as follows: captopril, foroxymithine, histargin and pepstatin. In spite of the apparently bizarre movements of the raw data, the analysis with autoregressive modelling unveiled the different modes of feedback regulations of the renin-angiotensin system under the influence of the various inhibitors. In order to interpret the in vivo actions of enzyme inhibitors, it seems essential to take feedback regulations into consideration.", 
    "295": "LPS (E. Coli), captopril, enalapril, teprotide and BK-infusion induced after 18 h in rabbits an increased hypotensive response to the selective B1-receptor agonist des-Arg9-BK. A similar selective increase in responsiveness and sensitivity of the in vitro aortic strip to des-Arg9-BK taken from pretreated animals was also seen. These results suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may elevate endogenous kinin levels which may contribute towards the inflammatory side-effects seen with this group of drugs.", 
    "296": "A comparative study of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme and renin activity was carried out in 55 patients with sarcoidosis and other pulmonary diseases. The converting enzyme activity was significantly increased in active sarcoidosis, showing a tendency to return to normal values after corticoid treatment, while plasma renin activity remained unaltered both before and after corticotherapy. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of the converting enzyme measurements, as already shown by others. Attention is drawn on the possible involvement of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system in the local vascular and enzymo-chemical alterations, suggesting the possibility of associating the converting enzyme inhibitors to the corticotherapy of sarcoidosis.",

Captopril and enalapril were given by the intraperitoneal route for 15 days, at 160 mumols/kg/d and 40 mumols/kg/d, respectively. Elements in tissues were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry with a JY 48 instrument. The common changes produced with the two drugs were: a decrease of Na in muscle (-10%), a decrease of Ca in plasma and kidney (less than -10%) and a decrease of Mn in liver (-15%). The main effects observed with only one of the two drugs were: an increase of Cu in plasma (+26%) with captopril, and increases of Sr in heart (+56%), muscle (+79%) and liver (+74%) with enalapril. Zinc concentration in tissues was not modified, except for an increase in liver with captopril (+13%) and a decrease in heart with enalapril (-11%).",

Blood pressure was reduced from an average of 170/101 mm Hg at the onset of the trial to 145/85.5 mm Hg after 24 weeks. The treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and tolerance improved remarkably in the patients, whose previous treatment had caused intolerance. Quality of life, determined by means of the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire, was favourably influenced in the patients participating in this study.",

    "300": "A new, orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CGS 16617, has been evaluated in normotensive subjects during acute and prolonged administration. Single ascending doses of CGS 16617 20 to 100 mg were given to 9 normotensive volunteers at one week intervals and the changes in blood pressure, plasma ACE and renin activity were examined up to 72 h after drug intake. Also, CGS 16617 50 mg/day or placebo were given for 30 days to 8 and 6 normotensive subjects, respectively, maintained on an unrestricted salt diet. Blood pressure was measured daily in the office and ambulatory blood pressure profiles were also obtained before, during and after therapy, using the Remler M 2000 blood pressure recording system. CGS 16617 was an effective and long lasting ACE inhibitor. It did not induce a consistent change in blood pressure, but, the individual responses were very variable and several subjects experienced a clear decrease in the average of the blood pressures recorded during the daytime.", 
    "301": "Enalapril (20 mg daily) was used in the treatment of primary arterial hypertension in 28 patients with the WHO class I and II and diastolic blood pressure ranging from 105 to 120 mm Hg. Hypotensive effect after an initial dose of enalapril occurred in 12 patients (42.8%) in whom a decrease in blood pressure at 1 hr exceeded 10% of the basal value (from means = 169.9/109.1 to 146.7/97.9 mmHg). At 6 weeks positive hypotensive effect was found in 46% of patients. A combination of enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg daily) in patients without normalization of the blood pressure level increased the number of the favourably treated to 64%. Of 12 patients with positive effects after the first dose of enalapril only seven patients profited from chronic enalapril monotherapy. In chronic treatment enalapril seemed to be well tolerated and side effects were only sporadic.",

Systemic blood pressure decreased, glomerular filtration rate was not significantly changed, and sodium fractional excretion and renal plasma flow increased, whereas renal vascular resistances and filtration fraction decreased acutely at the end of the study. Proteinuria diminished, but no variations in qualitative pattern were observed. ACE inhibitors, promoting efferent rather than afferent arteriolar vasodilatation and reduction of glomerular permeability coefficient, may reduce glomerular capillary hypertension and the development of proteinuria.", 
    "303": "1. The pharmacokinetics of cilazapril and the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were investigated in 10 patients with congestive heart failure, NYHA class II-III, receiving diuretics with or without digoxin. 2. Patients received 0.5 mg and 1 mg cilazapril on the first 2 days, followed by 0.5 mg or 1 mg daily for the next 8 weeks, in a single-blind study. Plasma cilazaprilat concentrations and plasma ACE activities were measured by radioenzymatic methods up to 24 h after the first and last doses. 3. After the initial 0.5 mg dose of cilazapril, a mean maximum plasma concentration of cilazaprilat of 6.8 ng ml-1 was observed at 2.3 h. Concentrations declined up to 8 h with a mean half-life of 5.8 h, followed by slower decrease to 24 h. Total clearance, based on data to 24 h, was estimated at 8.5 l h-1, with three-fold inter-individual variation. Mean maximum plasma ACE inhibition was 87%, decreasing to 65% at 24 h. 4. In the multiple dose phase of the study, four patients received cilazapril 0.5 mg daily, and six patients 1 mg daily. Cilazapril accumulation for the 0.5 mg group averaged 77%, but steady state concentrations for the 1 mg group were less than double those of the 0.5 mg group. ACE inhibition profiles at steady state were similar for both groups, and they differed from first dose data only in a somewhat lower inhibition at 24 h. 5. Historical comparison of the first-dose data with those for healthy young volunteers at identical dosage revealed only minor differences in kinetic parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "304": "1. In a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study 12 patients with essential hypertension received single doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg of cilazapril. 2. Peak plasma levels of cilazaprilat and the 24 h areas under curve were directly proportional to dose. 3. The elimination half-life during the first 8 h was about 1.7 h. 4. From 24 h onwards there was a prolonged terminal elimination phase with a half-life of about 40 h, and strict dose proportionality of plasma concentrations was not maintained. 5. The pharmacokinetics of cilazaprilat and the pharmacodynamics of plasma ACE inhibition were well described by a one compartment model with saturable binding to ACE. 6. The coefficients of the model which related to plasma ACE and its interaction with cilazaprilat were in good agreement with model independent observations. 7. The values for kinetic and dynamic parameters in hypertensive patients were comparable with those reported for healthy volunteers.", 
    "305": "1. There is recent experimental evidence that the renin-angiotensin-system may play an essential role in producing splanchnic vasoconstriction. However, controversy exists as to the influence of ACE inhibition on splanchnic haemodynamics in man. We therefore investigated whether cilazapril, a structurally new and long-acting ACE inhibitor, interacts with angiotensin I-dependent changes in splanchnic haemodynamics in man, using an experimental model. 2. The effects of cilazapril on angiotensin I-induced splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics were studied in seven normotensive men using the hepatic venous catheter technique (indocyanine-green dye), right-heart catheterisation (thermodilution method), intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring and systolic time-intervals. Dose-responses to angiotensin I were determined under control conditions and 60 min after ACE inhibition with 5 mg oral cilazapril. Angiotensin I was infused intravenously at constant rates in an increasing dose-sequence until systolic blood pressure was greater than 30 mm Hg. 3. ACE inhibition with cilazapril did not change basal splanchnic or systemic haemodynamics to any relevant extent. The angiotensin I dependent increase in systemic and pulmonary resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was attenuated by cilazapril, as indicated by the shift of the dose-response curves to the right. In the splanchnic vascular bed angiotensin I dose-dependently increased splanchnic vascular resistance and also wedge hepatic venous pressure and decreased splanchnic blood flow. These angiotensin I induced haemodynamic changes were clearly suppressed by cilazapril. The angiotensin I dose needed to produce a 30% increase in splanchnic vascular resistance, given as mean and s.e. mean, was 1.7 +/- 0.3 micrograms min-1 during control-trials vs 7.3 +/- 1.3 micrograms min-1 after ACE inhibition with cilazapril (P less than 0.001). 4. We conclude that, in man, the influence of cilazapril on acute angiotensin I-mediated haemodynamic responses is present in the splanchnic vascular bed, and that the overall effects of cilazapril are consistent with both arterial and venous effects of the ACE inhibitor. Cilazapril effectively counteracts angiotensin I-induced splanchnic vasoconstriction.", 
    "306": "1. The aim of the studies was to develop a new methodology to estimate the pharmacodynamic properties and potency of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in man. 2. Angiotensin I dose-response curves were derived by continuous infusion of angiotensin I in increasing dose steps; steady state was reached within 3 min. 3. Interaction between angiotensin I (agonist) and ACE inhibitors (antagonist) was characterized according to Schild-plot methodology by measuring agonist dose-response curves using diastolic blood pressure in the absence and the presence of varying doses of the antagonist. 4. Cilazapril shifted the angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. A twofold shift (apparent Ki-dose) was observed with approximately 0.6 mg cilazapril. 5. The effect of angiotensin I on diastolic blood pressure was determined before and up to 36 h after administration of 25 mg captopril, 10 mg enalapril, 4 mg cilazapril and a placebo orally. The pharmacodynamic half-life of captopril was about 2 h, whereas the effect of enalapril and cilazapril was about 4 h. 6. Angiotensin I dose-response curves are useful methods of investigating the pharmacodynamic properties of ACE-inhibitors in man.", 
    "307": "1. The three dimensional requirements for inhibition of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) were investigated in order to facilitate design of a more potent and selective antihypertensive agent. 2. All compounds designed possessed a bicyclic unit incorporating carboxylate and amidic carbonyl groups together with a thiol-bearing side chain. 3. NMR spectroscopy of the bicyclic units and molecular mechanics calculations enabled the possible positions of the thiol group to be studied. 4. Determination of the positions of the thiol group conferring best inhibition in the active site of ACE permitted the probable location of the active site zinc ion to be identified. The intention was to replace the thiol side chain with a homophenylalanine unit to bind to the zinc ion and also to occupy the S1 site which fits the Phe8 side chain of angiotensin I. 5. Examination of a torsional angle psi in a compound possessing poor inhibitory potency indicated correspondence to a high energy conformation of alanylproline. The bicyclic unit was modified to incorporate a seven-instead of a six-membered ring to bring psi into the range of an accessible conformation of alanylproline. The corresponding IC50 resulting indicated that psi was closer to that of the active conformations of enalaprilat and captopril. 6. Removal of one carbonyl improved the ACE inhibitory potency further. 7. The postulated active conformation of cilazaprilat is presented.", 
    "308": "Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity is elevated in certain human granulomatous diseases. Angiotensin II modestly suppresses thymidine incorporation and augments gamma interferon production from human blood mononuclear cells. This suggests that angiotensin II may play an immunoregulatory role in human granulomatous inflammation. For this reason, the binding of angiotensin II to human peripheral blood mixed mononuclear cells, and to the human monocyte-like cell line, U-937, was studied. Angiotensin II binding to U-937 cells reveals a low level of saturable specific binding (Kd = 3 x 10(-10) M). However, binding to human cells is not easily reversible and is poorly inhibited in a competitive manner. In addition, the molecular integrity of the radioligand is not maintained following binding. Therefore, the definition of classical receptor binding cannot be fulfilled. Since binding is decreased by low temperatures and various metabolic inhibitors, it appears likely that endocytosis occurs, perhaps along with receptor binding. Angiotensin II or its breakdown products modulate the production of monocyte cAMP in spite of the inability to demonstrate classical cell surface receptors.", 
    "309": "Captopril has been reported to inhibit ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity in erythrocyte membrane fragments. We investigated the effect of captopril on two physiological measures of Na+/K+ pump activity: 22Na+ efflux from human erythrocytes and K+-induced relaxation of rat tail artery segments. Captopril inhibited 22Na+ efflux from erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion, with 50% inhibition of total 22Na+ efflux at a concentration of 4.8 X 10(-3) M. The inhibition produced by captopril (5 X 10(-3) M) and ouabain (10(-4) M) was not greater than that produced by ouabain alone (65.3 vs. 66.9%, respectively), and captopril inhibited 50% of ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ efflux at a concentration of 2.0 X 10(-3) M. Inhibition by captopril of ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux was not explained by changes in intracellular sodium concentration, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme or a sulfhydryl effect. Utilizing rat tail arteries pre-contracted with norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5HT) in K+-free solutions, we demonstrated dose-related inhibition of K+-induced relaxation by captopril (10(-6) to 10(-4) M). Concentrations above 10(-4) M did not significantly inhibit K+-induced relaxation but did decrease contractile responses to NE, although not to 5HT. Inhibition of K+-induced relaxation by captopril was not affected by saralasin, teprotide or indomethacin. We conclude that captopril can inhibit membrane Na+/K+-ATPase in intact red blood cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. The mechanism of pump suppression is uncertain, but inhibition of ATPase should be considered when high concentrations of captopril are employed in physiological studies.", 
    "310": "Lisinopril is a synthetic, nonsulfhydryl, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Its bioavailability is approximately 25% and is not affected by food. Hepatic metabolism is not required for pharmacologic effect, which occurs 1 hour after administration. Peak serum concentration and effect are delayed, occurring 6-8 hours after a single dose and lasting for at least 24 hours. The drug is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The elimination half-life is 12.6 hours and is prolonged in renal impairment. Lisinopril 10-80 mg once a day is effective in lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension. It is as effective as hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, and nifedipine. Combining lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide produces a greater degree of blood pressure reduction. Patients with congestive heart failure have demonstrated immediate and prolonged beneficial hemodynamic effects and increased exercise tolerance. Lisinopril is well tolerated. Clinically significant drug interactions have not been reported, but caution should be used when lisinopril is administered with diuretics, nifedipine, or agents that may increase concentrations of potassium. The usual initial oral dosage of lisinopril is 10 mg once a day (range 20-40 mg/day). Lower dosages may be necessary in patients with renal impairment or congestive heart failure, elderly persons, and those receiving diuretics.", 
    "311": "The bradykinin receptor antagonists [D-Phe7]bradykinin, D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7]bradykinin and D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]bradykinin were tested for their ability to serve as substrates for kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme) purified from rabbit lung. By HPLC, the peptides were not measurably degraded over 30 minutes. Under identical conditions, bradykinin was completely degraded to bradykinin (1-7). When hippuryl-His-Leu was used as a substrate for kininase II, the D-Phe7-substituted bradykinins acted as weak noncompetitive inhibitors. While the peptides were poor substrates for kininase II, they were short-lived when injected intravenously. D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7]bradykinin was completely degraded to small fragments in less than 2 minutes. In diluted serum in vitro, a single product was observed with elution consistent with loss of arginine, suggestive of metabolism by kininase I.", 
    "312": "We investigated the activity of bombesin (BN), neuromedin-C (NM-C) and neuromedin-B (NM-B) on serotonin (5-HT) release and reuptake in rat hypothalamus (HYP) in vitro. BN and NM-C but not NM-B (all 1 microM) decreased K+ evoked 3H-5-HT release from superfused HYP slices by 25%. Bacitracin (BCN, 2 micrograms/ml), a nonspecific peptidase inhibitor, reversed the inhibitory effect of BN on K+ evoked 3H-5-HT release. Phosphoramidon (PAN, 10 microM) an endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, abolished the inhibitory effect of BN, but not NM-C, on K+ evoked 3H-5-HT release. The peptidyl dipeptidase A inhibitor enalaprilat (ENP, 10 microM), enhanced both BN and NM-C inhibition of 3H-5-HT release. Bestatin (BST, 10 microM) had no effect on BN or NM-C inhibitory activity on 3H-5-HT release. Neither BN, NM-C nor NM-B affected reuptake of 3H-5-HT into HYP synaptosomes alone or in combination with any of the peptidase inhibitors, nor did these peptides alter the ability of fluoxetine to inhibit 3H-5-HT uptake. These data suggest: a) that BN-like peptides may alter neurotransmission in the HYP by acting presynaptically on the 5-HT release mechanism; b) a similarity in the structural requirements for the BN induced inhibition of 5-HT release and BN evoked thermoregulatory disturbances; and c) that peptidases may selectively augment or reduce pharmacologic activity of BN-like peptides upon CNS administration.", 
    "313": "The antihypertensive efficacy both of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and thiazide diuretics has been claimed to be influenced by plasma renin activity, which declines with age and is low in blacks. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group preliminary study, the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (20 mg day-1) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg day-1) were evaluated and compared for 4 weeks in 20 African patients with essential hypertension. The two groups had similar baseline clinical features and serum Na+ and K+ levels. Hydrochlorothiazide caused a significant and sustained fall in erect blood pressure with a reflex tachycardia. Enalapril exerted only a modest antihypertensive action, but significantly reduced erect heart rate. Direct comparison of hydrochlorothiazide- and enalapril-induced hypotension suggested a greater fall in subjects on the thiazide. The 95% confidence limits for the thiazide-enalapril difference in antihypertensive action at the end of the study was 39.5 to -7.5 mm Hg systolic and 22.0 to -6.6 mm Hg diastolic. The maximal blood pressure fall after hydrochlorothiazide was positively correlated with age (r = 0.50; p less than 0.05), whilst that of enalapril was inversely related age to (r = -0.57, p less than 0.05). The results are compatible with the notion that ACE inhibitor monotherapy may be less effective than thiazide diuretic treatment in African and black patients with essential hypertension. The findings also support the concept that age and racial factors may influence the response to antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "314": "Perindopril, a new specific and potent inhibitor of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme, was used to evaluate the possible participation of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of aminoglycoside-induced renal failure. Kidney function, morphology and biochemistry were evaluated at regular intervals throughout the study. Perindopril was given orally to rats at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg for 15 days prior to and during 15-day gentamicin treatment given intraperitoneally at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg. Perindopril treatment alone induced no modification in renal function or structure. Gentamicin treatment alone induced typical renal lesions which were scored as moderate and a slight but significant decrease in ACE blood levels. Concurrent treatment with perindopril and gentamicin induced a greater drop in ACE blood levels than after the administration of perindopril alone and produced more marked renal impairment than after the administration of gentamicin alone. These observations suggest that the integrity of the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in limiting kidney injury during aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "315": "We studied the effects of mid-term enalapril administration on protein-load-induced renal responses in 10 patients with early chronic renal failure (serum creatinine 2.70 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). The oral protein load was performed twice, before and after a 10-day therapy with enalapril. Glomerular filtration rate (125I-iothalamate clearance) rose from 22.5 +/- 10.6 to 60.1 +/- 32.8 ml/min after the protein load before enalapril; it did not change after the protein load during enalapril therapy. Percent fractional excretion of sodium, urinary osmolality and free water clearance were significantly affected only by the protein load before enalapril. Enalapril blunts the protein-load-induced changes in glomerular filtration rate and in tubular function; these effects might be mediated by angiotensin II blockade.",

We examined in humans whether enalapril, which has been shown to decrease glomerular capillary pressure in rats with chronic renal failure, could attenuate the renal response to a meat meal. Twelve healthy volunteers were studied after an oral protein load, 1.5 g/kg body weight, as lean cooked beef meat, and on a separate day, after eating the same meal with prior oral intake of enalapril. On the control day, creatinine clearance increased from 114.3 +/- 4.7 before the meal to 137.1 +/- 4.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 after the meal (p less than 0.001). On the enalapril intake day, creatinine clearance increased from 113.7 +/- 5.6 before the meal to 128.3 +/- 5.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 after the meal (p less than 0.01). However, the mean increase in creatinine clearance was lower on the enalapril intake than on the control day (14.0 +/- 4.3 vs. 21.0 +/- 4.1%, p less than 0.05). Mean arterial pressure before the meal was lower on the enalapril intake day than on the control day (76.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 84.2 +/- 3.6, p less than 0.01). Likewise, postprandial mean arterial pressure was lower on the enalapril day compared with the control day (69.9 +/- 2.8 vs. 78.5 +/- 3.7, p less than 0.01). We conclude that enalapril blunts the hyperfiltration which follows a meat meal.", 
    "317": "A 65-year-old woman started taking enalapril 2.5 mg daily for hypertension. Twelve days later she complained of a persistent, dry cough. Due to the coughing and a preexisting cystocele, she developed stress incontinence and a marked decline in her functional status. The coughing and incontinence resolved with the discontinuation of enalapril. During a subsequent hospitalization the patient received captopril 6.25 mg twice daily for congestive heart failure. Within 24 hours the dry cough recurred. It resolved with the discontinuation of the drug. Cough is a symptom that is generally not recognized as a drug side effect. However, increasing numbers of case reports document angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough. Although the actual frequency and mechanism are currently unknown, the dry cough typically begins early in the course of therapy. It may be specific to this pharmacologic class rather than to one individual agent. Age and sex may be contributing factors. While cough has been considered a minor side effect, unnecessary hospitalizations and inappropriate treatments may easily result. Even minor adverse reactions may have an impact on a patient's quality of life.", 
    "318": "The effect of zinc depletion and of additional angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment was studied on ACE in aortic and other tissues, in plasma and on systolic blood pressure of the rat. Zinc deprivation significantly reduced plasma zinc concentration, plasma and testicular ACE activities and blood pressure, but stimulated aortic ACE while lung values remained constant. Zinc deficiency combined with ACE inhibition further suppressed plasma ACE and stimulated the aortic enzyme earlier. Zinc repletion experiments (in vitro) suggest the existence of a feedback mechanism controlling ACE synthesis depending on plasma ACE activity.", 
    "319": "The effect of captopril on the mean arterial blood pressure was studied in rats. Two different disease-state rats, namely the sodium-deficient rat (SDR) and the two-kidney-one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rat (GHR), as well as normotensive rats (NR), were used. After i.v. bolus administration of captopril to each rat, the time course of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and mean arterial blood pressure were determined. In a different experiment, the effect of captopril on the plasma ACE activity in vitro was determined. Captopril inhibited the plasma ACE activity in a concentration-dependent manner and the relationship between concentration of captopril and inhibition of plasma ACE activity in vitro was reasonably described by a Langmuir-type equation. Then, plasma concentrations of captopril after i.v. administration were estimated by means of this equation. The estimated plasma concentration of captopril followed a double exponential equation. From the data obtained, a kinetic model including the renin-angiotensin system and pharmacokinetics of captopril was constructed under the following assumptions; (1) the hypotensive effect of captopril is solely attributable to the reduction of angiotensin II level in the body, (2) the production rate of angiotensin II is proportional to the total ACE activity and (3) plasma ACE activity reflects the total ACE activity in the body. Then, the effect of captopril on the mean arterial blood pressure in each type of rat was calculated. The results indicated that the hypotensive effect of captopril in NR was reasonably described by the model. However, the hypotensive effect of captopril in both GHR and SDR could not be well described by the model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "320": "Pressor response to exogenous angiotensins was investigated in rats. Two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rats (GHR) and sodium-deficient normotensive rats (SDR), as well as normal rats, (NR) were used. Various amounts of angiotensin I (Ang I) or angiotensin (Ang II) were administered intravenously by constant infusion, with or without pretreatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and the pressor response was determined. Captopril was used as the ACE inhibitor. From the data obtained, a simple kinetic model for the renin-angiotensin system was constructed. The model was based on a linear compartment model with the following assumptions; (a) there are compartments in respect to Ang I and II in the body; (b) in the steady-state condition, Ang I is produced at a constant rate; (c) a part of Ang I is converted to Ang II by a first-order rate process; (d) Ang I and II are eliminated from the respective compartments by first-order rate processes and (e) the relationship between mean arterial blood pressure and the amount of Ang II in the body can be described by Hill's equation with a baseline effect. Then the pressor response to angiotensins in GHR, SDR or NR was fitted to the model. The result indicated that the pressor response to Ang I or Ang II can be described by the present model. The model parameters obtained were consistent with the actual physiological parameters of rats.", 
    "321": "Inhibition of rabbit lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme was studied with two inhibitors that combined tricyclic mimics of a substrate C-terminal dipeptide recognition unit with a 4-phenylbutanoic acid fragment. The overall inhibition constant for [4S-[4 alpha, 7 alpha(R*),12b beta]]-7-[S-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl) amino]-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,12b-octahydro-6-oxopyrido[2,1-a] [2] benzazepine-4-carboxylic acid (MDL 27,088) was approximately 4 pM, whereas that for [4R-[4 alpha, 7 alpha(S*), 12b beta]]-7-[S-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-3,4,6,7,8, 12b-hexahydro-6-oxo-1H-[1,4]thiazino[3,4-a] [2]benzazepine-4-carboxylic acid (MDL 27,788) was estimated to be 46 pM. The formation of an initial complex of target enzyme and MDL 27,088 and its slower isomerization to a second complex were characterized kinetically. Both compounds appear to be among the most potent inhibitors known for this enzyme.", 
    "322": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on serum lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoproteins was studied in 21 patients with mild essential hypertension. The drug was administered at a dosage of 2.5 to 10 mg daily for 12 weeks. Enalapril significantly decreased the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction at eight and 12 weeks. The apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and A-II fractions were significantly increased by 10% and 7.8%, respectively, at 12 weeks. The apo B fraction and the apo B/apo A-I ratio were significantly decreased at eight weeks (8% and 17%, respectively) and at 12 weeks (11% and 19%, respectively). Unchanged were the total cholesterol level, the lipoprotein cholesterol level, the triglyceride level, apo C-II, apo C-III, apo E, and the apo A-I/apo A-II ratio. This study confirmed that enalapril is an effective antihypertensive drug with a favorable effect on the lipid profile.", 
    "323": "The effects of single orally-administered dose of enalapril and captopril on central and district-peripheral circulations have been studied in 20 patients with essential arterial hypertension. Either drug caused a decrease in arterial pressure, telesystolic and telediastolic parietal stress, and a reduction in the peripheral vascular resistance of upper limb district. Furthermore, at the upper limb district level, increases in arterial flow and venous-system capacity have been observed. The entity of these modifications induced by enalapril and captopril appeared comparable, according to the respective peak-time and used dosages. Under this study conditions, the difference between the drugs resulted to be essentially of chronological nature.", 
    "324": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, 2 micrograms/min) was infused intravenously into rabbits four weeks after renal wrap or sham operation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) averaged 132 +/- 4 mmHg in the renal wrapped rabbits and 89 +/- 3 mmHg in the sham rabbits, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly lower in the hypertensive rabbits (6.2 +/- 1.0 ml/min) than in sham rabbits (8.9 +/- 0.7 ml/min). In sham rabbits, ANP caused a significant diuresis, natriuresis and increase in GFR. Enalapril pretreatment blunted these responses. In the hypertensive rabbits, ANP reduced mean arterial pressure but did not cause significant diuresis or natriuresis or change in GFR. Enalapril pretreatment did not significantly alter this response to ANP. In separate experiments, nitroprusside was infused to lower arterial pressure in hypertensive rabbits by a similar amount to that achieved with ANP and this reduced GFR, sodium and urine excretion rates. Thus ANP maintained GFR and sodium excretion in hypertensive rabbits compared to an equihypotensive dose of nitroprusside. In summary, ANP did not cause natriuresis or diuresis in renal wrapped kidneys at a dose which was effective in normal kidneys, but did maintain GFR, sodium and water excretion rates, compared to an equally hypotensive dose of nitroprusside.", 
    "325": "After a 2-4 week no-treatment period, 24 patients (12 young, age 29-45 yr.; 12 elderly, age 65-81 yr.; 20 black, 4 white) with an untreated sitting diastolic blood pressure between 91-120 mm Hg received the nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril for three weeks in a singleblind, parallel group comparison. Patients who did not achieve goal blood pressure with the initial low-dose (10 mg/day) were treated with a high-dose regimen (40 mg/day) for three weeks. In those who remained incompletely responsive, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day was added for four weeks in an attempt to normalize blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). Low-dose lisinopril monotherapy produced comparable reductions in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (approximately -15/-8 mm Hg in both younger and older patients). Increasing the dose produced a slightly greater fall in mean blood pressures which normalized the blood pressure in five of six elderly patients unresponsive to the lower dose; addition of hydrochlorothiazide normalized three of the five remaining subjects from both groups who were unresponsive to high dose lisinopril. Lisinopril administration resulted in a rise in plasma renin activity and a fall in plasma aldosterone concentrations which were similar in both groups and which returned over time toward the baseline. The drug was well tolerated, producing one episode of symptomatic hypotension following the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to lisinopril monotherapy. Lisinopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide produces favorable antihypertensive effects in both younger and older predominantly black, low-renin patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "326": "Seven of eight hypertensive Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with microalbuminuria completed a randomised crossover trial to compare the renal effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and calcium antagonist (nicardipine). Four-week fixed oral maintenance dosages of enalapril (10-20 mg/day) and nicardipine (60-120 mg/day) significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered the systolic and diastolic blood pressures without altering renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction. Both drugs significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) urinary albumin excretion rate and fractional clearance of albumin to similar extents. Total renal vascular resistance decreased significantly by nicardipine (p less than 0.05) and non-significantly by enalapril. Plasma osmotic pressure, plasma aldosterone concentration, total serum protein concentration, serum electrolytes and HbA1c remained unchanged by these drugs, whereas plasma renin activity was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the enalapril than in the control and nicardipine phases. These results suggest that both drugs have similar renal function preserving effects with a concomitant hypotensive action in hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, and that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may not have advantageous renal effects when compared to the calcium antagonist and vice versa. Both drugs might be useful for treatment of high blood pressure in hypertensive diabetic patients, if long-term studies of these drugs can be shown to benefit the patients over other conventional antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "327": "Vasodilator drugs reduce peripheral vascular resistance but lead to a secondary baroreflex-mediated chronotropic effect. After angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, blood pressure falls without associated tachycardia. In a previous study it was observed that enalapril increased vagal tone in essential hypertensive patients. In order to evaluate the effect of enalapril on sympathetic stimulation 10 mild to moderate hypertensive patients were studied during static (hand grip) and dynamic exercise (bicycle ergometer), after 2 weeks of placebo and after 1 month of treatment with 20-40 mg enalapril once daily. Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure and the rate-pressure product at rest and at peak dynamic exercise. There was no effect on supine and maximal heart rate. Enalapril also significantly reduced blood pressure during hand grip, but did not interfere with the rate of the increase. Thus, enalapril does not seem to interfere with sympathetic adaptation to stress.", 
    "328": "1. The population pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were investigated using data collected from two multicentre trials of lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients (n = 40) and patients with renal disease (n = 20). 2. Lisinopril was started at doses of 2.5-5 mg daily and increased at 2-4 weekly intervals as required for control of blood pressure. Steady-state concentration-time profiles were measured after at least 2 weeks at a constant dose. 3. All concentration-time data were analysed simultaneously using the program NONMEM and the influence of clinical factors on clearance/F and volume of distribution/F was tested. 4. Clearance was significantly influenced by creatinine concentration, age, weight and cardiac failure. No clinical features tested were found to influence volume of distribution. 5. The influence of renal function and cardiac failure on lisinopril clearance has been confirmed using a population pharmacokinetic analysis technique.", 
    "329": "1. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activities were obtained from nine mammalian species: rat, mouse, horse, sheep, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, dog and man. 2. Kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) using hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine as substrate and inhibitory constants (I50 and Ki) for captopril were determined for the serum ACE of each species. 3. There were important differences in the kinetic and inhibitory constants (Kms went from 6.6 mM to 1.21 mM for hamster and guinea pig; I50 ranged from 2100 nM to 3 nM for mouse and sheep) as well as differences in enzyme activity of the different species (values varied from 938 to 13 nmol hippuric acid/ml/min for guinea pig and dog serum).", 
    "330": "The safety and tolerance of single oral doses of a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril have been examined in 90 healthy male volunteers, in a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study. The subjects were divided into 10 groups, each of 9 subjects and treatments (6 subjects on trandolapril and 3 on placebo per group) were allocated by unbalanced randomisation. Ten single, increasing oral doses were tested: 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 mg. The assessment criteria were clinical (monitoring of blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, temperature and evaluation of behaviour and side effects) and routine laboratory tests. Blood pressure did not fall except for a slight drop in diastolic pressure during the first 4 h following the 32-mg dose. However, although an effect of the compound cannot be excluded, the reduction in blood pressure may have reflected intersubject variability. No orthostatic hypotension was observed. There was no change in the other vital signs, and in particular no increase in heart rate was observed. No serious adverse effect was encountered. The pharmacological activity of the compound was studied by assaying plasma ACE activity. Inhibition of ACE was linearly dose-dependant from 0 (placebo) to 2 mg, and above that dose, the inhibition was nearly total. ACE activity was markedly reduced within 30 min after administration of trandolapril, and maximal inhibition was observed from 2-4 h onwards, lasting for up to 24 h after dosing. For doses above 2 mg, inhibition was still 40% of the basal activity on Day 8 after dosing.", 
    "331": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on myocardial sympathetic tone, as represented by noradrenaline overflow, were studied in 14 men with congestive heart failure (mean ejection fraction 20%) in a double blind crossover comparison with placebo. Arterial and coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations and oxygen content, and coronary sinus blood flow, were measured at rest and during peak symptom limited upright exercise on a bicycle ergometer. There were no significant changes four hours after the first dose of enalapril, but after six weeks of treatment (10-20 mg/day) enalapril reduced myocardial overflow of noradrenaline at peak exercise. The external workload (exercise duration) increased from baseline values after both placebo and enalapril, and there was no difference between placebo and enalapril at six weeks. Heart work, however, was lower after enalapril: stroke work index was reduced at rest and the double product was lower at peak exercise. The reduction in maximal myocardial oxygen consumption after enalapril did not reach statistical significance. Coronary sinus adrenaline concentrations after enalapril and after placebo were not significantly different. The long term reduction of myocardial sympathetic activity on exercise may represent a significant benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in heart failure and may reflect a reduced cardiac workload.", 
    "332": "One-hundred patients suffering from slight-moderate hypertension (53 m, 47 f, aged between 18 and 78, average 49.08) have been studied in order to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of lisinopril (\"Zestril\", ICI-Pharma), a new ACE inhibitor in a single daily administration at doses of between 10 and 80 mg in relation to pressure values. Monotherapy with Lisinopril proved effective in 84 patients (88.4%), in 74 of whom (7.9%) pressure values were returned to normal. 11 patients (11.6%) did not respond to treatment. In most cases, the result was obtained with a dose of 20 mg in a single administration (32.6%). The incidence of side-effects was limited and in no case required the withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "333": "The short-term effect (2 weeks) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on renal hemodynamics and urinary albumin excretion was investigated in eleven normotensive patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy (IDN). Six patients had had elevated baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and each responded to enalapril with a decline in the GFR, from a mean of 160.7 to 134 ml/min/1.73 m2, (p less than 0.05). Their respective filtration fraction values also decreased from a mean of 27.8 to 23.8% (p less than 0.01). Such renal hemodynamic change was accompanied by a decrease in urinary albumin excretion (33 to 19 micrograms/min, p less than 0.05). The remaining 5 patients had displayed normal baseline GFR (mean, 109.6 ml/min/1.73 m2), responded to enalapril with minimal change in the GFR (115.2 ml/min/1.73 m2) and showed no significant improvement in their microalbuminuria. It is concluded that enalapril is effective in lowering glomerular filtration pressure and ameliorating microalbuminuria in the normotensive patient with IDN only when the baseline GFR is elevated.", 
    "334": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) to control hypertension has increased in recent years. Despite extensive reports of hematologic, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous side effects, no specific incidence of oral mucosal lichenoid reactions caused by these drugs have been reported. It is the purpose of this article to present two case reports, bringing the attention of clinicians to oral mucosal lichenoid drug reactions in which these drugs may be implicated.", 
    "335": "Three cases are presented with a rash due to captopril which, on histology, showed a lichenoid pattern of bandlike upper dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, together with hydropic degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis producing Civatte bodies and pigmentary incontinence. The rash presented either as a pityriasis rosea-like picture which appeared about three to six months after the onset of treatment in patients taking low doses, or alternatively, as lichenoid plaques which appeared three to six months after commencement of medication in patients taking high doses. Although both clinical patterns produced a \"saw tooth\" pattern of the epidermal rete ridges, hypergranulosis and acanthosis were seen only with the lichenoid plaques.", 
    "336": "Ten patients (mean age 53 years; range 37-65 years) with hypertension refractory to standard triple treatment were selected for measurement of blood pressure and echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricular dimensions before and after 3, 6 and 12 months of captopril therapy. In each patient the dose of captopril was titrated to a maximum of 150 mg t.d.s. (range 25 to 150 mg t.d.s.) with a therapeutic goal of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. Most patients had added diuretic therapy. Four patients were unable to complete the study, two because of insufficient response to captopril therapy, and two because of side-effects (skin rash and cough). A significant fall in blood pressure was seen after three months of treatment and a reduced blood pressure was still maintained after 12 months. Over the same period, the average number of drugs was reduced from 3.6 to 2.1 per patient. A gradual reduction of septal and posterior wall thickness were noted, from 12.8 and 11.5 mm to 10.0 and 8.5 mm, respectively, after 12 months. Calculated left ventricular muscle mass was insignificantly reduced from 281 to 243 g after 12 months. The present study suggests that in hypertension resistant to conventional multiple therapy, captopril can reduce the blood pressure, and, in the long run it can also induce reversal of left ventricular wall thickening without causing deterioration of left ventricular function.", 
    "337": "In an open trial, the pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite ramiprilat were studied in 25 hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency given 5 mg ramipril p.o. for 14 days. Ramipril was rapidly absorbed and reached a peak concentration after 1-2 h. Cmax was greater in patients with severe renal insufficiency, which might indicate a reduced renal elimination rate, although, the rapid decline of the concentration-time curve for ramipril was almost independent of renal function. The mean initial apparent half-lives on Days 1 and 12, respectively, were 2.8 and 3.4 h (Group I: creatinine clearance 5-15 ml/min), 1.8 and 2.3 h (Group II: creatinine clearance 15-40 ml/min), and 1.9 and 1.9 h (Group III: creatinine clearance 40-80 ml/min). No accumulation was observed after multiple dosing. In contrast, the kinetics of its active acid metabolite ramiprilat was significantly influenced by renal function. The mean times to the peak plasma concentration were 5.7 h in Group I, 4.4 h in Group II and 3.8 h in Group III. The initial decline in plasma ramiprilat was dependent upon renal function; the mean initial apparent half-lives (Days 1 and 12, respectively) were 16.0 and 14.8 h (Group I), 10.1 and 9.5 h (Group II) and 10.6 and 8.0 h (Group III). Mean trough concentrations and absolute accumulation also increased with worsening renal function, and the renal clearance of ramiprilat was significantly correlated with the creatinine clearance. The subsequent long terminal phase at low plasma ramiprilat concentrations represented slow dissociation of the ACE-inhibitor complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "338": "This study was undertaken to further clarify the role of kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems in the hypotensive mechanisms of the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor by using highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays in patients with essential hypertension. Captopril was administered for 14 days (chronic effect), and the acute effects of captopril, alacepril and ramipril were also studied in the in-patients with essential hypertension. All of these converting enzyme inhibitors rapidly decreased the blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II levels, and increased plasma and urinary kinin and plasma renin activity in the acute effect. Following the administration of captopril for 14 days, these decreases and increases were maintained. The change of blood pressure was significantly correlated negatively with that of plasma kinin levels and positively with that of plasma angiotensin II levels in both the acute and chronic effect of converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine volume and urinary sodium excretion were markedly augmented, while both the change of urine volume and that of urinary sodium excretion were negatively correlated with the change of blood pressure in the chronic effect. These findings suggest that the hypotensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitors might be caused by an increase of plasma kinin and a decrease of plasma angiotensin II, and in part by an augmentation of urine volume and urinary sodium excretion. In this drug treatment, the renal kallikrein-kinin system may also play some role in the increase of urine volume and urinary sodium excretion through the increased kinin in the kidney.", 
    "339": "The effect of captopril on skin response to intradermal injection of bradykinin was investigated by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and weal and flare measurements in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over balanced study. Intradermal injections of 1 and 2.5 micrograms of bradykinin and normal saline were made into the forearm skin of six healthy volunteers between 1 and 2 h (t1) and between 3 and 4 h (t2) after either 25 mg captopril or placebo. Skin blood flow outside the induced weal was monitored continuously by LDF for 15 min and the mean LDF values over the last 15 s were used for analysis. Weal and flare sizes were measured at 15 min. On the placebo days, the mean LDF output, weal volume and flare area increased with incremental bradykinin dose. Pre-treatment with captopril significantly increased LDF output following intradermal bradykinin at t1 but not at t2. At both t1 and t2, captopril significantly increased weal volume. There was no significant difference between treatments in flare areas. Skin response following intradermal normal saline, measured by the above parameters, was not affected by captopril. This study showed that captopril potentiated the effects of intradermal bradykinin both with respect to blood flow changes and weal formation. The non-invasive technique of LDF can be used to detect the skin blood flow changes induced by intradermal bradykinin and the potentiation of this effect by captopril. It appears to be a useful and more objective method of quantifying local cutaneous blood flow changes than measurement of flare area.", 
    "340": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, the effects of ramipril, a long-acting non-sulphydryl angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, on phenprocoumon steady-state pharmacodynamics were investigated in 8 healthy male volunteers taking individually fixed doses of phenprocoumon. The results showed that 5 mg ramipril or placebo once daily for 7 days did not alter the anticoagulant response (Quick values) to phenprocoumon after a stabilization phase of 2 weeks. Mean Quick values during the steady-state phase with ramipril and placebo were 67.5% and 69.3%, respectively. The clotting factors II, VII, IX and X as well as protein C decreased in the run-in phase and remained stable both during ramipril and placebo treatment. There were no differences between ramipril or placebo treatments. As the phenprocoumon dosage was kept unchanged during the double-blind phase, the results indicate that ramipril does not interfere with the vitamin K-dependent cascade.", 
    "341": "Antihypertensive agents have been shown to differ markedly in their effects on the development and regression of cardiac hypertrophy. In view of possible trophic properties of angiotensin II (ANG II), we compared the effects of equipotent antihypertensive doses of the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor ramipril (1 mg/kg), the calcium antagonist nifedipine (30 mg/kg), and the arterial vasodilator dihydralazine (30 mg/kg) on cardiac mass in rats subjected to banding of the abdominal aorta. Treatment was started either immediately after banding (\"prevention experiments\") or after hypertension and hypertrophy had already developed (\"regression experiments\"). Groups of untreated animals with aortic constriction and sham-operated animals served as controls. In the prevention experiments heart weight, myocardial protein content and ANG II plasma levels were significantly increased in untreated animals and in those receiving nifedipine and dihydralazine. In contrast, values obtained in animals treated with ramipril were not different from those seen in normotensive, sham operated controls with the exception of plasma ANG II levels which were lower. Similar results were observed in the second series of studies which examined the effect of antihypertensive agents on the \"regression\" of cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment was started 6 weeks after aortic banding and continued for another 6 weeks. While all three drugs lowered blood pressure equally well, only ramipril induced a significant and complete regression of cardiac hypertrophy to values not different from sham-operated controls. In addition we studied a group of animals treated with a nonantihypertensive low dose of ramipril (10 micrograms/kg). Remarkably, these animals showed the same complete regression of cardiac hypertrophy as seen in the group receiving the antihypertensive dose of CE inhibitor. Our study indicates a selective advantage of CE inhibitors over other antihypertensive drugs in the prevention and regression of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, the dissociation between effects on blood pressure and cardiac mass demonstrated in the experiments with a low dose of ramipril stresses the role of factors other than blood pressure and afterload on the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. One such peptide, thus, may be ANG with its known potential as a growth factor.", 
    "342": "1. Possible interactions between cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide with respect to pharmacokinetics and renal effects were investigated in healthy subjects (single dose) and in hypertensive patients (multiple dosing). 2. No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was found between cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide. 3. Cilazapril showed weak saluretic properties as compared with hydrochlorothiazide, but increased the saluretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Cilazapril attenuated the hypokalaemia observed with hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients. 5. The effect on blood pressure reduction obtained from the combination of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide lasted longer than that of cilazapril alone.", 
    "343": "1. Six healthy subjects received cilazapril (2.5 mg once daily), propranolol (120 mg once daily), the combination of both and placebo for a period of 1 week each (wash-out phase 1 week). 2. Propranolol and cilazapril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) by 7 mm Hg at peak when compared with placebo. However after the combination, this reduction was more than doubled (18 mm Hg) and lasted longer. 3. There was a trend to lower and later peak concentrations for both drugs after administration of the combination. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between cilazapril and propranolol were found. 4. The effects on blood pressure were confirmed in hypertensive patients (BP diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg). Thirteen patients were randomly allocated cilazapril (2.5 mg day-1) or propranolol (120 mg day-1] as part of a cross-over design. This was then followed by the combination. All treatment periods were of 3 weeks duration and all measurements were done 2 h after drug administration. 5. Cilazapril lowered the median sitting diastolic BP by 8 mm Hg, and propranolol by 9 mm Hg, whereas the combination reduced the diastolic BP by 19 mm Hg. 6. The results of these studies, attempting to elucidate drug-drug interactions, showed that combined use of propranolol and cilazapril resulted in a more pronounced and longer lasting blood pressure reduction, in healthy subjects and in patients with hypertension.", 
    "344": "1. The purpose of the present studies was to compare the pharmacodynamic profile of the new ACE inhibitor cilazapril with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol in healthy subjects and in hypertensive patients. 2. Hormonal and haemodynamic responses at rest and after pharmacological interventions with angiotensin I and isoprenaline were investigated in six healthy volunteers following a 1 week treatment with placebo, propranolol (120 mg day-1) and cilazapril (2.5 mg day-1) in a double-blind cross over design with a wash-out period of 1 week between the different treatments. 3. Cilazapril induced a pronounced increase of plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentrations, whereas after propranolol both parameters decreased. After both compounds slight decreases in angiotensin II concentrations were found. After the pharmacological challenges with angiotensin I and isoprenaline specific effects of the ACE inhibitor and beta-adrenoceptor blocker were found respectively. 4. Seventeen hypertensive patients received after a 2 week placebo period in random order cilazapril (2.5 mg day-1) or propranolol (120 mg day-1) for 3 weeks. A cross over design switched the patients to the other treatment. On the last day of each treatment period blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were determined at rest and during handgrip test. In addition, bicycle exercise test was done and blood lactate concentrations were determined. 5. At rest blood pressure was lowered by both drugs, but total peripheral resistance increased after propranolol and decreased after cilazapril. After hand grip test, blood pressure was lowered after both drugs, but peripheral resistance decreased only after cilazapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "345": "1. In two single dose studies, acute blood pressure reduction with cilazapril was not associated with any significant change in supine or erect heart rate in either normotensives or hypertensives. 2. To investigate the lack of reflex cardioacceleration, a series of autonomic function tests was undertaken when there was maximum ACE inhibition, maximum evidence of angiotensin II withdrawal and the lowest blood pressure. 3. There was no evidence that cilazapril had any significant impact on indices of sympathetic nervous activity or the integrity of baroreflex mechanisms. 4. The results for the bradycardic response to apnoeic facial immersion, suggested enhanced parasympathetic activity, consistent with the withdrawal of the vagolytic actions of angiotensin II. 5. These results suggest that the absence of a heart rate response to ACE inhibition is not related to a profound sympatho-inhibitory effect or an impairment of baroreflex function. While there is some evidence of enhanced cardiac parasympathetic tone it seems unlikely that this is the sole explanation for the lack of cardioacceleration.",

In a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study lasting 6 weeks, twenty patients with essential hypertension were treated with placebo for 2 weeks followed by oral cilazapril 2.5 mg once a day or oral indomethacin 50 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Afterwards they received the combination of both drugs for a further 2 weeks. 2. Cilazapril significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure for a period of 24 h post administration. 3. Indomethacin significantly attenuated the antihypertensive activity of cilazapril. This was more pronounced in those patients who were treated for the initial 2 weeks with indomethacin plus placebo (and subsequently with cilazapril in addition) than in the subjects who first received cilazapril plus placebo and then the combination. 4. Correspondingly the decrease of plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary prostaglandin excretion (PGE2) was more pronounced in those patients treated initially with indomethacin. 5. The effect of indomethacin on the antihypertensive effect of cilazapril appears to depend upon the sequence of drug administration.", 
    "347": "1. It has been reported that calcium antagonists lower blood pressure more effectively in salt replete hypertensive patients with a low plasma renin activity (PRA), whereas angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in salt depleted patients with a high level of PRA. An inverse relationship between the antihypertensive effects of these two groups of drugs might therefore be expected. 2. Since salt retention and inappropriately high levels of PRA are said to contribute to hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), an additive antihypertensive effect with both drugs might also be expected in such patients. 3. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine and the new ACE inhibitor cilazapril, given alone, and in combination, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study of 11 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure who had a mean pretreatment blood pressure of 149 +/- 3/96 +/- 2 mm Hg. Patients received nitrendipine 10 mg, cilazapril 1.25 or 2.5 mg depending on creatinine clearance, or placebo once daily orally. Nitrendipine and cilazapril were also combined at the same doses. 4. Nitrendipine and cilazapril were equally effective, with a maximal acute reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 5.3 +/- 1.8% and 8.0 +/- 1.9%, and after 1 week of treatment 5.0 +/- 2.4% and 8.1 +/- 1.8%, respectively.

A 1.25 mg dose of cilazapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was administered orally to two groups of hypertensive patients, five with normal renal function (NRF) and seven with impaired renal function (IRF), once daily for 5 or 8 consecutive days. Blood pressure, heart rate and serum ACE activity were measured up to 24 h following the initial and the last dose. Plasma level profiles of cilazapril and its active diacid were also evaluated on the first and the last day of treatment. 2. Cilazapril induced significant falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures without increasing heart rate. The antihypertensive effect was evident within 1 h after drug administration and was sustained for up to 24 h, particularly after consecutive dosing. 3. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed over 24 h. The recovery of ACE activity was delayed in the IRF group when compared with the NRF group. 4. Plasma concentrations of the active diacid in the IRF group were higher than in the NRF group with significant differences in the peak concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The plasma concentration profile for the parent drug was similar for both the NRF and IRF groups. 5. A significant inverse correlation was found between the creatinine clearance and the AUC for the diacid. 6. Cilazapril is a potent ACE inhibitor with a prolonged duration of antihypertensive effect and is a useful agent for controlling blood pressure in hypertensives either with NRF or IRF. In patients with severe renal impairment the dose of cilazapril should be reduced.",

The pharmacokinetics of a single 1 mg dose of cilazapril were determined in six subjects with normal renal function and in 19 uraemic patients with various degrees of renal impairment. 2. Significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were noted in all groups of subjects between 2 and 8 h after administration of 1 mg cilazapril. 3. There was a significant correlation between ACE inhibition at 24 h and creatinine clearance (CrCL). 4. For cilazapril, Cmax and tmax were independent of creatinine clearance. AUC(24) was inversely related to CrCL and apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was directly related to CrCL. 5. For cilazaprilat, Cmax and tmax were related to creatinine clearance. AUC(24) was inversely related to CrCl and apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was directly related to CrCL. 6. Dialysis clearance was approximately 2 l h-1 for cilazapril and for cilazaprilat. 7. The effects of renal impairment on cilazapril and cilazaprilat kinetics were similar to those observed for other inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme such as captopril, enalapril and lisinopril. 8. It may be necessary to modify doses of cilazapril for the treatment of essential hypertension in uraemic patients. When creatinine clearance was below 15 ml min-1 cilazaprilat concentrations were increased, half-lives were prolonged and ACE inhibition remained above 90% for at least 24 h. A reduced dosage is indicated for these patients. 9. In patients requiring haemodialysis, maintenance doses of 0.5 mg given after each haemodialysis session are sufficient.",

In a controlled, randomized, double-blind study the influence of cilazapril and metoprolol on learning and memory functions and on sleep behaviour was investigated in healthy young volunteers under steady-state conditions. Twenty-three subjects were given either 2.5 mg cilazapril, 200 mg metoprolol, or placebo for 14 days in a latin square design separated by washout periods of 7 days. 2. To test memory functions different modalities--verbal, visual, numerical associative and two dimensional spatial memory were tested for recent anterograde recall, both short-term (less than 10 s) and middle-term (up to 15 min) were selected. The test had a content similar to that used in daily life situations. The sleep behaviour was tested both by objective (all night sleep EEG) and subjective measures. 3. Neither antihypertensive drug had an observable influence on memory performance at the dosages used under steady-state conditions. However, sleep was disturbed during metoprolol, while cilazapril could not be differentiated from placebo. The effects of metoprolol on sleep behaviour were observed in the objective and subjective measures. There was more frequent awakening during the night with the subjective complaint of difficulties in sleeping through. 4. From this study it is concluded that cilazapril has no major effect on memory functions and sleep behaviour. This is only true for the dosages given and under steady-state conditions.",

Heart failure increased markedly the responsiveness of the renal and mesenteric vascular beds to ACE inhibition which produced a vasodilation in these two vascular beds. 4.

The effects of acute and chronic treatment with cilazapril, a new ACE inhibitor, on peripheral vasculature and renal excretory function were assessed in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Acute treatment (3 mg kg-1 intravenously) reduced mean arterial blood pressure from 171 +/- 7 to 140 241 +/- 7 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), chronic treatment (1 x 10 mg kg-1 day-1 orally for 9 weeks) from 191 +/- 5 to 122 +/- 3 mm Hg P less than 0.001). With both kinds of treatments cardiac output was unchanged. Heart rate was slightly decreased (-9%, P less than 0.05) with chronic treatment. Acutely, the main effect of cilazapril was a decrease of the renal vascular resistance (-41%, P less than 0.001) associated with an increase of the fraction of the cardiac output distributed to the kidney (+46%, P less than 0.001). Chronically, cilazapril decreased regional vascular resistance in most of the peripheral vascular beds except the heart. 3.

However, with a low dose (1 mg kg-1 orally) the kidneys responded only to chronic treatment. 4.

Cilazaprilat has an IC50 of 1.9 nM as an inhibitor of rabbit lung ACE in vitro making it one of the most potent ACE inhibitors currently available. Studies on a wide range of other enzymes show that the inhibition is highly specific. 2. An oral dose of 0.1 mg kg-1 cilazapril evoked the same maximum degree of plasma ACE inhibition (approximately 76%) in the rat as 0.25 mg kg-1 enalapril. Cilazapril (0.25 mg kg-1 p.o.) inhibited plasma ACE by greater than 95%. The rate of recovery of ACE activity was slower with cilazapril (5-6% h-1) than with enalapril (10% h-1). 3. In anaesthetised rats cilazaprilat was equipotent with ramiprilat and slightly more potent (1.5x) than enalaprilat as an inhibitor of the angiotensin I pressor response. 4. Following oral administration to conscious rats and intravenous administration to anaesthetised dogs, cilazapril was 2-4.5x more potent than enalapril as an ACE inhibitor. 5. In cats cilazapril (0.1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 p.o.) dose dependently decreased plasma ACE activity and the angiotensin pressor response. Peak effects occurred at 2 h after dosing and plasma ACE inhibition was maintained at greater than or equal to 50% for up to 18 h. Mean arterial pressure was also decreased dose dependently with a peak effect at 3-4 h. 6. Daily oral dosing of cilazapril (30 mg kg-1 p.o.) to spontaneously hypertensive rats evoked a progressive and prolonged (24 h) antihypertensive response with a maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg. 7. Cilazapril (10 mg kg-1 p.o. twice daily for 3.5 days) progressively decreased blood pressure in volume depleted renal hypertensive dogs. The maximum fall in systolic pressure was 39 +/- 6 mm Hg. 8. Haemodynamic studies in open chest anaesthetised dogs showed that the hypotensive response to intravenous cilazapril was accompanied by a reduction in total peripheral resistance. Small decreases in cardiac output and myocardial contractile force were seen at high doses. 9. Cilazapril had no adverse effect on cardiovascular reflexes. There was no impairment of the baroreflex in rats. Exercise-induced tachycardia and pressor responses in conscious cats were unchanged. 10.

An acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated on renal biopsy, and improvement was temporally related to initiation of therapy with prednisone. A review of the literature revealed 5 similar cases in whom acute deterioration of renal function occurred following initiation of captopril and in whom there were features of a hypersensitivity reaction, including skin rash, fever, eosinophilia, azotemia, eosinophiluria, and a Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. Renal biopsy, where available, revealed an acute interstitial nephritis. Observations from these cases suggest that, of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, this syndrome appears to be specific for captopril, begins within the 1st month of therapy, is not dose-dependent, and generally resolves on cessation of therapy.

    "363": "The enlarged heart has long been recognized as an important sign of systolic dysfunction of many different etiologies. Regardless of etiology, cardiac enlargement is associated with decreased survival. Cardiac enlargement after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be a progressive process. Early after AMI, the process of infarct expansion, or thinning and stretching of the infarct region leads to early volume enlargement detectable within 3 days of the infarct. During the next 2 weeks, volume enlargement takes place which includes lengthening of both the infarcted and the non-infarcted regions. Finally, additional left ventricular enlargement occurs during the next year after the infarction. Both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that such progressive LV enlargement may be halted by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril. A large scale randomized trial is currently under way to determine whether captopril improves survival after infarction (Survival and Ventricular Enlargement, SAVE).",

Measurements were made basally, before Ramipril administration and on days 1 and 7 during the treatment. Ramipril given alone induced a decrease in urinary PGE2 (NS) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (p less than 0.05) on day 1, together with an increase in urinary kinins on day 7 (p less than 0.01) and in urine volume on days 1 and 7 (p less than 0.05). Increased urinary PGE2 (NS) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (p less than 0.05) were observed in indomethacin pretreated rats after ramipril administration. No modifications in BP levels were observed either with indomethacin or with ramipril given alone or with ramipril plus indomethacin. Ramipril increased plasma renin activity levels both in indomethacin treated and untreated rats on days 1 (p less than 0.01) and 7 (p less than 0.05). The diuretic effect of ramipril and the stimulation of kinins were blunted when concomitant indomethacin was administered. Although a stimulatory effect of ramipril on urinary PGS was only observed during indomethacin administration, the present results would suggest that a non-inhibited PGS synthesis would be required for the renal actions of Ramipril.",

A baboon model (n = 6) was used, and the parameters evaluated were obtained by the \"integral spleen\" method of radiorenogram analysis. Although the images and parameters pointed to 123I-Hippuran and commercial MAG3 as the ideal renal scanning agents and to DTPA as the least so, with the local product an acceptable alternative, the differences were not significant enough to warrant either the purchase of the commercial product or the extensive development of the local product.

    "367": "Serum copper (Cu) concentration was evaluated as an index of lung injury in two rat models of pneumotoxicity: hemithoracic irradiation and monocrotaline ingestion. In both models there was a dose- and time-dependent increase in serum Cu concentration. This hypercupremia paralleled the development of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction (decreased lung plasminogen activator activity and increased prostacyclin production) and pulmonary fibrosis (hydroxyproline accumulation). In the radiation model, lung injury and hypercupremia persisted for at least 6 months, and were spared similarly when the total dose was delivered in multiple daily fractions as compared to single doses. In irradiated rats, the elevated serum Cu concentration was accompanied by increases in plasma ceruloplasmin, lung Cu concentration, and lung Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In monocrotaline-treated rats, lung damage and hypercupremia also were accompanied by a reduction in liver Cu concentration, and by a direct correlation between the concentrations of Cu and SGOT in the serum. In both models, some but not all modifiers of lung damage (penicillamine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, pentoxifylline) also partially prevented the insult-induced hypercupremia. In contrast, serum iron concentration was largely independent of treatment in all experiments. These data suggest that elevated serum copper concentration is an accurate and minimally invasive index of lung injury in irradiated and monocrotaline-treated rats.",

Renin concentration increased with captopril (P less than 0.02) and urine protein excretion decreased (P less than 0.05). Blood pressure did not change in any individual. There was no alteration in baseline GFR, effective renal plasma flow, or creatinine clearance, with or without captopril. Following a high-protein meal there was no increase in any of the measured renal haemodynamic parameters before, during, or after taking the drug. There was a significant increase in plasma creatinine while taking captopril (P less than 0.02) which reversed on cessation of the drug.

Although this has been ascribed in some cases to nephrotoxicity, hypotension, a hypersensitivity reaction, and interstitial nephritis, most cases have been associated with stenosis of the renal arteries or arterioles occurring in either native or transplanted kidneys. We describe a case of reversible acute renal failure due to the use of captopril in a renal allograft recipient who had no evidence of any of these conditions, but who was also receiving cyclosporin therapy.", 
    "370": "Using a recently described new technique, individual kidney filtration fraction was measured from the first 3 min of the Tc-99m DTPA renogram in a series of 11 subjects without evidence of renal disease and in 23 patients with hypertension. Fourteen of these hypertensives had angiographic evidence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) but only 2 had proven renovascular hypertension (RVH). In addition, renal blood flow (RBF), expressed as a fraction of cardiac output, was measured from the first pass time activity curves following bolus injection of Tc-99m DTPA, and individual kidney glomerular filtration rate (IKGFR) was measured from the subsequent plasma Tc-99m DTPA clearance and renographic divided function. An estimation of filtration fraction based on these measurements of RBF and IKGFR correlated rather poorly with that directly based on the renogram, although both showed directionally similar changes in the hypertensive patients following inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with captopril. Filtration fraction by both estimates fell significantly after ACE inhibition in patients with RAS and essential hypertension, while RBF increased. IKGFR showed no change in essential hypertension or in hypertensive patients with RAS but fell sharply in 3 renal units in 2 patients with RVH. This renographic method for measuring filtration fraction is worthy of further elaboration and might be a simple and useful discriminator of RVH in a hypertensive population.", 
    "371": "Deterioration of renal function is a major concern during treatment by converting enzyme inhibitors of hypertensive kidney recipients with transplant renal artery stenosis. However, there has been no assessment of the frequency of this complication and its specificity for converting enzyme inhibitors as compared to other antihypertensive drugs. The effect of acute administration of captopril on mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance) and effective renal plasma flow (clearance of 131I-hippuran) was assessed in eight hypertensive patients with transplant renal artery stenosis. Captopril induced a decrease in mean arterial pressure (128 +/- 6-121 +/- 7 mmHg) and a reduction in GFR (59 +/- 8-44 +/- 8 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P less than 0.05). The decrease in GFR was observed in seven out of eight patients and varied between 0% and 100% of the pre-captopril value. Effective renal plasma flow was maintained (157 +/- 47-141 +/- 24 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and filtration fraction decreased by 15 +/- 7%. The effect of captopril was compared to that of nifedipine (N = 20 mg) in four patients. Despite a larger decrease in mean arterial pressure (130 +/- 7-109 +/- 10 mmHg), no reduction in GFR was observed (68 +/- 13-71.4 +/- 8). Effective renal plasma flow was unchanged and filtration function slightly increased. Surgical or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in five patients suppressed the captopril-induced decrease in GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "372": "The effect of prolonged treatment with captopril on some parameters of pulmonary circulation was studied in a group of 17 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis. Each patient received 25 mg of captopril four times daily for mean time of means = 12.5 +/- 2.1 days. A drop in pulmonary artery mean pressure of at least 20% was observed in 5 patients (29.4%). In 4 patients (23.5%) captopril had adverse effect on the hemodynamics of the pulmonary circulation, and in 8 patients no effect of captopril on the pulmonary hypertension was noticed. Our model of the experiment did not allow us to select before the treatment the group of patients in whom positive effects of captopril could be expected.",

The former were expected to have inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme. All of the compounds mentioned above were unreported in the literature. In preliminary test in rats, compounds VII7 and VII9 showed marked hypotensive activity.", 
    "374": "The treatment of hypertension in patients with airway dysfunction is a delicate problem. This article focuses on the airway effects of some antihypertensive drugs. Early on, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were shown to be hazardous in patients with asthma. Nonselective beta-blockers could induce severe asthma attacks and the bronchodilating effect of beta-agonists was totally blocked. Also, the beta-blockers with partial agonist activity totally blocked the effect of bronchodilating beta-agonists. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists were shown to have less pronounced effects on the airways, and it was possible to overcome the beta-blockade in the airways with high doses of beta-agonists. beta-Blockers are contraindicated in asthma patients, even if it is possible to give selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists in some patients together with high doses of beta 2-agonists. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors were recently shown to induce cough and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some patients. This is probably due to an increased inflammation in the bronchial mucosa as substances (e.g., bradykinin) are not metabolized. Therefore, ACE inhibitors could be hazardous in asthmatic patients, as they can increase the underlying bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Calcium channel blockers were earlier considered to be beneficial in asthma, as it was shown that they had a small relaxant effect on bronchial tone, and could amplify the effect of bronchodilators. In studies of provoked bronchoconstriction, calcium channel blockers were shown to have some protective effect against allergens, histamine, methacholine, or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Calcium channel blockers do not have a major place in asthma treatment, but as they have no severe side effects on the airways, they could preferably be given to hypertensive patients with airways disease instead of other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "375": "With chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, blood pressure remains controlled throughout the day despite intermittent recovery of normal function of the renin-angiotensin system. This has been taken as evidence to suggest that the disappearance of angiotensin II (Ang II) from the circulation is not the main mechanism involved in the blood pressure-lowering action of ACE inhibitors. However, the degree of ACE inhibition is often not reliably estimated by the commonly used measurements of plasma ACE activity in vitro or plasma immunoreactive Ang II levels. The most appropriate method to assess ACE activity seems to be the measurement of the ratio between circulating angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide and angiotensin I (Ang I) concentrations. The octapeptide and angiotensin I (Ang I) concentrations. The octapeptide Ang II can be measured precisely using high pressure liquid chromatography followed by a radioimmunoassay. Even using such improved methods, with long-term ACE inhibition, there exists a clear dissociation between the time course of ACE inhibition and that of the antihypertensive effect. Although it is attractive to speculate on this basis that other pathways such as blockade of tissue renin or enhanced vasodilator activity are responsible for the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, it is important to remember that the dissociation between the pharmacokinetic profile and the time course of the antihypertensive effect is not specific for ACE inhibitors and is well known with other agents. Since intermittent reduction of circulating Ang II is still an omnipresent feature of ACE inhibition, it seems at present that ACE inhibitors reduce blood pressure predominantly by this mechanism.", 
    "376": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have offered new perspectives in the treatment of hypertension. The development of new ACE inhibitors such as ramipril provides an opportunity to improve the knowledge on this class of drug, and to optimize the benefit/risk ratio for the patient. Ramipril was selected among several analogs because of its unique physicochemical properties. It is a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, and after oral absorption it is transformed in the liver into its active metabolite ramiprilat, which is at least 23 times more lipophilic than enalaprilat. Furthermore, the in vitro affinity of ramiprilat for the enzyme is 7 times higher than for enalaprilat and 47 times higher than for captopril. The ramiprilat-ACE complex is therefore very stable and dissociates 6 times more slowly than the enalaprilat-ACE complex and 22 times more slowly than the captopril-ACE complex. Ramipril possesses a favorable pharmacokinetic profile as a consequence of its physicochemical properties: its high potency allows the use of very low doses, and the slow dissociation of the ramipril-ACE complex explains the long duration of its action, permitting a once-daily treatment. Dose-finding studies have confirmed that very low doses of ramipril--2.5 mg once a day--can be used as a first-step treatment of hypertension. This dose can be increased up to 5 mg, and if necessary a low dose of a diuretic can be added. Using this therapeutic scheme, ramipril normalized blood pressure, insuring that each patient receives the smallest effective dose. Inhibition of the tissue renin-angiotensin system by ramipril has been described in recent studies on animal models.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "377": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were evaluated from their effects on human arterial smooth muscle cells in culture. [3H]ramipril binding has been determined in two different cell lines exhibiting ACE(+) and ACE(-) phenotypes. Specific binding occurred only in ACE(+) cells, was saturable, and displayed a Kd of 1 nM with a beta max value of 3.5 fmol/10(6) cells. Ramipril specific binding did not significantly modulate PGI2 synthesis in ACE(+) cells. By contrast, ramipril and, to a lesser extent, captopril appeared as weak inhibitors of PGI2 synthesis in ACE(-) cells. These data indicate that human arterial SMCs may express several phenotypes of the renin-angiotensin system under culture conditions and that ACE inhibitors may exert a non-renin-angiotensin-mediated pharmacological effect on eicosanoid synthesis.", 
    "378": "Ramiprilat is an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor whose particular lipophilicity may modify its inhibitory activity on the cellular form of this enzyme in comparison to ACE inhibitors that are more hydrophilic. The inhibitory activity of ramiprilat on cellular ACE and its binding to plasma membrane ACE have been studied in cultures of pig vascular endothelial cells. ACE activity in pig pulmonary artery endothelial cells is completely inhibited by 100 nM ramiprilat; the IC50 is 2 nM, whatever the form of ACE: soluble ACE released into the culture medium, cellular ACE studied in a cell monolayer homogenate, or tissue ACE purified from pig lung tissue. When added directly to whole living cells in their culture medium, 100 nM ramiprilat inhibits less than 80% of ACE activity in the supernatant while this dose inhibits the cellular form of the enzyme completely, suggesting that ramiprilat reaches and more specifically inhibits membrane-bound ACE rather than ACE secreted by the monolayer of endothelial cells. [3H]ramiprilat binds specifically to the membrane of cultured endothelial cells, in a time and dose-dependent manner (Kd = 6 nM; Bmax = 1,600 fmol/mg of protein); specificity is confirmed by the fact that an anti-ACE antibody prevents binding of [3H]ramiprilat and that both cold ramiprilat as well as other synthetic inhibitor compounds (captopril and enalaprilat) displace [3H]ramiprilat in a dose-dependent manner. Angiotensin I and bradykinin, natural substrates of ACE, do not induce displacement of [3H]ramiprilat bound to the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "379": "A direct central nervous system (CNS)-related component of the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors will be governed by the ability of these drugs to gain access to the brain. We investigated the inhibitory effect of the two CE inhibitors ramipril and Hoe 288 on CE activity in different brain regions and in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats. One-week oral gavage treatment with ramipril (10 mg/kg/day) and Hoe 288 (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in a marked inhibition of CE activity in the brain cortex (90 and 91%, respectively), the hypothalamus (78 and 82%, respectively), and in the brainstem (67 and 66%, respectively). The complete blockade of plasma CE activity was paralleled by a 84% inhibition of CE activity in cerebrospinal fluid. Both CE inhibitors failed significantly to inhibit CE activity in the striatum. Our results demonstrate that the CE inhibitors Hoe 288 and ramipril were able to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to inhibit central CE activity. The penetration of CE inhibitors into the CNS appears to depend on the lipophilicity of the drugs and on the mode of drug application. The possibility that an inhibition of CE activity in circumventricular organs outside the BBB such as the subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis may be sufficient to explain the central effects of orally applied CE inhibitors is discussed.", 
    "380": "The distinction between a circulating renin-angiotensin system and a tissue renin-angiotensin system led us to determine tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. This study establishes the experimental conditions for a good reproducibility of the fluorimetric assay of ACE and describes the use of [3H]ramiprilat to characterize ACE. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was determined in rat lung, heart, aorta, and kidney (cortex and medulla) and in rabbit kidney (cortex, medulla, tubules, and glomeruli). ACE activity and [3H]ramiprilat binding does not increase in a linear fashion with the protein content of tissue extracts. Linearity limits varied from 1.0 to 2.0 mg of protein/ml (fluorimetry) and from 0.4 to 1.0 mg of protein/ml [( 3H]ramiprilat binding). Comparing ACE activity, measured by fluorimetry, with the amount of [3H]ramiprilat bound shows that the two techniques yield similar results.", 
    "381": "Biochemical, pharmacological, and molecular biological data provide evidence for the presence of a cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Tissue angiotensins were demonstrated in all regions of the mammalian heart. Reduction of cardiac angiotensin II formation after oral administration of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors in nephrectomized animals points to local generation of these peptides. Functional studies in isolated working rat hearts subjected to transient regional ischemia and reperfusion showed that there is aggravation of arrhythmias as well as exhaustion of energy status by angiotensins. This was prevented by CE inhibition and/or perfusion with bradykinin (BK), which in turn could be competitively antagonized with a BK antagonist. Intracoronary infusion of low-dose bradykinin attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injuries and reduced enzyme and lactate release in anesthetized dogs. Oral pretreatment with the CE inhibitor ramipril in rats, in doses that did not affect the elevation of blood pressure caused by aortic constriction, could prevent induction of as well as cause regression of established cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, pure vasodilation was without effect on cardiac enlargement despite lowering blood pressure, pointing to a possible trophic influence of angiotensin II. Thus, apart from afterload reduction and euvolumia produced by CE inhibition, the outstanding efficacy of this therapeutic approach in congestive heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy and its potential usefulness in myocardial ischemia may also be explained by intracardiac suppression of angiotensin II generation and bradykinin degradation.", 
    "382": "Cardiovascular function is regulated by short-term and long-term neurohormonal and autocrine-paracrine mechanisms that act synergistically or sequentially. Structural adaptive changes that occur progressively over time also contribute to the long-term outcome. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can operate as both an endocrine and an autocrine-paracrine (tissue) system. The endocrine component is involved with acute circulatory homeostasis, whereas the tissue RAS, we believe, participates in the tonic regulation of cardiovascular function and structure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert both acute and long-term effects on blood pressure. The acute response is influenced by the activity of the endocrine RAS. On the other hand, the chronic response to ACE inhibition is determined by both serum and tissue effects. The reversal of hypertensive cardiovascular structural changes as well as the enhancement of renal sodium excretion by ACE inhibitors are important mechanisms of their long-term antihypertensive action.", 
    "383": "Many studies in recent years have dealt with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. The renin-angiotensin system is widely distributed in plasma and peripheral tissues and is activated following certain conditions including myocardial ischemia. The effects of ACE inhibitors on the ischemic heart are apparently many and achieved through a blockade of plasma and tissue ACE as well as through their property of scavenging free radicals. Captopril seem to exert a beneficial effect in preventing heart failure after myocardial infarction probably by restoring the contractile function of infarcted myocardium. An antianginal effect of ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease along with a potentiation of isosorbide dinitrate coronary vasodilator capacity. The antiarrhythmic efficacy, clearly evident in animal models, deserves further investigations in humans. The above listed effects of ACE inhibitors and the suppressive action demonstrated for captopril on platelet aggregation could represent a very useful tool for the future treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "384": "Fifty years ago it was observed that a sudden restoration of antegrade flow in the ischemic myocardium can lead to a paradoxical deterioration of cardiac function. The implications of this observation were only fully understood during the last decade when, thanks to the improvement of angiographic methods and the development of thrombolytic agents, reperfusion could be demonstrated in humans. At present, it is generally accepted that reperfusion phenomena play an important role in ischemic heart disease and probably the reperfusion damage, which may occur as a consequence of thrombolytic therapy, reduces the finally observed effect of these agents. During the last few years, many agents have been studied for their potential to reduce reperfusion damage. Several groups of these agents and their mechanism of action are discussed in this report. Special attention is paid to the possible effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in this situation, as this group of agents combine several interesting characteristics of other groups, among which are their effects on norepinephrine levels, prostaglandin synthesis, and free radicals.", 
    "385": "The current revolution in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by means of thrombolytic therapy has as its underlying strategy three aims: early restoration of the blood flow in order to salvage jeopardized but still viable tissues; limitation of acute consequences of ischemic heart disease, such as infarct size, ventricular fibrillation, and pericardial effusion; and preservation, as far as possible, of ventricular function. It is also hoped that these three achievements will result in reduced short- as well as long-term mortality rates. The techniques employed in this overall strategy are still under investigation, and several leading pharmacological compounds vie for supremacy: streptokinase (SK) and its anisoylated form (APSAC), recombinant technique tissue type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and urokinase (UK) with or without prourokinase (PUK). Other pharmacological agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, Ca2+ antagonists, and O2 radical scavengers, might find here their \"finest hour\" yet. In addition, the underlying anatomy may require early or, where needed, delayed PTCA, backed up by coronary artery bypass grafting. Thus, the tactics of the intervention may vary from case to case and indeed from center to center depending on experience and facilities, but the strategic conclusion is clearly the same: early reperfusion is a must if one wishes to save ischemic but still viable tissue.", 
    "386": "The acute and long-term hemodynamic efficacy of the positive inotropic and vasodilatory drug pimobendan (5 mg b.i.d.) was compared with that of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (25 mg t.i.d.) in a double-blind, randomized study in 20 patients suffering from chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA functional classes II-III). The hemodynamics at rest and under comparable exercise conditions were always obtained on the first and 14th treatment day before and 2 h following drug administration. Under resting conditions, pimobendan reduced the end-diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure measured 2 h after drug administration by 33% (p less than 0.05) and increased the cardiac output by 16% (p less than 0.05). These effects were maintained after a treatment period of 14 days. Following administration of captopril, no significant hemodynamic changes at rest were noted 2 h after the first dose on day 1 and the last dose on day 14. There was, however, a tendency to continuous decline of the end-diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure over the study period. Under comparable work load (median of 25 W), both substances decreased the end-diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure 2 h following the first dose (pimobendan, -38%, p less than 0.01; captopril, -9%, p less than 0.05). The difference in the magnitude of effect between both treatment groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Following a treatment period of 14 days, the end-diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure before drug administration was significantly reduced (-24%, p less than 0.05) only in the pimobendan group, whereas the reduction in the captopril group (-11%) could not be statistically verified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "387": "The current therapeutic interest in specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition involves patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) whose symptoms are not controlled by diuretics, nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and digitalis. Maximal exercise capacity is limited in these patients by an inadequate rise in cardiac output and a fixed capacity to dilate the skeletal muscle vasculature, which is perhaps compounded by disorders of the skeletal muscle metabolism. To improve maximal exercise capacity, the increase in cardiac performance produced by specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors must, in turn, reverse the abnormalities present in the periphery, and more specifically augment the capacity to dilate the skeletal muscle vasculature. Increased vasodilatory response to maximal exercise probably depends on the regression of structural changes in the skeletal muscle vasculature. Such regression may be mediated by a reduction in neurohormonal vasoconstrictor stimuli and/or chronic augmentation in resting limb blood flow. Submaximal exercise capacity, at work loads equivalent to less than 70% of peak aerobic capacity, appears to be directly limited by depressed cardiac output and high sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity. Specific phosphodiesterase inhibition, which consistently increases left ventricular performance during exercise, is more likely to improve exercise capacity at submaximal work loads than at maximal work loads.", 
    "388": "A local vascular tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may contribute to blood pressure control and the maintenance of high blood pressure in some forms of hypertension, independently of the plasma RAS. Vascular converting enzyme (CE), present mainly in the endothelial layer of arteries and veins, can be altered in hypertension. Locally generated vascular angiotensin II (ANG II) may exert a number of actions on vascular tone and function, including directly and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, changes in vascular compliance in larger vessels, influence on vascular reactions to inflammation and injury, and alterations in vascular texture. Orally administered CE inhibitors have been shown to block not only the plasma RAS but also CE in the vasculature, leading to decreased vascular ANG II concentrations and possibly to an accumulation of locally generated vasodilator peptides and prostaglandins in the vascular wall. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the slow recovery of CE activity in the vasculature on drug withdrawal was more closely associated with the slow return of blood pressure to hypertensive levels than the fast recovery of the plasma RAS. These and other experimental data discussed in this article favor the hypothesis that local CE inhibition in the vascular wall of resistance vessels, large arteries and veins contributes to the beneficial therapeutic effects of CE inhibitors in cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "389": "Thirty-two hypertensive subjects with diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg were treated with ramipril over a period of 3 months. To determine the effective decrease of blood pressure and for reliable and reproducible demonstration of regression of myocardial hypertrophy during ramipril treatment, we performed parallel measurements with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography. Measurements were carried out before treatment, 4 h after the first dose, and after 14 days and 3 months of treatment. MRI slices showed a significant decrease of interventricular septal thickness from 19.57 to 15.20 mm, whereas echocardiography demonstrated an equivalent decrease from 18.78 to 14.57 mm. At each measuring point, quantification of wall thickness was performed three times and the means were calculated. The septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle were also measured at three different points. The values were obtained with negligible scatter and the changes with ramipril treatment were highly significant (p less than 0.001). A concomitant decrease of blood pressure was also observed. The therapeutic aim to reduce diastolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg was achieved in all patients. In addition to the significant reduction in blood pressure, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril caused a significant regression of pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography.", 
    "390": "Three hundred thirty-one patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, 182 males and 149 females with a mean age of 54 (range, 17-87 years), were studied for 1 year in a clinical trial with ramipril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The patients included had completed double-blind trials with ramipril vs. captopril, HCT, atenolol and ramipril plus piretanide. All cases were treated first with 5 mg ramipril and, where appropriate, also with 25 mg HCT. Adjustment of the dose in the range 1.25-20 mg ramipril was left to the investigator. Overall, a consistent reduction in blood pressure was achieved. Only small changes in mean blood pressure were noted during the 12 months (mean diastolic blood pressure 84.3-86.9 mm Hg, mean systolic blood pressure 145.6-148.2 mm Hg). Two hundred sixty-two (82%) of the 331 patients had diastolic values consistently equal to or lower than 95 mm Hg. There was a downward shift in the dosages upon which the investigators finally settled during the 12-month period in the patients receiving ramipril monotherapy. In patients also receiving HCT the initial dose was increased in most cases. Adverse events were observed in 6.7% of patients taking ramipril alone. The most frequent symptoms were dizziness, asthenia, pain in the upper abdomen and headache. Adverse effects occurred more frequently under continuous additional treatment with HCT, the same symptoms being reported. The clinical trial was prematurely terminated in six patients, in only two cases for medical reasons.

    "391": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produce a dry, nonproductive cough in some patients. Retrospective surveys have suggested an incidence of cough of between 0.7 and 14%. Those patients who develop cough show a marked increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex to inhalation of the extract of red pepper, capsaicin. They have a normal response before treatment, and the sensitivity of the cough reflex returns to normal when therapy is discontinued. The mechanism of this important side effect is not known. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of cough, both as a side effect of therapy and as a common symptom of respiratory disease.", 
    "392": "Patients with essential hypertension were studied to clarify the role of the kallikrein-kinin system in the hypotensive actions of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors. Captopril, alacepril, ramipril, and altiopril administered in single doses rapidly decreased blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II levels, and increased plasma and urinary kinins as well as plasma renin activity. Following administration of captopril for 14 days, similar effects were observed. Urine volume and urinary sodium excretion were augmented after acute and chronic administration of captopril. The patients who received ramipril and altiopril were divided into renin subgroups. In the normal-renin group, the change in blood pressure was accompanied by an increase in plasma kinin level and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II level. However, in the low-renin group, although these drugs reduced blood pressure and increased plasma kinin, no significant change was observed in plasma angiotensin II levels. These findings suggest that (a) in patients with normal renin activity, the hypotensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitors might be caused by an increase in plasma kinin and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II, but in the low-renin group, the increase in plasma kinin levels may be more important; and (b) the augmentation of urine volume and urinary sodium excretion may also be related to the hypotensive effects of the converting enzyme inhibitors during long-term administration.", 
    "393": "The therapeutic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with the production of a dry cough, which occurs more commonly in women than men and appears to be unrelated to concurrent illness. At present the exact incidence of ACE inhibitor cough and the substrate of ACE responsible for this effect is unknown. Cough challenge by inhalation of aerosols of tussive agents such as citric acid and capsaicin may be used to study the effect of drug administration on the cough reflex. In normal subjects, an oral dose of captopril (25 mg) causes a significant shift in the dose-response curve to capsaicin inhalation, but not that to distilled water or citric acid. The exacerbation of artificially induced cough by ACE inhibition may be the result of a local increase in perineuronal substance P or bradykinin concentrations within the lung.", 
    "394": "In an open trial, the antihypertensive and hormonal effects of ramipril, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were studied in 23 hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal failure: group I, creatinine clearance 5-15 ml/min, n = 10; group II, creatinine clearance 15-40 ml/min, n = 7; group III, creatinine clearance 40-80 ml/min, n = 6. In a 2-week placebo run-in period, antihypertensive agents were reduced or discontinued. During the treatment phase, patients received a 5-mg tablet of ramipril once daily for a period of 2 weeks. Concomitant medication remained unchanged. In all groups, ramipril significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure. Blood pressure response was not different in the three groups, although plasma ramipril levels were higher in patients with severe renal failure. In patients with high plasma renin activity (PRA), reduction of blood pressure was greater than in subjects with low PRA. Plasma ACE activity was suppressed to less than 20% of its initial value in all groups during the whole treatment period, and the suppression was more marked and lasted longer in patients with severe renal failure. A strong correlation between the plasma ramiprilat levels and the inhibition of plasma ACE activity was noted for all groups. Mean serum creatinine did not increase significantly; serum potassium levels rose from 4.5 to 4.9 mmol/L on day 14 (p less than 0.01).

    "395": "In an open trial, the pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite ramiprilat were studied in 23 hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. During a 2-week treatment period, each subject took daily a 5-mg tablet of ramipril. Serum profiles and urinary excretion of the parent compound and ramiprilat, the active metabolite, were then evaluated. Peak concentrations of ramipril were slightly greater in patients with severe renal insufficiency; however, most of the ramipril was metabolized in the liver. The drug concentration-time curve was almost independent of renal function and no accumulation was observed after multiple dosing. In contrast, ramiprilat kinetics were significantly influenced by renal function. Initial apparent half-lives (8-16 h), mean trough concentrations (5-19 ng/ml), and absolute accumulation all increased with worsening renal function, and renal clearance of ramiprilat was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance. The subsequent long terminal phase at low ramiprilat serum concentration represents the slow dissociation of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-bound drug. This study indicates that in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min), smaller doses of ramipril will be required than in patients with normal or borderline normal renal function.", 
    "396": "Dietary sodium restriction alone is effective in lowering blood pressure in some, but not all, patients with essential hypertension. Homeostatic mechanisms, including activation of the renin-aldosterone system, may counteract the effects of sodium restriction. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are also effective as sole therapy in many patients with essential hypertension, but may be less effective in those with low-renin hypertension. The combination of dietary sodium restriction with blockade of the renin system by an ACE inhibitor is a particularly effective way to improve blood pressure control. Addition of a thiazide diuretic will reduce pressure further.", 
    "397": "To investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril (HOE 498), in patients with cardiac insufficiency (NYHA III-IV), we performed an open trial with a follow-up of 10 days. Twenty-seven patients (18 females, 9 males), mean aged 62 years (46-83) with severe heart failure, were included. After a single oral dose of 5 mg ramipril, the plasma and urine levels of ramipril, ramiprilat, ACE plasma activity, standard laboratory values, blood pressure and pulse rate were evaluated. The maximal plasma level of ramipril was 57.0 +/- 26.8 ng/ml after 1.4 h; t1/2 was 2.4 +/- 1.2 h. The peak level of ramiprilat was 27.9 +/- 24 ng/ml after 4.6 h; t1/2 for the active compound was 6 +/- 4.2 h. The total recovery of ramipril and metabolites in urine was on average 39 +/- 17.5% within 96 h. Ninety-five percent inhibition of ACE activity was observed in all patients and 80% inhibition lasted 24 h. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased without changes in heart rate. Five patients had mild side effects: hypotension, diarrhea, and dizziness. In conclusion, in patients with severe heart failure, plasma levels of drug and active metabolite were higher and remained measurable longer, with more sustained inhibition of ACE activity than reported in healthy volunteers. This indicates that titration should start with lower doses (1.25-2.5 mg) and that doses above 5 mg may rarely be necessary.",

Creatinine clearance ranged from below 15 ml/min (n = 9) to above 80 ml/min (n = 3). Serial blood samples were taken for the determination of ACE activity, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALDO), angiotensin II (AT II), and serum creatinine (CR). Blood pressure was also monitored before and after medication. After administration of ramipril systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) fell; the decreases were unrelated to renal function. Peak BP-lowering effect was seen at 6 h basal, 174 +/- 19.5/102.6 +/- 8.9 to 149.8 +/- 19.7/87.6 +/- 13.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001). ACE inhibition occurred within 2 h, being maximal at 4 h: basal, 82.6 +/- 17.9 to 0.2 +/- 0.6 nmol/ml/min (p less than 0.001). The greater the renal impairment, the longer the ACE inhibition. Angiotensin II was reduced maximally at 10 h after dosing, from 10.4 +/- 5.4 to 6.2 +/- 3.6 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Aldosterone also fell from 212 +/- 188.4 to 134 +/- 73.3 pg/ml at 6 h (p less than 0.01). Plasma creatinine was unchanged: 401.3 +/- 315.7 to 394.9 +/- 306.1 nmol/L (NS). Ramipril, given as a single oral dose, lowers BP in hypertensives with both normal and impaired renal function, inhibits ACE activity, and causes no change in serum creatinine.", 
    "399": "To investigate the effects of ramipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on autonomic function, autonomic function tests were performed in eight healthy male subjects, aged 22-26 years, after single oral administration of 5 mg of ramipril or placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Measurements of heart rate variability and diving reflex test were performed as indices of parasympathetic tone. Forearm isometric exercise (handgrip test) and cold pressor test were carried out to evaluate sympathetic nervous reactivity. Supine systolic blood pressure was decreased significantly after ramipril (F = 11.16, p less than 0.01), but diastolic blood pressure was not. Heart rate at rest did not significantly differ between ramipril and placebo. Heart rate variability was significantly increased 120 min after ramipril [5.5 +/- 0.7% (SEM) on ramipril and 3.7 +/- 0.2% on placebo; F = 7.13, p less than 0.05]. However, reflex bradycardia during the diving test was not enhanced after ramipril. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations before and after handgrip test were not influenced by ramipril. Increments of mean blood pressure and heart rate during handgrip or cold pressor test did not significantly differ between ramipril and placebo, either. These results suggest that ramipril may enhance cardiac vagal tone without affecting sympathetic nervous activity. Enhanced parasympathetic activity could be related to an absence of reflex tachycardia following the administration of ramipril.", 
    "400": "Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and sodium-diuresis lower blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The purpose of the present study was to examine whether long-term therapy with ramipril (RA, and ACE inhibitor) would lower blood pressure more effectively and without adverse reactions in combination with the loop diuretics piretanide (PI) or furosemide (FU). Groups of 15 SHR each were treated once daily for 3 weeks by gavage with 1 and 10 mg/kg RA, 2 and 4 mg/kg PI, and 8 and 16 mg/kg FU alone and with 1 mg/kg RA in combination with each of these diuretics at both the high and low doses. Sustained and marked ACE inhibition with 10 mg/kg RA normalized BP, but this was accompanied with slightly impaired kidney function as assessed by increases in both urea and creatinine. Low-dose diuretic therapy, producing little diuresis, or treatment with 1 mg/kg RA, producing less sustained ACE inhibition were less effective on blood pressure and scarcely altered serum solute levels, except 4 mg/kg PI, which produced slight reductions in Na+, K+, Mg2+, and PO4(3-). Combined treatment with the 1 mg/kg RA with either diuretic given at low or high dose was well tolerated at much improved reduction in blood pressure compared to their effects individually and without changes in serum solute concentrations and without hemoconcentration. Thus, combined treatment with low doses of loop diuretics and ACE inhibitors that permit partial recovery of serum ACE activity during the 24 h after dosing synergistically lowers blood pressure without adverse reactions associated with larger doses of either therapy alone.", 
    "401": "Evidence for effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on isolated human glomeruli was provided using specific binding of tritium-labeled ramiprilat, a potent inhibitor of ACE. [3H]ramiprilat bound to isolated glomeruli, depending on time and temperature, displaying a KD of 3.8 nmol/L and a Bmax of 853 fmol/mg protein. Specific binding represented more than 90% of total binding. Dissociation occurred rapidly after dilution of the sample with incubation buffer or after addition of an excess of unlabeled inhibitor. Binding of [3H]ramiprilat was also inhibited by increasing concentrations of enalaprilat, another ACE inhibitor. ACE is a zinc-containing enzyme. Addition of EGTA to the assay, which chelates zinc ions, completely prevented binding. This was reversed by divalent Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions, but not by magnesium. Binding of [3H]ramiprilat to isolated glomeruli was maximal at pH 8, which also is optimal for ACE activity. The binding of [3H]ramiprilat to isolated human glomeruli is specific, and resembles the characteristics which have been found earlier for enzyme activity of ACE. Thus, binding of [3H]ramiprilat to isolated glomeruli can be assumed to be directed to ACE.", 
    "402": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and their combined use with an antiestrogenic steroid on erythropoiesis were investigated in patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD). Hematocrit was decreased by 10% or more in 6 of 12 patients who received either captopril or enalapril for 2-6 months. Erythropoietin (Epo) and angiotensin II (AII) were significantly reduced in these patients. When treatment with mepitiostane was combined with ACE inhibitor, anemia was significantly improved but without evidence of changes in circulating Epo concentrations or indices of renin-angiotensin activity. The reduction of AII and Epo formation by ACE inhibitors seems to play an important role in the worsening of anemia in patients on CHD; addition of an antiestrogenic steroid should be considered.", 
    "403": "The most important component of the renal-body fluid feedback is renal pressure natriuresis which through sodium and water excretion stabilizes arterial pressure. The chronic effects of angiotensin II in regulating the pressure natriuresis was studied in dogs by the Guyton school. Renal perfusion was either permitted to increase or was maintained constant with a servo-controlled occluder placed on the abdominal aorta just above the kidneys. When the renal pressure was allowed to increase, sodium excretion was reduced for a day and after 4-5 days there was little net change in sodium balance and arterial pressure stabilized at about 30 mm Hg above control. In the servo-controlled renal perfusion, escape from sodium retention did not occur, arterial pressure continued to rise, and pulmonary edema developed. Angiotensin II, by its hemodynamic and tubular effects, modulates renal sodium and water excretion and has an important role in blood pressure regulation. Antibodies to renin and converting enzyme inhibitors showed a causal relationship between the stimulated renin-angiotensin system and the antihypertensive effect of these agents. Chronic effects are observed in hypertensive patients with normal or even low plasma renin activity. This suggests that local angiotensin concentrations in the vascular and renin tissues may be more important in determining sodium and water excretion. Our knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system in regulating blood pressure made the usage of converting enzyme inhibitors a logical and efficacious modality in the therapy of hypertension. In a multicenter study of 202 hypertensive patients, the efficacy and safety of ramipril and enalapril was studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "404": "Angiotensin II appears to have important actions in modulating sympathetic nerve activity; conversely, sympathetic stimulation alters renin release. Drugs that inhibit angiotensin II formation would be expected then not only to offset the direct vasoconstricting and aldosterone releasing actions of this peptide but also to reduce sympathetic nerve activity. Hypertension and cardiac failure are two major conditions in which converting enzyme inhibitors have found important therapeutic roles; both are considered to be associated with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. However, in spite of considerable experimental evidence for a sympatholytic action of converting enzyme inhibitors, direct proof has been difficult to obtain in humans. In part, this results from the lack of any satisfactory way of assessing sympathetic activity in the clinical situation. Nevertheless, our failure to understand the pathophysiology of disease and the precise mechanism of action of drugs has not precluded exploiting the salutatory effects of inhibition of converting enzyme.", 
    "405": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has provided a new approach to the treatment of hypertension. The broad efficacy of ACE inhibitors across the entire spectrum of hypertension exceeds original predictions. Diuretics have been shown to extend efficacy to over 85% of noncomplicated hypertensives. In addition to efficacy, combination of ACE inhibitors with diuretics permits prevention or attenuation of many undesirable side effects of diuretic therapy, including hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Thus, considerations of both efficacy and beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors make the combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics an attractive one in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "406": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to inhibit angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced steroidogenesis and vasoconstriction. To investigate the role of Ang II in the renal response to ANP, a synthetic ANP (0.1 micron/kg/min, 60 min) was infused for 1 h in eight subjects with or without pretreatment with an inhibitor of the converting enzyme, enalapril (20 mg, p.o.), or Ang II (10 ng/kg/min). ANP infusion alone caused increases in urinary volume, urinary sodium excretion, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, enalapril treatment abolished these diuretic and natriuretic effects of ANP. In this group, GFR was decreased and no tubular effects, which was estimated by urinary excretion of sodium and phosphate, were observed. The anti-natriuretic effects of exogenous Ang II were reversed by concomitant ANP infusion, which inhibited both proximal and postproximal sodium reabsorption induced by Ang II without changing the GFR. These results indicate that endogenous Ang II plays an obligatory role in the natriuretic response to ANP and also suggested that ANP inhibits Ang II-stimulated tubular reabsorption of sodium.", 
    "407": "Substance P is a neuropeptide released in vivo from the substantia nigra, the principal substance P nerve terminal region in the rat brain. Its inactivation was investigated in a purified nigral synaptic membrane preparation. The membrane-bound enzyme shares many features with the endopeptidase 24-11 (EC 3.4.24.11): 1) hydrolysis of peptide bonds Gln6-Phe7, Phe7-Phe8 and Gly9-Leu10, 2) sensitivity to the inhibition by phosphoramidon and 3) relative affinity for substance P. Bestatine and captopril inhibit only the hydrolysis of the metabolites. These results suggest that substance P is inactivated in substantia nigra by endopeptidase 24-11 and that a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme may play a role in subsequent degradation of the substance P metabolites.", 
    "408": "Acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been found to induce natriuresis in humans as well as in experimental animals. However, the tubular sites involved have not been precisely evaluated in humans. Using both free-water and lithium clearance, the latter as a marker of proximal tubular reabsorption, we measured segmental tubular movement of sodium before and after acute captopril administration in eight healthy normotensive volunteers on normal sodium diet. Captopril decreased slightly but significantly glomerular filtration rate (GFR), filtration fraction, and mean arterial pressure (MAP), whereas renal plasma flow (RPF) was unchanged. Captopril acutely increased excretion rate and fractional excretion of sodium. When assessed by lithium clearance, both absolute and fractional proximal reabsorption of sodium and fractional distal reabsorption of sodium were found to be decreased by captopril. When assessed by free-water clearance, both fractional proximal and distal reabsorption of sodium were found to be decreased by captopril but only the decrease in fractional proximal reabsorption was significant. These results indicate that captopril-induced natriuretic effect is due to decreased sodium reabsorption in both proximal and distal sites of the nephron. Shifts in segmental tubular sodium reabsorption obtained from either free-water or lithium clearance are directionally similar but quantitatively different. Results obtained from lithium clearance indicate that the rate of fluid delivery to the diluting segment is at least twice as great as that estimated from free-water calculations. Lithium clearance techniques therefore appear to be more sensitive in detecting subtle changes in segmental tubular reabsorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "409": "Following chronic administration of the protein-reactive sulphydryl drug captopril (CP) to rats, an IgG antibody response to CP-derived antigen was detected by ELISA in rats administered the free drug at doses of 270 mumol/kg (i.p. and i.m.) and 27 mumol/kg (i.p.). The antibody response was slow to develop, requiring three series of four daily injections at one-monthly intervals before CP-specific serum IgG was apparent. The IgG antibody recognized CP-ovalbumin but not ovalbumin, and was inhibited by CP in protein-conjugated form, and by free CP and CP-disulphide, thus confirming specificity for a CP-derived antigenic determinant. A drug-induced non-drug-specific IgG response directed against human serum albumin was also observed after chronic high dose CP treatment. No IgG anti-DNA, IgM anti-CP nor IgM anti-HSA responses were seen following chronic drug administration. These studies show that CP, like the model reactive metabolite dinitrofluorobenzene, but unlike other protein-reactive drugs such as D-penicillamine and benzylpenicillin, is immunogenic in the rat. The findings also suggest the possibility that anti-CP antibodies reported in man may be drug-induced, rather than naturally occurring.", 
    "410": "Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) can be treated by diuretics, inotropic agents and vasodilators. Increased diuresis lowers left and right ventricular filling pressures but may further reduce cardiac output. Nevertheless, diuretics produce symptomatic improvement in most patients. Digoxin also has beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with advanced CHF and sinus rhythm, but the frequency and degree of therapeutic response is inferior to that of vasodilators. Among the latter, ACE inhibitors are the most appropriate for long-term administration since they do not lead to development of tolerance and seem to improve long-term prognosis in patients with severe CHF. Newer inotropic agents have marked hemodynamic effects in the short term, but their utility for chronic treatment remains questionable. The optimum choice of drugs in various forms and stages of CHF is discussed.", 
    "411": "Hemodynamic effects of captopril were prospectively studied in 12 children suffering from dilative cardiomyopathy. Before the administration of the drug all patients were put on a stable medication of diuretics and/or glycosides. A median daily dose of 1.83 mg captopril/kg body weight was given in 3 or 4 single doses depending on age. Median body weight of the children was 18.6 kg (range 2.7-42.2) and the median age was 5.8 years (range 0.2-15). Left ventricular volume was determined in systole and diastole using 2-D echo, and the stroke volume als well as the ejection fraction were calculated. Cardiac index (CI) and systemic resistance (Rs) were measured by Doppler echo. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at each echo registration. ESVI (-32%), EDVI (-21%) and SVI (-7%) were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced by short-term captopril treatment. This effect was maintained under long-term therapy. EF, CI, Rs, blood pressure and heart rate showed only minor changes under captopril. Adverse effects were recorded only in one child. They disappeared after dose reduction."
