    "0": "The induction of B(1) receptors (B(1)Rs) and desensitization or down-regulation of B(2) receptors (B(2)Rs) as a consequence of the production of endogenous kinins has been termed the autoregulation hypothesis. The latter was investigated using two models based on the rabbit: kinin stimulation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and in vivo contact system activation (dextran sulphate intravenous injection, 2 mg kg(-1), 5 h). Rabbit aortic SMCs express a baseline population of B(1)Rs that was up-regulated upon interleukin-1beta treatment ([(3)H]-Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK binding or mRNA concentration evaluated by RT - PCR; 4 or 3 h, respectively). Treatment with B(1)R or B(2)R agonists failed to alter B(1)R expression under the same conditions. Despite consuming endogenous kininogen (assessed using the kinetics of immunoreactive kinin formation in the plasma exposed to glass beads ex vivo) and producing hypotension mediated by B(2)Rs in anaesthetized rabbits, dextran sulphate treatment failed to induce B(1)Rs in conscious animals (RT - PCR in several organs, aortic contractility). By contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 microg kg(-1), 5 h) was an effective B(1)R inducer (kidney, duodenum, aorta) but did not reduce kininogen reserve. We tested the alternate hypothesis that endogenous kinin participate in LPS induction of B(1)Rs. Kinin receptor antagonists (icatibant combined to B-9858, 50 microg kg(-1) of each) failed to prevent or reduce the effect of LPS on B(1)R expression. Dextran sulphate or LPS treatments did not persistently down-regulate vascular B(2)Rs (jugular vein contractility assessed ex vivo). The kinin receptor autoregulation hypothesis is not applicable to primary cell cultures derived from a tissue known to express B(1)Rs in a regulated manner (aorta). The activation of the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system is ineffective to induce B(1)Rs in vivo in an experimental time frame sufficient for B(1)R induction by LPS.", 
    "1": "The effect of quinapril and nifedipine on platelet aggregation, vascular endothelial function and coagulation system activity, was compared in a parallel-group, investigator-blind study carried out on patients with mild to moderate hypertension but no other diseases or receiving medication which might affect platelet function, vascular endothelium or coagulation. Forty patients (two groups of 20 patients each) and 20 control subjects were recruited. Patients were randomised to receive either quinapril or nifedipine retard and the dose escalated to control hypertension. Platelet aggregation studies were assessed serially and beta-thromboglobulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), von Willebrand factor (vWF) coagulation factors VIIIc, XII and fibrinogen were measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all patients in both groups. Platelet function was impaired in certain parameters (slope of the reaction with ADP and collagen and maximum aggregation with collagen) in the patient group compared to controls before treatment and this improved in patients on quinapril but not on nifedipine; likewise beta-thromboglobulin was higher in the patient group and fell significantly in the quinapril group but not those on nifedipine. Measurements of endothelial function and coagulation were normal before treatment and showed no alteration during the study, except in the expected fall in plasma ACE in the quinapril group. The results indicate that the ACE inhibitor, quinapril, has a beneficial effect on platelet function unlike the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine.", 
    "2": "A large variety of drugs is available for treatment of hypertension. Moreover, many randomised controlled trials with clinically relevant endpoints (morbidity, mortality, quality of life) do exist in the cardiovascular field, providing for sufficient evidence to choose the appropriate agent in most circumstances. For diuretics and betablockers a large body of evidence in terms of beneficial effects on outcome does exist, for ACE-inhibitors in some special indications only. These drugs are therefore recommended as first-line treatments. For calcium-channel blockers (with the exception of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly) and AT1-receptor-antagonists the results of endpoint-studies are still awaited. These results will have to be considered for revised versions of currently available guidelines.", 
    "3": "Enteric loss of protein with the sequelae of edema, immunodeficiency, and hypercoagulability is being diagnosed with increasing frequency after Fontan procedure. The precise pathophysiological mechanism is unknown; however, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) after Fontan procedure is likely related to a hemodynamic derangement that is not easily detectable via standard hemodynamic measures presently obtainable in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Treatment options include (1) symptomatic relief via diuretics, supplemental albumin infusion, and dietary change to high protein/high medium-chain triglyceride intake, (2) hemodynamic improvement via afterload reduction (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), repair of branch pulmonary artery stenoses, or coil embolization of aortopulmonary collaterals, (3) intestinal cell membrane stabilization via high-dose steroids or heparin infusion, and (4) attempt at alteration of the primary hemodynamic derangement via fenestration of the systemic venous baffle or via heart transplantation. Further understanding of the cause of PLE after Fontan procedure is needed before more effective treatment options can be used. Copyright 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company", 
    "4": "Diacylglycerol (DG) kinase (DGK) terminates signaling from DG, which serves as an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), by converting DG to phosphatidic acid. DGK is thus regarded as an attenuator of the PKC activity. In rats, five DGK isozymes have been cloned, but little is known about their role in the heart. In this study, the spatiotemporal expression of DGK isozymes was investigated in rat hearts under a normal condition and after myocardial infarction (MI) by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. In normal left ventricular myocardium, DGKalpha, DGKepsilon, and DGKzeta mRNAs were expressed evenly throughout the myocardium, although the DGKalpha expression was very low. In infarcted hearts, the expression of DGKzeta was enhanced in the peripheral zone of the necrotic area and at the border zone 3 and 7 days after MI, and to a lesser extent in the middle layer of the granulation tissue 21 days after MI. The enhanced DGKzeta expression in the infarcted and border areas could be attributed to granulocytes and macrophages. In contrast, the expression of DGKepsilon in the infarcted and border areas was lower than that in the viable left ventricle (LV) throughout the postoperation period. Furthermore, DGKepsilon expression in the viable myocardium 21 days after MI decreased significantly compared with left ventricular myocardium in the sham-operated rats and was completely restored by treatment with captopril. Our results demonstrate that three DGK isozymes are expressed in the heart and that each isozyme might have different functional characteristics in the healing and LV remodeling after MI.", 
    "5": "Adjuvant medical therapy plays a central role in the ongoing care of patients with coronary artery disease after percutaneous revascularization. The cardiac and vascular protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors make these agents an attractive choice in this setting, especially in light of the HOPE study results. Mounting evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors exert their favorable effects at the cellular level by antagonizing angiotensin II and enhancing nitric oxide bioavailability and, in the process, restoring normal endothelial function.", 
    "6": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of a growing number of integral membrane proteins that is shed from the cell surface through proteolytic cleavage by a secretase. To investigate the requirements for ectodomain shedding, we replaced the glycosylphosphatidylinositol addition sequence in membrane dipeptidase (MDP) - a membrane protein that is not shed - with the juxtamembrane stalk, transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic domains of ACE. The resulting construct, MDP-STM(ACE), was targeted to the cell surface in a glycosylated and enzymically active form, and was shed into the medium. The site of cleavage in MDP-STM(ACE) was identified by MS as the Arg(374)-Ser(375) bond, corresponding to the Arg(1203)-Ser(1204) secretase cleavage site in somatic ACE. The release of MDP-STM(ACE) and ACE from the cells was inhibited in an identical manner by batimastat and two other hydroxamic acid-based zinc metallosecretase inhibitors. In contrast, a construct lacking the juxtamembrane stalk, MDP-TM(ACE), although expressed at the cell surface in an enzymically active form, was not shed, implying that the juxtamembrane stalk is the critical determinant of shedding. However, an additional construct, ACEDeltaC, in which the N-terminal domain of somatic ACE was fused to the stalk, TM and cytosolic domains, was also not shed, despite the presence of a cleavable stalk, implying that in contrast with the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain lacks a signal required for shedding. These data are discussed in the context of two classes of secretases that differ in their requirements for recognition of substrate proteins.", 
    "7": "It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO, nitrogen monoxide) is a regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle. The present study was undertaken to investigate the acute effects of the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) on blood glucose levels and on the gluco-regulatory hormones insulin and glucagon in healthy dogs. The acute effects of SNAP on mean arterial pressure and heart rate were also investigated. The drug was administered intravenously and the pre- and postprandial blood glucose, plasma insulin, and glucagon concentrations were determined at half-hour time intervals postadministration after a glucose challenge. The plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured and taken as the biochemical markers of in vivo NO formation. The oral glucose tolerance test revealed an impaired glucose tolerance in SNAP-treated dogs as reflected by the area under the glucose curve, 1150.50 +/- 63.00 mmol x 150 min and 1355.25 +/- 102.01 mmol/L x 150 min in dogs treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg of SNAP, respectively, compared with 860.25 +/- 60.68 mmol/L x 150 min in captopril-treated controls (P < 0.05). The 2-h blood glucose concentration in dogs treated with 20 mg/kg body wt of SNAP was 9.17 +/- 1.10 mmol/L compared with 5.59 +/- 0.26 mmol/L for captopril-treated controls (P = 0.015). The oral glucose tolerance test also confirmed an impaired insulin secretion in the SNAP-treated dogs. While the plasma insulin concentration increased gradually in the captopril-treated controls to a peak value of 39.50 +/- 2.55 microIU/ml, 1.5 h after a glucose challenge there was a decrease in the plasma insulin concentration in SNAP-treated dogs to a low value of 20.67 +/- 0.88 microIU/ml (P = 0.006). In contrast, there were no significant differences in plasma glucagon concentration in SNAP-treated dogs and captopril-treated dogs at any time points. Using the Griess reaction, we found that there was a 27-95% increase in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentration on administration of SNAP. The sustained hyperglycemic effect observed in SNAP-treated dogs was accompanied by a marginal decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure and a significant increase in heart rate (P < 0.05). We conclude that acute administration of SNAP in the oral glucose tolerance test releases NO that modulates the parameters of carbohydrate metabolism.",

    "9": "A 40-year-old Hispanic woman with well-controlled chronic hypertension and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was treated with valsartan and atenolol until pregnancy was diagnosed at 24 weeks' gestation. An ultrasound examination revealed normal fetal growth and anatomy but anhydramnios (amniotic fluid index 0). Valsartan was discontinued, and amniotic fluid volume normalized within two weeks. Intrauterine fetal death was documented at 33 weeks' gestation. Labor was induced, with the delivery of a stillbom female fetus with small, hypoplastic lungs (weight 41% of expected) and an extremely small, 148-g placenta (weight 48% of the 10th percentile for gestational age).", 
    "10": "The use of valsartan, a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA), in human pregnancy has not been reported, but this class of agents would be expected to cause fetal toxicity similar to that observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This toxicity includes reduced perfusion of the fetal kidneys, resulting in anuria, oligohydramnios, and subsequent pulmonary hypoplasia. The small hypoplastic lungs and very small placenta were probably a consequence of valsartan and atenolol combination therapy.", 
    "11": "Resolution of anhydramnios after discontinuing valsartan is evidence for ARA-induced fetal toxicity. The pulmonary hypoplasia observed in the stillbom infant was a direct result of the severe oligohydramnios. The cause of fetal death nine weeks later is uncertain, but because the woman's chronic hypertension and diabetes were well controlled, we believe the primary cause was chronic placental insufficiency resulting from the previous combination of valsartan and atenolol.",

Prior to stroke, only 45% of the patients were receiving any antithrombotic (anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet) therapy; this figure rose to 77% at six months. Antithrombotic treatment rates among those with atrial fibrillation were 59% before stroke and 83% at six months, including warfarin in 64%. Approximately 70% of subjects had controlled blood pressures one, three, and six months after stroke, defined as systolic blood pressure < or = 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg. Use of multiple antihypertensive agents was common; calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used most frequently.

    "17": "A case history of a woman with gingival overgrowth (GO) induced by amlodipine is presented. A 49-year-old Japanese woman, who was taking amlodipine, had gingival overgrowth and swelling on examination. No specific periodontal treatment was provided to the patient for the GO; however, the amlodipine was replaced with an ACE inhibitor after consultation with her medical practitioner. Within two months, the suspension of amlodipine resulted in a significant improvement in her periodontal condition. Failure to control the hypertension caused the physician to re-prescribe amlodipine. After three months, the gingival overgrowth returned; however, its severity was less when compared with the original periodontal condition, due to reduction in drug dose and periodontal therapy. This experience suggests that temporary suspension of a drug which can induce GO can improve the periodontal condition without the aid of surgical treatment.", 
    "18": "HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most common cause of renal failure in patients infected with type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The renal prognosis for HIVAN is poor and is typically associated with rapid progression to renal death. We report a patient with biopsy-proven HIVAN who was successfully treated with corticosteroids and review the currently available evidence supporting the specific treatments of this condition. A 34-year-old African-American male with a 2-year history of uncomplicated HIV disease developed progressive azotemia despite treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). He was treated with an uncomplicated 4-month course of prednisone, which improved his serum creatinine from 2.9 to 1.9 mg/dl and decreased his degree of proteinuria from 8 to 2.1 g/day. Two years post-steroid treatment his renal function remains stable. Increasing evidence supports that both ACE inhibitors and HAART are effective in preventing and in some cases of reversing HIVAN induced renal failure. In selected patients who progress despite these measures, a limited course of corticosteroid may achieve long-standing disease remissions. In general, with adequate supervision, corticosteroid therapy appears to be well tolerated and has an acceptable side effect profile. Although persuasive in view of the abysmal natural history of HIVAN, the currently available studies are subject to major methodological limitations. Appropriate randomized controlled trials are urgently required in order to further examine the efficacy, optimal timing, and potential side effects of these treatments.", 
    "19": "The interaction between homologous C-type natriuretic peptide (dfCNP) and catecholamine release in cardiovascular control was assessed in the marine dogfish (Squalus acanthias). This was accomplished by evaluation of the dynamics of the dfCNP-elicited secretion of catecholamines in situ and in vivo. With an in situ saline-perfused postcardinal sinus preparation, it was demonstrated that perfusion with saline containing dfCNP (10(-9) mol x L(-1)) did not affect the secretion of either noradrenaline or adrenaline. However, the presence of dfCNP in the perfusate significantly enhanced carbachol-evoked secretion of noradrenaline. In vivo, intravascular injection of dfCNP (10(-9) mol x kg(-1)) caused a biphasic pressor-depressor response consisting of a brief increase in caudal artery blood pressure (P(CA)) followed by a prolonged reduction in P(CA). Furthermore, although systemic resistance initially increased, it was subsequently maintained at baseline values in the face of persistent decreases in both P(CA) and cardiac output. Bolus injection of dfCNP elicited significant increases in plasma noradrenaline levels that peaked within 10 min; plasma adrenaline levels were unaffected. The release of noradrenaline elicited by dfCNP was unaffected by prior blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril) or by pretreatment with the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium. The delayed decrease in P(CA) was not observed in the hexamethonium-treated fish. Prior blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors (with sotalol) or alpha-adrenoreceptors (with prazosin) either significantly reduced (sotalol) or abolished (prazosin) the increase in plasma noradrenaline levels after dfCNP injection. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the elevation of plasma noradrenaline levels observed in vivo following dfCNP injection is not caused by a direct effect of dfCNP on catecholamine secretion from axillary body chromaffin cells. Furthermore, the dfCNP-mediated increase of plasma noradrenaline appears to be unrelated to changes in P(CA) and is insensitive to blockade of the RAS or nicotinic receptors. However, stimulation of adrenergic receptors, in particular the alpha-adrenoreceptors, appears to be a key mechanism underlying the dfCNP-elicited secretion of noradrenaline.",

    "21": "A cost-effectiveness model was designed to explore the effect of adding a new angiotensin-II inhibitor, telmisartan, to the therapeutic options for treating mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Incorporating the cost of drugs, physician visits, and adverse-event treatments, the model concluded that availability of telmisartan on formulary may shorten the mean time and costs to control. The stability of the initial findings over a range of sensitivity analyses lends credence to the model conclusions that availability of telmisartan on formulary improves the therapeutic options of care for hypertension.", 
    "22": "The interstitial granulomatous drug reaction (IGDR) is a novel drug-associated entity, characterized by violaceous plaques with a predilection for skin fold areas. Light microscopically, it resembles the incipient diffuse interstitial phase of granuloma annulare. Differentiating light microscopic features include the absence of complete collagen necrobiosis, the presence of interface dermatitis, and variable lymphoid atypia. The lack of vasculitis rules out the extravascular necrotizing granuloma (Winkelmann granuloma) associated with systemic disease. The differential diagnosis with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis as defined by Ackerman et al. has not been studied until now. Our aim was to determine the histologic criteria allowing us to differentiate IGDR without interface dermatitis and lymphoid atypia from interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. We report three patients with IGDR triggered, in two cases by respectively angiotensin convertin enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and furosemide, and in one case by the association of an ACE inhibitor, furosemide, and fluindione. Histologic examination showed a histological pattern of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. We found a dense, diffuse histiocytic infiltrate distributed interstitially and in palisaded array within the reticular dermis. Eosinophils and some neutrophils were scattered throughout the infiltrate. In some tiny foci, enveloped by histiocytes, thick collagen bundles associated with basophilic nuclear debris or \"flame figures\" were seen. Vasculitis, interface dermatitis, or lymphoid atypia were absent. Our study allowed us to expand the histological spectrum of IGDR including a histological pattern similar to interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. The lack of degenerated collagen could be a subtle clue in favor of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis triggered by a drug.", 
    "23": "Angioedema without urticaria is a clinical syndrome characterised by self-limiting local swellings involving the deeper cutaneous and mucosa tissue layers. Most occurrences of angioedema respond to treatment with a histamine H1 receptor blocker (antihistamine) because they are an allergic or parallergic reaction. A small number of cases do not respond to antihistamine treatment. Such cases tend to occur in patients with deficiency or dysfunction of the inhibitor of the first component of the complement (C1-INH), but more rarely can occur in patients with other conditions and as an adverse drug reaction. Angioedema is well documented in patients taking ACE inhibitors. Considering that 35 to 40 million patients are treated worldwide with ACE inhibitors, this drug class could account for several hundred deaths per year from laryngeal oedema. ACE inhibitors certainly do not mediate angioedema through an allergic or idiosyncratic reaction. For this reason the relationship with this drug is often missed and consequently quite underestimated. Rare instances of angioedema have also been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This adverse effect seems to occur less frequently with angiotensin II receptor antagonists than with ACE inhibitors. However, we do not know whether this adverse effect has the same mechanism with the 2 classes of medications. Some cases of severe angioedema have been recently reported after treatment with fibrinolytic agents. Scattered reports suggest the possibility of angioedema associated with the use of estrogens, antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors, and psychotropic drugs. Angioedema can also occur with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prevention of angioedema relies first on the patient history. Estrogen and ACE inhibitors should be avoided in a patient with congenital or acquired C1-INH deficiency. In the case of ACE inhibitors, the appearance of angioedema following long term treatment does not lessen the probability that such an agent could be the cause. The most important action to take in a patient with suspected drug-induced angioedema is to discontinue the pharmacological agent. Epinephrine (adrenaline), diphenydramine and intravenous methylprednisolone have been proposed for the medical management of airway obstruction, but so far no controlled studies have demonstrated their efficacy. If the acute airway obstruction leads to life-threatening respiratory compromise an emergency cricothyroidotomy must be performed.", 
    "24": "Advances have occurred rapidly in how the patient who presents with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction is managed. Nevertheless, due to availability and effectiveness, medical therapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment. Several drugs are of proven efficacy in decreasing myocardial loss and mortality. Thrombolytics, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants combine to decrease the thrombus overlying the active plaque and thus increase blood flow to the infarcting myocardium. Beta blockers, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors diminish myocardial oxygen consumption and have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. Supportive therapies provide patient comfort and aid survival until definitive therapies are instituted. However, as advanced as treatments become, none are effective unless patients are educated to seek help quickly and emergency response systems are efficient. Health care providers must ensure patient education and prompt medical response in communities so that medical regimens can be as effective as possible.",

In contrast, ET-1 peptide and the preproET-1 mRNA remained unchanged. In subsequent congestive heart failure (CHF), Ang II and ACE mRNA did not show further increases. But ET-1 and the mRNA were increased de novo by 5.3- and 4.1-fold, respectively. In ascending aorta-banded rats, the local activations of Ang II and ET-1 also showed a differential time course between LV hypertrophy and CHF. Long-term treatments of Dahl salt-sensitive rats with temocapril (an ACE inhibitor) and with bosentan (a mixed ET receptor blocker) equally improved long-term survival. Temocapril reduced the LV/body weight ratio and ameliorated LV fractional shortening. Conversely, although bosentan equally improved fractional shortening, it did not reduce the increase in LV mass. Combined treatment with these 2 drugs further ameliorated the animal's survival without additional decreases in systolic pressure.",

Because of this there has been considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of the natriuretic peptide system. Several approaches have been explored including the use of native peptides, the development of natriuretic peptides mimetics and targetting of endogenous clearance of natriuretic peptides. While ANP and BNP administration may be valuable in some circumstances, however, the limitations of the use of peptides especially for long-term treatment are well apparent. In view of this, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of orally active agents to enhance endogenous natriuretic peptides through inhibition of breakdown by neutral endopeptidase. This research has now led to the vasopeptidase inhibitors - dual inhibitors of both endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. These agents clearly provide a novel approach to enhance endogenous natriuretic peptide function on a background of reduced angiotensin II activity and may lead to an important advance in the treatment of hypertension and of conditions associated with overt salt and water overload.",

Dahl salt-sensitive (S) and Dahl salt-resistant (R) rats on a high salt diet were examined by radioimmunoassay for AVP and in situ hybridization histochemistry for nNOS. The high salt diet containing 8.0% NaCl was given for 4 weeks. The concentrations of AVP in hypertensive Dahl S rats were significantly increased in comparison with those in SD rats and Dahl R rats on a high salt diet. The levels of nNOS mRNA and NADPH-diaphorase activity in the PVN and SON of hypertensive Dahl S rats were greater than those in Dahl R rats on a high salt diet. The antihypertensive drugs, either nicardipine or captopril were administered to the Dahl S rats for 2 weeks beginning 2 weeks after the start of the high salt diet The nNOS mRNA in the PVN and SON of Dahl S rats given a high salt diet was not upregulated by treatment with nicardipine, while the nNOS mRNA in salt loaded Dahl S rats was greater upregulated by treatment with captopril to that greater than without the antihypertensive drug. Our results suggest that the increased NO production in the PVN and SON of hypertensive Dahl S rats may be ineffective in decreasing blood pressure or inhibiting AVP secretion.", 
    "45": "A beta-adrenoceptor agonist, norepinephrine (NE)-induced relaxation in the presence of an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and indomethacin was investigated in isolated femoral arteries from 5-week-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). NE elicited endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation in WKY. In endothelium-intact WKY artery, the NE-induced relaxation was reduced by nitro L-arginine (L-NA) and methylene blue. The residual response to NE in the presence of L-NA was further reduced by tetraethylammonium (TEA). Glibenclamide attenuated the NE-induced, endothelium-independent relaxation in WKY. In SHR, on the other hand, the relaxation to NE was solely endothelium-independent, unaffected by a combination of L-NA and TEA and inhibited by glibenclamide. The relaxation in response to NE in SHR was less than that in WKY, regardless of the presence and absence of endothelial cells. When WKY and SHR were treated for 10 days with captopril, the response to NE was increased not only in WKY but also in SHR. The relaxation in captopril-treated SHR consisted of endothelium-dependent and -independent components. The former was attenuated by L-NA and to a greater extent by TEA with L-NA. Sodium nitroprusside- and forskolin-induced, endothelium-independent relaxations in SHR were not significantly different from those in WKY. Captopril did not affect the response to these drugs. The present results indicate that the relaxation to NE is in part mediated by NO and a vasorelaxing factor distinct from NO in WKY but not in SHR. It is suggested that NE-induced, endothelium-independent relaxation in both groups is in part mediated by ATP-sensitive K+ channels. It is also suggested that in SHR, captopril increases the response to NE through increases in endothelial production of NO and the non-NO vasorelaxing factor.", 
    "46": "In the last ten years the incidence of patients with terminal renal insufficiency has been continuously rising. A decrease in numbers is expected through vigorous treatment of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Any antihypertensive therapy--independent of the substance group used--decreasing blood pressure, will slow down the progression of renal insufficiency. Whenever possible, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be part of the treatment, since these drugs have been shown to be renoprotective beyond their antihypertensive effect in certain renal diseases. This review will discuss pathogenesis, treatment and the use of renoprotective drugs in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.",

    "51": "In this 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative trial, 57 adult patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomly allocated to receive imidapril or captopril, initially at a dose of 5 mg once a day and 25 mg twice daily, respectively. After 4 weeks of therapy, the dose of each drug was increased twice if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained > or =90 mm Hg. Both treatments effectively lowered DBP in a comparable manner. Mean changes from baseline in DBP at 12 weeks were -9.9 mm Hg for imidapril and -8.8 mm Hg for captopril (p = 0.488). Responder rates in patients receiving active treatment for at least 6 weeks were 53.9% for imidapril and 48% for captopril (p = 0.676). Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse drug reactions were observed in 20.7% (6/29) of the imidapril group and 46.4% (13/28) of the captopril group (p < 0.05). A cough was the most frequent side effect, reported in 13.8% of the imidapril group and 35.7% of the captopril group. The results indicate that imidapril is as effective as captopril in the treatment of hypertension. Imidapril produces less adverse effects compared with captopril.",

Decreased glomerular filtration rates, elevated plasma urea and creatinine and glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were ameliorated by omapatrilat and fosinopril to a similar degree.

Six of these drugs have already been licensed in Europe and in the United States for the treatment of high blood pressure, and additional candidates are in the pipeline. The World Health Organisation has also recently endorsed their use for this condition. Inasmuch as AT1 receptor antagonists have proven themselves the equals of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with respect to antihypertensive efficacy, but demonstrated better safety profiles, this class of drugs may be considered to be a qualitative improvement in the treatment of essential hypertension. Interestingly, the six agents now on the market diverge considerably with respect to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, although it is not certain whether such differences are clinically relevant. A considerable number of large, multicentre trials are in progress to ascertain the possible longer-term organoprotective effects of these substances on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because of their noteworthy safety record to date, and simple once-a-day dosage regimen, AT1 receptor antagonists have the potential to improve compliance in patients with chronic hypertension.",

Patients with type 2 diabetes were identified as incident oral antidiabetic drug users between 1992 and 1997. Nondiabetic subjects were 1:1-matched for age, sex, pharmacy, and index date and received no insulin, oral antidiabetic drugs, or glucose-testing supplies.",

Differences between patients with type 2 diabetes and nondiabetic subjects lessened from 1 year before until 6 years after the start of oral antidiabetic therapy, reflected by decreasing attributable risks for diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and cardiac and antithrombotic drugs. The difference in use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering drugs increased. Cardiovascular hospitalizations attributable to type 2 diabetes were approximately 50% in the years close to the start of oral antidiabetic treatment and decreased to approximately 33% in the following years.",

    "61": "Using a community-based population of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we sought to: (1) determine the prevalence of bundle branch block (BBB) on the presenting electrocardiogram (ECG), (2) compare the clinical characteristics and the treatment administered to patients with and without BBB, and (3) determine the association of BBB with mortality. We analyzed the admission ECGs of 894 consecutive patients with AMI from Olmsted County, Minnesota, seen at our institution from January 1988 to March 1998. Of these, 53 had left BBB (LBBB) (5.9%) and 60 had right BBB (RBBB) (6.7%). Patients with BBB were more likely to be older, have a history of AMI or hypertension, and to be in Killip class >I at presentation. They were less likely to receive primary reperfusion therapy, beta blockers, or heparin, but more likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. They had lower mean predischarge ejection fractions (38 +/- 16% vs 50 +/- 15%, p <0.0001). In-hospital mortality was 13.3%, 17.0%, and 9.1% for patients with RBBB, LBBB, and no BBB, respectively (p = 0.11). Respective postdischarge survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 80%, 60%, and 50% in the RBBB group, 78%, 56%, and 51% in the LBBB group, and 92%, 85%, and 76% in the group without BBB (p <0.0001). Although BBB was not an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis, the presence of transient or persistent BBB with AMI is an easily recognized clinical marker of increased mortality. Our conclusion from this study is that in a community-based population, patients who had LBBB or RBBB at the time of AMI had lower predischarge ejection fractions and higher in-hospital and long-term unadjusted mortality.",

In total 320 patients aged 18 - 75 years, with mean sitting diastolic blood pressures of 95 - 115 mmHg, were randomized to treatment with imidapril (n = 157) or nifedipine SR (n = 163). Efficacy evaluations were based on the intent-to-treat principle. On study completion, there was no difference between the groups with respect to the primary efficacy variable of response to treatment (imidapril 63.1%; nifedipine SR 61.3%). After 2 weeks' treatment, clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure were observed in both groups, with a trend towards further reductions until study end. Fewer patients in the imidapril-treated group than the nifedipine group withdrew due to adverse events that occurred on treatment with study medication (3.2% versus 16.0%) or experienced adverse events (40.1% versus 49.7%). In addition, fewer adverse events were causally related to imidapril (24.2%) compared with nifedipine SR (41.7%). These results show that imidapril is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and is better tolerated than nifedipine SR.",

Serum digoxin concentrations were determined before and after the administration of captopril for 1 week in patients on chronic digoxin therapy. Each patient who was taking 0.25 mg of digoxin PO q.d., was administered 12.5 mg of captopril PO t.i.d. for 7 days. The peak serum concentration of digoxin (Cmax) before and after (on Days 0 and 7) captopril administration was 1.7+/-0.2 ng/ml and 2.7+/-0.2 ng/ml, the time to peak (tmax) was 2.4+/-0.5 h and 1.3+/-0.2 h, and the area under the 24-hour digoxin concentration-time curve (AUC0-24h) was 30.0+/-1.5 ng x h/ml and 41.7+/-3.4 ng x h/ml, respectively. While captopril caused a significant increase in peak serum concentration and the area under the digoxin concentration-time curve, it decreased the time to digoxin peak (p = 0.01, p = 0.04, p = 0.01, respectively). No patient developed evidence of digoxin toxicity. Concomitant administration of captopril with digoxin increases serum digoxin concentration in patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "71": "Despite positive results in large scale chemoprevention trials, many physicians are unaware of the potential cancer preventive properties of drugs in common usage. The antioestrogen tamoxifen and the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib have been licensed in the USA for the chemoprevention of breast and colorectal cancers respectively in selected high risk individuals. Similarly, folate and retinol have been shown to decrease the incidence of colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin respectively in large scale intervention trials. Other retinoids have proved efficacious in the tertiary chemoprevention of cancers of the breast and head/neck. Epidemiological evidence also exists in favour of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors preventing certain cancers. Phytochemicals may represent less toxic alternatives to these agents. Although some of these drugs are available without prescription and most are not yet licensed for use in cancer chemoprevention, physicians and students of medicine should be aware of this accumulating evidence base.

Because carotid intima-media thickness is correlated with blood pressure and is predictive of future cardiovascular events, it can be used as an endpoint in intervention trials. Inclusion of carotid bifurcation in the measurements appears necessary for inferences about atherosclerosis. Several intervention studies using antihypertensive agents have been completed and others are ongoing. Placebo-controlled studies have shown beneficial effects of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers, and contradictory responses with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, but none of these studies have been performed in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, three studies comparing different antihypertensive agents have been completed, with some evidence favoring calcium antagonists over diuretics. Two studies are ongoing, and should be completed and published soon.",

The comparative effects of antihypertensive regimens based on different drug classes are less well established. The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration conducted a series of prospectively designed overviews of randomized trials that compared the effects of different drug classes on major cause-specific outcomes. These overviews found no differences between the effects of regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and those based on diuretics or b-blockers. There was limited evidence of small differences between regimens based on calcium antagonists and those based on diuretics or beta-blockers. The overviews of regimens based on calcium antagonists compared with those based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors recorded too few events to provide reliable findings. Over the next few years, the findings of ongoing trials and future cycles of overview analyses conducted by the Collaboration should substantially add to these data.", 
    "74": "Measurement of vascular compliance has assumed increasing importance as a marker of early disease of the vascular wall, a predictor of future vascular disease, and a way to monitor the effects of vasoactive agents on arterial wall stiffness. Vascular compliance can be estimated by several methods: measurement of the pulse pressure, or pulse pressure-stroke volume ratio; analysis of the systolic pulse wave augmentation index and the diastolic pulse wave contour; ultrasonic echo-tracking; and MRI. Because few comparative studies have been done, the physiologic significance of the measures of compliance obtained by each method is uncertain. Antihypertensive drugs may improve vascular compliance by reducing blood pressure, relaxing vascular smooth muscle, or promoting long-term effects on vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to improve vascular compliance in nearly all studies, suggesting a beneficial class effect independent of blood pressure reduction. Favorable changes in the vascular wall-lumen ratio of small vessels from subcutaneous gluteal biopsy specimens after treatment with ACE inhibitors and the persistence of improved vascular compliance after withdrawal of therapy indicate that these agents may produce long-term vascular remodeling. Although few studies have been done, angiotensin II receptor antagonists improve vascular compliance, possibly by blocking angiotensin II-mediated cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis via unopposed AT1 receptor stimulation. In contrast, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers have variable effects on vascular compliance, although beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity improve vascular compliance. Diuretics have little effect on vascular compliance beyond their blood pressure-lowering actions, except for spironolactone, which by improving vascular compliance may have contributed to the reduction in heart failure mortality seen in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study.", 
    "75": "Hypertension and high serum cholesterol levels are two of the most relevant risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. A combined increase in both risk factors has been reported in a significant proportion of patients with coronary artery disease. Statins are the most widely used drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia, and they interact with blood pressure control in different populations of hypertensive patients. A significant reduction in blood pressure associated with the use of statins has been described in patients with untreated hypertension and in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. The effect of statins on blood pressure control has also been reported in diabetic patients. The mechanisms responsible for the hypotensive effect seem to be largely independent of the effect of statins on lipid profile, and are probably related to their interaction with endothelial function or angiotensin II receptors. The capacity of statins to improve blood pressure control could be a useful consideration for an integrated approach to better prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "79": "Our results showed that a decrease in the size of the JGA is offset by antihypertensives. The negative correlation between the change in the luminal area of the afferent arteriole and mean diastolic blood pressure in groups 1 and 2 suggest that renal protection in antihypertensive treatment may be through a better constriction of the afferent arteriole protecting the glomerulus from systemic blood pressure.", 
    "80": "The blood pressure. renal function, baroreflex response of heart rate and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) pressor response were determined in conscious, normotensive, sodium-replete dogs that had received fosinopril. Oral administration of fosinopril at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day for 5 days decreased the systolic arterial pressure from 147.1 +/- 3 to 131.8 +/- 4.3 mmHg (p < 0.05) and the mean arterial pressure from 99.7+/- 3.9 to 87.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg (p < 0.05), while heart rate was unchanged. A study of the noradrenaline pressor response showed a tendency to alleviate the increased MAP by fosinopril treatment, although this was not significant. There were no significant changes in the sensitivity of the baroreflex response in HR, although the setpoint was reduced. After 7 days of fosinopril treatment, the glomerular filtration rate had increased by 18.5% (p < 0.05). The effective renal plasma flow tended to increase, leaving the filtration fraction unchanged. The renal vascular resistance was reduced by 11.3% (p < 0.05). Fosinopril caused a significant 41.5% increase in urinary excretion of Na+ (p < 0.05), along with an elevation of urinary excretion of K+ and Cl- . It is concluded that fosinopril can lower the blood pressure, reduce the noradrenaline pressor response and lower the cardiac baroreflex setpoint to noradrenaline. Oral administration of fosinopril for 7 days affects both the renal haemodynamics and electrolyte excretions in conscious, normotensive, sodium-replete dogs.",

The only significant risk factor change involved an increase in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, between 1992 and 1997 there was an increased in-hospital use of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolytics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins.

When the patient was instructed to stop taking that drug, her diarrhea promptly ceased, and the blood eosinophil level returned to normal.

    "91": "Heart failure treatment has markedly changed during the last few decades, with demonstration of benefit of afterload reduction by vasodilator therapy and introduction of the concept of the deleterious consequences of the neuro-hormonal compensatory stimulation. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, initially contra-indicated in heart failure, provide a marked reduction of mortality and morbidity in combination with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as demonstrated in many clinical trials. We performed a review of all clinical trials that compare beta-blockers vs. placebo in chronic heart failure. Beta-blockers with different pharmacological profiles have been tested, mainly metoprolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol and carvedilol. With progressive dose increment, tolerance of such treatment was generally good, left ventricular function improved, hospitalisations for heart failure were less frequent and mortality was reduced. The meta-analysis of the 16 randomised trials, with at least one death in each treatment group, provides a 24% relative risk reduction for such hospitalisations (95% CI=19%-29%) and 22% reduction for mortality (95% CI=16%-28%). Heterogeneity of beta-blocker effect for mortality was found and related to the non-significant benefit obtained in the BEST trial with bucindolol. When such a trial is excluded, the effect model analysis shows that relative risk reduction (beta-blocker induced benefit) is constant whatever the severity of the disease. The mechanism of beta-blocker induced benefit remains unclear, but is at least partly related to left ventricular function improvement and prevention of severe ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, beta-blocker treatment has become an established therapy for heart failure, in combination with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Complementary informations will be needed to clarify the mechanism of benefit and to define the best therapeutic strategy according to the individual characteristics of patients with heart failure.", 
    "92": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the first-choice drugs for treating hypertension and congestive heart disease. It has been reported, however, that these drugs could induce chronic cough and airway hyperresponsiveness. The aim of this work was to assess in pigs the effects of bradykinin and tachykinins on citric-acid-induced coughing after ACE inhibitor pretreatment. Coughing was induced by challenging pigs with an aerosol of 0.8 M citric acid over 15 min. Coughs were counted by a trained observer for 30 min. The animals underwent two cough induction tests two days apart (days 1 and 3), the first being taken as a control. All drugs were injected intravenously 30 min before the second challenge. In the control group, no difference was observed between days 1 and 3. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (7.5 and 15 microg/kg) caused the cough frequency to increase significantly. In contrast, a dose-related decrease was observed with Hoe140 (icatibant), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (0.5 and 1 mg/kg). When both drugs were administered simultaneously (15 microg/kg for enalapril and 1 mg/kg for Hoe140), a significant increase was observed as compared with the control value obtained on day 1. When enalapril was combined with the three tachykinin receptor antagonists SR 140333 (NK1 receptor antagonist), SR 48968 (NK2 receptor antagonist) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor antagonist), a significant decrease was observed as compared with control value obtained on day 1; the percentage of variation was also significantly different as compared with those observed in enalapril groups at both doses. These data suggest that ACE-inhibitor-induced enhancement of the cough reflex is mainly due to tachykinins and not to bradykinin in our pig model. Bradykinin, however, plays a major role in coughing induced by citric acid alone.",

    "98": "The benefits of blood pressure lowering, lipid lowering, and glycemic control on morbidity and mortality have been established in major long-term clinical trials. The most extensive information is available for diuretics or beta-blockers in hypertension, hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in dyslipidemia, and insulin or sulfonylureas in diabetes. Other drug classes provide similar improvements in blood pressure, lipid profile, and glycemic control, and thereby might be expected to provide comparable long-term benefits. As a result, national guidelines advocate treating patients aggressively in order to achieve control of blood pressure low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood glucose. The risks associated with drug treatment are generally class-specific. Among antidiabetic agents, sulfonylureas and insulin are associated with risk for severe hypoglycemia, metformin with risk for lactic acidosis, and troglitazone with risk for idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury. Similarly, widely used antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents are associated with risk for serious complications, such as angioedema with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, possible increased risk for myocardial infarction and cancer with calcium antagonists, and myositis and liver dysfunction with statins. Physicians must take an aggressive approach to patient management in order to achieve a level of disease control that optimally reduces risk for morbidity and mortality. Serious adverse events may occur rarely with most drug classes; these events can be minimized by appropriately monitoring or selecting patients for treatment.",

Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical hallmark of microangiopathy and often leads to end-stage renal failure. Significantly, microalbuminuria is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both the diabetic and non-diabetic population. In diabetic patients, it is also strongly associated with proliferative retinopathy, neuropathy and hypertension. Effective blood pressure reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy is known to reduce albuminuria, delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, postpone renal failure and improve survival. These benefits have been demonstrated with a variety of blood pressure-lowering agents, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Less is known about the renal effects of the newest class of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). Irbesartan is an AIIRA that provides antihypertensive efficacy comparable to ACE inhibitors but with superior tolerability.

Combination therapy aims to improve overall therapeutic efficacy while minimising adverse effects. In well-designed multicentre clinical trials, perindopril/indapamide at doses ranging from 2/0.625 to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving adequate blood pressure (BP) control. A similar reduction in supine BP was observed when combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was compared with losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in 24-hour ambulatory BP were also seen with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, response and normalisation rates were significantly higher with combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan monotherapy. Combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day therapy effectively reduced BP in elderly patients aged 65 to 85 years to a significantly greater extent than either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Supine BP was also normalised in approximately two-thirds of patients in a small noncomparative trial in patients with hypertension and renal impairment. Low-dose perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical trials; the most common adverse events were headache and cough. Hypokalaemia, associated with the use of diuretics, occurred with a higher incidence with combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day therapy than with either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day has shown efficacy in well designed comparative trials with atenolol, losartan and irbesartan including elderly patients and patients with renal impairment. Studies comparing this dosage of perindopril/ indapamide with other combination therapies would be beneficial in allowing the place of perindopril/indapamide to be more accurately determined.

In experimental hypertension, PAC function was up-regulated in the established phase of high blood pressure. This association of altered PAC function and elevated arterial pressure suggests that PAC function is regulated by alterations in blood pressure. In the present study, we electrophysiologically investigated PAC function in intact endothelium of aorta (EA) and mesenteric artery (EMA) from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), SHRSP after 4 weeks of treatment with quinaprilat (10 mg/kg/day), and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In untreated SHRSP and WKY rats, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 201+/-3 mm Hg and 142+/-3 mm Hg, respectively. In quinaprilat-treated SHRSP, SBP was lowered to 135+/-5 mm Hg. Apparent PAC density (percentage of patches with PAC activity) in EA of untreated SHRSP (63.7%+/-7.3%) was 2.4-fold higher than in WKY rats (26.0%+/-5.0%). In contrast, no significant PAC up-regulation was detected in EMA of SHRSP (15.7%+/-4.2%) compared with WKY rats (12.0%+/-3.9%). In EA of quinaprilat-treated normotensive SHRSP, PAC density (27.1%+/-5.2%) was lowered to levels found in normotensive WKY rats. Unitary conductance and pressure sensitivity of PAC were not altered in either hypertensive or normotensive rats. Taken together, hypertension-induced increases of endothelial PAC density can be completely reversed by antihypertensive therapy. The PAC up-regulation in EA was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism to enhance Ca2+-influx and subsequently the synthesis of vasodilatory factors. This mechanism is missing in EMA of SHRSP, which might contribute to high blood pressure in this rat model of severe genetic hypertension.", 
    "109": "To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks. Patients were then crossed-over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the final day of each period. The agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches: Subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders using as a threshold an arbitrary level of response (ABP fall > or = 10 mm Hg systolic or > or = 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs. Disagreement between the two drugs in the responders-nonresponders classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to one of the drugs only. Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP (mean difference 4.7+/-8.1/3.3+/-5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Disagreement in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion). Significant correlations were found between the responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01). We conclude that in more than one third of hypertensive subjects, the BP response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to AT1R antagonism and vice versa. These data suggest that there are differences between these two drug classes that are not only of theoretical but also of practical significance.",

In 2504 unselected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 63+/-10 years) blood pressure, cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and during a treatment period of 1 year with the ACE inhibitor cilazapril by primary care physicians. The average dose of cilazapril was 2.5 mg/day. Outcome measures were blood pressure, serum creatinine, proteinuria (dip stick), HbA1c levels, evaluation of edema, and exertional dyspnea. In the study cohort, systolic blood pressure decreased by 24+/-17 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 12+/-11 mm Hg. An increase in serum creatinine (> 0.2 mg/dL) occurred more frequently in patients with than in those without renal involvement (19% v 7%; P < .05). Serum creatinine decreased more frequently in patients with renal involvement than in those without (26%+/-4% v 12%+/-3.8%; P < .05). Overall renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy (n = 318) improved (2.1+/-1.6 mg/dL v 1.7+/-1.4 mg/dL; P < .05).

Scores for edema formation and exertional dyspnea improved as well (P < .01).

    "111": "Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the important influence of ethnicity and dietary salt on the antihypertensive efficacy of drugs that block the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are a new therapeutic entity that have not been widely studied in African American hypertensives, either alone, or in combination with other therapies such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We performed a pilot, prospective, open label, randomized design clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan (160 mg once a day) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive African Americans (n = 88) on a low salt (100 mEq Na+/day) for 2 weeks and the same diet supplemented by 100 mEq Na+ for 4 weeks. After this evaluation, while continuing the Na+ supplementation, patients were randomized to valsartan 320 mg/day (n = 28), or the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day (n = 30), or benazepril 20 mg/day to the valsartan 160 mg/day for an additional 6 weeks. Valsartan (160 mg/day) lowered blood pressure significantly in African American patients on both low salt (-6.4/-4.8 mm Hg: P < .001) and a high salt diet (-4.9/-3.8 mm Hg: P = .01). The high salt diet attenuated the antihypertensive effect slightly (1.6/1.3 mm Hg, P = not significant). When comparing the efficacy of the three randomized therapeutic regimens while on the Na+ supplement, the valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was the most effective therapy with an incremental reduction in blood pressure of -10.5/-6.9 mm Hg (P < .01), compared to valsartan 160 mg/day alone. Doubling the dose of valsartan to 320 mg incrementally lowered blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg (P = not significant). The least effective approach was adding benazepril 20 mg/day to valsartan 160 mg/day with no incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reduction of only 1.7 mm Hg (P = not significant). We conclude that in our open label pilot study, the antihypertensive activity of valsartan is not significantly attenuated by supplemented salt diet in hypertensive African Americans. Moreover, adding a low dose of HCTZ appears to be the most effective strategy in enhancing the antihypertensive activity of this angiotensin II receptor blocker in contrast to either doubling the dose or adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.",

To evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on cardiac arrhythmias (CA) and transient episodes of myocardial ischemia (TEMI), we studied 46 hypertensive patients with LVH, divided into four groups randomly treated with enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), atenolol, or verapamil (SR-V) for 6 months. Office blood pressure and office heart rate values were recorded, in basal conditions, after 1 and 6 months of treatment, and all patients underwent echocardiography, electrocardiographic Holter monitoring, and stress testing. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure, whereas left ventricular mass index was reduced by atenolol, enalapril, and SR-V, but not by HCTZ. Treatment induced a significant reduction in the number of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (35 v 15, P < .034, and 28 v 8, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P < .008). The number of patients with ventricular arrhythmias was also reduced (32 v 16 considering all groups, P < .08, and 24 v 9, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P < .04). The number of TEMI during Holter monitoring significantly decreased from 47 to 23 (P = .043) in all patients, and from 39 to 14 (P = .013) excluding patients treated with HCTZ. In all groups, irrespective of treatment, a reduction of blood pressure, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure/heart rate product measured by exercise stress test was observed. The present study shows that in hypertensive patients with LVH, antihypertensive treatment with atenolol, enalapril and SR-V reduces LVH and decreases the prevalence of CA and TEMI. Treatment with HCTZ during the 6-month study did not alter LVH and did not appear to reduce CA and TEMI.",

Third, the dependency of the target variable (ICER) on random variables was described in a simulation. The cost for chronic dialysis had by far the greatest impact on the target variable, which was 28 times greater than the impact of clinical effectiveness of ramipril, i.e. the number of PYCDA. There were net savings per PYCDA with ramipril treatment after 1, 2 and 3 years: 95% of the 10,000 simulation steps resulted in savings of between DM69 500 and D94,600 per PYCDA after 3 years.",

Vascular hypertrophy with collagen deposition and increased stiffness is found in large arteries, whereas in small arteries, smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, and there is no net growth of the vascular wall, particularly in milder forms of hypertension. Hypertrophic remodeling and increased small artery stiffness may be found in more severe hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in large or smaller vessels in a variable percentage of patients, particularly in presence of other risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, and advanced atherosclerosis. In clinical trials, 1-year treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, and long-acting calcium channel blockers corrected small artery structure and endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients, whereas beta-adrenergic receptor blockers did not. Improved outcomes in hypertensive patients demonstrated in recent trials with some but not others of these agents could be a consequence, at least in part, of vascular protection offered by some antihypertensive agents.",

Specific angiotensin II receptor subtype AT1 blockers offer an alternative to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension, as the incidence of side-effects may be lower. This open-label study was designed to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of the AT1 receptor blocker, eprosartan, in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg and < or = 114 mmHg). 706 patients from 55 centres in the USA and three centres in Canada were randomised to receive once-daily eprosartan (400-800 mg) alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The study consisted of five periods: screening (day 1), run-in (2-4 weeks), titration (3-15 weeks), maintenance (12-24 months) and follow-up (5-7 days). Safety evaluations included incidences of adverse events and changes in laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiograms. Efficacy assessments included effects on blood pressure (BP) and fasting concentrations of lipids and glucose. The maintenance period was completed at 12 months by 583 (83.3%) patients and at 24 months by 311 (44.4%) patients. In total, 396 (56.1%) patients completed the study according to protocol. Once-daily eprosartan was well tolerated either alone or in combination with HCTZ, irrespective of the study dose administered. Patients treated with eprosartan had a safety profile similar to that reported in short-term placebo-controlled studies. The most frequently reported adverse event was upper respiratory tract infection. The incidence of adverse events was not affected by age or race, and, although events increased with the addition of HCTZ, they were generally not severe. The beneficial effect on BP was maintained throughout treatment. For the majority of patients, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels remained within the reference levels at all doses and timepoints. In summary, eprosartan provides reliable blood pressure control in a high proportion of patients, with a safety profile similar to that seen with placebo in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.

    "145": "The potentiation of kinin actions represents a cardioprotective property of ACE inhibitors. Although a clear contribution to this effect is related to the inhibition of bradykinin (BK) breakdown, the high efficacy of potentiation and the ability of ACE inhibitors to provoke a B(2)-receptor-mediated response even after receptor desensitization has also triggered hypotheses concerning additional mechanisms of kinin potentiation. The application of kinin analogues with enhanced metabolic stability for the demonstration of degradation-independent mechanisms of potentiation, however, has yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, the relation between the susceptibility of B(2)-agonists to ACE and the potentiation of their actions by ACE inhibitors was investigated with the use of minimally modified kinin derivatives that varied in their degree of ACE resistance. The B(2)-agonists BK, D-Arg-[Hyp(3)]-BK, [Hyp,(3) Tyr(Me)(8)]-BK, [DeltaPhe(5)]-BK, [D-NMF(7)]-BK, and [Phe(8)psi(CH(2)-NH)Arg(9)]-BK were tested for degradation by purified rabbit ACE and for their potency in contracting the endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular vein in the absence and presence of ramiprilat. Purified ACE degraded D-Arg-[Hyp(3)]-BK and [Hyp,(3) Tyr(Me)(8)]-BK at 81% and 71% of BK degradation activity, respectively, whereas other peptides were highly ([DeltaPhe(5)]-BK) or completely ([D-NMF(7)]-BK, [Phe(8)psi(CH(2)-NH)Arg(9)]-BK) resistant. The EC(50) of BK-induced venoconstriction (1.15+/-0.2 nmol/L) was reduced by a factor of 5.7 in the presence of ramiprilat. Likewise, D-Arg-[Hyp(3)]-BK and [Hyp,(3) Tyr(Me)(8)]-BK were both significantly potentiated by a factor of 4.4, whereas the activities of the other agonists were not affected. Ramiprilat exerted no influence on the maximum contraction induced by any of the agonists. It is concluded that the potentiation of kinin analogues during ACE inhibition correlates quantitatively with the susceptibility of each substance to degradation by ACE. As such, no evidence of degradation-independent potentiating actions of ACE inhibitors could be obtained.", 
    "146": "ACE inhibitors block B(2) receptor desensitization, thereby potentiating bradykinin beyond blocking its hydrolysis. Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) also acts as an ACE inhibitor and, in addition, may stimulate bradykinin release via angiotensin II type 2 receptors. In this study we compared the bradykinin-potentiating effects of Ang-(1-7), quinaprilat, and captopril. Porcine coronary arteries, obtained from 32 pigs, were mounted in organ baths, preconstricted with prostaglandin F(2alpha), and exposed to quinaprilat, captopril, Ang-(1-7), and/or bradykinin. Bradykinin induced complete relaxation (pEC(50)=8.11+/-0.07, mean+/-SEM), whereas quinaprilat, captopril, and Ang-(1-7) alone were without effect. Quinaprilat shifted the bradykinin curve to the left in a biphasic manner: a 5-fold shift at concentrations that specifically block the C-domain (0.1 to 1 nmol/L) and a 10-fold shift at concentrations that block both domains. Captopril and Ang-(1-7) monophasically shifted the bradykinin curve to the left, by a factor of 10 and 5, respectively. A 5-fold shift was also observed when Ang-(1-7) was combined with 0.1 nmol/L quinaprilat. Repeated exposure of porcine coronary arteries to 0.1 micromol/L bradykinin induced B(2) receptor desensitization. The addition of 10 micromol/L quinaprilat or Ang-(1-7) to the bath, at a time when bradykinin alone was no longer able to induce relaxation, fully restored the relaxant effects of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 or 2 receptor blockade did not affect any of the observed effects of Ang-(1-7). In conclusion, Ang-(1-7), like quinaprilat and captopril, potentiates bradykinin by acting as an ACE inhibitor. Bradykinin potentiation is maximal when both the ACE C- and N-terminal domains are inhibited. The inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) are limited to the ACE C-domain, raising the possibility that Ang-(1-7) synergistically increases the blood pressure-lowering effects of N-domain-specific ACE inhibitors.", 
    "147": "There are between 2 and 13 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent reports suggest that their treatment is currently suboptimal. To further investigate this issue, patterns of practice for the treatment of patients with CKD who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in New Mexico were analyzed. Among the >200,000 patients who were enrolled in the health maintenance organization between 1994 and 1997, a cohort of 1658 patients who exhibited at least two gender-specific, elevated creatinine concentrations (Cr), separated by at least 90 d, were identified. The proportions of patients with Cr values of <2.0, 2.0 to 2.9, 3.0 to 3.9, and > or =4.0 mg/dl were 73, 17, 3, and 7%, respectively. The majority of patients were treated by a primary care physician until Cr values reached 3.0 mg/dl, at which time a nephrologist was consulted. Care tended to be transferred to the nephrologist when the Cr reached 4.0 mg/dl. Only 7.4% of patients received erythropoietin (EPO). Use of EPO increased as Cr increased. EPO was unlikely to be prescribed unless the patient had visited a nephrologist. Fewer than one half of all patients with CKD and fewer than 20% of patients with CKD with Cr values of > or =4.0 mg/dl received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Nephrologists were not more likely to prescribe ACEI than were primary care physicians. Diabetic patients were more likely to receive ACEI than were nondiabetic patients, but ACEI use was quite low even among diabetic patients with CKD. The average number of hospitalizations per patient-year increased as Cr increased and was more than twice as high for patients with Cr values of > or =4.0 mg/dl, compared with those with Cr values of <2.0 mg/dl. The reasons for hospitalization were more likely to be related to comorbidities than to CKD itself, however. There are many opportunities to improve the care of patients with CKD. Better adherence to practices known to be of clinical benefit for patients with CKD not only will improve patient outcomes but also may reduce the costs of care. Providers, policy-makers, and payers should view CKD as a major public health problem and initiate innovative programs to address this growing patient population.", 
    "148": "The treatment of hypertension has become increasingly refined during the past decade. Although a variety of antihypertensive medication classes exist, drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin axis have gained a favored position in the treatment of hypertension and its attendant end-organ complications. In this regard, two drug classes, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are most commonly used. Angiotensin receptor blockers have proven highly effective in the management of hypertension. This class is fairly heterogeneous with individual class members having somewhat distinctive pharmacologic properties. Eprosartan is a recent entry into this class. This compound compares favorably to others in this class relative to blood pressure reduction. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that this compound may uniquely interrupt the sympathetic nervous system and thereby preferentially reduce systolic blood pressure.", 
    "149": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of both hypertension and renal complications involves an intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors. In the case of diabetic nephropathy, the genes governing the RAS are an obvious choice in the search for contributing factors. These genetic components can reflect polygenetic mechanisms or a major gene effect. During recent years, polymorphisms of the genes governing both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen have been studied, with varying outcomes. Investigation of the interaction between ACE inhibition and the glycemic state yields equally interesting results. In healthy subjects on a high salt diet, the hyperglycemic state produced significant increases in renal plasma flow (RPF) in response to administration of the ACE inhibitor captopril. A similar study using the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) eprosartan demonstrated again that the agent had little effect on RPF in subjects in a normal glycemic state; however, when administered during a hyperglycemic state, a marked increase in RPF occurred. Implications for the prevention of nephropathy and endstage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetics with hypertension are significant. Until recently, pharmacologic intervention in the RAS has focused on the ACE step, with documented success being reported in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy and ESRD using ACE inhibitors. Despite this success, data suggest that greater therapeutic benefit might be accomplished by blocking the deleterious effects of angiotensin II at the receptor site. From a renoprotective perspective, the ARB appear to have tremendous potential in the management of hypertension.", 
    "150": "Improvements in the death rate from coronary heart disease and in the control of hypertension have leveled off in recent years, reversing a trend toward steady improvement that began in 1972. Of the roughly 20% of Americans who suffer from hypertension, only 29% achieve adequate control (<140/90 mm Hg) with treatment and nearly half receive no treatment at all. Poor adherence to therapy doubtless plays a key role in this failure. As a major cause of poor adherence, tolerability becomes an extremely important element in any discussion of effective antihypertensive treatment. Despite their efficacy in treating hypertension, diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all been associated with numerous side effects, including increased serum lipid levels, insulin resistance, and edema. With the introduction of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, patients were able to achieve blood pressure goals with fewer side effects. These agents, however, cause an irritating cough in up to 19% of patients. A newer class of drugs, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), have similar effects to the ACE inhibitors, but their highly selective nature produces even fewer side effects. Eprosartan is a structurally unique ARB. Like the other ARB, this promising new agent has a side effect profile similar to placebo, and its response rate rivals or exceeds that of enalapril. Although it remains to be seen whether the ARB can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, preliminary data from the Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) trial appear to be promising.", 
    "151": "The significance of cardiac chymase after myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated using a hamster model of MI. At 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after MI, tissues were removed for measurements of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase activities. The mean infarct size 3 days after left coronary artery ligation was 47.3 +/- 5.9% of the left ventricle circumference. The ratio of left ventricle weight to body weight was significantly increased from 3 days after MI. The level of plasma renin activity in the MI hamsters was significantly increased at the early phase of MI (1-3 days), while no significant changes in plasma ACE activity were observed. The ACE activity in the infarcted left ventricle was significantly increased starting from 3 days after MI and this increase was sustained up to 28 days. The chymase activity in the infarcted left ventricle was significantly increased starting from 1 day after MI and this increase was sustained up to 56 days. The number of chymase-positive mast cells in the infarcted left ventricle was significantly higher than in the sham group 3 and 7 days after operation. Treatment with an angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan cilexetil, 10 mg/kg per day) starting 3 days before the induction of MI significantly reduced the mortality rate during 14 days of observation following MI, whereas treatment with an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/kg per day) did not. A significant improvement in hemodynamics (maximal negative and positive rates of pressure development, left ventricular systolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure, mean arterial blood pressure) was observed by the treatment with candesartan cilexetil, but not with lisinopril, 3 and 14 days after MI. These results suggested that Ang II produced by chymase may participate in the pathophysiologic state after MI in hamsters.", 
    "152": "Increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) regulate the functions of the nephron, the vasculature, and the renin-containing juxtaglomerular granular cells. As increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system can also influence nephron and vascular function, it is important to understand the interactions between RSNA and the renin-angiotensin system in the control of renal function. These interactions can be intrarenal, that is, the direct (via specific innervation) and indirect (via angiotensin II) contributions of increased RSNA to the regulation of renal function. The effects of increased RSNA on renal function are attenuated when the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed or antagonized with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-type AT1 receptor antagonists. The effects of intrarenal administration of angiotensin II are attenuated following renal denervation. These interactions can also be extrarenal, that is, in the central nervous system, wherein RSNA and its arterial baroreflex control are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to the circumventricular organs, the permeable blood-brain barrier of which permits interactions with circulating angiotensin II, there are interactions at sites behind the blood-brain barrier that depend on the influence of local angiotensin II. The responses to central administration of angiotensin II type AT1 receptor antagonists, into the ventricular system or microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla, are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system produced by physiological changes in dietary sodium intake. Similar modulation is observed in pathophysiological models wherein activity of both the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems is increased (e.g., congestive heart failure). Thus, both renal and extrarenal sites of interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and RSNA are involved in influencing the neural control of renal function.",

    "162": "A cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy of 25-40% has been documented after duration of diabetes of at least 25 years in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause (25-44%) of end-stage renal failure in Europe, the United States and Japan. Until the early 1980s, no renoprotective treatment was available for use in diabetic nephropathy. Death occurred on average 5-7 years after the onset of persistent proteinuria. It should be recalled that development of treatment modalities occurred in reverse order: in the early 1980s, antihypertensive treatment of diabetic nephropathy was introduced, and in the early 1990s, primary and secondary prevention with improved glycaemic control and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The two main treatment strategies for primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy are improved glycaemic control and blood pressure lowering, particularly using drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Megatrials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of both the above-mentioned treatment modalities. Secondary prevention, that is, treatment modalities applied to diabetic patients with high risk of development of diabetic nephropathy (e.g. those with microalbuminuria) has been documented, applying angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Furthermore, improved metabolic control reduces the risk of progression. In special cases (such as pancreas transplantation) even reversal of diabetic glomerular lesions has been documented. Antihypertensive treatment of patients with overt nephropathy induces a reduction in albuminuria, a reduction in the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate, delays development of end-stage renal failure and improves survival. Many potential treatment modalities in preventing and treating diabetic nephropathy are presently being evaluated.", 
    "163": "A large number of randomized controlled trials have been published over the past decade. The earlier ones established the benefits of low-dose diuretic-based therapy. The more recent ones have documented the equal overall effectiveness of therapy based on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a calcium antagonist.

For the rapidly increasing population of diabetic hypertensive patients, similar conclusions are obvious, with the caveat that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should usually be the initial choice, with diuretics and calcium antagonists usually needed to accomplish adequate control. There are no concerns about the use of calcium antagonists in diabetic patients.",

There were no differences between the 2 groups in patient characteristics, ACE gene polymorphism, pulmonary function, or bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Control of hypertension was the primary end point; new cough detected by self-administrated questionnaire and an increase in cough frequency by visual analog scale were the second end point.

Historical controls who never received an ACE inhibitor were selected (matched for age and Cr) from a database of patients reaching ESRD between 1993 and 1998, with a primary diagnosis of DN. Patients enrolled (N = 6) were started on enalapril at 5 mg per day with the dose titrated upward to a blood pressure (BP) goal of 140/90 mm Hg. The enalapril group tended to be older than controls (58.8 vs 51.5 years of age, P = ns) and had had their diabetes longer (18.5 vs 13.2 years of age, P = ns). At baseline, there were no significant differences in blood pressure, blood, urea, nitrogen (BUN), Cr, or BMI between groups. One of the 6 treated with enalapril had the agent stopped due to hyperkalemia. Five of 6 in the enalapril group reached ESRD, but there was no significant difference between the groups in the time it took to reach this stage (69.5 +/- 13.8 weeks vs 92.0 +/- 21.4 weeks, enalapril group vs control group, P = ns). In the enalapril patient who did not reach ESRD, the Cr level increased from 2.9 to 3.8 mg/dl in approximately 3 years.

In the present study, the effects of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on ACE in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was studied. TNF-alpha (0.1-10 ng/ml) and IL-1beta (0.1-10 ng/ml) caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the amount of ACE in intact endothelial cell membranes and decreased levels of ACE mRNA. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta activated p44/42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in HUVECs; this was inhibited by the specific inhibitors of these kinases, PD98059 and SB202190, respectively. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (5 microM) or hydrocortisone (5 microM) partly reversed the suppression of ACE by TNF-alpha or IL-1beta, whereas the specific p44/42 MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (40 microM) was without effect. Vascular endothelial growth factor (1 ng/ml) caused an increase in membrane-bound ACE and ACE mRNA levels which was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with TNF-alpha (1 ng/ml) or IL-1beta (1 ng/ml). In summary, the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta downregulated ACE in cultured human endothelial cells, which effect was probably mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. Downregulation of ACE by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta locally in the vascular wall may be a counterbalancing mechanism in inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis, leading to decreased production of angiotensin II and accumulation of bradykinin.", 
    "180": "This study was designed to analyze the pathophysiological role of the endogenous endothelin (ET) system and the therapeutic approach to congestive heart failure (CHF) with ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonists in a canine CHF model. After 3 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacing (240 beats/min), concentrations of immunoreactive ET-1 in dogs increased approximately 2-fold in plasma and in the left and right ventricles but not in the lung. There were no meaningful changes in the density and affinity of total ET receptors, or in the ratio of ET(A) to ET(B) receptors. To clarify the functional role of endogenous ET, we examined the effects of acute injection of J-104132 (1 and 3 mg/kg i.v.), an ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist, on cardiovascular and renal function in dogs with CHF. Compared with vehicle, J-104132 at both doses significantly decreased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and increased cardiac output (CO) and renal blood flow. J-104132 had no effects on heart rate and cardiac contractility. In addition, we examined whether J-104132 has an additive effect in the presence of enalaprilat. J-104132 (1 mg/kg i.v.) administered after enalaprilat (0.05 mg/kg i.v.) induced further decreases in MAP, PCWP and PAP, and further increases in CO, resulting in further decreases in total peripheral resistance. These results indicate that the endogenous ET system is exaggerated in CHF and has a detrimental effect on cardiac function. Therefore, J-104132 given alone or as combination therapy may play a beneficial role in the treatment of CHF in humans.", 
    "181": "Betablockers have been convincingly shown to reduce total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of hypertensive diabetic patients. In diabetic patients, after myocardial infarction, these agents confer a twice as high protective effect when compared to non-diabetic patients. However, most paradoxically, betablocking agents are used less frequently in diabetes. Control of hypertension is insufficient in most of the diabetic patients, probably because a combination of antihypertensive agents including betablockers is frequently needed to sufficiently control blood pressure but is not used in these patients. The fear of betablocker-associated side effects in diabetes may be partly responsible for the frequent antihypertensive mono-therapy and the resulting poor quality of blood pressure control among diabetic patients.", 
    "182": "We have performed an analysis of the literature to assess whether possible adverse metabolic effects, a higher risk of hypoglycaemia or less nephroprotective effects of beta1-selective betablocking agents could justify the reticence in prescribing these antihypertensive agents to diabetic patients.", 
    "183": "A thorough review of the literature does not indicate that beta1-selective betablocking agents have important adverse effects on glucose metabolism, prolong hypoglycaemia or mask hypoglycaemic symptoms. In diabetic nephropathy, betablockers are as nephroprotective as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

After 40 days of experimentation, the heart and the ventricles were measured. The optical disector was used for the calculation of numerical density of the cardiomyocytes (Nv[c]). The left ventricular myocytes number (N[c]) was calculated as the product of Nv[c] and the left ventricular myocardium volume (LVMV) that was determined by using the Scherle's method. In the L-NAME group the blood pressure (BP) had a significant weekly increment. In the enalapril and the verapamil groups, BP increased in the first two weeks, but decreased in the following weeks. The LVMV increased in the L-NAME rats and decreased in the enalapril and verapamil animals. The Nv[c] and N[c] decreased in the L-NAME rats but the verapamil and enalapril treatments maintained the Nv[c] close to the control group. In conclusion, the left ventricular hypertrophy and the significant decrease of the left ventricular cardiomyocyte number caused by the NO synthesis inhibition are efficiently prevented with the use of enalapril and verapamil.",

Right heart infarct was induced in twelve young swine and losartan was given in a bolus intravenous dose one hr later to five animals, while seven animals served as controls. Haemodynamics were then followed for one hr at 15 min intervals. Losartan was subsequently shown to decrease central venous pressure and wedge pressure, while cardiac output, left ventricle stroke work and stroke volume all showed improvement. Compared to the control animals, pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance and systemic pressures were unaffected by the drug, as was heart rate. The use of losartan shortly after right heart infarct reduced both right and left heart preload as well as inducing an improvement in cardiac performance. At the same time, systemic pressures and heart rate were maintained. We conclude that an inhibition of angiotensin II action may be a benefit in the treatment of right heart failure symptoms during the first hours after right heart infarct.",

Doxazosin combined with the same low-dose ACE inhibitor reduced left ventricular mass and hydroxyproline without potentiating the hypotensive effect of doxazosin. By contrast, the combination of beta-1 antagonist with the low-dose ACE inhibitor reduced pressure, unlike either agent alone. Aortic weight index was significantly reduced only by doxazosin whether when used alone or with the ACE inhibitor.

Linearity range for perindopril and indapamide was 5.0-70.0 and 8.0-35.0 microg ml(-1). In the second method, the first derivative spectrophotometry with a zero-crossing technique of measurement is used for the simultaneous quantitative determination of perindopril and indapamide in binary mixtures without previous separation step. Linear calibration graphs of first derivative values at 225.7 and 255.4 nm for perindopril and indapamide, respectively. The third method is based on ratio derivative spectrophotometry, the amplitudes in the first derivative of the ratio spectra at 226.5 and at 255.3 nm were selected to determine perindopril and indapamide in the binary mixture.

    "210": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has an established role in the management of hypertension, heart failure, patients post-myocardial infarction and renal impairment. The mechanism of action of angiotensin II antagonists offers the potential of more complete blockade of angiotensin II, selective inhibition of the AT1 receptor and specificity for the renin-angiotensin system. Whether these mechanistic differences enhance the clinical potential of these drugs remains to be established. Preliminary evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have similar antihypertensive, haemodynamic and nephroprotective effects. Several major outcome trials with angiotensin II antagonists are underway and these should determine the eventual clinical potential of this class. Early results suggest equivalence with ACE inhibitors but further direct comparisons are needed. Angiotensin II antagonists have one undisputed advantage--excellent tolerability. Given the continuing under-use of ACE inhibitors because of concerns about adverse effects, this property alone may prove decisive in ensuring that angiotensin II antagonists yield the full clinical potential from blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "211": "Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of terminal renal failure in all Western nations due to a steady increase of patients with the renal complication of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. A number of modifiable risk factors have been identified that predispose to and/or accelerate renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. Among these, the level of blood pressure, even in the range of normotension according to World Health Organization or Joint National Committee definition, is closely related to the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy. This has been documented in patients with incipient (microalbuminuric) and in patients with manifest (proteinuric) diabetic renal disease. Consequently, the treatment of even normotensive diabetics has been recommended once microalbuminuria is present, and blood pressure values in the low normal range should be aimed for. The selection of antihypertensive agents is also important, however, since a 'renoprotective effect' has been documented for drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Recently, a new class of drugs that selectively inhibits this system by specifically targeting the angiotensin II receptor has been developed. These angiotensin II subtype 1-receptor antagonists are efficacious antihypertensive agents with a side-effect profile similar to placebo. Evidence for a renoprotective effect in patients with diabetic nephropathy from a large controlled clinical trial is still awaited, but data generated in animal experiments and in smaller clinical trials are encouraging. Currently, these drugs are a valuable substitute for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients who experience side effects such as intractable cough.",

This study's aim was to determine whether ACE inhibitors influence the metabolism of glomerular cells in addition to their known hemodynamic effects. Streptozotocin diabetic rats were treated with lisinopril (DLis 1.5 mg/l water), or hydralazine (Dhyd, 50 mg/l water) over 4 weeks. Untreated diabetic rats (DC) and non-diabetic rats (C) served as controls. After four weeks of treatment, urinary excretion of albumin, blood pressure and metabolic control (Glyc-Hb) were measured. After treatment glomeruli were isolated and homogenized, and beta-NAG and total proteolytic activity against azocasein were measured. Glycated hemoglobin levels were similar in all diabetic groups (DC, 12%, Dhyd, 10%; DLis 11%). Blood pressure of DLis rats (79 +/- 3 mmHg) and DHyd rats (46 +/- 2 mmHg) was lower than that of DC rats (111 +/- 3 mmHg). Urinary albumin excretion of diabetic groups was lowest in DLis. Diabetic rats showed a decrease in glomerular beta-NAG (10 vs. 60.5 U/g protein) and total proteolytic activity against azocasein (148 vs. 170 U/mg protein hour) compared to non-diabetic rats. Lisinopril increased beta-NAG (30 vs. 14 U/g protein) and total proteolytic activity (160.5 vs. 141.5 U/mg protein hour) compared with hydralazine. Our study confirms that the nephro-protective effect of ACE inhibitors is partially due to modulatory effects on the metabolism of basement membrane proteins.",

    "219": "Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for microangiopathic diabetic complications and associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An intensified antihypertensive treatment reduces microangiopathic complications and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Even in normotensive type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, the treatment with ACE inhibitors may prevent the later development of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment with ACE inhibitors increases the concentrations of bradykinin, which is responsible for the side effects such as cough and urticaria in some patients. On the other hand, bradykinin may have beneficial intrarenal effects decreasing the intraglomerular pressure. The novel angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists do not influence the bradykinin concentrations and seem to be tolerated by patients suffering from chronic cough with ACE inhibitor therapy. It is still unclear whether the different intrarenal effects are of clinical relevance in the long-term treatment of diabetic patients. In studies with diabetic animals the nephroprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are comparable. It was shown that glucose and lipid metabolism is not influenced by treatment with angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists. Further compared to Felodipine the reduction of urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) was more pronounced by Losartane in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Short-term studies directly comparing the renal effects of ACE inhibitors with AT II type 1 receptor antagonists revealed similar reduction of blood pressure and albumin excretion rate in patients with diabetic nephropathy, so a combination of both substances might be useful. Data from ongoing long-term trials are still missing. Further, it is unknown whether different phenotypes of the ACE gene (DD, II polymorphism) require different therapeutic options. In conclusion, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists is well-tolerated and has no adverse effects on metabolic control in diabetic patients. The beneficial effect on microangiopathic complications however has to be proven in randomized long-term studies in direct comparison with ACE inhibitors, which were clearly shown to delay the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "220": "ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists increase the effective renal plasma flow dose dependently, whereas glomerular filtration rate does not change. Both substances reduce dose dependently arterial blood pressure, glomerular capillary pressure and proteinuria and are probably comparably renoprotective due to haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic (e.g. antiproliferative) effects. These data indicate that the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are the results of inhibition of angiotensin II and not due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Several studies suggest an additive renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, controlled clinical studies are lacking. Experimental data suggest that the combination of AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers or treatment with ACE inhibitors reduce more effectively inflammatory cell infiltration into the kidney than angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists alone. Long-term clinical trials using angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are needed before these substances can be recommended as comparably renoprotective as ACE inhibitors.", 
    "221": "Angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) have long been the only possibility to influence the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and its often fatal influences in heart failure. In the last few years specific blockers of the angiotensin 1 receptor (AT I blockers) offered a new possibility for this therapeutic target. In contrast to ACE inhibitors AT I blockers are relatively new and, therefore, few data on heart failure are available. The first head-to-head studies that compared AT I blockers and ACE-inhibitors and their effect on mortality did not show a reduced mortality in the AT I blocker groups. Based on the available data AT I blockers should be used in heart failure patients who are intolerant of ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "222": "Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARB) are equally effective but better tolerated than all the other blood pressure lowering agents. The reason, why they are not subscribed as first line drugs for uncomplicated hypertension, is the higher price for these products. What the real difference in costs is, remains unclear because calculations are missing to what extent lesser controls of therapy would shift the balance in favour of the ARBs. For other indications than hypertension, but often associated with that condition, be it per se or as a consequence of it, the effects of the ARBs are studied in large trials these days. For some of them the benefit, which has been proven for ACE inhibitors, is not yet established for the ARBs, but evidence emerges that they are also useful in the treatment of cardiac failure, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic and other kinds of nephropathy. A large percentage of hypertensive patients can be treated effectively with ARBs without considerable side effects, thus increasing adherence and minimizing the necessity of safety controls.",

    "225": "In non-smokers the underlying causes for chronic persistent cough (CPC) e.g. chronic cough without diagnostic chest X-ray or pulmonary function test--are usually as follows: several common upper airways diseases, bronchial (cough type) asthma, gastrooesophageal reflux or treatment with an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme)--inhibitor. In 10% of CPC however the cause remains uncertain. We report a 30 year old non-smoker with severe coughing and repeated vomiting for two months. No laboratory or technical data could be collected suggestive of a common cause of CPC: Upper airways disease, bronchial flow limitation or hyperresponsiveness, ACE inhibitor medication, B. pertussis infection, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (by 24 hours pH-probe) were ruled out. Fiberbronchoscopic findings remained unremarkable, except for the bronchial biopsy specimen, which showed moderate eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa and marked thickening of the subepithelial layer. Since the cough was non-productive, sputum induction with 3 ml nebulised 3% NaCl solution was performed. 28% of the granulocytes were eosinophil stained. A low quality morning sputum (< 1 ml) showed 21% eosinophilia. Thus, the diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis was established. 400 micrograms budesonide dry powder inhalations b.i.d. for one week resolved the cough, treatment was stopped after three weeks. No recurrence was seen two months later. Both the cough type asthma and the eosinophilic bronchitis could represent a form fruste of classical bronchial asthma beyond wheezing or dyspnoea, but with the common main symptom: cough. Since hyperresponsiveness and cough are phenotypic hallmarks of cough variant asthma, in eosinophilic bronchitis--beside cough--another two features of asthma are present: eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa along with sputum eosinophilia and subepithelial layer thickening. Not surprisingly, eosinophilic bronchial inflammation could be shown in patients with cough variant asthma as well, who--up to 56% during a four year-period--develop classic asthma. The long-term outcome of eosinophilic bronchitis is not known, however. Thus, asthma, cough variant asthma and cough due to eosinophilic bronchitis can mirror different phenotypes or phases of the same entity. CPC due to either the cough type asthma or the eosinophilic bronchitis is like asthma fast responding to inhalative steroids. (Induced) sputum staining should be added to the diagnostic armamentarium of CPC.", 
    "226": "To examine if the neuroendocrine link between volume sensing and renal function is preserved in compensated chronic heart failure [HF, ejection fraction 0.29 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE)] we tested the hypothesis that intravascular and central blood volume expansion by 3 h of water immersion (WI) elicits a natriuresis. In HF, WI suppressed ANG II and aldosterone (Aldo) concentrations, increased the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and elicited a natriuresis (P < 0.05 for all) compared with seated control. Compared with control subjects (n = 9), ANG II, Aldo, and ANP concentrations were increased (P < 0.05) in HF, whereas absolute and fractional sodium excretion rates were attenuated [47 +/- 16 vs. 88 +/- 15 micromol/min and 0.42 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.12% (mean +/- SE), respectively, both P < 0.05]. When ANG II and Aldo concentrations were further suppressed (P < 0.05) during WI in HF (by sustained angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, n = 9) absolute and fractional sodium excretion increased (P < 0.05) to the level of control subjects (108 +/- 34 micromol/min and 0.70 +/- 0.23%, respectively). Renal free water clearance increased during WI in control subjects but not in HF, albeit plasma vasopressin concentrations were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, the neuroendocrine link between volume sensing and renal sodium excretion is preserved in compensated HF. The natriuresis of WI is, however, modulated by the prevailing ANG II and Aldo concentrations. In contrast, renal free water clearance is attenuated in response to volume expansion in compensated HF despite normalized plasma AVP concentrations.",

We present the first report of such reactions in patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Fourteen (47%) of the 30 transfused patients experienced severe hypotensive reaction during filtered transfusion of at least 1 unit of blood product, with a total of 24 episodes. Eleven (79%) of these patients were treated pre-operatively with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "228": "Aspirin, which has been the mainstay of antiplatelet agent for many decades, affects a single pathway in the platelet activation process and provides incomplete protection against cardiovascular events. Aspirin also may blunt the hemodynamic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Dipyridamole may provide some additional benefit, but there is little evidence to suggest its superiority alone or in combination with aspirin compared to standard doses of aspirin. Oral platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, although initially promising, have had disappointing results in recent clinical studies. A new class of medications, the thienopyridines, blocks the activity of platelet adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) receptors, thereby reducing platelet activation. This review discusses the pharmacology, clinical studies, and potential uses of these agents, which include ticlopidine and clopidogrel. ADP inhibitors, by blocking an alternate pathway of platelet activation, are slightly more effective than aspirin in reducing cardiovascular events.",

It is now evident from World Health Organisation data that coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are increasing so rapidly that they will rank as numbers 1 and 5 respectively as causes of global burden of disease by the year 2020. In spite of the current low prevalence of hypertension in some countries, the total number of hypertensive subjects in the developing world is high, and a cost-analysis of possible antihypertensive drug treatment indicates that developing countries cannot afford the same treatment as developed countries. In the USA only 20% of cases of hypertension are adequately controlled (blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg), and in the developing world the figure falls to 5 - 10%. Black hypertensives have varying responses to antihypertensive therapy. They respond well to thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators such as alpha-blockers, hydrazine and reserpine, and poorly to beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor antagonists unless these drugs are combined with a diuretic. A comprehensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) programme is necessary. There are social, economic and cultural factors that impair control of hypertension in developing countries. Hypertension control should ideally be the initial component of an integrated CVD control programme that needs to be implemented in developing countries. Primary prevention through a population-based lifestyle-linked programme, as well as cost-effective methods of detection and management, are synergistically linked. The existing health care infrastructure needs to be orientated to meet the emerging challenge of CVD, while empowering the community through health education.", 
    "235": "Complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD) is known to be associated with Down syndrome (DS) and to be a major cause of infantile death in these patients. Recently several leading articles reported that complete surgical repair before 6 months of age is a relatively low-risk procedure leading to a dramatic improvement in outcome. Most surgical reviews, however, fail to describe their selection criteria and to include patients who die early in infancy or who are unfit for surgery for some or other reason. A retrospective descriptive study was done of all children with CAVSD treated over a period of 15 years from 1980 to 1994 at our institution. The aims were to describe the profile of children with CAVSD in our population, and to evaluate screening procedures and treatment received versus outcome. Thirty-three patients were included in the study, 25 with DS and 8 without. The basic skills of careful auscultation, interpretation of chest radiograph and electrocardiograms (ECGs) are all 100% sensitive in alerting the physician to this condition. Careful screening, especially of DS babies, is essential to ensure early optimal intervention. Echocardiography is the least invasive, most informative investigation to establish a definite diagnosis. The Rastelli anatomical classification is highly indicative of outcome. Children in the Rastelli C group showed a universally dismal prognosis. Digitalis and furosemide are still the mainstay of medical treatment. No additional benefit was observed with the limited introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Complete repairs were undertaken earlier and more frequently in recent years, but limited resources had led to the majority of patients not receiving surgery at all. There was insufficient urgency to aim for early complete repair, and more than 20% of children died before even being considered for surgery. This study is the first in South Africa to describe our own patient population and to evaluate local practice. Adequate screening of babies (especially those with DS), with early referral for complete repair in the first 6 months of life, remains the goal of optimal management.", 
    "236": "OBJECTIVES: Heart failure (HF) is a serious, prevalent health condition in industrialised countries where the incidence has been on the increase. The economic repercussions are costly, and therefore cost-effective medication is important in the overall management of the condition. It has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are clinically effective in the management of HF. Ramipril has been shown to reduce mortality and the probability of hospitalisation in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Internationally, the use of this drug has proved to be cost-effective. The objective of this study was to investigate the economic implications of using ramipril in South Africa for post-MI patients with HF. METHODOLOGY: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing the use of ramipril and placebo in post-MI patients with HF who were receiving standard therapy. The economic impacts included drug acquisition costs and savings on hospitalisation; these were evaluated based on the clinical benefits of using ramipril in terms of life-years gained (LYG). The cost-utility of the use of ramipril was determined to provide an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed on the major economic variables; discounting of future costs and savings was performed at rates of 0%, 5 % and 10 %. RESULTS: The use of ramipril results in an incremental cost/LYG of R16 808 and a total incremental cost per patient per month of R107 over 3.8 years. When the quality of life of the patients is taken into account, the cost-utility analysis shows an incremental cost/QALY of R21 382 for those younger than 65 years of age and R18 029 for those older than 65 years. The pharmaco-economic model was robust and consistent when tested at the extremes of the major variables, including costs, savings and discount rates. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that it is cost-effective to administer ramipril in addition to standard therapy for post-MI patients with HF in South Africa.",

    "242": "A role of the potent and long-acting vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and the pathophysiology of chronic human heart failure has been postulated based upon indirect evidence such as elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels and their with the degree of hemodynamic impairment. The advent of specific of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity not only to directly evaluate its pathophysiological role but also to assess its potential role as a new approach to heart failure therapy. This brief review summarizes the evidence linking endothelin-1 to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and the clinical results obtained in patients during acute, intravenous and more prolonged, oral administration with bosentan, a mixed ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist. Bosentan acutely and during short-term oral therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in patients in addition to standard heart failure therapy, including an ACE-inhibitor. These effects were associated with a reduced responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system to diuretic therapy and reduced basal plasma aldosterone levels. Although the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of short-term bosentan therapy looks promising for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure appropriate trials will have to be performed to document clinical benefit during long-term therapy. Finally, the question remains open whether mixed endothelin-1 receptor antagonists like bosentan will have similar effects as compared to antagonists which block the ET(A) receptor only.",

Expression of ACE mRNA was detected and quantified using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to angiotensin II (10(-5) mol/L) for 24 hours had no significant effect on the expression of ACE mRNA (0.7+/-0.5-fold versus control, P=NS), but similar treatment with aldosterone (10(-5) mol/L) induced a 23.3+/-7.9-fold increase (P<0.01) in ACE mRNA expression. The effect of aldosterone was both time- (maximal effect, 24 hours) and dose-dependent (EC(50), 4x10(-7) mol/L), and it was significantly (P<0.01) inhibited by spironolactone, a specific mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.",

The key role of the renin-angiotensin system in blood pressure and volume homeostasis has long been established, but its importance for the overall normal functioning of the kidney itself is also increasingly being recognized. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, widely and successfully used in the treatment of hypertension, may also provide renal protection independent of blood pressure reduction; however, their relatively nonspecific mode of action in blocking an early metabolic step entails major clinical disadvantages, such as accumulation of bradykinin and substance P, that may cause the characteristic ACE-inhibitor side effects of persistent dry cough and, more rarely, angioneurotic edema. Angiotensin II antagonists or receptor blockers, a new class of antihypertensive agent, selectively antagonize the AT1 receptor subtype and, because of greater specificity, do not give rise to the side effects associated with ACE inhibitors.

Cardiac fibroblasts (from normal male adult rats) from passage 2 were cultured to confluency and added to a hydrated collagen gel, with or without angiotensin II, angiotensin II plus telmisartan, or angiotensin II plus P-186 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 1, 2, or 3 days. Control gels containing adult rat cardiac fibroblasts showed a significant amount of contraction after 3 days of incubation, causing a contraction to 67.9 +/- 7.1% of the area after 1 day. Angiotensin II (10(-7) M) stimulated (p < or = 0.05) the contraction of collagen mediated by cardiac fibroblasts after 1, 2, or 3 days. Telmisartan (10(-7) M) completely blocked the angiotensin II-induced collagen contraction by cardiac fibroblasts. P-186 (10(-7) M) had no effect on the angiotensin II-induced collagen contraction by cardiac fibroblasts. Addition of telmisartan and P-186 alone did not affect the collagen gel contraction by cardiac fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that the effects of angiotensin II on the collagen gel contraction by adult rat cardiac fibroblasts are angiotensin II type 1 receptor mediated because they were abolished by the specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist telmisartan but not by the specific angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist P-186.", 
    "265": "The effect of the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced facilitation of noradrenergic neurotransmission was investigated in the isolated rat mesenteric artery under isometric conditions. Electrical field stimulation (2, 4, and 8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent increase of contractile force. At stimulation frequencies of 2, 4, and 8 Hz, Ang 11 (10 nM) increased the stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses by a factor 4.8 +/- 0.9, 2.9 +/- 0.7, and 1.3 +/- 0.1, respectively (p < 0.05 compared with control for all frequencies). The enhancement could be concentration-dependently antagonized by losartan (1 nM-1 microM), irbesartan (0.1 nM-0.1 microM), and telmisartan (0.01 nM-0.01 microM). At a stimulation frequency of 2 Hz, the relation between stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses (in presence of Ang II 10 nM) and the concentration of the AT1-antagonists used could be described by linear regression. The order of potency concerning sympathoinhibition was telmisartan > irbesartan > losartan (p < 0.05 between linear regression lines). Contractile responses to exogenous noradrenaline were unaltered in the presence of Ang II 10 nM. We conclude that the facilitating effect of Ang II on noradrenergic neurotransmission is mediated by presynaptically located AT1-receptors. Conversely, this facilitating effect can be dose-dependently counteracted by blockade of these receptors. Sympathoinhibitory properties are likely to contribute to the therapeutic effect of AT1-blockers, in particular in conditions in which the sympathetic nervous system is activated, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension.", 
    "266": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21 amino acid peptide originally purified from conditioned medium of cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells, is recognized as a product of many other cells as well. It is now known that there are three endothelin genes in the human genome (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3). ET-1 and ET-2 are both strong vasoconstrictors, whereas ET-3 is a potentially weaker vasoconstrictor than the other two isoforms. Besides being the most potent vasoconstrictor yet known, ET-1 also acts as a mitogen on the vascular smooth muscle, and, thus, it may play a role in the development of vascular diseases. It is well known that accelerated angiopathy is a major complication in diabetes mellitus. As generalized endothelial cell damage is thought to occur in diabetic patients, ET-1, being released from the damaged endothelial cells, is able to make contact with the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells and thus could be one important cause of diabetic angiopathy. This article summarizes the reported literature of the role of ET-1 in the development of diabetic complications, with particular focus on the possible role of ET-1 in mediating the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

In humans with chronic renal injury, renoprotection has been successfully demonstrated only late in the course of the renal disease. The rate of progression to end-stage renal failure can be delayed, but progression continues at a slower pace. Further study is required to determine whether earlier intervention can better preserve nephron structure and function. A strategy for future trials is recommended.

We evaluated 6 groups of subjects twice (basal: before any treatment; 2nd: after at least 18 months): 42 hypertensives (H) with a family history of hypertension (F+) and 30 H without a family history of hypertension (F-) successfully treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium channel blockers (2nd: 24-h BP < or = 130/80 mm Hg); 22 untreated (UT) HF+ and 18 UTHF- (2nd: 24-h BP >140 and/or 90 mm Hg); 18 normotensives F+ and 15 normotensives F-. The parameters evaluated were as follows: glucose, insulin, and C-peptide (Cp) response to an oral glucose load. Glucose was normal in all of the subjects, similar among the 6 groups, and unchanged at the 2nd evaluation. At the basal evaluation insulin and Cp were higher and the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucose was lower in the three F+ groups compared with the corresponding F- groups. In the 2nd evaluation insulin and Cp were reduced and the MCR of glucose increased in THF-, whereas all metabolic parameters were unchanged in THF+; in both UT hypertensive groups insulin and Cp increased and the MCR of glucose decreased, more so in F+ than in F-; in normotensive groups metabolic parameters did not change. A familial predisposition to hypertension influences insulin sensitivity changes during successful antihypertensive therapy, with an improvement in insulin sensitivity in F- and no changes in F+. A persistently high BP has a negative influence on insulin sensitivity in F+ and F-; this influence is greater when high BP is associated with a familial predisposition to hypertension.", 
    "269": "Angiotensin II plays an important role in blood pressure control and in water and salt homeosthasis. It is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and structural alterations of the vasculature, kidney, and heart, including nephrosclerosis, post infarction remodelling and left ventricular hypertrophy. At least two subtypes of receptors have been identified, angiotensin type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2). The AT1 receptor is responsible for all the known effects of Ang II on blood pressure, osmoregulation, and cell growth and consequently for the contribution to cardiovascular and renal pathology. Research has indicated that the AT1 receptor modulates cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, cellular growth and ventricular remodelling. Evidence suggests that, on the other hand, the AT2 receptor is involved in growth inhibition, inhibits cell proliferation, induces vasodilatation and reverses the AT1 induced hypertrophy. The accumulating evidence appears to demonstrate therefore that the function of these receptor subtypes may exerts opposite effects while stimulated by AngII. The angiotensin receptor antagonists are able to inhibit the renin angiotensin system by blocking selectively the AT1 receptor. It is supposed that AT1 receptor antagonists may provide end organ protection by blocking angiotensin II effects via the AT1 receptor leaving the AT2 receptor unopposed: it is conceivable that the stimulation of AT2 receptors may prevent the hypertropic effects seen in conditions such as LVH, hypertrophy, postinfarction remodeling and repair after injury. For this, the AT1/AT2 selectivity associated to these drugs may be important for their effects and to differentiate them from ACE inhibitors.",

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate changes of left ventricular (LV) myocardial mass, as well as diastolic filling properties, in hypertensive patients treated with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril. Sixteen hypertensive patients with echocardiographically documented LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction received fosinopril (10-20 mg daily). Measurements of LV myocardial mass and properties of diastolic filling (peak filling fraction (PFF); peak filling rate (PFR)) were performed prior to medication, as well as after 3 and 6 months of therapy using cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Prorenin mRNA levels in animals on normal (plus ramipril), low or high salt diet correlated as 1:10:0.5, respectively, while cathB mRNA levels correlated as 1:1:0.6, respectively. Treatment of the As4.1 cells with 100 nM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 16 h inhibited prorenin mRNA expression 3-fold relative to the control conditions. CathB mRNA abundance was not different between the PMA treated and the control As4.1 cells. Western analysis of the cathB protein abundance has shown no difference between the rats on normal and low salt diet, and decrease by 50% in the rats on high salt diet. The results of this study suggest that prorenin and cathB gene expression in renal JG cells are differentially regulated.", 
    "299": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in a complex mechanism that serves to preserve the blood supply to organs so that they can maintain cellular function. Angiotensin II exerts this effect, independently of the blood pressure generated, through two time-related events: a fast opening of the reserve collateral circulation and a much slower response of new vessel formation or angiogenesis. This effect is observed in rats with ligation of the abdominal aorta and in gerbils with abrupt or progressive unilateral carotid artery ligation. Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or the angiotensin II receptor represses this effect, and it appears that it is mediated through a non-AT1 receptor site of angiotensin II. Many tumors, both benign and malignant, express renin and angiotensin. It seems that the stimulating action of angiotensin II on angiogenesis could also be involved in preserving the blood supply to tumor cells. Administration of converting enzyme inhibitors increases survival and decreases tumor size in tumor-bearing rats. These observations support the hypothesis that the RAS, directly or indirectly, is involved in situations in which the restoration of blood supply is critical for the viability of cells and that it is present not only in normal but also in pathological conditions such as tumors. In view of the ubiquitous presence of renins and angiotensins, it is also likely to be involved in other conditions, such as inflammation, arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and retrolental fibroplasia, among others in which angiogenesis is prominent. In addition, angiotensin II could be involved, through the counterbalance of the AT1 and AT2 receptors, in the rarefaction of blood vessels as an etiologic component of essential hypertension.",

However, the effect of the magnitude of the dose of ACE inhibitor on blood pressure variability has not been reported. The objective of this sub-study of the ATLAS trial was to determine if there was a difference in effect on systolic blood pressure variability of two doses (35mg, 'high'; and, 5mg, 'low') of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, in patients with heart failure (class II-IV; NYHA). Criteria for inclusion were: symptomatic heart failure (class II-IV; NYHA), left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 30%, and 2 months of conventional therapy with diuretics with, or without, digoxin. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was recorded prior to randomization and after peak titration (4 weeks) of the study drug for analysis of variability of systolic blood pressure variability. The high dose of lisinopril was associated with greater variability of 24 h systolic blood pressure as noted by inspection of the 24 h recordings or calculation of the blood pressure variability index (P < 0.05). The greater variability in SBP was not associated with a difference in mean 24 h arterial blood pressure.",

    "306": "Baroreceptor-unloading-mediated activation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by antihypertensive agents, such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), has been considered to compromise the beneficial effects of the therapy and lead to unsatisfying clinical outcome. The present study was aimed at finding a novel way of using CCB without activating SNS. In anaesthetized Wistar rats, baroreceptor-unloading-mediated reflex activation of SNS, as indicated by tachycardia and increase of plasma catecholamines, was observed after mean arterial pressure (MAP) was decreased by 15 mmHg during 4-h administration of nifedipine, a CCB. However an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril did not cause tachycardia or increase plasma catecholamine levels when it decreased MAP by 15 mmHg. After 100 min (supposedly baroreceptor resetting or adaptation to hypotension had occurred), enalapril infusion was gradually replaced by nifedipine infusion in 40 min. Nifedipine was infused for another 100 min, which kept the lowered MAP unchanged and did not activate SNS. In anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), baroreceptor-mediated reflex activation of SNS was observed after MAP was decreased by 25 mmHg during 4-h nifedipine administration. However enalapril did not cause tachycardia or increase plasma catecholamine levels when it decreased MAP by 25 mmHg. After 100 min, enalapril infusion was gradually replaced by nifedipine infusion in 40 min. Nifedipine was then infused for another 100 min, which kept the lowered MAP unchanged and did not activate SNS. The present study indicated that reflex activation of SNS caused by antihypertensive effect of CCB could be avoided if, prior to CCB administration, baroreceptors have been reset to a lower MAP by a drug that does not activate baroreceptor reflex.", 
    "307": "The classical concept of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is that of a blood-borne cascade, whose final and bioactive product, angiotensin II, plays an important endocrine role in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte as well as fluid balance. In addition to this circulating RAS, there are an increasing number of studies to suggest the existence of a local angiotensin-generating system in several tissues. The so-called tissue RAS can act locally as a paracrine and/or autocrine factor in meeting specific needs for individual tissues and it can operate, in whole or in part, independently of the circulating counterpart. Recent studies on the expression and localization of key RAS components, particularly angiotensinogen and renin, have provided solid evidence for the existence of an intrinsic, angiotensin-generating system in the pancreas. The tissue RAS has a potential role in finely regulating exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas such as ductal anion secretion and islet hormonal secretion. Some of these effects may be exerted via the markedly vasoconstrictive effects of RAS. Of particular interest in this context are the recent epidemiological data showing that administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appears to be protective against the development of diabetes in hypertensive patients. Moreover, the upregulation of pancreatic RAS has been shown to occur during chronic hypoxia. The significance of changes in pancreatic RAS could have a potential role in acute pancreatitis, islet transplantation and in different shock states, by causing a further decrease of blood perfusion in the pancreas.", 
    "308": "HF is a prevalent and debilitating disease, affecting nearly 5 million patients and perhaps an equal number with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction who are at high risk of atrial fibrillation developing. An estimated 550,000 new cases occur every year. HF is the most common diagnosis in hospitalized patients aged 65 and over and is a major cause of death. The median survival after onset is 1.7 years in men and 3.2 years in women. The majority of cardiac deaths in patients with HF are sudden and arrhythmogenic: the rest are due to progressive hemodynamic deterioration. A significant advance in the past decade has been the recognition of the importance of inhibiting the neurohormonal action in HF with the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor, and aldosterone antagonists. In addition, a new concept in HF therapy has evolved. The view that chronic HF is an irreversible, end-stage process is being supplanted by the fact that it is possible to effect biological improvement in the intrinsic defects of function and structure in hearts afflicted with chronic HF. Reversibility of HF has been reported by (1) unloading the failing heart using an LVAD, (2) the sophisticated use of diuretic combinations and neurohormonal blocking drugs, or (3) employing continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. Thus it is now possible to reverse a process that has long been considered irreversible. Exercise programs designed for patients with HF that have been advocated recently can be difficult to apply. Fine tuning of an exercise regimen is required because a reduction in cardiac work is mandatory when treating HF, where the concern is that the heart may not be capable of supplying the metabolic needs of the body, even in resting states. Finally, although not emphasized in the recent literature on HF, the use of diuretics and sodium restriction continue to be the mainstays of therapy without which compensation of HF is not possible.",

To prevent the progression of these lesions, they should not be overlooked at the initial diagnosis. For this purpose, I propose a new system of diagnostic cooperation between physicians in private practice and hospitals. A 50-year-old male showed proteinuria([symbol: see text]), occult blood([symbol: see text]), and one granular and red cell cast in the total fields in spot urine samples, a 24 hr urinary protein of 0.17 g, a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dl and a mean blood pressure of 112 mmHg at the first examination. Four months after the administration of an ACE-inhibitor, the urinary protein decreased to 0.04 g while the serum creatinine level increased to 1.5 mg/dl. Therefore, a biopsy was performed at Kyoto University Hospital. Twenty-one glomeruli were obtained revealing 6 with global sclerosis and 13 proliferative glomeruli, including 3 with crescentic and 4 with adhesive lesions. In addition, interstitial cell infiltration was observed. After treatment for active blomeruli lesions using prednisolone and warfarin, the 24 hr urinary protein decreased to 0 g and serum creatinine to 1.2 mg/dl, Since a correlation between the relative volume of the renal cortical interstitial involvement and the serum creatinine concentration has been reported, the possibility of glomerular-interstitial interaction was considered. Thus, to prevent the neglect of patients with apparently mild disease associated with a poor prognosis, I propose the establishment of a system of diagnostic cooperation consisting of physicians in private practice, general hospitals and central hospitals that can provide appropriate treatment principles and give instructions for patients with mild urinary abnormalities encountered in daily practice.",

    "315": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists (ARAs) are widely administered to reduce urinary protein loss and slow the progression of proteinuric nephropathy to end-stage renal failure. Our group recently observed that the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARAs may have an additive antiproteinuric effect, which may occur because ACE inhibitors do not completely reduce angiotensin II (Ang II) production. Ang II is also produced by chymase. Thus, combination therapy better antagonizes the effects of Ang II. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the additive antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors plus ARAs is dose dependent and related to the drug-induced reduction in systemic blood pressure. Therefore, enalapril (E; 10 mg/d) and losartan (LOS; 50 mg/d) were randomly administered alone and then in association; initial dosages were doubled when drugs were administered alone and in association. To determine the influence of the drug-dependent effect on reducing blood pressure and the reduction in urinary proteinuria, both ambulatory and office blood pressures were recorded. E and LOS administered alone reduced proteinuria by the same extent; no further reduction was observed when E and LOS alone were administered at a doubled dose. When E and LOS were coadministered, proteinuria decreased by a greater extent compared with E and LOS alone; an additional reduction in proteinuria was observed when combined therapy doses were doubled. The reduction in proteinuria was not correlated with clinical through blood pressure; however, reductions in diastolic and mean ambulatory blood pressures significantly correlated with the decrease in proteinuria, as well as with creatinine clearance. In conclusion, this study shows that combination therapy with E and LOS has an additive dose-dependent antiproteinuric effect that is likely induced by the drug-related reduction in systemic blood pressure. In normotensive proteinuric patients, it is likely that even a small reduction in systemic blood pressure may affect intraglomerular hemodynamics by a great extent because efferent arteriole regulation is hampered more completely by the coadministration of ACE inhibitors and ARAs.",

Seventy patients with type 2 diabetes with overt nephropathy (serum creatinine >/= 1.5 mg/dL) were studied. Serum ACE activity was measured by the spectrophotometric method. ACE deletion/insertion (D/I) and Atg M235T genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Patients with and without macroangiopathy were compared. Those with macroangiopathy had increased ACE activity (median, 60.9 U/L; range, 37.9 to 100 U/L versus without macroangiopathy, 47.9 U/L; range, 11.2 to 84.5 U/L; P = 0.01) and prevalence of ACE DD/DI genotypes (DD/DI:II: with macroangiopathy, 61%:39% versus without macroangiopathy, 34%:66%; P = 0.03). Multivariate analysis using age; sex; duration of diabetes; glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid level control; serum creatinine level; and presence of the ACE D allele showed that presence of the D allele (P = 0.03; odds ratio, 1.8; confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.1) and serum creatinine level (P = 0.0007) were independent risk factors for macroangiopathy. Association of the D allele became insignificant after serum ACE activity was included in the analysis in which only serum ACE activity (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine level (P = 0.01) were independent risk factors. Neither Atg M235T nor its synergistic effect with the ACE D allele showed an association with macroangiopathy. In conclusion, the ACE D allele is associated with macroangiopathy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy. The association is dependent on its effect on serum ACE activity, which is an independent risk factor for the development of macroangiopathy.", 
    "317": "We evaluated the effects of chronic oral administration of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonist YM358 and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on hemodynamics and cardiac hypertrophy in rats with volume overload-induced heart failure. We assessed changes of cardiac hemodynamics and cardiac hypertrophy at 2 and 4 weeks after administration of YM358 (3, 30 mg/kg per day) or enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) in abdominal aortocaval shunt rats. YM358 (30 mg/kg) attenuated increases of left ventricle (LV)/body weight (BW), left atrium (LA)/BW, right ventricle (RV)/BW and heart/BW ratios, but did not affect cardiac hemodynamics in shunt rats. Enalapril also reduced the increased LV/BW and heart/BW ratios together with significant reductions of systolic blood pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure and the first derivative of left ventricular pressure. These data suggest that the effects on attenuation of the development of cardiac hypertrophy are not different for YM358 and enalapril, although the effects on cardiac hemodynamics are different for the same dosages. The attenuating action of YM358 on cardiac hypertrophy was independent of the action on hemodynamics and indicated the direct action of the AT1 receptor on the heart.",

The IC50 value of BCEAB for purified human chymase was 5.4 nM, whereas BCEAB did not inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, elastase and tryptase. In isolated dog arteries, the IC50 value of BCEAB for the angiotensin I-induced contraction in the presence of 1 microM lisinopril was 2.8 microM. In the hamster, the heart chymase activities were significantly suppressed to 42.0% and 26.9% 3 h after oral administration of 100 and 300 mg of BCEAB/kg of body weight, respectively. In conclusion, BCEAB is a useful chymase inhibitor for studying the role of chymase in vivo.",

The integrity of kidney function was determined 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation by investigation of the renal response to angiotensin II. Under pentobarbitone anaesthesia (70 mg x kg(-1), I.P.), rats underwent a right nephrectomy. Transplantation of the left kidney was performed after 2 h cold ischaemia without or with ABT-627 treatment. Control animals underwent left renal denervation. The renal response to angiotensin II was measured 2 weeks later following blockade of endogenous production of angiotensin II with captopril. A further transplant group was allowed to recover for 8 weeks before the terminal study. In the control group, angiotensin II reduced renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow rate (UV), and fractional sodium excretion (FE(Na)) by 29 +/- 5 %, 19 +/- 4 %, 25 +/- 4 % and 32 +/- 7 %, respectively. Conversely, in the transplant group, angiotensin II left RBF unchanged and increased GFR (59 +/- 12 %) and UV (93 +/- 8 %). FE(Na) decreased by 24 +/- 9 %. In both the transplant group treated with ABT-627 and the long-term recovery group, the renal response to angiotensin II was normalised. In conclusion, renal transplantation following 2 h cold I-R injury resulted in a temporary abnormal renal response to angiotensin II, which was reversed by ET(A) receptor antagonism at the time of transplantation.",

We studied the association of polymorphisms in these genes with CHD with linkage and association analyses in 118 families with premature and severe CHD and in 110 healthy controls. In linkage analysis there was no evidence for a linkage of the ACE or PAI-1 loci with CHD. However, in quantitative linkage analysis the ACE locus was linked with fasting glucose (P=0. 047) and fasting free fatty acid levels (P=0.029). In association analysis the ACE genotype frequencies of probands with CHD did not differ from those of healthy controls. Normoglycemic probands with MI and with the ACE polymorphism DD genotype had characteristics of the insulin resistance syndrome. They had higher levels of 1-h glucose (P=0.008) and 2-h free fatty acids (P=0.011) in an oral glucose tolerance test and higher levels of total (P=0.005) and very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (P=0.006) than probands with the ID or the II genotypes. The PAI-1 gene polymorphism was not associated with any of the variables of glucose or lipid metabolism. In conclusion, the ACE and PAI-1 gene polymorphisms are not linked with early-onset CHD.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) delays renal disease progression. More recently, agents that block the RAS by preventing angiotensin II from binding to its subtype 1 receptor (ARBs) have been developed in an effort to prevent deleterious consequences of pathologic levels of angiotensin II and to reduce the adverse effects of RAS blockade associated with ACEIs. Human studies with a variety of ARBs have clearly demonstrated the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy of these agents in patients with progressive renal diseases. Moreover, the effects of ARBs are similar or identical to those of ACEIs. Ongoing long-term clinical trials are designed to determine whether ARBs also preserve renal function similar to ACEIs. Specifically, the role of ARBs in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes is being evaluated in 3 large trials, including Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes-Part 2 With Valsartan, the Losartan Renal Protection Study, and the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial. Definitive evidence of the long-term protective effects of ARBs in chronic progressive renal disease is expected from these important studies.",

All compounds were administered via the drinking water for 312 days, at which time there was 80% mortality in the control group--the study's primary endpoint. The infarct sizes were similar across all groups. At endpoint, the mortality rates were: 63% (milrinone), 56% (enalapril) and 53% (simendan); the risk reductions were 25% (P = 0.04 vs. control) and 28% (P = 0.02 vs. control) with enalapril and simendan, respectively.

Detergent-extracted canine testes were sonicated in the presence of protease inhibitors and purified on an affinity column with the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, as an affinity ligand for ACE. The fractions recovered were assessed for ACE enzyme activity via an enzyme kinetic microplate assay (at 330 nm) based on the hydrolysis of Fa-Phe-Gly-Gly (FAPGG) at pH 7.5 during an 8 min incubation. The specific activity of ACE in the starting testicular extracts was 3.53 +/- 0.99 mU mg(-1) protein with a 1588 times enrichment in ACE activity after lisinopril affinity chromatography (4239 +/- 2600 mU mg(-1) protein). The recovery efficiency of ACE after lisinopril affinity chromatography was 71.2%. The ACE activity in the detergent extracts and the purified fractions was inhibited significantly by 10 micromol captopril l(-1), a specific ACE inhibitor, and was restored to 88% of normal activity by the addition of the thiol-alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (0.5 mmol l(-1)) in the detergent extracts and the purified fractions incubated with captopril. The treatment of testicular extracts with 10 mmol EDTA l(-1) reduced the ACE activity significantly (5.40 +/- 1.26 versus 0.58 +/- 0.23 mU mg(-1)). The ACE activity was restored fully in the presence of zinc (5.28 +/- 0.70 mU mg(-1)). The anti-ACE antibody (raised against a 70 kDa protein from the periacrosomal plasma membrane of equine spermatozoa) recognized a 65-70 kDa protein in the detergent-extracted testes as well as in the affinity-purified fractions. This antibody also recognized a protein of similar molecular mass in ejaculated spermatozoa. ACE was localized in the periacrosomal area of the ejaculated spermatozoa and in spermatids in the seminiferous tubules. The results of this study demonstrate that ACE is present in canine testis and retains its enzyme activity after purification with lisinopril affinity chromatography. Activity of canine ACE is inhibited by captopril and EDTA and is restored in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide and zinc.",

Other factors significantly correlated with progression of ACR included age, baseline body mass index and systolic blood pressure, the presence of diabetes (or levels of fasting glucose), and elevated levels of serum gamma glutamyl transferase.

The effect of these parameters on the reaction product were carefully studied to optimize reaction conditions. The relationship between the absorbance at 465 nm and the concentration was found to be linear over the range 1-10 microg/ml. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity was also found to be directly proportional at the concentration over the range of 20-100 ng/ml at 530 nm after excitation at 465 nm. The proposed procedure was successfully applied to the determination of ramipril in both tablet dosage form and in plasma. Spectrophotometric determination of ramipril tablets yielded a percentage recovery of 98.66+/-0.38, while the percentage recovery of spectrofluorimetric determination of ramipril in spiked human plasma was 99.08+/-1.11%.

We examined the protective role of novel antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) directed at ACE mRNA in myocardial ischemic injury. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ACE-AS-ODN (200 microg per rat, n = 8, i.v.) or inverted-ODN (IN-ODN, 200 microg per rat, n = 8, i.v.), given with 600 microg per rat of liposome DOTAP/DOPE. Hearts from AS-ODN- or IN-ODN-treated rats were excised, perfused in vitro, and subjected to 25 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Parallel groups of rats were given ACE inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg, n = 8) or saline (n = 8) before excising the hearts. Ischemia/reperfusion resulted in myocardial dysfunction (increase in coronary perfusion pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure and a decrease in developed LV pressure) in the saline-treated rats. Myocardial dysfunction was associated with evidence of lipid peroxidation and enzyme leakage (MDA and LDH levels in the myocardium) and up-regulation of ACE protein expression. Administration of AS-ODN or captopril, but not IN-ODN, reduced Ang-II levels in the plasma, decreased ischemia/reperfusion-mediated cardiac functional deterioration and lipid peroxidation, and preserved LDH in the myocardium (all P < 0.05 versus the saline group). AS-ODN and captopril had equipotent effects on cardiac dynamics. ACE protein expression (western blot) was decreased in the hearts of the AS-ODN-treated group, but not in IN-ODN-treated rat hearts. In contrast, ACE protein expression was significantly increased in captopril-treated rat hearts. These observations suggest that AS-ODN directed at ACE mRNA can ameliorate myocardial dysfunction and injury after ischemia/reperfusion, and its use is associated with decreased expression of ACE protein in the ischemic myocardium.",

Oral uptake of captopril, a selective and specific inhibitor of ACE, resulted in a complete phenotypic knockout of circulating ACE activity. When compared with control animals, captopril-fed female flies showed an increase in the liver meal-induced trypsin peak in the midgut and elevated levels of protein meal-induced yolk polypeptides in the hemolymph. The latter effect was not due to a slower vitellogenin uptake by the ovaries, because oocyte growth was not affected by the captopril treatment. The apparent synergism between the demonstrated ACE functionality and the previously reported effects of the oostatic peptide Neb-TMOF are discussed in the context of our recent finding that Neb-TMOF represents a prime candidate for being the first known in vivo substrate for circulating insect ACE.

Multiple regression analysis showed that the effect of the ACE genotype was explained by its influence on serum ACE activity and that the only other significant determinants of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia were the degree of hypoglycaemia awareness, b-cell function, and duration of diabetes of more than 20 years.",

    "396": "In summary, autoregulation of the renal vasculature provides a mechanism by which renal function is maintained relatively constant despite variations in systemic blood pressure. This system also provides a means for changes in blood pressure to occur without causing inappropriate alterations in urinary NaCl excretion. Alterations in the autoregulatory response can have clinical consequences. Increased activity of the TGF mechanism may be causally related to the development of some forms of hypertension. Decreased activity of TGF or an impaired myogenic response may help explain the increased susceptibility that certain patient groups exhibit toward hypertension-induced renal injury. The aggressive treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired renal autoregulation may be associated with an increase in the serum creatinine concentration. As long as this increase is neither excessive nor progressive, physicians should not be dissuaded from trying to achieve newly established blood pressure goals.", 
    "397": "Many controversial studies concerning relation between angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphism and renal and cardiovascular disease have been published during the last years. Most of the papers have suggested that the DD genotype plays an important negative role in the progression of some renal diseases (e.g. IgA nephropathy, diabetic nepropathy). The D allele may be an independent risk factor for development of the target organ damage in essential hypertension. The therapeutic response on inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme depends on insertion-deletion polymorphism. It probably also depends on the gender. The pathological mechanisms of insertion-deletion polymorphism have not yet been clearly identified.", 
    "398": "Microalbuminuria (MA) is defined as persistent elevation of albumin in the urine, of 30-300 mg/day (20-200 microg/min). These values are less than the values detected by routine urine dipstick testing, which does not become positive until protein excretion exceeds 300-500 mg/day. Use of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio is recommended as the preferred screening strategy for all diabetic patients. MA is measured in spot morning urine obtained from the patient in the office and sent for measurement of both albumin and creatinine. A value above 0.03 mg/mg suggests that albumin excretion is above 30 mg/day and therefore MA is present. MA should be checked annually in everyone, and every 6 months within the first year of treatment to assess the impact in patients started on antihypertensive therapy. MA is an established risk factor for renal disease progression in type 1 diabetes and its presence is the earliest clinical sign of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, a number of studies suggest that MA is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and defines a group at high risk for early cardiovascular mortality in both type 2 diabetes and essential hypertension. MA also signifies abnormal vascular permeability and the presence of atherosclerosis. Among nondiabetic patients with essential hypertension, MA is associated with higher blood pressures, increased serum total cholesterol, and reduced serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus, taken together these data support the concept that the presence of MA is the kidney's notice to the physician/patient that there is a problem with the vasculature. MA can be reduced, and progression to overt proteinuria prevented, by aggressive blood pressure reduction. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that blood pressure levels be maintained at or below 130/80 mm Hg in anyone with diabetes or renal disease. This should be accomplished with antihypertensive agents that prevent the rise in MA and hence prevent development of proteinuria. Such agents are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and, to a lesser extent, Beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, and diuretics. In summary, the presence of MA is a marker of endothelial dysfunction and a harbinger of markedly enhanced cardiovascular risk. All patients with diabetes and/or hypertension should be screened for the presence of microalbuminuria with use of spot morning urine. To maximize prevention of MA development, the following goals should be instituted: 1) blood pressure should be maintained at less than 130/80 mm Hg and a low-salt, moderate-potassium diet instituted; 2) in diabetics, HbA1c should be kept at less than 7%; 3) in obese patients, a weight loss program should be implemented, with a goal BMI of less than 30; and 4) the physician and patient, working together, should maintain low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at less than 120 mg/dL, and less than 100 mg/dL if diabetes is present.

    "399": "Choosing the initial antihypertensive drug for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient is an important and frequent event for the primary care physician. Patients' first experience with antihypertensive drug therapy will likely affect their long-term perception of hypertension treatment. The choice should be made on the basis of sound scientific data and from the patient's perspective and needs. The drug should be taken once a day, should have proven efficacy in hypertension control and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reduction, and should have as few side effects as possible. Low-dose thiazide diuretics meet this description, although the need to monitor electrolytes may make them less than ideal. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist class, with side-effects similar to those of placebo in controlled trials, is the most attractive from the patient's perspective, although outcome trial data do not yet exist proving that hypertension treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists reduces cardiovascular events. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with their low side-effect profiles and unique effects on vascular remodeling, are attractive second choices to combine with a diuretic if needed, although low-dose diuretic/Beta blocker combinations have also been shown to lower blood pressure with minimal side effects. At present, ensuring adequate long-term hypertension control is the most important aspect of hypertensive care, and which antihypertensive drug(s) the physician chooses can greatly affect the hypertensive patient's ability to achieve and to maintain long-term blood pressure control.

    "400": "Hypertension among black Americans explains much of the black health disadvantage. Compared with white Americans, blacks develop hypertension at a younger age and have higher rates of stage 3 hypertension (i.e., blood pressure is greater than 180/110 mm Hg). Black Americans tend to wait longer for treatment after diagnosis, causing a longer duration of elevated blood pressure and greater target organ damage. To arrive at the recommended target blood pressure of less than 130/85 mm Hg (in patients with diabetes or renal failure) or 125/75 mm Hg (in patients with proteinuria greater than 1 g/24 hours), all antihypertensive drug classes can be considered. Tight blood pressure control in black Americans frequently requires the use of more than just one agent (monotherapy). Low dose combination therapy, such as a calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor, can solve many of the clinical issues that must be considered when treating hypertension in this patient group.

The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VI) suggests that the use of low dose combination therapy may be an appropriate alternative to initial treatment. In this prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point (PROBE) study, following a 2 week single blind placebo washout period, qualified patients were started on a calcium channel blocker, felodipine 5 mg for 2 weeks. Patients who were nonresponders (DBP equals 90 mm Hg) were randomized to either felodipine 10 mg (n equals 17, mean age 52.4, 12 males), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril 5 mg/felodipine 5 mg (n equals 20 mean, mean age 52.1, 13 males), or another ACE inhibitor, benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine 5 mg (n equals 18, mean age 53.9, 15 males) for an additional 6 weeks. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at the end of the single blind placebo washout period and again at the end of the study. All three treatment groups had significant reductions in mean 24 hour systolic and diastolic BP compared to baseline. The reduction in mean 24 hour systolic and diastolic BPs in the benazepril/amlodipine treated patients (-17.2/-9.7 mm Hg) was significantly greater (p equals 0.05) than in the felodipine 10 mg treated patients (-11.9/-6.4 mm Hg) and was also numerically but not statistically significantly greater than in the enalapril/felodipine treated patients (-14.2/-8.2 mm Hg). Similar differences were seen when assessing daytime BP (06:00-21:59) and nighttime BP (10:00-05:59). The reductions in morning systolic and diastolic BP (6 am-noon) in the benazepril/amlodipine treated patients (-18.6/-10.7 mm Hg) were numerically but not statistically significantly greater than the enalapril/felodipine treated patients (-13.6/-7.5 mm Hg) and the felodipine 10 mg treated patients (-14.9/-8.3 mm Hg). The data from this study suggests that using low dose combination therapy in patients who are nonresponders to first line monotherapy with a calcium channel blocker provides greater blood pressure control than up titration to higher dose monotherapy. Low dose combination therapy may therefore be an important early alternative to up titration of monotherapy in patients who are nonresponders. These data confirm other observations with combination therapy with \u00c3 -blockers/ diuretics, ACE inhibitors/diuretics, and angiotensin II (AII) receptor blockers/diuretics.

    "402": "The process of aging leads to significant changes in the structure and function of the cardiovascular system. Some of these changes result directly in pathological effects, while others serve to exacerbate the effects of cardiovascular diseases. The changes in the walls of the peripheral arteries lead to increased systolic and pulse pressures. In the myocardium, there is an age associated loss of myocytes. The remaining cells have reduced inotropic capacity. The aging heart also shows increased stiffness in both animal and human studies. Cardiac function is shown to be normal at rest in the aging population, however, during exercise, the aging heart shows a significantly smaller reserve. The increased mortality rates in setting of myocardial infarction and/or congestive heart failure in the elderly may be related to reduced muscle mass and loss of cardiac myocytes. Conversely, the aging population may receive greater benefit from the protective effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

In healthy male volunteers, omapatrilat decreased blood pressure while being generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of age and gender on the pharmacodynamics of omapatrilat. Healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80 were given a single oral dose of omapatrilat 40 mg. Neither age nor gender affected the vasopeptidase inhibition by omapatrilat. There were no differences between subject groups in the effect of omapatrilat on supine systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressure.

    "404": "Previous studies using pulsed Doppler echocardiography have demonstrated a pattern of abnormal left ventricular relaxation associated with increasing age. Specifically, aging is associated with decreased peak velocity of early diastolic mitral inflow, increased peak velocity of late diastolic inflow, increased isovolumic relaxation time, and early diastolic deceleration time. Abnormal relaxation can progress to significantly elevated left atrial pressure--characterized by increased early peak velocity and shortened isovolumic relaxation time and deceleration time--as part of the disease processes. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is highly prevalent, occurring in one half to two thirds of elderly patients with congestive heart failure, in association with normal systolic function. Left ventricular hypertrophy, which is commonly related to systemic arterial hypertension, and ischemic heart disease are the two major causes of abnormal left ventricular diastolic function in the elderly. Recently, newer echocardiographic techniques have been described that allow more accurate evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function. Treatments for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction should focus on the underlying disease etiology as well as on the derangement in left ventricular diastolic function. Although calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used clinically to treat diastolic dysfunction, their effects on prognosis remain unproven.",

Endothelial function was assessed by measurement of forearm blood flow responses to intra-arterial infusions of endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilators and an endothelial-dependent vasoconstrictor [acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) respectively] using venous occlusion plethysmography. Lisinopril significantly increased the forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine by 20% [lisinopril, 3.12+/-0.37 (mean+/-S.E.M.); placebo, 2.58+/-0.25; P=0.02, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.09, 1.06] (values given are ratios of flow in the infused arm to that in the control arm); there was no effect on the response to sodium nitroprusside (lisinopril, 3.97+/-0.40; placebo, 3.92+/-0.39; P=0.84; 95% CI -0.50, 0.61). The vasoconstrictor response to L-NMMA demonstrated a significant improvement (lisinopril, 0.77+/-0.06; placebo, 0.95+/-0.05; P<0.001; 95% CI -0.09, -0.27). In conclusion, these results indicate that ACE inhibition can improve endothelial function in cigarette smokers. We show that lisinopril improves both receptor-mediated and tonic NO release. The mechanism could be either that lisinopril limits the angiotensin II-induced production of superoxide radicals which would normally inactivate NO, or that lisinopril may increase bradykinin-mediated NO release.", 
    "406": "It has been reported that soybean peptide fractions isolated from Korean fermented soybean paste exert angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in vitro. In this study, further purification and identification of the most active fraction inhibiting ACE activity were performed, and its antihypertensive activity in vivo was confirmed. Subsequently, a novel ACE inhibitory peptide was isolated by preparative HPLC. The amino acid sequence of the isolated peptide was identified as His-His-Leu (HHL) by Edman degradation. The IC(50) value of the HHL for ACE activity was 2.2 microg/mL in vitro. Moreover, the synthetic tripeptide HHL (spHHL) resulted in a significant decrease of ACE activity in the aorta and led to lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats compared to control. Triple injections of spHHL, 5 mg/kg of body weight/injection resulted in a significant decrease of SBP by 61 mmHg (p < 0.01) after the third injection. These results demonstrated that the ACE inhibitory peptide HHL derived from Korean fermented soybean paste exerted antihypertensive activity in vivo.",

The molecular weight distributions of the first, second, and third hydrolysates were 4.8-6.6, 3.4-6.6, and 0.9-1.9 kDa, respectively. The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of the third hydrolysate (IC(50) = 0.689 mg/mL) was higher than that of the first and second hydrolysates. Two different peptides showing strong ACE inhibitory activity were isolated from the hydrolysate using consecutive chromatographic methods including gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The isolated peptides were composed of Gly-Pro-Leu and Gly-Pro-Val and showed IC(50) values of 2.55 and 4.67 microM, respectively.", 
    "408": "Blood transfusion is considered safe when the infused blood is tested using state of the art viral assays developed over the past several decades. Only rarely are known viruses like HIV and hepatitis C transmitted by transfusion when blood donors are screened using these sensitive laboratory tests. However, there are a variety of transfusion risks which still remain that cannot be entirely eliminated, many of which are non-infectious in nature. Predominantly immune-mediated complications include the rapid intravascular or slow extravascular destruction (hemolysis) of transfused red cells or extravascular removal of platelets by pre-formed antibodies carried by the transfusion recipient. Alternatively, red cells can be damaged when exposed to excessive heat or incompatible intravenous fluids before or during the transfusion. Common complications of blood transfusion that at least partly involve the immune system include febrile non-hemolytic and allergic reactions. While these are usually not life-threatening, they can hamper efforts to transfuse a patient. Other complications include circulatory overload, hypothermia and metabolic disturbances. Profound hypotensive episodes have been described in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors who receive platelet transfusions through bedside leukoreduction filters. These curious reactions appear to involve dysmetabolism of the vasoactive substance bradykinin. Products contaminated by bacteria during blood collection and transfused can cause life-threatening septic reactions. A long-term complication of blood transfusion therapy unique to chronically transfused patients is iron overload. Less common - but serious - reactions more specific to blood transfusion include transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease and transfusion-associated acute lung injury. Many of these complications of transfusion therapy can be prevented by adhering to well-established practice guidelines. In addition, individuals who administer blood transfusions should recognize these complications in order to be able to quickly provide appropriate treatment.", 
    "409": "Trandolapril is the prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It has been proposed that its active metabolite, trandolaprilat, is mainly excreted in bile, but this has not been clearly demonstrated. Recently it has been reported that temocaprilat, an active metabolite of the ACE inhibitor temocapril, is effectively excreted in bile via an ATP-dependent active transporter (canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter: cMOAT). To investigate whether trandolaprilat has the pharmacological ability to affect the cMOAT system in a manner similar to temocaprilat. The lipophilicity of trandolaprilat and temocaprilat was measured to determine the n-octanol-water partition coefficients. The dose-dependent inhibition of the up-take of [3H]-estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and [3H]-2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, which are good substrates for cMOAT, in canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats was determined in the presence of trandolaprilat and temocaprilat. The partition coefficient of trandolaprilat (log Po/w - 1.1) was about 30 times higher than that of temocaprilat (log Po/w - 2.5). The uptake of [3H]-estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and [3H]-2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione was dose-dependently inhibited by the presence of temocaprilat, but trandolaprilat had no effect on the transport of [3H]-estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide or [3H]-2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione into CMVs even at concentrations as high as 200 microM. It could be concluded that trandolaprilat has a higher lipophilicity than temocaprilat. But the hepatobiliary excretion system via cMOAT may not contribute to the excretion of trandolaprilat in bile.", 
    "410": "Roles of each angiotensin II producing enzymes of each of the angiotensin II-producing enzymes were reviewed based on experimental models. In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is potentially cleaved from angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase. It has been confirmed that vascular tissues of humans, monkeys, dogs and hamsters have a chymase-dependent angiotensin II-forming pathway. Much like other hypertensive models, hamster hypertensive models show high levels of vascular ACE activity, but not chymase activity. In hypertensive hamsters, administration of either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist resulted in similar reductions in blood pressure, suggesting that chymase is not involved in the maintenance of high blood pressure in this model. In monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet, ACE activity was increased in the atherosclerotic lesions, and an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist prevented atherosclerosis to a similar degree, suggesting that ACE may be mainly involved in the development of atherosclerosis. After balloon injury in dog vessels, both ACE and chymase activities were locally increased about 3-fold in the injured arteries, and an AT1 receptor antagonist was effective in preventing the intimal formation, but an ACE inhibitor was ineffective. In dog grafted veins, the activities of chymase were increased 15-fold, but those of ACE were increased only 2-fold, and the intimal formation was suppressed by either an AT1 receptor antagonist or a chymase inhibitor. In the normal vascular tissues, ACE plays a crucial role for angiotensin II production, whereas chymase is stored in mast cells in an inactive form. Chymase acquires the ability to form angiotensin II following mast cells activation followed by mast cells activation by a strong stimulus such as occurs in catheter-injury or grafting. Together, these results indicate that chymase plays a major role in the vascular angiotensin II-generating system, particularly in cases of vascular injury.",

He then considers the possibility of beta-blockers (particularly carvedilol) being used instead of ACE inhibitors.

The actual scientific evidence supports the use of the ACEI in patient with ventricular dysfunction in all functional NYHA classes, of the ARA in heart failure patients with intolerance to ACEI and of low-dose spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure. Ongoing clinical trials will further clarify the role of these pharmacological agents in the management of chronic heart failure patients.",

    "428": "Converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor antagonism attenuate elevations in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine in response to insulin, suggesting that integrity of the renin-angiotensin system is necessary for insulin-induced sympathoexcitation. To test this, we infused vehicle (saline) in control experiments, or insulin (40 mU/min) during euglycemic clamp in captopril-pretreated (intravenously 2.5 mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg/h) and in nonpretreated urethane-anesthetized Wistar rats while measuring mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity. Although euglycemic hyperinsulinemia produced similar blood pressure (BP) increases in insulin-infused rats (change in mean arterial pressure: +9 +/- 3 mm Hg) compared with vehicle-controls (+6 +/- 2 mm Hg), insulin decreased blood pressure (BP) in captopril-pretreated insulin-infused rats (-8 +/- 3 mm Hg). Control rats developed mild heart rate increases (change in heart rate: +28 +/- 15 beats/min), contrasting with a marked tachycardia in insulin-infused rats (+82 +/- 13 beats/min) and a bradycardia in captopril-treated insulin-infused rats (-16 +/- 18 beats/min). As with heart rate, insulin-infused rats experienced large increases in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (+ 127 +/- 29%), whereas small and equivalent elevations were observed in vehicle-treated rats (+39 +/- 24%) and in captopril-pretreated insulininfused rats (+61 +/- 13%). These observations demonstrate an attenuation of insulin-induced sympathetic activation by renin-angiotensin blockade with captopril in Wistar rats, and suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is critical for insulin to exert its sympathoexcitatory effects.", 
    "429": "A large-scale, 8-week, open-label, clinical experience trial evaluated the efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor (AT1 subtype) blocker candesartan cilexetil (16 to 32 mg once daily) either alone or as add-on therapy in 6465 hypertensive patients. The study population was 52% female and 16% African American with a mean age of 58 years. It included 5,446 patients who had essential hypertension (HBP) and 1,014 patients who had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). These patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90 to 109 mm Hg inclusive at baseline) despite a variety of antihypertensive medications including diuretics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha- or beta-blockers, either singly or in combination. The mean baseline blood pressure for the HBP group was 156/97 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy (in 51% of HBP patients) reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18.7/ 13.1 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 49% of HBP patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently reduced mean SBP/DBP further, irrespective of the background therapy: diuretics (17.8/11.3 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (16.6/11.2 mm Hg), beta-blockers (16.5/ 10.4 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (15.3/10.0 mm Hg), alpha-blockers (16.4/10.4 mm Hg). The mean baseline blood pressure for the ISH group was 158/81 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil, as monotherapy (in 34% of ISH patients), reduced SBP/DBP by 17.0/4.4 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 66% of ISH patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently reduced mean SBP/DBP further, irrespective of the background therapy: diuretics (17.4/5.1 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (15.6/3.6 mm Hg), beta-blockers (14.0/4.8 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (13.4/4.3 mm Hg), and alpha-blockers (11.6/4.5 mm Hg). The further blood pressure lowering effects of candesartan cilexetil as add-on therapy were seen regardless of age, sex, and race. Overall, 6.8% of the 6465 patients withdrew because of adverse events, most commonly headache (6.3%) and dizziness (5.0%). Orthostatic hypotension was infrequent; 0.2% with candesartan cilexetil alone, and 0.8% with candesartan cilexetil as add-on therapy. Thus, candesartan cilexetil either alone or as add-on therapy was highly effective for the control of systolic or diastolic hypertension regardless of demographic background when used in typical clinical practice settings.", 
    "430": "Despite the recent emphasis on combination drug therapy for hypertension, little attention has been given to alpha/beta blockade using agents other than labetalol. The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the efficacy of low-dose alpha/beta blockade using doxazosin + betaxolol, versus monotherapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]), and 2) assess the efficacy of low-dose doxazosin. In a crossover study, 21 hypertensive subjects were treated for 3 weeks each with HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg/day, quinapril, 10 to 40 mg/day, and a combination of doxazosin, 1 to 4 mg + betaxolol, 5 to 10 mg daily. Doses were titrated to achieve a systolic pressure <130 mm Hg, as assessed by self-recorded home measurements. Home blood pressure decreased 11.5/7.5 mm Hg after HCTZ, 12.9/8.8 mm Hg after quinapril, and 21.2/16.5 mm Hg after doxazosin + betaxolol (P < .001/< .001 v HCTZ and P < .002/< .001 v quinapril). The target systolic pressure was achieved by 33%, 43%, and 71% of subjects, respectively (P = .04 v HCTZ, and .03 v quinapril). Among the 8 subjects in whom doxazosin dosage was increased to the maximum of 4 mg, the mean blood pressure achieved at 4 mg did not differ from that achieved at 2 mg (136/87 v 136/88 mm Hg). We conclude that oral alpha/beta blockade is superior to monotherapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a diuretic and that maximal or near maximal efficacy can be achieved at a 2-mg dose of doxazosin. Low-dose oral alpha/beta blockade merits greater consideration in the drug therapy of essential hypertension.", 
    "431": "This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms of weight loss-induced blood pressure (BP) reduction focusing, in particular, on the contributions of sympathetic nervous system activity, fasting plasma insulin, and leptin to BP levels, and to delineate the additional influence of antihypertensive drug therapy. Each of five groups of obese hypertensives were treated with the long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril with or without a weight reduction program, or a weight reduction program alone. The goal BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg for the pharmacologic treatment groups. The weight reduction program groups with or without pharmacologic treatment were divided into two groups; weight loss groups who succeeded in weight reduction (> or = 10%) and nonweight loss groups who failed in weight reduction (<10%) in the first 6 months. The final dose of CCB and ACE inhibitor were less in the combined pharmacologic and weight loss groups than in the pharmacologic treatment alone groups or in the pharmacologic and nonweight loss groups. In the weight reduction groups regardless of pharmacologic treatment, the percent reductions from baseline in plasma insulin, leptin, and norepinephrine (NE) were greater in the weight loss groups (> or = 10%) than in the nonweight loss groups (<10%). The reductions in plasma NE, insulin, and leptin were significantly greater and earlier in combined pharmacologic and weight loss groups than in the pharmacologic treatment alone groups. In ACE inhibitor groups, the reductions in plasma NE, in insulin, and especially in leptin were greater than the other groups. In the CCB alone group, reductions in insulin and leptin occurred, but there was no change in plasma NE. Reductions in insulin and leptin in CCB groups were less and occurred later than in the ACE inhibitor groups or the weight reduction alone group. These results show that weight loss associated with favorable metabolic improvements and these improvements are amplified when combined with pharmacologic treatment. Therefore, weight loss should be regarded as an essential component of any treatment program for obesity-related hypertension. A novel finding from this study is that ACE inhibition had a striking effect to lower plasma leptin. Suppression of sympathetic activity, insulinemia, and leptinemia appeared to play a role in the BP reduction accompanying weight loss.", 
    "432": "Several studies have suggested that high blood pressure is associated with the risk of bone loss. Since various antihypertensive drugs are in wide use for the treatment of hypertension, it is important to investigate the influences of these drugs on bone metabolism. Osteoblasts play a pivotal role in the regulation of bone formation. During differentiation, they sequentially express type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), other bone matrix proteins, and finally undergo mineral deposition. In this study, we examined the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on the function of osteoblast using clonal MC3T3-E1 cells. Drugs examined include dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers (benidipine, amlodipine, and nifedipine), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril, and enalapril), and angiotensin II receptor type1 (AT1) antagonists (TCV-116 and KW-3433). None of the ACE inhibitors or AT1 antagonists affected ALP activity or cellular DNA content significantly. In contrast, benidipine, amlodipine, and nifedipine increased ALP activity when used in amounts 1 pM, 100 nM, and 100 nM, respectively. Benidipine blocked calcium influx through the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel of MC3T3-E1 more potently than amlodipine or nifedipine. These calcium channel blockers did not change collagen accumulation. Benidipine significantly increased in vitro mineralization at a concentration of 1 nM and higher, while amlodipine did so at 1 microM and nifedipine did not. Comparison of the effective concentration of each calcium channel blocker in our study with the reported maximum serum concentration of each drug suggests that benidipine, but not amlodipine or nifedipine, promotes mineral deposition in human.",

A mathematical model (y = kt(alpha)e(-beta t), t > 0), applied to the BK kinetically released from endogenous high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) during plasma activation in the presence of an ACE inhibitor, revealed a significant difference in the rate of formation of BK between men and women. For des-Arg(9)-BK, the active metabolite of BK, the rate of degradation was higher in women compared with men, correlating significantly with serum APP activity (r(2) = 0.6485, P < 0.001).

    "442": "The effects of systemic treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan on central effects of angiotensin II (Ang II), namely, increase in blood pressure, vasopressin release into the circulation, and drinking response, were investigated in conscious, normotensive rats. The central responses to i.c.v. Ang II (30 ng/kg) were measured at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h following acute i.v. or acute and chronic oral telmisartan application. At a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v., the drinking response to i.c.v. Ang II was completely blocked over 4 h, while the pressor response and the release of vasopressin in response to i.c.v. Ang II were blocked by 60 to 80%. The inhibition of the centrally mediated pressor and drinking response to Ang II was sustained over 24 h. The lower doses of telmisartan (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced actions over 4 h. A consistent 24-h inhibition of the central responses to i.c.v. Ang II was obtained after acute and chronic oral treatment with 30 mg/kg telmisartan. Oral treatment with 1 and 3 mg/kg telmisartan produced a slight but inconsistent inhibition of the central actions of Ang II. Telmisartan concentrations measured in the cerebrospinal fluid following 8 days of consecutive daily oral treatment (1-30 mg/kg) ranged from 0.87 +/- 0.27 ng/ml (1 mg/kg/day) to 46.5 +/- 11.6 ng/ml (30 mg/kg/day). Our results demonstrate that, following peripheral administration, the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan can penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a dose- and time-dependent manner to inhibit centrally mediated effects of Ang II.", 
    "443": "Multiple pathways of angiotensin (Ang) I conversion and their functional role in the canine penile corpus cavernosum were investigated. Biochemical analysis revealed high activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (6.9 +/- 1.7 mU/mg of protein, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 8) and chymase-like enzyme (4.0 +/- 1.4 mU/mg of protein). Functional recording of isometric tension showed that Ang I (3 x 10(-7) M) induced a tension of 0.17 +/- 0.05 g (n = 5), which was reduced to about 60% by pretreatment with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (10(-6) M), and almost completely blocked by lisinopril in combination with a chymase inhibitor, chymostatin (10(-4) M). Binding sites for ACE and Ang II receptors were studied by in vitro autoradiography using 125I-351A and 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II as ligands, respectively. Dense binding of ACE appeared in the endothelial layer of the corpus cavernosum penis, and Ang II receptors were localized in the trabecular smooth muscle layer. An AT1 receptor antagonist, CV-11974 (10(-6) M), markedly displaced 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II bindings, indicating that the corpus cavernosum penis contains AT1 receptors exclusively. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated ACE in the endothelium of the corpus cavernosum penis. Mast cells that produce chymase were present mainly in the cavernosal area. These results demonstrate that chymase, in addition to ACE, is involved in the contraction of canine penile corpus cavernosum through local Ang II formation.", 
    "444": "This prospective study was designed to compare the captopril suppression test with the salt-loading approach to confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. A total of 49 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. The captopril test was performed in the morning with patients in the seated position after overnight fasting. Blood samples for plasma aldosterone were obtained before captopril administration (25 mg PO) and again 2 hours later. Patients were then subjected to a high salt diet (300 mmol sodium per day for 3 days). On the third day, urinary sodium (24 hours) was measured, and plasma aldosterone levels were measured at 8:00 AM (recumbent) and at noon (standing). Of the 49 patients, 44 had nonsuppressible aldosterone concentrations with all the clinical characteristics of primary aldosteronism: 22 patients had surgically confirmed unique adenoma, and 22 patients had presumed bilateral hyperplasia. There was a significant correlation between plasma aldosterone values of salt-loaded patients (mean of 8:00 AM and noon results) and the values 2 hours after captopril administration (r=0.8, P<0.01). Plasma aldosterone cumulative distribution curves in primary aldosteronism patients (adenoma and hyperplasia) were not significantly different between the 2 suppression tests. Our results showed that the captopril suppression test is as effective as sodium loading in confirming the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.", 
    "445": "We examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the beta-blocker propranolol on dilator responses of cerebral arterioles in chronic hypertension. Dilator responses to acute hypotension were examined in untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) that were untreated or treated for 3 months with a low (0.3 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) or a high (2 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) dose of perindopril or a dose of propranolol (250 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) alone or in combination with the low dose of perindopril. Pressure (servo-null) and diameter were measured in cerebral arterioles during acute reductions in arterial pressure both before and during maximal dilatation (EDTA). The high dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and perindopril normalized cerebral arteriolar pressure (52+/-2 [mean+/-SEM], 49+/-2 mm Hg versus 50+/-2 mm Hg in WKY and 96+/-3 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05). In contrast, the low dose of perindopril or propranolol alone did not normalize arteriolar pressure (74+/-2 mm Hg and 58+/-3 mm Hg). Both the low and high doses of perindopril improved autoregulatory dilatation, maximal dilatation, and dilator reserve of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP, with the low dose of perindopril being almost as effective as the high dose of perindopril. Propranolol alone did not significantly improve dilator function of cerebral arterioles. Furthermore, dilator function of cerebral arterioles was not further improved by the addition of propranolol to the low dose of perindopril. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as perindopril, may be more effective than propranolol in attenuating the impairment of cerebral autoregulatory vasodilatation, maximal dilatation, and dilator reserve during treatment of chronic hypertension.", 
    "446": "Initial pharmacologic therapy for hypertension is low-dose thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Increasing data have confirmed that ACE inhibitors have specific benefit in patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis, left ventricular dysfunction, and renal insufficiency. CCBs are alternative agents for ISH in the elderly and appear to decrease stroke with perhaps less protection against progression of renal insufficiency and proteinuria, CAD mortality and new onset heart failure versus other initial agents, especially ACE inhibitors. ARBs are well tolerated and effective blood pressure lowering agents but have not been confirmed as effective as ACE inhibitors for reducing renal progression, clinical events, or mortality from heart failure. Effective pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy may avoid disabling and undetected cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and disturbing symptoms of elevated blood pressure. Vasopeptidase inhibitor, such as omapatrilat, and endothelin-1 antagonist, such as bosentan, may become future agents approved for the reduction of morbidity and mortality with hypertension. The ALLHAT trial continues to examine the potential benefits and harms of amlodipine versus chlorthalidone and lisinopril in a diverse high-risk population. Based on ALLHAT data, however, doxazosin is no longer an acceptable initial pharmacological agent. Intensive pharmacologic treatment with blood pressure lowering to less than 130/85 mm Hg is recommended with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and heart failure with additional goal of less than 125/75 mm Hg with renal failure and proteinuria greater than 1 g/24 h, based on multiple outcome studies.",

Angiotensin II through the activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system has been the principal focus therapy over the last 2 decades. New agents that target selective blockade of the angiotensin II receptor have been introduced in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. Aldosterone has been identified as a critically important neurohormone with direct detrimental effects on the myocardium. Aldosterone antagonists have been used in clinical trials to improve mortality in patients with chronic heart failure.",

Patients (n = 277) were randomised, double-blind and allocated to receive either P/I or L50 once daily for a period of 12 weeks. Responder and normalisation rates in the two groups were compared by a chi 2 test. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results were compared using the one-tailed Student's t-test. Normalisation rates were significantly greater in the P/I group (76.0%) than in the L50 group (60.0%) (p = 0.009). Responder rates were significantly higher in the P/I group (91.7%) than in the L50 group (81.8%) (p = 0.025). The average blood pressure reductions were: in sSBP (P/I-L50 = -2.4 mmHg; CI: 6.2; 1.3) and sDBP (P/I-L50 = -2.0 mmHg; CI: -4.2; 0.2). The average night-time SBP decrease (ABPM) was significantly greater in the P/I group (p = 0.041). The tolerability was comparable between the two groups in terms of emergent adverse events related to treatment (12.4% for P/I patients and 8.4% for L50 patients). Laboratory evaluations did not show any significant variations. It was concluded the low-dose P/I combination had significantly higher responder and normalisation rates than L50. This study also confirmed the good tolerability of both treatments.",

We therefore compared in anaesthetized obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats (ZOs) the effects of captopril (2 mg kg(-1), i.v.+2 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), retrothiorphan (25 mg kg(-1), i.v. +25 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), a selective NEP inhibitor, and mixanpril (25 mg kg(-1), i.v. +25 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), a dual ACE/NEP inhibitor, on IMGD using hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp technique. The role of the kinin-NO pathway in the effects of mixanpril was tested using a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (Hoe-140, 300 microg kg(-1)) and a NO-synthase inhibitor (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME, 10 mg kg(-1) i.v. +10 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) as pretreatments. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was lower in ZO controls than in lean littermates. Increases in ISI were observed in captopril- and retrothiorphan-treated ZOs. In mixanpril-treated ZOs, ISI was further increased, compared to captopril- and retrothiorphan-treated ZOs. In ZOs, Hoe-140 and L-NAME alone did not significantly alter and slightly reduced the ISI respectively. Hoe-140 and L-NAME markedly inhibited the ISI improvement induced by mixanpril. These results show that in obese insulin-resistant Zucker rats, under acute conditions, NEP or ACE inhibition can improve IMGD and that dual ACE/NEP inhibition improves IMGD more effectively than does either single inhibition. This effect is linked to an increased activation of the kinin-NO pathway.", 
    "455": "In adult mammalian kidney, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is found in a restricted subpopulation of cells. The two sites of renal COX-2 localization detected in all species to date are the macula densa (MD) and associated cortical thick ascending limb (cTALH) and medullary interstitial cells (MICs). Physiological regulation of COX-2 in these cellular compartments suggests functional roles for eicosanoid products of the enzyme. COX-2 expression increases in high-renin states (salt restriction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, renovascular hypertension), and selective COX-2 inhibitors significantly decrease plasma renin levels, renal renin activity, and mRNA expression. There is evidence for negative regulation of MD/cTALH COX-2 by angiotensin II and by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Conversely, nitric oxide generated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase is a positive modulator of COX-2 expression. Decreased extracellular chloride increases COX-2 expression in cultured cTALH, an effect mediated by increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and, in vivo, a sodium-deficient diet increases expression of activated p38 in MD/cTALH. In contrast to COX-2 in MD/cTALH, COX-2 expression increases in MICs in response to a high-salt diet as well as water deprivation. Studies in cultured MICs have confirmed that expression is increased in response to hypertonicity and is mediated, at least in part, by nuclear factor-kappaB activation. COX-2 inhibition leads to apoptosis of MICs in response to hypertonicity in vitro and after water deprivation in vivo. In addition, COX-2 metabolites appear to be important mediators of medullary blood flow and renal salt handling. Therefore, there is increasing evidence that COX-2 is an important physiological mediator of kidney function.",

Plasma ANP tended to increase in MI rats and was further increased by quinapril. ANP was decreased in 12 brain areas of MI rats. ANP concentration was also significantly decreased by quinapril in six brain nuclei including subfornical organ and organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (areas lacking blood-brain barrier), and by losartan in 16 brain nuclei outside and within the blood-brain barrier in sham operated rats. However, both quinapril and losartan prevented a further reduction of central ANP as a result of myocardial infarction. These data suggest that there are effects on central ANP that result from chronic left ventricular dysfunction as well as an ACE-inhibitor and AT1-antagonist. Mechanisms and consequences of central ANP depression remain unclear. They could, however, support systemic vasoconstriction and sodium and fluid retention.",

    "489": "Bradykinin triggers early PC. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase local bradykinin levels via inhibition of kinin breakdown and have been shown in experimental studies to augment early protection afforded by PC. A role for bradykinin in eliciting delayed PC has not so far been identified.",

On day 1 (closed chest), pigs were either sham-operated (group 1) or preconditioned, using balloon catheter inflation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, with either a full (4 x 5 min PC, group 2) or subthreshold PC stimulus (2 x 2 min PC, group 3). Additional groups were pre-treated with perindoprilat (0.06 mg/kg i.v.) before sham (group 4) or subthreshold PC (group 5). On day 2 (open chest), all pigs were subjected to 40 min occlusion of the LAD followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was determined by tetrazolium staining.",

Groups 3 and 4 had infarct sizes not statistically different from group 1. However, combining perindoprilat with subthreshold PC resulted in a significant limitation of the infarction (18.4+/-3.1% p < 0.05), comparable with group 2.",

    "494": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of CHF, and aldosterone levels closely relate to outcome in patients with CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suppress the RAAS, but a significant proportion of patients exhibit elevated serum levels of aldosterone despite long-term administration of apparently adequate doses of these agents.", 
    "495": "We prospectively studied 132 patients with CHF (ejection fraction <45%) receiving long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors for over six months. Patients taking aldosterone antagonists were excluded from the study. \"Aldosterone escape\" was defined as being present when plasma aldosterone levels were above the normal range in our laboratory (>42 nmol/L). Patients were then divided into two subgroups according to the presence (group 1) or absence (group 2) of aldosterone escape. Genotype analysis for the ACE I/D polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "496": "The prevalence of aldosterone escape in our patients was 10% (13/132). The two groups of patients did not differ regarding the dose of ACE inhibitor, diuretics and their renal function. There was a statistically significant different distribution of genotypes between the two groups, with a higher proportion of DD genotype in group 1 compared with group 2 (62% vs. 24%, p = 0.005).", 
    "497": "Patients with CHF with aldosterone escape have a higher prevalence of DD genotype compared with patients with aldosterone within the normal limits.

Experimental evidence suggests that aldosterone may have detrimental effects on the autonomic nervous system, especially during the morning hours.", 
    "500": "Twenty-eight patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV CHF received spironolactone 50 mg daily and placebo for four weeks each in a double-blind crossover fashion. After each treatment phase, a full circadian assessment was undertaken of spironolactone's autonomic effects. The assessment included monitoring heart rate, QT dispersion, continuous Holter recordings, heart rate variability (HRV) and norepinephrine kinetics.", 
    "501": "Spironolactone significantly reduced all indices of QT dispersion. The reductions in QTcmax, QTd and QTcd were greatest at 6 AM. In addition, spironolactone had favorable autonomic effects, which were limited to the morning (6-10 AM), including heart rate reduction and an improvement in HRV.", 
    "502": "Spironolactone reduced heart rate and improved HRV and QT dispersion in CHF. Its effects were particularly prominent during the morning hours.", 
    "503": "Heart failure (HF) is associated with weight loss, and cachexia is a well-recognized complication. Patients have an increased risk of osteoporosis and lose muscle bulk early in the course of the disease. Basal metabolic rate is increased in HF, but general malnutrition may play a part in the development of cachexia, particularly in an elderly population. There is evidence for a possible role for micronutrient deficiency in HF. Selective deficiency of selenium, calcium and thiamine can directly lead to the HF syndrome. Other nutrients, particularly vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, are antioxidants and may have a protective effect on the vasculature. Vitamins B6, B12 and folate all tend to reduce levels of homocysteine, which is associated with increased oxidative stress. Carnitine, co-enzyme Q10 and creatine supplementation have resulted in improved exercise capacity in patients with HF in some studies. In this article, we review the relation between micronutrients and HF. Chronic HF is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and research effort has centered on pharmacological management, with the successful introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists into routine practice. There is sufficient evidence to support a large-scale trial of dietary micronutrient supplementation in HF.", 
    "504": "The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) has been one of the most remarkable stories in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have several acute and sustained hemodynamic effects that are beneficial in the presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. They increase cardiac output and stroke volume and reduce systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The hemodynamic benefits are associated with improvement in the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as decreased mortality, regardless of the severity of CHF. In patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, therapy with ACE inhibitors prevented the development of CHF and reduced hospitalization and cardiovascular death. They also increase survival when administered early after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Most recently, ACE inhibition was associated with improved clinical outcomes in a broad spectrum of high-risk patients with preserved LV function. The mechanism of ACE inhibitors benefits is multifactorial and includes prevention of progressive LV remodeling, prevention of sudden death and arrhythmogenicity and structural stability of the atherosclerotic process. Evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors are underutilized in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Efforts should be directed to prescribe ACE inhibitors to appropriate patients in target doses. It is reasonable to believe that ACE inhibitors have a class effect in the management of LV dysfunction with or without CHF and acute MI. Whether the same is true for ACE inhibitors in the prevention of ischemic events is not known yet.", 
    "505": "The prevalence of several cardiovascular diseases is increased with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), due to, as yet, unclear reasons. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. In this study, plasma ACE activity and the distribution of an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene were determined in OSAS patients and in healthy controls. A total of 63 patients with OSAS (mean+/-SEM 54.5+/-2.5 apnoea/hypopnoeas.h(-1)) and 32 healthy subjects were studied. To avoid potential confounding factors, patients treated with ACE inhibitors or continuous positive airway pressure were excluded, as well as controls in whom a blood sample was not obtained early in the morning. ACE activity was determined spectrophotometrically in 46 OSAS patients and 25 controls. The I/D ACE polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction in 44 patients and 32 controls. ACE activity was higher in OSAS patients (53.9+/-2.5 IU.L(-1)) than in healthy controls (42.4+/-3.1 IU.L(-1), p<0.01). This was independent of the presence of arterial hypertension. The frequency distribution of the DD, II and ID genotypes in OSAS patients (30%, 16%, 54%, respectively) was not significantly different from that seen in healthy subjects (31%, 28%, 41%, respectively, p=0.356). These results indicate that ACE plasma activity is increased in untreated OSAS patients. This increased activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular disease in these patients.", 
    "506": "Plasma angiotensin levels were measured for the first time in a cyclostome, the river lamprey. With the demonstration that angiotensins are present in the circulation, the possibility of a physiological role in the regulation of drinking was re-examined. Angiotensin II and III concentrations and plasma osmolalities were significantly higher in lampreys acclimated to 28 ppt seawater than in those acclimated to freshwater. No changes were found in angiotensin II and III levels 4 h after transfer from freshwater to 50% seawater, although plasma osmolality had started to rise by this time. There was a suggestion that plasma angiotensin II levels might be related to osmolality in the transfer experiment. Injection of Asp(1)Val(5)- or Asn(1)Val(5)-angiotensin II (40-169 microg/kg body wt.) did not stimulate drinking in freshwater-acclimated lampreys, even when they were still capable of drinking. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the smooth muscle relaxant papaverine both reduced drinking rate in 50% seawater-acclimated lampreys. The data do not provide direct evidence for the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of drinking behaviour in the lamprey. Indirect evidence from the captopril effect is suggestive, but could have other explanations.", 
    "507": "In an ovine model of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after transmural anteroapical myocardial infarction (MI), we have previously demonstrated that the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT(1) receptor blockade is more effective at limiting LV remodeling than either therapy alone. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of combined therapy is due in part to upregulation of AT(2) receptor levels.", 
    "508": "Two days after transmural anteroapical MI by coronary ligation, 16 sheep were randomized to losartan (50 mg/day), ramipril (10 mg/day), ramipril+losartan (combined therapy), or no therapy. At 8 weeks after MI, radioligand receptor assay were deployed with homogenates from regional LV tissues.", 
    "509": "We found that AT receptors in normal sheep myocardium are predominantly of the AT(2) receptor subtype. Binding studies of remodeled myocardium 8 weeks later showed that the apparent maximum binding (B(max)) was increased from 23 to 48 fmol/mg protein only in animals with combined therapy. The AT(2)/AT(1) proportion was increased significantly in animals with combined therapy compared to infarcted controls (18.0 vs. 5.17).", 
    "510": "These results indicate that AT(2) receptor expression increased significantly during LV remodeling with combined therapy but not with either therapy alone. In combination with prior work demonstrating the effectiveness of combined therapy in limiting LV remodeling, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that AT(2) receptors play a cardioprotective role in LV remodeling after MI.", 
    "511": "Perindopril erbumine (perindopril) is a prodrug ester of perindoprilat, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly reduces supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline values in hypertensive patients. These reductions are maintained for at least 24 hours, as evidenced by trough/peak ratios of >50%. Vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension were improved or normalised during perindopril treatment. Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly decreased carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), improved arterial compliance, reduced left ventricular mass index and, in patients with recent cerebral ischaemia and/or stroke, preserved cerebral blood flow despite significantly reducing SBP and DBP. Further research is needed to establish the significance of promising results showing that reductions in aortic PWV were associated with reduced mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure, a third of whom received perindopril. Response rates (numbers of patients with supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) were significantly higher with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily (67 to 80%) than with captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily (44 to 57%) in 3 randomised double-blind trials. In other clinical trials, the antihypertensive effects of perindopril were similar to those of other ACE inhibitors (including enalapril) and calcium-channel antagonists. Combination treatment with perindopril and an antihypertensive agent from another treatment class provided additional benefits, either as first-line treatment or in patients failing to respond to monotherapy. Perindopril monotherapy was also effective in the elderly and in patients with hypertension and concomitant disease. Perindopril has a similar adverse event profile to that of other ACE inhibitors; cough is the most common event reported during treatment, and is also the most common adverse event responsible for treatment withdrawal.", 
    "512": "Perindopril is a well tolerated ACE inhibitor that is significantly better than captopril (in terms of response rates) in the treatment of hypertension, and as effective as other ACE inhibitors. Perindopril appears to reverse some of the vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension, including arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy, although further research is needed to confirm promising results regarding its ability to decrease associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from ongoing studies will help confirm the place of perindopril in the treatment of hypertension; currently, it is an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "513": "End-stage renal failure (ESRF) represents a major health problem. Early diagnosis and effective measures to slow or to stop renal damage are essential goals for nephrologists to prevent or delay progression to ESRF. Identifying mechanisms of progressive parenchymal injury is instrumental in developing renoprotective strategies. Protein traffic through the glomerular barrier is an important determinant of progression in chronic nephropathies and proteinuria is the best predictor of renal outcome. At the moment, ACE inhibition is the most effective treatment in patients with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies, reducing protein traffic, urinary protein excretion rate and progression to ESRF more effectively than conventional treatment. Low sodium diet and/or diuretic treatment may help to increase the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors by maximally activating the renin-angiotensin system. Intensified blood pressure control, whatever treatment is employed, also enhances the antiproteinuric response to ACE inhibitors. However, since this is not always sufficient to normalise urinary proteins and fully prevent renal damage, additional treatments may be needed in patients poorly or not responding to ACE inhibitors. These may include angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and perhaps low doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Preliminary data on multidrug treatments including these additional antiproteinuric agents are encouraging, but additional studies in larger patient numbers are needed to better define the risk/benefit profile of this innovative approach.", 
    "514": "Our recent studies showed that endothelin (ET)(B) receptors are downregulated in congestive heart failure. These changes in ET(B) receptor density can be prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, suggesting a possible role for angiotensin. Using isolated inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD), we examined the possibility that angiotensin-induced downregulation of ET(B) receptors is accompanied by a decrease in ET(B) receptor mRNA. Binding studies showed that overnight incubation with angiotensin II induced a downregulatiion of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors' density in IMCD by 39% and 29%, respectively. This downregulation in ET receptor density was abolished when IMCD was coincubated with angiotensin II and its receptor antagonist saralasin. Furthermore, when the cells were exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), it resulted in a reduction in ET(A) and ET(B) receptor binding sites by 41% and 34%, respectively, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC). In isolated IMCD, ET-1 induced an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation (705 + 63 to 1,015 + 88 fmol/microg protein/5min, P <.01), and the ET-1-induced accumulation was attenuated in the presence of angiotensin II (641 + 45 to 809 + 46 fmol/microg protein/5min, P <.01). Using competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we also observed downregulation of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mRNA in IMCD treated with angiotensin II (ET(A), 1.09+0.11 v 0.77 + 0.07 amol/microg of total RNA, P <.01; ET(B), 14.80 + 1.95 v 8.65 + 0.67 amol/microg of total RNA, P <.01). The addition of a PKC inhibitor abolished the downregulation of ET(A) and ET(B) receptor mRNA induced by angiotensin II (ET(A), 1.25 + 0.07 v 1.19 + 0.06 amol/microg of total RNA, not significant [NS]; ET(B), 14.36 + 0.83 to 13.68 + 0.64 amol/microg of total RNA, NS). These results suggest that angiotensin II-induced downregulation of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mRNA is mediated by a mechanism involving PKC.", 
    "515": "Diabetes-related cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hypertension is common among diabetics and has the same pathogenetic mechanisms as insulin resistance, in which the activated renin-angiotensin system contributes to the emerging high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is one of the triggering factors for vascular dysfunction and clotting abnormalities and, therefore, for accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes. Glycated hemoglobin levels, as a reflection of the degree of glycemia, are strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and in the general population. Tight glycemic control, the treatment of dyslipidemia and raised blood pressure, in addition to the use of antiplatelet therapy, all powerfully reduce the risks associated with diabetes. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might offer additional cardioprotection to diabetics above that provided by blood pressure reduction.", 
    "516": "In certain groups of patients, treatment of high blood pressure raises particular problems. These groups include, for instance, older people, those with co-existing disease (such as renal disease or diabetes), those of certain racial origin and pregnant women. Here, we discuss the use of antihypertensive drugs in such groups.",

    "519": "We conducted a prospective cohort study through a network of 173 pharmacies across Canada to identify patients with hypertension who were newly prescribed monotherapy with losartan, an ACEI, or a CCB. Individuals were interviewed by telephone 3 times over a 3-month period to determine perceived side effects of the antihypertensive medication prescribed. Data were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model.", 
    "520": "Among the 663 eligible individuals, the 3-month cumulative incidence of perceived side effects was 52.5% (42/80), 60.2% (222/369), and 69.6% (149/214) for those treated with losartan, an ACEI, and a CCB, respectively. After adjustment for sex, age, level of education, number of symptoms perceived the week before entering the study, prior use of antihypertensive drugs, current use of any other drug, drug insurance coverage, and duration of hypertension, the odds of reporting a side effect were significantly higher among patients treated with an ACEI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78: 95% CI, 1.02-3.12) or a CCB (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.47-4.78) compared with patients treated with losartan.", 
    "521": "In a community-based setting, we observed that losartan is better tolerated than ACEIs and CCBs. Given that the occurrence of side effects may contribute to lower adherence to drug treatment, the low incidence of side effects associated with losartan makes it an attractive antihypertensive drug choice.", 
    "522": "The chromatographic behaviour of the ACE inhibitors lisinopril, enalapril and its two degradation products, enalaprilat (hydrolytic degradation product) and diketopiperazine (DKP) (cyclization degradation product) was studied as a function of column temperature and pH of the mobile phase. The rate of isomerization (which influences the peak shape or even peak splitting during chromatographic analysis) increases with temperature. The shape of the chromatographic peak for enalapril, enalaprilat and lisinopril is also pH dependent. At high temperature (80 degrees C) and low pH (pH=2) all studied compounds appear on the chromatogram as a narrow chromatographic peak. Chromatographic peaks become broader or they split by lowering the column temperature. Enalapril appears at 6 degrees C on the chromatogram in two peaks which belong to its cis- and trans-rotation isomers. Separation of the rotamers was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.", 
    "523": "Recent studies in homogenized hearts suggest that chymase rather than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is responsible for cardiac angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion. We investigated in intact rat hearts whether (i) enzymes other than ACE contribute to angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion and (ii) the localization (endothelial/extra-endothelial) of converting enzymes.", 
    "524": "We used a modified version of the rat Langendorff heart, allowing separate collection of coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. Hearts were perfused with angiotensin I (arterial concentration 5-10 pmol/ml) under control conditions, in the presence of captopril (1 micromol/l) or after endothelium removal with 0.2% triton X-100. Endothelium removal was verified as the absence of a coronary vasodilator response to 10 nmol bradykinin. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II were measured in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid with sensitive radioimmunoassays.", 
    "525": "In control hearts, 45% of arterial angiotensin I was metabolized during coronary passage, partly through conversion to angiotensin II. At steady-state, the angiotensin I concentration in interstitial fluid was three to four-fold lower than in coronary effluent, while the angiotensin II concentrations in both fluids were similar. Captopril and endothelium removal did not affect coronary angiotensin I extraction, but increased the interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin I two- and three-fold, respectively, thereby demonstrating that metabolism (by ACE) as well as the physical presence of the endothelium normally prevent arterial angiotensin I from reaching similar levels in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. Captopril, but not endothelium removal, greatly reduced the angiotensin II levels in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. With the ACE inhibitor, the angiotensin II/I ratios in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid were 83 and 93% lower, while after endothelium removal, the ratios were 33 and 71% lower.",

In-vivo NEP and ACE inhibition was studied using in-vitro autoradiography in rats that received oral gemopatrilat (1, 3, 10 mg/kg; n = 4 per dose) and were killed 1 h later, or received oral gemopatrilat (3, 10 mg/kg) and were killed at time points 1, 2, 4, 8, 18, 24 and 48 h (n = 4 per time point).",

    "531": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) comprises an enormous public health burden, with an increasing incidence and prevalence. Hypertension is a major risk factor for progressive renal disease. This escalating prevalence suggests that newer therapeutic interventions and strategies are needed to complement current antihypertensive approaches. Although much evidence demonstrates that angiotensin II mediates progressive renal disease, recent evidence also implicates aldosterone as an important pathogenetic factor in progressive renal disease. Several lines of experimental evidence demonstrate that selective blockade of aldosterone, independent of renin-angiotensin blockade, reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat model and reduces proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in the subtotally nephrectomized rat model (i.e. remnant kidney). Whereas pharmacological blockade with angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis/ glomerulosclerosis, selective reinfusion of aldosterone restores these abnormalities despite continued renin-angiotensin blockade. Aldosterone may promote fibrosis by several mechanisms, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and consequent alterations of vascular fibrinolysis, by stimulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1, and by stimulation of reactive oxygen species. Based on this theoretical construct, randomized clinical studies will be initiated to delineate the potential renal-protective effects of antihypertensive therapy utilizing aldosterone receptor blockade.",

Treatment with an ACE inhibitor has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination.",

After enrollment, patients were followed prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21 months or until the need for dialysis.

Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p = 0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the treatment.",

There were corresponding reductions in sitting systolic blood pressure and standing blood pressure. At least one adverse event was reported by 46% of patients in the imidapril group and 53% of patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group.

The potentiometric, enantioselective membrane electrodes can be used reliably for the assay of S-captopril as raw material and in pharmaceutical formulations such as Novocaptopril tablets, by use of direct potentiometry. The best response was obtained when maltodextrin with higher DE was used for construction of the electrode. The best enantioselectivity and time-stability was achieved for the lower DE maltodextrin. L-proline was found to be the main interferent for all the proposed electrodes. The surface of the electrodes can be regenerated by simply polishing; this furnishes a fresh surface ready for use in a new assay.", 
    "538": "Angiotensin II not only elevates arterial pressure, it adversely alters hemodynamics and cardiovascular structure and exacerbates the course of hypertensive disease. Alterations in coronary hemodynamics, including reductions in coronary blood flow and flow reserve, reflect the pathophysiology of arteriolar disease and associated endothelial dysfunction thereby promoting coronary insufficiency and increasing overall cardiovascular risk. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, coronary flow reserve, the difference between basal coronary blood flow and the flow achieved during maximal coronary vasodilation achieved by physiological or pharmacological interventions, is drastically impaired at rest; however, it can be improved significantly by pharmacological agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, alone or in combination. The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin-II (type 1) receptor blocker, in equidepressor doses, markedly improved coronary flow reserve to levels seen in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats after 12 weeks of treatment, while diminishing cardiovascular mass and improving systemic hemodynamics and ventricular metabolic demands. These findings suggest the potential merits for clinical studies employing the combination of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in patients with hypertension and hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "539": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, originally designed to treat hypertension, were quickly demonstrated to confer hemodynamic and survival benefit to patients with congestive heart failure. Extending this paradigm to patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), ACE inhibitors were shown to attenuate ventricular remodeling and reduce mortality. An unexpected finding that ACE inhibitors could reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction, prompted enormous interest in their anti-ischemic potential. Indeed, a significant body of experimental literature supports the concept that ACE inhibitors have direct anti-atherosclerotic and anti-ischemic effect. Recent clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitors confer significant protection from ischemic events.", 
    "540": "The renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are increasingly being implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and its sequelae and the potential of ACE inhibitors to protect the heart is a topic that has emerged recently as a matter for scientific discussion. Experimental and clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on the metabolism, function and structure of healthy and damaged hearts and these data support the concept of both primary and secondary cardioprotection with this class of drugs. Animal studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of ACE inhibition at a variety of sites, including improvement of endothelial function, inhibition of platelet aggregation, prevention of atherosclerotic lesions and inhibition of myointimal proliferation, extending the concept to a more general definition of cardiovascular protection with ACE inhibitors involving both the heart and the vessels. ACE inhibitors prevent stimulation of smooth muscle cell angiotensin-II (A-II) receptors, thereby blocking both contractile and proliferative actions of A-II. In addition, ACE inhibition of kininase inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin, a direct stimulant of nitric oxide release from the intact endothelial cell. Thus, at the cellular level ACE inhibition shifts the balance of ongoing mechanisms in favour of those promoting vasodilatory, anti-aggregatory, antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects. Although these data have not all been validated in human studies, the reduction of ischemic events in studies of ACE inhibition in left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and, more recently, also in patients without LVD, cannot be explained solely by improved hemodynamics, and it is possible that actions on the endothelium, the atherosclerotic process and platelets are at least in part responsible. So, the available data underlie the potential benefits of ACE inhibition in the field of ischemic heart disease and atherosclerosis; the results of ongoing studies in humans looking more directly at the influence of ACE inhibitors in this setting are awaited with interest.", 
    "541": "Endothelial cells are a rich source of a variety of vasoactive substances, which either cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Important endothelium-derived vasodilators are prostacyclin, bradykinin, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In particular, nitric oxide inhibits cellular growth and migration. In concert with prostacyclin. nitric oxide exerts potent anti-atherogenic and thromboresistant properties by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. Endothelium-derived contracting factors include the 21 amino acid peptide endothelin (ET). vasoconstrictor prostanoids such as thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2, as well as free radicals and components of the renin angiotensin system. In hypertension, elevated blood pressure transmits into cardiovascular disease by causing endothelial dysfunction. Hence, modem therapeutic strategies in human hypertension focus on preserving or restoring endothelial integrity. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a primary candidate for that concept as they inhibit the circulating and local renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin converting enzyme is an endothelial enzyme which converts angiotensin-I (A-I) into angiotensin-II (A-II). This effect of the ACE inhibitor prevents direct effects of angiotensin-II such as vasoconstriction and proliferation in the vessel wall but also prevents activation of the ET system and of plasminogen activator inhibitor. Furthermore, inhibition of ACE prolongs the half-life of bradykinin and stabilizes bradykinin receptors linked to the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In isolated arteries ACE inhibitors prevent the contractions induced by angiotensin II and enhance relaxation induced by bradykinin. Chronic treatment of experimental hypertension with ACE inhibitors normalizes endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and other agonists. In addition, the dilator effects of exogenous nitric oxide donors are enhanced, at least in certain models of hypertension. In humans with essential hypertension ACE inhibitors augment endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin, while those to acetylcholine remain unaffected, at least in the time frame of the published studies, i.e. 3-6 months. In patients with coronary artery disease, however, paradoxical vasoconstriction to acetylcholine is markedly reduced after 6 months of ACE inhibition. After myocardial infarction ACE inhibitors reduce the development of overt heart failure, the occurrence of reinfarction and cardiovascular death in hypertensive patients. These effects have also been demonstrated in a subgroup analysis of the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial. Thus, in summary, ACE inhibitors are an important class of drugs providing cardiovascular protection in patients with increased cardiovascular risk.", 
    "542": "Actions mediated by the renin-angiotensin system may be inhibited at various levels: renin itself may be inhibited, angiotensin-I (A-1) conversion to angiotensin-II (A-II), or binding of A-II at the A-II type 1 (A-II1) receptor. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the A-II1 receptor antagonists are now clinically established. Because ACE is a relatively unspecific peptidase which catalyses the breakdown of A-I, bradykinin and neuropeptides like substance P and neurotensin, the effects of ACE inhibitors go far beyond the prevention of A-II production. On the other hand, in certain tissues like vascular and cardiac tissue, A-II is produced by other enzymes, for instance chymase, and ACE inhibitors do not consistently prevent A-II production. The action of A-II1 receptor antagonists may also not be confined to prevention of binding of A-II at the A-II1 receptor, as by rebound more A-II may bind at the A-II type 2 (A-II2) receptor and thus mediate until now not well defined effects. Thus, anti-ischemic actions of these drugs may be related to multiple mechanisms. Inhibition of A-II effects at the A-II1 receptor may prevent systemic and coronary vasoconstriction and growth effects of A-II on various cell types. In addition, A-II may potentiate, by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Prevention of breakdown of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin may result in direct vasodilation or release of nitrous oxide from the endothelium. Thus, growth-inhibiting effects may also be mediated. All these mechanisms seem to direct to a reduction of cardiac load by vasodilation and to a limitation of cardiovascular cell growth. While the systemic circulating renin-angiotensin system is probably responsible for control of cardiac load, local systems seem to control cell growth. Systemic effects seem to depend on activation of the renin-angiotensin system which has been shown in various ischemic syndromes. Activation of various components of the renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated in myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction and coronary occlusion and reperfusion models as well as in chronic left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction. While animal models of stress-induced myocardial ischemia have revealed predominantly positive results, clinical studies, which mostly were small and not well controlled, were equivocal. Large clinical trials with ACE inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction showed small benefits over placebo. Hypotension seems to be a critical side-effect in this situation. Experimental models show protective effects of both ACE inhibitors and A-II1 receptor antagonists in the situation of ischemia and reperfusion. New data on large clinical trials in patients at risk of cardiovascular events but normal left ventricular function demonstrate clear benefits of an ACE inhibitor. Large clinical trials in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction show reduction of ischemic events.", 
    "543": "Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats fed high-salt diet exert compensated left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and eventually develop heart failure. Oxidative stress has been shown to be involved in myocardial remodeling and failure and thus might play an important role in this transition from hypertrophy to failure. We measured the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the myocardium from DS rats by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl (hydroxy-TEMPO) and also examined the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the transition. We divided DS rats (5 weeks old, 150-200 g) into three groups: low-salt (0.3% NaCl) diet for 10 weeks (LS group), high-salt (8% NaCl) diet for 10 weeks (HS-10+V group), and high-salt diet and cilazapril (10 mg/kg body weight per day) started after 5 weeks of high-salt diet and maintained for 5 weeks (HS-10+Cil group). Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) was significantly elevated in the HS-10+V (229+/-5) and HS-10+Cil (209+/-5) groups compared with the LS group (141+/-2). The amount of myocardial ROS was not changed after 5 weeks of high-salt diet, but significantly increased in HS-10+V rats compared with LS rats, and was abolished in the HS-10+Cil group. HS-10+V rats exerted the clinical signs of heart failure, including increased lung weight and pleural effusion, associated with LV hypertrophy and LV cavity dilatation. In the HS-10+Cil group, signs of heart failure were significantly attenuated despite only a modest reduction in systolic blood pressure (-20 mm Hg). The progression of LV failure after hypertrophy in high-salt-loaded DS hypertensive rats was associated with increased myocardial ROS, and ACE inhibitor could prevent this transition from compensated hypertrophy to failure.", 
    "544": "Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, was developed as a more specific alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. At a daily dose of 50 mg, losartan is currently evaluated in large outcome trials involving patients with hypertension and postmyocardial infarction. The current study evaluated the level and duration of blockade of a pressor response to angiotensin II by 50 and 150 mg of losartan, compared with 32 mg of candesartan. Eight normotensive volunteers were randomly assigned to a single dose of losartan 50 or 150 mg, candesartan 32 mg, or placebo. Subjects were re-randomized after a 2-week washout period to complete all four study arms. Radial artery systolic pressure response to exogenous angiotensin II was measured at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after administration of drug. Losartan 50 mg reduced the pressure response to exogenous angiotensin II significantly only at 6 h. In contrast, candesartan and losartan 150 mg produced a greater reduction in the pressure response to angiotensin II throughout the 24-h period. This suppression was not paralleled by a reduction in resting systemic arterial pressure. Higher doses than 50 mg of losartan might be evaluated to elicit optimal clinical effects.", 
    "545": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease in Westernised society, and more than 50% of individuals with diabetes mellitus die from cardiovascular causes. The underlying metabolic defect of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a combination of insulin resistance and decreased secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta-cells. Insulin resistance commonly precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is usually associated with a metabolic syndrome including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. Treatment of known cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, plays a key role in delaying the onset and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other forms of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Sulphonylureas should be used with caution in patients with CHD but aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors play an important role in the medical management of patients with established coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes mellitus represent a higher risk group of patients after both percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularisation and the decision regarding the choice of revascularisation procedure should take into account angiographic characteristics, clinical status and patient preference. Patients presenting with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction should be considered for reperfusion therapy with either urgent thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention.", 
    "546": "Angiotensin II(AII) accelerates the progress of cardiovascular diseases. This was proved by the fact that the blockade of renin-angiotensin system provided clinical benefits for patients with cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the differences between AT1-receptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor in basic and clinical aspects. Beside decreased AII concentration, increased tissue bradykinin concentration may contribute to the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitor, on the other hand, this increases the rate of cough to decrease the compliance. Increased AII concentration by AII receptor antagonist may antagonize the binding of the drug as well as stimulate AT2 receptor subtype. ACE inhibitor can not block the effect of non-ACE AII formation, but AII receptor does. These differences should be considered for their clinical use.", 
    "547": "The number of classes of antihypertensive drugs has been growing. The options of choice of the drugs now are so great that it seems not to be difficult to reduce blood pressure effectively. Newly developed classes have been shown to provide beneficial effects in variety of hypertension-related processes. However, each drug shows significant differences in adverse effects, incidental properties and interactions with non-antihypertensive drugs. To improve quality of life, compliance with medication, and beneficial effects on pathophysiological and cardiovascular risk conditions of patients, we should be well acquainted with adverse effects and possible disadvantages produced by antihypertensive drugs in particular situations.", 
    "548": "Lifestyle modifications are the first approach to the treatment of dyslipidemia and hypertension, that is, control of overweight; reduced intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium chloride, and alcohol; and increased physical activity. In high doses, thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics can induce at least short-term increases in levels of total plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low-dose thiazide diuretics do not produce these effects. beta-blockers may increase levels of plasma triglycerides transiently and reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. alpha-blockers may decrease serum cholesterol concentration to a modest degree and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and central adrenergic agonists have clinically neutral effects on levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.", 
    "549": "Obesity is often accompanied with hypertension and increases cardiovascular events. Japanese new guideline on identification of obesity includes a modified BMI categories and a method of detection of visceral fat obesity in Japanese. Hyper-insulinemia and leptin released from adipose tissue play an important role in the development of hypertension in obese patients. Insulin and leptin increase sympathetic tone which results in sodium retention and hyper-responsiveness of blood vessels. As leptin has also a direct vasodilative and diuretic action, its effect on blood pressure is bidirectional. Life style modification, especially diet and physical exercise are important to obtain the body weight loss and the improvement of insulin resistance. Dynamic exercise at the level of fifty percent of max VO2 for 30 to 60 minutes over three times a week should be recommended for hypertensive patients with obesity. ACE inhibitors improve the hypersympathetic tone and impaired insulin sensitivity in obese patients. Calcium antagonist is also useful for these patients.", 
    "550": "Based on many epidemiological studies, hypertensive diabetics have been regarded as high risk for cardiovascular disease. The sixth Joint National Committee guideline (JNC VI) recommended to start hypotensive agents even at high normal blood pressure, i.e. over 130/85 mmHg and lower their blood pressure to less than 130/85 mmHg. If patients are associated with renal dysfunction (proteinuria of more than 1 g/day), the target blood pressure would be less than 125/75 mmHg. These target blood pressures were supported Hypertension Optimal Treatment study and/or UKPDS. ACE inhibitors, Ca-antagonists or alpha-blockers were regarded as one of the first line drugs. Japanese Society of Hypertension has established the guideline for hypertension treatment, in which almost the same recommendation has been made for diabetics except one point, i.e., at high normal blood pressure, lifestyle modification might be the initial treatment followed by hypotensive agents if their blood pressure dose not go down to less than 130/85 mmHg during the next 3-6 months. Based on these guidelines, more vigorous antihypertensive treatment would be recommended in diabetics to reduce micro- and macrovascular disease.", 
    "551": "Renal disease constitutes an important determinant of cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanisms for the progression of renal impairment remain fully undetermined, available evidence indicate that renal glomerular hypertension is responsible in part for the development of renal injury. In renal disease, afferent arteriolar tone is reported to be reduced, while the augmented intrarenal angiotensin II serves to act as an efferent arteriolar constrictor, both of which result in an increase in glomerular capillary pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are established as the agent possessing both antihypertensive and renoprotective actions, which exert vasodilator action on efferent arterioles. Calcium antagonists are also reported to have salutary effect on renal disease, although their beneficial action varies depending on the antagonists used and the underlying disease. The use of calcium antagonists, however, is mandatory particularly under the circumstance where renal failure moderately to severely progresses and the ACE-I cannot be used.", 
    "552": "In patients with hypertension and chronic renal parenchymal disease, BP should be controlled to 130/85 mmHg or lower (125/75 mmHg) in patients with proteinuria in excess of 1 g/day. Reducing dietary sodium (< 7 g/day) and protein (< 0.6-0.7 g/kg) helps control high BP and renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. As first antihypertensive drug, ACE inhibitors or long-acting Ca antagonists are recommended. In patients with renovascular hypertension, angioplasty is the first choice increasingly to be accompanied by stenting, and surgical revascularization is the next choice. As antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and AII-receptor blockers are recommended. Hypertension accompanied by endocrine disease with adenoma or tumor is almost cured or improved by surgical removal. Spironolactone and Ca antagonists are used in patients with idiopathic aldosteronism (bilateral hyperplasia). Alpha and beta blockers are used in patients with pheochromocytoma during preoperative period.", 
    "553": "Normal blood pressure and hypertension were defined according to age and sex based on the data on Japanese children. When high blood pressure is found, both white-coat and secondary hypertension should be excluded. Subsequently lifestyle modifications should be initiated in children and adolescents with essential hypertension. These modifications include: weight reduction, reduction of dietary salt intake, high dietary potassium intake and increased physical activity. When nonpharmacologic treatment is not effective after 3 to 6 months, or when there is an evidence of target organ injury, antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors and Ca antagonists will be started to control blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications are also important for primary prevention of hypertension in normotensive children.", 
    "554": "Recently published Hypertension Treatment Guideline by Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH2000) contains several unique suggestions for treatment of elderly hypertension in particular. In general, the therapeutic goal of blood pressure in the elderly is set at a higher level than that in the young. For the patients of age 70 and over blood pressure should be controlled less than 150-160 mmHg. The following drugs are recommended as the first line drug in the elderly hypertension: 1. long-acting Ca antagonists, 2. ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin II antagonists) and 3. small dose of diuretics. Combination therapy should be considered when monotherapy of more than 2 to 3 months is not successful to reduce blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg.", 
    "555": "The number of patients with severe ventricular dysfunction from coronary artery disease is constantly increasing. Although the medical management of these patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers has favorable impact on the morbidity and mortality the overall prognosis is still poor. Historically many of these patients have been referred for transplantation. In the past few years there has been an increasing amount of information about the utility of surgical revascularization in patients with low ejection fraction. Careful patient selection and optimal perioperative management is of critical importance for good outcome. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be performed relatively safely despite the advanced level of left ventricular dysfunction. Quality of life is improved by CABG with elimination of angina and enhanced functional capacity. Improvement in the ejection fraction and increased survival after the operation has been objectively demonstrated. However patients with advanced right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, redo bypass and ungraftable coronaries should be considered for heart transplantation. In this review we describe our experience and focus on pertinent issues in patient selection, perioperative management and long term outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "556": "Vasopeptidase inhibition (VPI) represents a new therapeutic principle including both inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP).

Aortic and renal artery segments were isolated and suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Functional endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity was assessed in native segments and after preincubation with omapatrilat. Furthermore, vascular ECE protein levels as well as plasma and tissue ET-1 levels were determined.", 
    "558": "The increase in systolic blood pressure of salt-fed rats was prevented by omapatrilat and captopril to a comparable degree. In salt-induced hypertension, functional ECE activity (calculated as the ratio of the contraction to big ET-1 divided by the contraction to ET-1) in renal arteries (0.46+/-0.05) and in aorta (0.68+/-0.05) was reduced as compared with control animals (0.9+/-0.05 and 0.99+/-0.04, respectively; P<0.05). While omapatrilat in vitro blunted the response to big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) and diminished ECE activity further (P<0.01 vs native segments), chronic treatment with omapatrilat in vivo restored contractions to ET-1 (120+/-6%) and big ET-1 (98+/-9%) in renal arteries, and therefore normalized renovascular ECE activity. In addition, omapatrilat normalized plasma ET-1 concentrations (12.9+/-1.2 vs 16.6+/-1.4 pg/ml on high salt diet; P<0.05) and renovascular ECE protein levels.", 
    "559": "In salt-induced hypertension, vasopeptidase inhibition restores alterations in the endothelin system, such as renovascular ECE activity and responsiveness to ET-1 and big ET-1 with chronic but not acute in vitro application. Thus, the beneficial effects of vasopeptidase inhibition may reflect a resetting of cardiovascular control systems and therefore may be particularly suited to treat hypertension and heart failure.",

The effect of the co-administration of both B(1) and B(2) kinin receptor antagonists (2.5 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) each) with metallopeptidase inhibitors was also evaluated. The pharmacological treatments were infused subcutaneously using micro-osmotic pumps for 5 days starting 4 days before the ligation of the left coronary artery. Immunoreactive kinins were quantified by highly sensitive and specific competitive enzyme immunoassays. The post-MI mortality of untreated rats with a large MI was high; 74% of rats dying prior to the hemodynamic study. Mortality in the other MI groups was not significantly different from that of the untreated MI rats. Cardiac BK levels were not significantly different in the MI vehicle-treated group compared with the sham-operated rats. Both omapatrilat and enalapril treatments of MI rats significantly increased cardiac BK concentrations compared with the sham-operated group (P < 0.05). However, cardiac BK levels were significantly increased only in the MI omapatrilat-treated rats compared with the MI vehicle-treated group (P < 0.01). Cardiac des-Arg(9)-BK concentrations were not significantly modified by MI, and MI with omapatrilat or enalapril treatment compared with the sham-operated group. The co-administration of both kinin receptor antagonists with MI omapatrilat- and enalapril-treated rats had no significant effect on cardiac BK and des-Arg(9)-BK levels. Thus, the significant increase of cardiac BK concentrations by omapatrilat could be related to a biochemical or a cardiac hemodynamic parameter on early (24 h) post-MI state.",

These renal diseases usually present as a nephrotic syndrome with progressive loss of renal function and an increased risk of mortality. The prevalence and epidemiology of these renal lesions remain largely undefined; however, most studies agree that black race is a major risk factor for HIVAN. Observational studies have suggested that antiretroviral medications and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on slowing the progression of renal disease among patients with HIVAN; however, little is known about the effect of these therapies on other renal lesions. Future research should focus on gaining a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of renal disease among HIV-infected patients as well as on performing controlled studies to test treatment strategies.",

We have investigated the effect of a 50 % reduction in maternal nutrient intake during the last 30 days of pregnancy on arterial blood pressure and on arterial blood pressure responses to angiotensin II (AII) and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in the sheep fetus at 115-125 and at 135-145 days gestation (term = 147 +/- 3 days gestation). 2. Fetal plasma glucose concentrations were lower in the undernourished (UN) group compared to the control animals. There was no difference, however, in fetal plasma cortisol or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentrations between the UN and control groups between 115 and 145 days gestation. 3. During the first 10 days of undernutrition, maternal plasma concentrations of cortisol were increased in the UN group compared to controls. At 115-125 days gestation, fetal arterial blood pressure was also higher in the UN group compared with controls and there was an inverse relationship (r = -0.62, P < 0.05) between mean arterial pressure and the fetal plasma concentrations of ACTH in the UN group. Fetal blood pressure responses to increasing doses of angiotensin II were also higher (P < 0.05) in UN compared to control animals at 115-125 days gestation. 4. Between 135 and 145 days gestation, fetal arterial blood pressure was increased in UN fetal sheep and mean arterial blood pressure was correlated with fetal plasma concentrations of cortisol. 5. Increased arterial blood pressure and responsiveness to AII measured in the fetuses of nutrient-restricted ewes may be related in part to fetal exposure to the actions of cortisol derived from transplacental transfer during the first 10 days after the start of the restricted feeding regime.",

These phenotypic characteristics are similar to those observed in obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy. In this study, the effects of two types of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, an angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist (AT1A) and an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on renal injury in WF rats were studied during the progressive phase of diabetic nephropathy. An AT1A, candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg), and an ACEI, enalapril (10 mg/kg), were administered orally once a day for 12 weeks, beginning when the rats were 27-week-old and already showed diabetic nephropathy and obesity. Both drugs prevented an increase in proteinuria during the experimental period. Furthermore, after 4-week intervention, the levels of proteinuria were markedly lower in drug-treated rats. At the end of the experiment, both drugs prevented the development of glomerular lesions without affecting glucose metabolism and obesity. In conclusion, the inhibition of angiotensin II activity ameliorated both existing proteinuria and the progression of proteinuria, resulting in preservation of glomerular structure. Thus angiotensin II plays important roles in the development and the progression of nephropathy in genetically obese diabetic WF rats.", 
    "567": "During development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, the activity of adrenal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated. SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were studied at different ages: 3-4, 7-8 and 12-13 weeks after birth. Basal NOS activity was measured by the ability of homogenate to convert [3H]-L-arginine to [3H]-L-citrulline. At all ages, SHR rats exhibited 50-60% reduction in NOS activity when compared to age-matched WKY rats. In a following study, SHR rats (12-13 weeks) were treated chronically with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) captopril or enalapril, or the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (2 x 25, 10 and 60 mg/kg per day for 10 days, respectively). The total NOS activity and protein expression of NOS isoenzymes from adrenals were determined. The basal NOS activity and protein expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) was significantly increased in treated SHR rats when compared to control rats. The isoforms endothelial NOS and inducible NOS were undetectable. We conclude that impaired NO synthesis in the adrenal glands of SHR rats may contribute to the onset and maintenance of hypertension. The upregulation of nNOS protein in the adrenal glands may be one of the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists by restoring the NO synthesis, mediate their antihypertensive effects.", 
    "568": "An enquiry was undertaken amongst 71 cardiologists in 1999 evaluating 600 ambulatory patients with cardiac failure (64% men; mean age 73 years; NYHA Class I: 9%, Class II: 52%, Class III: 33%, Class IV: 6%). Cardiac failure is commoner in men (81%) before the age of 70. After the age of 80, the tendency is inversed (53% of women). Fifty-two per cent of patients had a history of hospital admission for cardiac failure: 26% in the year before the enquiry (on average 13.1 days' hospital stay). On inclusion, the diagnosis was made 4.2 +/- 4.6 years previously and the patients had been followed up for an average of 3.04 +/- 3.3 years. The diagnosis of cardiac failure was made by the cardiologist (57%), the general practitioner (37%), or another category of physician (6%). Eight per cent of patients were treated with a single drug before inclusion, 22% had a bi-therapy and 70% a polytherapy. The most frequently prescribed drugs were: diuretics (71%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (54%) and digitalis (35%). The prescription of betablockers was only reported in 14% of the population. In the over-80's, only 45% of patients were prescribed ACE inhibitors. These results confirm that ambulatory patients with cardiac failure are mainly in NYHA Classes II and III, that the pathology concerns elderly patients and that it is the cause of recurrent hospital admission. The prescription of diuretics is the main therapy in all NYHA Classes. ACE inhibitors were only prescribed in 2/3 of patients and in less than half of patients over 80 years of age. The prescription of betablockers remains marginal. The reason for the underprescription of recommended drugs (International Recommendations) would justify further investigation.", 
    "569": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects approximately 1% of people aged 50-59 years, and this high prevalence increases dramatically with age. CHF is a common reason for hospital admission and general practitioner consultation in the elderly. Common causes of CHF are ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis of CHF is based on clinical features and objective measurement of ventricular function (eg, echocardiography). Management is directed at prevention, retarding disease progression, relief of symptoms and prolonging survival. Non-pharmacological approaches include exercise, home-based support and risk-factor modification. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the cornerstone of pharmacological therapy to prevent disease progression and prolong survival. beta-Blockers prolong survival when added to ACE inhibitors in symptomatic patients. Diuretics provide symptom relief and restoration or maintenance of euvolaemia. Spironolactone, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and digoxin may be useful in some patients. Surgical approaches in highly selected patients may include myocardial revascularisation, insertion of devices and cardiac transplantation.",

    "576": "A 65-year-old Japanese woman with dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism and refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia experienced a near-death hypoglycemic syncope. The attack seemed to be induced by a high level of serum insulin, probably due to cibenzoline and by concomitant use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Additionally, decreased food intake because of a severe toothache may have contributed to the deterioration of her condition. This case warns cardiologists that a combined cibenzoline and ACEI therapy can provoke serious adverse effects such as hypoglycemic syncope in the elderly. Therefore, the possibility of a hypoglycemic attack associated with these drugs should be explained to patients who are in poor condition.",

Thirty patients were randomized in a double blind fashion to receive a single dose of either FOS 10 mg, CAP 6.25 mg or placebo. CAP produced a significant early and brief fall in BP, while the first-dose hypotensive response with FOS did not differ significantly from placebo. Baseline plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was similar in all groups. Only CAP showed an acute and significant fall in plasma ACE activity, whereas FOS and placebo did not change ACE activity. There was no correlation between mean arterial pressure or percentile change in mean arterial pressure and plasma ACE activity. Also no correlation was found between high or low ACE activity level and first dose hypotension. The practical importance of the results are: For patients with congestive heart failure. FOS and CAP have different effects on BP after the first dose, and this effect may be dependent on the plasma ACE activity level. FOS produces ACE inhibition and BP changes similar to placebo so it is the safer choice for the treatment of congestive heart failure.",

    "582": "Reference pricing pharmaceuticals in New Zealand involves reimbursing drugs at the lowest price ruling in a given therapeutic subgroup, and has been argued to promote competition leading to equalised prices among similar drugs. Disappointment at the inability to contain public drug expenditures sufficiently has led to the augmentation of reference pricing with cross-product strategic agreements. These require firms seeking subsidisation of new drugs to significantly reduce their prices in unrelated markets, typically for relatively unpopular drugs. An examination of the markets for statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in New Zealand shows that in neither case has price matching voluntarily accompanied these agreements. Although imperfect drug substitutability appears to be an important factor in explaining some of these results, particularly for statins, intrafirm cross-subsidisation induced by agreements and industry concern about international benchmarking of drug prices are proposed as major likely sources of influence.", 
    "583": "Familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a heterogeneous renal disease characterized by proteinuria and an unremitting deterioration of renal excretory function. Previous studies showed corticosteroid unresponsiveness and a variable response to cyclophosphamide therapy. We hypothesized that treatment with pulse methylprednisolone therapy (PMT), alternate-day corticosteroids, and cyclosphosphamide or cyclosporine would decrease proteinuria in patients with familial FSGS. Two adolescent brothers, 13 and 16 years old, presented with nephrotic range proteinuria, but with normal renal excretory function. Both brothers had renal biopsies that showed FSGS with mesangial hypercellularity and tubular atrophy. Intravenous PMT, at doses of 1 g, was initiated per the Tune-Mendoza protocol. Both patients received lisinopril therapy. One brother (case 1) was treated with PMT, alternate-day corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide (total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose was 154.3 mg/kg). Urinary protein-to-urinary creatinine (UP/UC) ratios decreased from 6.79 to 3.79. Cyclosporine therapy decreased the UP/UC further from 2.48 to 0.76 at the end of PMT. The other brother (case 2), treated with PMT, alternate-day corticosteroids, and cyclosporine, experienced a decrease in UP/UC from 7.27 to 1.14. At the time of last evaluation, approximately 7 months after the last PMT dose, the UP/UC ratios were 0.27 (case 1) and 0.37 (case 2). PMT-attributable adverse effects were not severe. Both patients continued to receive oral cyclosporine and lisinopril after completion of PMT. PMT and cyclosporine therapy may reduce proteinuria, without decreasing renal excretory function, in some patients with familial FSGS. Further evaluation of cyclosporine therapy and PMT of patients with familial FSGS is warranted.", 
    "584": "The most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States is diabetes mellitus. Data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that near-normalization of blood glucose levels results in a significant reduction in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. The UKPDS, however, clearly demonstrated that tight control of blood pressure in patients with diabetes is associated with reductions in macrovascular disease. Hypertension is also a major contributor to the development of diabetic renal disease. It is currently recommended that individuals with diabetes maintain a blood pressure level of less than 130/85 to maximize renal protection. It is essential that health care practitioners are aware of the importance of assessing early evidence of renal disease such as microalbuminuria and monitoring the progression of nephropathy.

Discussions of risk factors and secondary and tertiary prevention of CHF caused by anthracycline chemotherapy agents are also included. Recognition of risk factors and symptoms of CHF is essential to minimize the morbidity and mortality that accompanies cardiac failure and is an important part of the comprehensive care of breast cancer patients.

    "603": "1. Obese Zucker rats (OZR) were shown to be salt-sensitive in that they develop hypertension when placed on a high-salt diet. Because angiotensin (Ang) II is a major antinatriuretic factor, the present studies were undertaken to determine whether the characteristic of salt-sensitivity of OZR is associated with an enhanced antinatriuretic function of endogenous AngII. 2. The extent of AngII-mediated antinatriuresis was investigated in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) using candesartan (100 microg/kg, i.v.), a selective angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, and ramipril (1 mg/kg, i.v.), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The total number of AngII binding sites and their affinity were also assessed in renal cortical tubular membrane preparations of OZR and LZR using a specific radioligand-binding assay. Plasma renin activity was determined using a standard radioimmunoassay. 3. Both candesartan and ramipril produced substantially greater increases in urinary sodium excretion and urine flow in OZR and these effects were significantly greater than those observed in LZR. These observations suggest that basal antinatriuretic function of endogenous AngII is exaggerated in OZR. 4. The functional overexpression of AngII was not due to any alterations in the affinity or the total number of AngII binding sites in renal cortical tubular membranes. Higher plasma renin values in the OZR could have contributed to the phenomenon. 5. In conclusion, marked diuresis and natriuresis after AT1 receptor blockade and/or ACE inhibition suggest that the extent of endogenous AngII-mediated sodium transport under basal conditions is greatly augmented in OZR. It is proposed this phenomenon may be a contributing factor for the salt- sensitivity in the OZR.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the direct effect on endothelium- dependent vasodilation (EDV) of different pharmacological drugs commonly used in the treatment of these conditions. 2. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 37 young healthy normotensive subjects with venous occlusion plethysmography during local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine (MCh; 2-4 microg/min), evaluating EDV, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 5-10 microg/min), evaluating endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV). The measurements of EDV and EIDV were undertaken under baseline conditions and were repeated after 1 h intra-arterial infusion of digoxin (0.1 mg/h), furosemide (5.0 mg/h), enalaprilat (2,4 mg/h), metoprolol (1.2 mg/h) or saline (controls). 3. Enalaprilat and digoxin improved the FBF response to MCh at 4 microg/min (from 22.7+/-2.3 to 25.5+/-2.1 mL/min per 100 mL tissue (P < 0.01) and from 18.2+/-2.4 to 22.2+/-2.0 mL/min per 100 mL tissue (P < 0.05), respectively).

The pathway of degradation of enalapril maleate was found to be pH dependent. The extent of degradation of two different enalapril maleate tablet formulations (product A of a basic drug-matrix and product B of an acidic drug-matrix) has been investigated. The degree of degradation of the product with acidic matrix was significantly less than that of the basic matrix under same temperature and humidity conditions. In fact, diketopiperazine and enalaprilat degradants were mainly associated with the degradation of the product with the acidic matrix and that with the basic matrix, respectively. Dry enalapril maleate powder showed some photolysis, which was more significant with daylight (3.3%) compared with that under UV light (0.2%). Although the product with the acidic matrix showed some photolysis but the effect was not pronounced and the % recovery of enalapril was almost complete and within the acceptable experimental errors. However, the product with the basic matrix showed almost no response for photolysis.", 
    "620": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was applied to the study of several inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Separation of the compounds was performed by means of two phosphate buffers (each 100 mM) at pH 7.0 and 6.25, respectively [S. Hillaert, W. Van den Bossche, J. Chromatogr. A, 895 (2000) 33-42.]. Due to the highest selectivity of the first mentioned running buffer, the same system has been applied for the quantification of enalapril, lisinopril, quinapril, fosinopril, perindopril and benazepril in their corresponding pharmaceutical formulation. Especially, the possibility of simultaneous identification and quantification of the active ingredient in the finished product is very attractive. Excipients do not adversely affect the results. This paper deals with the validation of some parameters of the quantitative analysis: linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness.", 
    "621": "A direct reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) method has been developed for the separation and analysis of captopril and its 2R,2S diastereoisomer using a teicoplanin stationary phase. The proline containing diastereoisomers, which are known to form conformers in aqueous solution, were also separated from their rotational isomers. The influence of temperature, different organic modifiers and buffer type, concentration and pH were optimised to obtain a working resolution between the two diastereoisomers and their respective rotational isomers. The diastereoisomeric purity of several commercial captopril batches was subsequently evaluated using a 0.05% triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer (pH 3.8) run at 1.0 ml/min with mobile phase reservoir and column temperature controlled at 0 degrees C. Throughout the study online UV diode array and mass spectrometry detection was carried out simultaneously to confirm that peaks eluting from the teicoplanin column were in fact captopril and not its readily converted disulphide dimer. Additionally, as a result of the greater detection sensitivity of mass spectrometry, it also facilitated a more accurate optimisation study where trace amounts of the rotational isomers were found to be present in the baseline at temperatures higher than optimum.", 
    "622": "To test the hypothesis that the hypercoagulable state in hypertension is significantly altered by anti-hypertensive therapy, we conducted a pilot prospective randomised double-blind trial of 40 untreated hypertensive patients (30 males, mean age 59 years) who were treated with either enalapril (10-20 mg per day) or losartan (50-100 mg per day) for 8 weeks. Thrombogenicity was assessed by measurement of plasma fibrinogen, soluble P-selectin (an index of platelet activation), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, an index of fibrinolysis) and von Willebrand factor (an index of endothelial dysfunction). Baseline von Willebrand factor alone was significantly higher in untreated hypertensive patients compared to controls (P<0.001). Following 8 weeks treatment with enalapril (mean dose 17 mg/day) or losartan (mean dose 77 mg/day), there was a significant reduction in mean blood pressure from 169+/-11/94+/-8 mmHg (baseline) to 147+/-14/84+/-7 mmHg (post-treatment) (P<0.001). However, there were no statistically significant changes in the levels of haemostatic markers (von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, s-Psel and PAI-1). Our pilot study confirms previous observations of endothelial dysfunction in hypertensives. However, plasma fibrinogen and indices of platelet activation, fibrinolysis or endothelial dysfunction were not significantly affected by antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or losartan, despite satisfactory blood pressure control.", 
    "623": "We studied neurohormonal, clinical and invasively measured hemodynamic data of 47 infants with left-to-right shunts and varying degrees of congestive failure. When referred to a clinical heart failure score, plasma renin activities (r=0.71) and norepinephrine levels (r=0.43) are significantly increased. Arterial hypotension seems to be the hemodynamic trigger of renin release (r=-0.72), but not decreased systemic cardiac index (r=-0.43), the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt (r=0.33) or a reduced ejection fraction (r=0.12). These data indicate neurohormonal activation in infants with left-to-right shunts with preserved myocardial function is similar to the activation in adults with heart failure secondary to myocardial pump failure. These findings have to be considered for optimal medical treatment of these infants with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers.", 
    "624": "Increasing evidence points to the possible risks of delayed effects upon prenatal exposure to chemicals; the evaluation of such effects may pose serious problems to clinicians, epidemiologists and toxicologists. In fact, several systems (e.g., nervous, excretory) show important developmental processes well after the organogenetic period, up to the postnatal phase; accordingly, these are also expected to be sensitive targets of developmental toxicants, resulting in impairment of the function and/or functional reserve. This review describes the effects of several groups of drugs on the functional maturation and histogenesis of the kidney (e.g., aminoglycosides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin) and brain (e.g., anticonvulsivants, antiretroviral compounds, benzodiazepines) upon exposure in utero of humans and laboratory animals. The available data stress the importance for risk assessment of an adequate knowledge of both developmental biology and mechanisms of toxicity. The design of developmental toxicity studies should allow an evaluation of targets most relevant for a given drug (or group of drugs); moreover, the analysis of functional development should receive the due attention within the safety assessment of chemicals.", 
    "625": "Using B(2) kinin receptor gene knockout mice (B(2)(-/-)), we tested the hypothesis that (l) lack of B(2) receptors may affect blood pressure and cardiac function and aggravate cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI), and (2) kinins partially mediate the cardiac beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT(1)-ant), whereas lack of B(2) receptors may diminish this cardioprotective effect. Chronic heart failure (HF) was induced by MI, which was caused by coronary artery ligation in both B(2)(-/-) and 129/SvEvTac mice (wild-type control, B(2)(+/+)). An ACEi (ramipril, 2.5 mg/kg/d) or AT(1)-ant (L-158809, 3 mg/kg/d) was given 1 week after MI and was continued for 12 weeks. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, cardiac output (CO), diastolic LV dimension (LVDd), and LV mass were evaluated by echocardiography. Myocyte cross-sectional area and interstitial collagen fraction were studied histopathologically. We found that basal blood pressure and cardiac function were similar in B(2)(+/+) and B(2)(-/-) mice. After MI, development of HF and remodeling were also similar between the 2 strains. The ACEi improved cardiac function and remodeling in both strains; however, its effects were attenuated in B(2)(-/-) mice (respective values for B(2)(+/+) versus B(2)(-/-) mice: overall increase in ejection fraction, 64+/-10% versus 21+/-5% [P<0.01]; increase in CO, 69+/-17% versus 23+/-9% [P<0.01]; overall decrease in LVDd, -24+/-3% versus -7+/-4% [P<0.01]; and decrease in LV mass, -38+/-3% versus -6+/-6% [P<0.01]). AT(1)-ant had a beneficial cardiac effect similar to that produced by ACEi, and this effect was also diminished in B(2)(-/-) mice (respective values for B(2)(+/+) versus B(2)(-/-) mice: overall increase in ejection fraction, 46+/-10% versus 25+/-9% [P<0.01]; increase in CO, 44+/-14% versus 15+/-5% [P<0.01]; overall decrease in LVDd, -14+/-4% versus -6+/-3% [P<0.01]; and decrease in LV mass, -33+/-4 versus -16+/-7% [P<0.01]). The effect of ACEi or AT(1)-ant on myocyte cross-sectional area was similar between strains; however, their effect on the interstitial collagen fraction was diminished in B(2)(-/-) mice. We concluded that (1) lack of B(2) kinin receptors does not affect cardiac phenotype or function, either under normal physiological conditions or during the development of HF; and (2) kinins acting via the B(2) receptor play an important role in the cardioprotective effect of ACEi and AT(1)-ant.", 
    "626": "The general pharmacotherapeutic issues surrounding AMI are complex and expanding, especially with regard to treatment aimed at the [table: see text] culprit, coronary atherosclerotic thrombus. Basic, well-established therapy includes the routine administration of oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin, and at times morphine, with selected cases invoking caution with respect to these agents (e.g., nitroglycerin and the risk of hypotension in right ventricular infarction; contraindication to nitrolycerin in patients on sildenafil). Cardioprotective agents, especially beta-adrenergic antagonists, should be considered early in light of their demonstrated benefit; others, such as ACE inhibitors, need not be administered in the ED. Heparin, both UFH and the newer LMWHs, have well-established roles in acute coronary syndromes. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium; their role is evolving rapidly as research on this frontier continues. Table 2 reviews recommended dosing of selected agents in acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "627": "As outpatients with long-term chronic illness often show a high incidence of medication noncompliance, we investigated the influence of digoxin noncompliance on hospitalization, left ventricular ejection fraction, and mortality in outpatients in long-term therapy having congestive heart failure with tachycardia at a rate over 100 beats/min before starting digoxin therapy, but abnormal sinus rhythm.", 
    "628": "Before starting this study, the digoxin compliance/noncompliance of patients was determined by measuring the serum digoxin concentration (SDC). SDC was determined once a month, followed for six consecutive months, and patients were defined as noncompliant if their SDC was zero (0.0 ng/ml) on at least three consecutive occasions. According to SDC data, 218 patients were assigned to the compliant group and 213 patients were assigned to the noncompliant group. All 431 patients received diuretics, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, or nitrates as well as conventional therapy with digoxin throughout the trial. The duration of follow-up was 72 months.", 
    "629": "After 72 months of follow-up, the digoxin noncompliant patients showed significant increases in the number and duration of hospitalizations compared with the compliant patients. The digoxin noncompliant patients had a marked decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction from 49.1% to 41.8%. The cumulative rate of mortality from any cause in noncompliant patients was twofold higher (15.0%) than in compliant patients (7.8%; risk ratio when noncompliant was compared with compliant: 1.95; 95% confidence interval 1.11, 3.45; P = 0.029) at the 72-month follow-up. The higher mortality in digoxin noncompliant patients was exclusively attributed to worsening heart failure rather than other cardiac and noncardiac causes (risk ratio 2.13; 95% confidence interval 1.12, 4.07; P = 0.033). In addition, multiple regression analyses demonstrated that patient noncompliance as well as lower left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline were significantly involved in increased mortality.", 
    "630": "These results indicate that digoxin noncompliance, at least in part, increases the rate of both hospitalization and mortality due to worsening heart failure in outpatients who have congestive heart failure with tachycardia in long-term therapy.", 
    "631": "A growing body of evidence identifies the renin-angiotensin system as a key factor in the onset and progression of renal damage in chronic partial obstruction, which often represents a complex diagnostic challenge. A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the role of captopril mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 (MAG-3) renography as an early diagnostic test of obstruction. We report the results in a subgroup of children who underwent surgical correction for pyeloureteral obstruction.", 
    "632": "Pyeloplasty was performed in 12 patients, including 10 males, 2 to 72 months old (median age 7) with unilateral hydronephrosis, including normal renal function and blood pressure. Basal and captopril enhanced diuretic renography with 99mtechnetium MAG-3 was performed within 24 hours using the same hydration and diuretic stimulus (0.75 mg./kg. furosemide), and 0.75 mg./kg. captopril was administered orally 60 to 90 minutes before scintigraphy.", 
    "633": "No adverse effects or modifications of the blood pressure were observed after captopril administration. The diuretic response was deeply worsened by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in each hydronephrotic kidney even when the basal study was only slightly abnormal (15-minute washout basal -27 +/- 16%, after captopril -9 +/- 13, p <0.005). After surgical correction the diuretic washout during angiotensin inhibition appeared normal in all patients (15-minute washout -56 +/- 14%). Separate renal function and parenchymal transit of MAG-3 were not modified by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, preoperatively or postoperatively.", 
    "634": "Our data confirm the influence of angiotensin on the kidney excretory system in human hydronephrosis and suggest a role for captopril enhanced diuretic renography in the early diagnosis of pyeloureteral obstruction. Further work is needed to evaluate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition as a protective agent in obstructive nephropathy.", 
    "635": "As more high-risk hypertensives are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. Those combination agents should provide 24-h control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Also, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.", 
    "636": "Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.", 
    "637": "Diabetes and hypertension are the most common causes of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of more intensive control of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in delaying progression of renal disease, particularly in diabetic patients with macroproteinuria. Although traditional recommendations have suggested that reducing systolic to < 140 mm Hg is appropriate, there is consistent evidence in clinical trials demonstrating that, in the presence of diabetes, macroproteinuria, and impaired renal function, reducing systolic to < 125 mm Hg will result in a more successful attenuation of the rate of progression of renal disease. In addition, there is convincing evidence demonstrating that blockade of the renin angiotensin system, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, results in an improved opportunity to delay progression of renal disease. Despite the advantages of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, most patients will require three to five medications to achieve optimal levels of goal SBP to attenuate the rate of progression of renal disease.",

    "639": "A MEDLINE search of English-language articles published until June 1999 was undertaken using the terms diabetes mellitus, hypertension or blood pressure (BP), and therapy. Included were only prospective randomized studies of more than 12 months' duration that evaluated the effect of drug treatment on morbidity and mortality in diabetic hypertensive patients.", 
    "640": "The coexistence of diabetes mellitus doubled the risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality in hypertensive patients (approximate relative risk of 1.73 to 2.77 for cardiovascular events, 2.25 to 3.66 for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.73 to 2.18 for total mortality). Intensive BP control to levels lower than 130/85 mm Hg was beneficial in diabetic hypertensive patients. All four drug classes--diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists--were effective in reducing cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensive patients. In elderly diabetic patients with isolated systolic hypertension, calcium antagonists reduced the rate of cardiac end points by 63%, stroke by 73%, and total mortality by 55%. In more than 60% of diabetic hypertensive patients, combination therapy was required to control BP.", 
    "641": "Intensive control of BP reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients regardless of whether low-dose diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium antagonists were used as a first-line treatment. Combination of more than one drug is frequently required to control BP and may be more beneficial than monotherapy.",

This prospective interventional study in men with uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > or =140/90 mm Hg) used a survey instrument to assay sexual dysfunction before and after therapy with losartan.", 
    "643": "We evaluated the influence of a 12-week therapy with losartan in 82 hypertensive subjects with (n = 82) and without (n = 82) a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction using a self-administered questionnaire validated in another 60 subjects with hypertension.", 
    "644": "From an initial sample of 323 hypertensive men and women, 82 men, aged 30 to 65 years, with sexual dysfunction underwent a 12-week regimen of losartan therapy (50-100 mg/day). Losartan treatment improved sexual satisfaction from an initial 7.3 to 58.5% (chi2; P = 0.001). Subjects reporting a high frequency of sexual activity improved from 40.5% initially to 62.3% after drug treatment, whereas the number of patients with low or very low frequency of sexual activity decreased significantly (chi2; P = 0.001). At the completion of the 12-week losartan regimen, only 11.8% of the treated subjects reported in improvement in sexual function. Improvement on quality of life was demonstrated in 73.7% of subjects medicated with losartan, 25.5% reported no changes, and only 0.8% felt worse. In the group without sexual dysfunction, losartan had a nonsignificant effect on sexual function.", 
    "645": "Our data suggest that losartan improved erectile function and both satisfaction and frequency of sexual activity. Because side effects are one of the most influential factors in the management of hypertension, an added benefit of losartan therapy may be its positive impact on quality of life.",

    "647": "Twenty-nine hypertensive patients (14 females and 15 males; mean age 63 years.) with non-diabetic chronic renal failure of several causes received losartan 50 mg/day (plus other antihypertensive agents if needed) and were followed-up prospectively during 13+/-1 months. Eighteen patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus other antihypertensive drugs at baseline. Patients had been followed-up for 44+/-4 months prior to the treatment with losartan. The rate of progression of renal insufficiency was evaluated as the slope of the reciprocal of serum creatinine vs time in months.",

Serum creatinine at baseline, and after 6 months and 1 year of treatment with losartan was: 3.18+/-0.24, 3.24+/-0.27 (P=NS vs baseline) and 3.49+/-0.32 mg ml (P<0.05 vs baseline). The rate of progression of renal disease before and after 1 year of treatment with losartan was -0.0039+/-0.0058 vs -0.0012+/-0.0073 mg/month (P<0.01). Changes in proteinuria after 1 year of treatment with losartan correlated with the change in renal disease progression (r=-0.519, P<0.01).", 
    "649": "The rate of progression of renal function in patients with non-diabetic chronic renal failure is slowed down after 1 year of treatment with losartan. The results of this preliminary study suggest that AT1 receptor blockade treatment offers renoprotection in this subset of patients, although these results need to be confirmed in appropriate controlled trials.", 
    "650": "The severity of proteinuria is the main predictive factor in the progression of renal failure in chronic nephropathies. Therefore, action aimed at reducing proteinuria should be a priority in the treatment of these patients. Various antihypertensive drugs, in particular the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have a greater antiproteinuric effect, although it is difficult to establish whether this is due only to their effect on arterial blood pressure (BP) or to other mechanisms associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).", 
    "651": "The evolution of proteinuria after two successive treatment periods was studied prospectively for 2 years in 22 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis. In period I, which lasted for 12 months, BP was strictly controlled (<125/75 mmHg) and the patients received random and double-blind treatment with a beta-blocker (betaB), atenolol; a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), verapamil; an ACEI, trandolapril; or a fixed combination of the latter two. In period II, all of the patients received treatment openly for an additional 12 months with a fixed combination of verapamil+trandolapril at half the dose of the preceding period, to obtain conventional control of BP at <140/90 mmHG:", 
    "652": "The mean level for basal SBP/DBP was 136+/-14/86+/-7 mmHg, which decreased in period I to 121+/-15/76+/-8 mmHg (P=0.01) and to 124+/-5/78 +/-8 mmHg (P<0.05) at 6 and 12 months of treatment, respectively. There were no differences in the BP reached in the four therapy groups; however, proteinuria only decreased in the patients treated with trandolapril alone or in combination with verapamil. In period II, BP levels rose to 134+/-10/84+/-8 mmHg (P<0.05); this increase in BP was accompanied by an increase in proteinuria in those patients who had received the ACEI alone or in combination in the previous period, while in patients previously treated with a betaB or a CCB, proteinuria decreased, in spite of the increase in BP.", 
    "653": "With equal BP control, treatment with the ACEI trandolapril alone, or in combination with a CCB, has a greater antiproteinuric effect than that obtained with other antihypertensive drugs, but this effect is attenuated if BP is not strictly controlled.", 
    "654": "Hypertension (HTN) is very frequent in patients with renal disease and its prevalence increases as renal failure progresses.", 
    "655": "We studied the prevalence of HTN in 1921 patients with different nephropathies. Patients on dialysis and renal transplant patients were not included in the study. HTN was defined as SBP>140 and/or DBP>90 mmHg, or requiring antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "656": "The prevalence of HTN in the total group of patients with renal diseases was 60.5%, but this prevalence varied widely depending upon the type of underlying nephropathy. The prevalence of HTN was practically universal in patients with renal vascular disease (93%) and in patients with established diabetic nephropathy (87%), and 74% of the patients with polycystic kidney disease, 63% of the patients with chronic pyelonephritis and 54% of the patients diagnosed with glomerulonephritis were hypertensive. The prevalence of HTN in patients with renal insufficiency (80%) is significantly higher than that in patients without renal insufficiency (43% P<0.001). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the independent risk factors defining HTN in renal patients were: renal failure, age, the presence of diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia and proteinuria. Antihypertensive treatment consisted of diet alone in 4% of the patients, one drug in 45%, two drugs in 36%, three medications in 13% and more than three drugs in 2.5%. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed drug (39% of the patients treated in monotherapy) followed by calcium channel blockers (27%), diuretics (18%) and beta-blockers (9%). The most common combined therapy was a diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor. The percentage of patients with BP controlled according to current recommendations for renal patients (BP<130/85) was very low; SBP in only 49% and DBP in 24%. Control of both was only achieved in 10% of the patients.", 
    "657": "There is a high prevalence of HTN in renal patients, which depends on the type of nephropathy and the degree of renal failure. Other independent risk factors for HTN in patients with renal disease are: advanced age, the presence of diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia and the severity of proteinuria. BP control in renal patients is quite poor and should be improved to reduce progression of the renal disease.", 
    "658": "Hypertension leads to renal disease through a series of mechanisms that seem to be exaggerated in African-Americans, who have a higher prevalence of both hypertension and end-stage renal disease than whites. Renal disease itself leads to hypertension, which in turn can contribute to progression of renal disease. Although there are numerous mechanisms involved in the process of renal disease progression, the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role as determined by the beneficial response to angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AT II blockers) of reduced rate of progression in a variety of clinical and experimental renal diseases. Macromolecular trafficking across the glomerulus leading to proteinuria plays a significant role in progression of chronic renal disease. Reversal of this abnormality and reduced stress on capillary walls may be the major mechanisms of beneficial action of ACEIs and AT II blockers in halting renal disease progression.", 
    "659": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulates many genes involved in vascular physiopathology. Angiotensin II (Ang II) participates in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases. In a model of atherosclerosis, we have noted NF-kappaB activation in the neointimia lesion that was decreased by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the potential direct effect of Ang II in the vascular activation of NF-kappaB has not been completely elucidated.", 
    "660": "We first investigated whether Ang II elicited in vivo activation of NF-kappaB in large vessels of normal rats by systemic infusion of Ang II (50 ng/kg/min, s.c.) into rats for 72 h. In order to investigate the receptor involved in this process, we also studied the direct effect of Ang II on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from wild-type and AT1 knockout mice.", 
    "661": "Ang II-infused rats showed activated NF-kappaB in the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the aorta (southwestern histochemistry). In cultured VSMCs from wild-type mice, Ang II increased NF-kappaB activity that was partially inhibited by AT1 (losartan) and AT2 (PD123319) antagonists. In VSMC from AT1 knockout mice, Ang II also activated NF-kappaB.", 
    "662": "These data show that Ang II via AT1 and AT2 activates NF-kappaB in vascular cells both in vivo and in vitro, and suggest a potential involvement of the AT2 receptor in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis.", 
    "663": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], which can be formed directly from angiotensin I (Ang I) bypassing the requisite production of Ang II, is a bioactive component of the renin-angiotensin system that may oppose the actions of Ang II. In contrast to the generation of Ang II, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) hydrolyses Ang-(1-7) to inactive fragments. ACE inhibitors substantially augment circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) and increase the peptide's half-life. Thus, this enzymatic pathway constitutes a key regulatory point in the vasculature to balance the actions of Ang II, Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin. In contrast, the renal pathways for the metabolism of Ang-(1-7) appear quite distinct. Characterization of this pathway may shed new light on the potential actions of the peptide in the kidney, as well as the mechanisms of novel vasoactive peptidase therapies. We summarize recent experimental and clinical studies that begin to reveal novel pathways in the formation and degradation of Ang-(1-7) in the kidney.",

In the Cpl group, St. Thomas cardioplegia and reperfusional blood containing captopril 4.6 mumol/L were used. The plasma renin activity (RA), contents of angiotensin II (AT-II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in arterial blood were determined before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 5, 35, 60 min after reperfusion.

    "672": "At the initial examination, cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake and release, circulating noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentration, x ray cardiothoracic ratio, and echocardiographic variables were recorded. Cardiac MIBG uptake was obtained by measuring the heart to mediastinum activity ratio on the planar image obtained four hours after MIBG injection. MIBG washout rate was evaluated using relative decrease in cardiac activity measured at 20 minutes and four hours. Patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis, and were followed up for 12 (10) months. Fifteen patients did not respond to medical treatment (12 heart transplants; three deaths), and 25 did respond (improved or stable).", 
    "673": "Cardiac MIBG uptake was positively correlated with x ray cardiothoracic index (r = 0.55, p = 0.0008) and echocardiographic left ventricular fractional shortening (r = 0.68, p < 0.0001). Among all the clinical and laboratory variables tested, multivariate discriminant analysis showed that the only independent predictor of an unfavourable outcome was a low MIBG uptake (p < 0.001). Survival curves had a mean threshold value of 1.54 for MIBG uptake.",

    "675": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic losartan or captopril on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype and vascular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Male 12-week-old rats were treated for 16 weeks with losartan (15 mg/kg per day) or captopril (60 mg/kg per day) in their drinking water. Systolic blood pressure, measured by the tail-cuff method, was reduced approximately 40 mm Hg in both treatment groups compared with a nontreated control group. Cell structure and proliferation studies were performed in VSMCs obtained from rat carotid arteries. Cells from the losartan-treated group showed a significant reduction in size, total protein content, and nucleus number, as well as proliferation after stimulation with 10% fetal calf serum and an increased percentage of cells in the G(1) phase compared with the control and captopril-treated groups. Functional studies were performed in isolated carotid arteries from these groups. Contractions elicited by 75 mmol/L KCl or 10(-)(7) mol/L norepinephrine and relaxations elicited by acetylcholine were similar in all groups. Concentration-response curves to angiotensin I or angiotensin II (10(-)(10) to 3x10(-)(7) mol/L) were almost abolished in the losartan-treated group and were not modified by preincubation with the angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonist PD 123,319. These results suggest that long-term losartan treatment significantly changes VSMC phenotype and proliferative status, apparently unrelated to blood pressure lowering or to endothelial function improvements.", 
    "676": "ACE inhibitors are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension mainly because of their efficiency in reducing blood pressure levels and decreasing vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, ACE inhibitors improve baroreceptor reflex control. Chronic inhibition of ACE produces (in addition to decreased angiotensin II levels) a severe increase in angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] levels in several species. We have previously shown that Ang-(1-7) produces a facilitation of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study, we evaluated the participation of endogenous Ang-(1-7) in the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats after central infusion of ramiprilat, an ACE inhibitor. Reflex changes in heart rate were elicited, in conscious rats, by bolus injections of phenylephrine (baroreflex bradycardia) before and after intracerebroventricular infusion of (1) saline (8 microL/h), 4 hours (n=5); (2) ramiprilat (14 microg/h), 4 hours (n=6); (3) ramiprilat for 2 hours, followed by ramiprilat combined with A-779 (4 microg/h), a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist, for an additional 2 hours (n=6); and (4) A-779 for 2 hours, followed by A-779 combined with ramiprilat for an additional 2 hours (n=5). Intracerebroventricular infusion of ramiprilat produced an important increase ( approximately 40%) in baroreflex sensitivity (evaluated as the ratio between changes in heart rate and changes in mean arterial pressure) that was completely reversed by A-779. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of A-779 prevented the improvement of the baroreflex sensitivity produced by ramiprilat. Intracerebroventricular infusion of saline or A-779 alone did not significantly alter the baroreflex sensitivity. These results suggest that endogenous Ang-(1-7) is involved in the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats during central ACE inhibition.", 
    "677": "We have previously demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment with doxazosin (DZN), an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and lisinopril (LIS), an ACE inhibitor, reverse glomerular sclerosis in corpulent spontaneously hypertensive rats with type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examined the effects of the above-mentioned antihypertensive drugs alone and in combination on the structure of interlobular and arcuate arteries in these rats. Both male and female rats aged 6 months were treated with antihypertensive drugs for 16 weeks. Various structural parameters were evaluated by light microscopy, with the use of digital image analysis, in kidney sections stained with periodic acid-SCHIFF: Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in treated than in untreated rats. Untreated diabetic rats had a significantly higher media/lumen ratio (smaller luminal diameter) of both arteries compared with the ratio in treated rats (for interlobular artery, 0.72+/-0.06 [no treatment], 0.49+/-0.03 [DZN treatment], 0.54+/-0.06 [LIS treatment], and 0.52+/-0.04 [combination therapy], P<0.05 to <0.001 for no treatment versus treatment; for arcuate artery, 0.66+/-0.11 [no treatment], 0.40+/-0.02 [DZN treatment], 0.39+/-0.04 [LIS treatment], and 0.40+/-0.03 [combination therapy], P<0.05 for no treatment versus treatment). Antihypertensive treatment caused significant increases in total arterial cross-sectional area, internal and external diameters, luminal and medial cross-sectional area, and medial thickness in both interlobular and arcuate arteries. The improvement in arterial structure after antihypertensive treatment was due to remodeling and growth of the vessels. Both DZN and LIS were equally efficacious, and combination therapy had no additive or synergistic effect.", 
    "678": "This study was conducted to determine potentially differential effects between an angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor on systemic, renal, and glomerular hemodynamics and pathological changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with N(omega)-nitro-L>-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-exacerbated nephrosclerosis. The hemodynamic, renal micropuncture, and pathological studies were performed in 9 groups of 17-week-old male SHR treated as follows: group 1, controls (n=16); group 2, candesartan (10 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); group 3, enalapril (30 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=8); group 4, candesartan (5 mg/kg per day) plus enalapril (15 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=9); group 5, L-NAME (50 mg/L in drinking water for 3 weeks) (n=17); group 6, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus candesartan (10 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); group 7, L-NAME (50 mg/L) for 3 weeks followed by candesartan (10 mg/kg per day) for another 3 weeks (n=8); group 8, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus enalapril (30 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); and group 9, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) and the bradykinin antagonist icatibant (500 microg/kg SC per day via osmotic minipump for 3 weeks) (n=7). Both candesartan and enalapril similarly reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance index. These changes were associated with significant decreases in afferent and efferent glomerular arteriolar resistances as well as glomerular capillary pressure. Histopathologically, the glomerular and arterial injury scores were decreased significantly, and left ventricular and aortic masses also were diminished significantly in all treated groups. L-NAME-induced urinary protein excretion was prevented by both candesartan and enalapril. Thus, both AT(1) receptor and ACE inhibition prevented and reversed the pathophysiological alterations of L-NAME-exacerbated nephrosclerosis in SHR. Itatibant only blunted the antihypertensive effects of enalapril but did not attenuate the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on the L-NAME-induced nephrosclerosis. Thus, the AT(1) receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition have similar renal preventive effects, which most likely were achieved through reduction in the effects of angiotensin II, and ACE inhibition of bradykinin degradation demonstrated little evidence of renoprotection.", 
    "679": "Depressed ventricular performance and neurohormonal activation are key pathophysiological features of congestive heart failure (CHF). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blockers exert beneficial effects in CHF, mortality remains unacceptably high, and the development of further therapeutic approaches is warranted. Recent data suggest that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be of benefit in the treatment of CHF, although the mechanism for this action is incompletely understood.", 
    "680": "In the present study, we examined the effect of short-term CPAP (10 cm H(2)O for 10 minutes) on hemodynamics (Swan Ganz catheter) and total systemic and cardiac sympathetic activity (norepinephrine spillover method) in 14 CHF patients in New York Heart Association class III. The application of CPAP was associated with a fall in cardiac output (4.8+/-0.3 to 4.4+/-0.2 L/min; P<0.05) and a significant reduction in cardiac norepinephrine spillover (370+/-58 to 299+/-55 pmol/min; P<0.05), although total systemic norepinephrine spillover was unchanged.",

    "683": "Iontophoresis was employed for enhancing transdermal transport of captopril through rat skin in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "684": "It was demonstrated that the iontophoresis-induced flux of captopril was affected by various factors such as pH, ionic concentration, and the concentration of captopril in donor compartments as well as the applied electric current intensity. Electric current could induce several-fold increase in captopril flux with hydrogel. Skin permeation study in vivo in rats demonstrated that iontophoresis could effectively promote the transdermal transport of captopril without significant skin irritation. Captopril concentration in plasma reached plateau (approximately 0.9 microgram/mL) at 1 h after current application and was maintained at the same level during the experiment. On the contrary, captopril could not be detected in plasma when the current was not applied. No obvious skin irritation was observed after 9-h continuous iontophoresis.", 
    "685": "Transdermal delivery of captopril can be effectively improved by iontopophoresis.", 
    "686": "The aim of this study is to elucidate the long term effect of captopril treatment on the endothelial function to release nitric oxide (NO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The properties of endothelium were determined with a model of hindquarter perfusion in response to alpha 1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, at the age of 40 weeks of SHR which was administrated with captopril (100 mg/kg/day) from intrauterine and withdrawn at 16 weeks of age. Furthermore, in the presence of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (LNAME), or L-arginine, the responses to phenylephrine were studied. From the curve of perfusion pressure, the minimal, maximal perfusion pressure (PPmin, PPmax) and the maximal slope (slope), as well as the 50% of effective concentration (EC50) were obtained. The data show that in captopril treated SHR, PPmin, PPmax and slope were markedly lower, but EC50 higher than those of untreated SHR. The curve induced by phenylephrine was significantly right shift compared with that of untreated SHR. Like WKY, the intensive reactivity to phenylephrine in the presence of LNAME was much lower than that of untreated SHR. In the presence of L-arginine, however, the right shift of curves was seen only in captopril treated SHR and WKY rats, but not in control SHR. In conclusion, endothelium does involve in the response of resistant vessel to phenylephrine. The mechanism of enhanced reactivity in untreated SHR may be, at least in part, due to the diminished capacity of producing NO from endothelium, and the effect of sustained hypotension of early captopril treatment might be relevant to the improved ability of endothelium.", 
    "687": "Hypertension, which occurs commonly and early in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), affects both renal and patient outcome. However, there is no consensus about the type of antihypertensive therapy that is most appropriate for patients with ADPKD. This historical prospective, nonrandomized study was designed to investigate the effect on renal function of diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensive patients with ADPKD who entered the study with comparable renal function. Among hypertensive ADPKD patients followed in our center, patients taking diuretics without any ACE inhibitors were included in the diuretic group (n = 14, male/female ratio 5/9, mean age 47 years), whereas patients taking ACE inhibitors but no diuretics were included in the ACE inhibitor (ACEI) group (n = 19, male/female ratio 11/8, mean age 41 years). For comparable blood pressure control, 21% of the ACEI group and 64% of the diuretic group (p < 0.05) needed additional antihypertensive medications. After an average follow-up period of 5.2 years, the creatinine clearance decreased significantly in the diuretic group (74 vs. 46 ml/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.0001) and in the ACEI group (83 vs. 71 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.0005). The decrement in creatinine clearance was significantly larger in the diuretic group than the ACEI group (p < 0.05). The annual decrease in creatinine clearance was 5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the diuretic group and 2.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the ACEI group (p < 0.05). A significant increase in urinary protein excretion occurred in the diuretic but not in the ACEI group. Hypertensive ADPKD patients treated with diuretics had a faster loss of renal function as compared with patients treated with ACE inhibitors, despite similar blood pressure control. This result will need to be further examined in a randomized study.", 
    "688": "The occurrence of acute urticaria during treatment with drugs is a frequent event which poses two problems: 1) is the urticaria connected with the drug administration or with the underlying pathology which led to the prescription of the drug; 2) is the urticaria allergic in origin, i.e. due to specific immunity triggers, in particular IgE directed against the drug, or is the urticaria pseudo-allergic in origin, i.e. due to non-specific activation of mastocytes [1]? This question is of major importance because allergic events caused by IgE are potentially fatal while pseudo-allergic events are only rarely life-threatening. In this article we will not deal with contact urticaria where the cause is easily identifiable [2].", 
    "689": "Although hyperlipidemia is associated with the development of diabetes complications, the effect of lipid reduction on microvascular complications is unknown. We initiated a 2-year, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot trial of simvastatin/diet vs. diet alone in Type 1 diabetic patients without overt nephropathy. Thirty-nine patients with LDL cholesterol 100-160 mg/dl, >10 year duration of diabetes and an albumin excretion rate (AER) <200 microg/min were recruited for study. The primary end-point was change in AER. Secondary end-points were change in ankle-brachial index, progression of retinopathy status, change in vibratory threshold, and development of new clinical neuropathy. Nineteen patients were treated with simvastatin and twenty with placebo. However, because of the lowering of drug initiation levels by the American Diabetes Association, the trial was terminated early with 2 subjects reaching 2 years, 17 reaching 18 months, 36 reaching 1 year, and all 6 months. Simvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol (mean on treatment 173.4 vs. 191.4, P=.020) and LDL cholesterol (mean on treatment 105.0 vs. 127.7, P<.001). Simvastatin therapy was associated with a slower rise in AER compared to placebo, though the result was not statistically significant (median rate of change/month 0.004 vs. 0.029). There was a trend towards slower progression of neuropathy as measured by vibratory threshold (median change at 1 year 0.03 simvastatin vs. 0.94, P=.07). There was no difference in change in ankle-brachial index, clinical neuropathy status, or retinopathy status. In conclusion, treatment with simvastatin may have a beneficial effect on early nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy, justifying a fully powered trial. However, this would be difficult under current treatment guidelines.",

    "693": "Enalapril partially prevented the renal hypertrophy and fully prevented the increase in urinary albumin excretion rate in diabetic animals. The glomerular TGF-beta Type II Receptor mRNA and protein concentrations increased over 30 days in untreated diabetic animals compared with non-diabetic controls, while enalapril-treated diabetic animals showed a normalisation of TGF-beta Type II Receptor mRNA and protein.", 
    "694": "The ACE-inhibition had pronounced inhibitory effects on the increased expression of the glomerular TGF-beta Type II Receptor in the diabetic kidney required for intracellular signalling through this growth factor axis. This suggests a new mechanism of action of the ACE-inhibition in regulating the development of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "695": "The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction were shown before the introduction of thrombolysis and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Generally, the patients recruited to these trials were at low risk: few had heart failure, and none had measurements of left-ventricular function taken. We investigated the long-term efficacy of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction treated according to current evidence-based practice.", 
    "696": "In a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 1959 patients with a proven acute myocardial infarction and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of </=40% were randomly assigned 6.25 mg carvedilol (n=975) or placebo (n=984). Study medication was progressively increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily during the next 4-6 weeks, and patients were followed up until the requisite number of primary endpoints had occurred. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or hospital admission for cardiovascular problems. Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "697": "Although there was no difference between the carvedilol and placebo groups in the number of patients with the primary endpoint (340 [35%] vs 367 [37%], hazard ratio 0.92 [95% CI 0.80-1.07]), all-cause mortality alone was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (116 [12%] vs 151 [15%], 0.77 [0.60-0.98], p=0.03). Cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction were also lower on carvedilol than on placebo.", 
    "698": "In patients treated long-term after an acute myocardial infarction complicated by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, carvedilol reduced the frequency of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and recurrent, non-fatal myocardial infarctions.

    "700": "In patients with chronic renal failure, three kinds of treatments can slow the progression of renal insufficiency: optimal control of blood pressure; use of converting enzyme inhibitors; low-protein diet. The MDRD study strongly suggests that blood pressure should not be higher than 130/85 mmHg in patients with chronic renal failure, and than 125/75 mmHg in patients with chronic renal failure and proteinuria above 1 g/d. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial to patients with IDDM and either microalbuminuria or overt diabetic nephropathy and to patients with chronic renal failure and proteinuria above 1 g/d. A diet containing less than 1 g/kg/d of proteins should be prescribed to patients with chronic renal failure, and this protein content should be lowered to 0.75 g/kg/d (or to 0.60 g/kg/j in some cases) when creatinine clearance falls below 25 mL/min.", 
    "701": "Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disorder with a steep age-related incidence that affects 5-10% of the over 55-year age group. Because of the association with atherosclerotic disease elsewhere, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD), the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) correlates inversely with survival. Clinical management centres around detection, assessment, symptom relief and prevention of secondary cardiovascular complications. Non-invasive ultrasound and colour duplex techniques have revolutionised the detection of PAD, and the long-term surveillance of disease progression, while antiplatelet therapy coupled with risk factor modification (lipids, blood pressure and glycaemic control and smoking cessation) are aimed at reducing direct or indirect vascular complications, e.g. amputation or CHD death. The natural history of intermittent claudication, although troublesome and disabling, often runs a stable, fairly benign course, so the majority of patients (73%) are treated medically. Selecting patients for surgical revascularisation (angioplasty, bypass or endarterectomy) is guided principally by the severity of clinical symptoms, but discrete, proximal, short-segmental lesions are the most amenable to surgical intervention. In general, surgery is indicated to relieve disabling symptoms when medical therapy had failed; for treatment of symptoms of limb-threatening ischaemia, including rest pain, ischaemic ulceration and gangrene; and to remove or bypass sources of thrombo-embolism. Thus, medical therapies for symptom relief and secondary prevention of complications form the mainstay of treatment for three-quarters of patients with uncomplicated intermittent claudication.", 
    "702": "In the setting of soaring popularity, postmarketing studies of calcium channel blockers came to suggest an increase in a variety of major adverse end points. The evidence, however, was largely observational, and large-scale trials capable of addressing the concerns were wanting. Clinical trials now support the safety and efficacy of the long-acting dihydropyridines for patients with both uncomplicated and diabetic hypertension, although conventional therapies and, in the latter case, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have superior proof of benefit. By contrast, short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided. In the acute coronary syndromes, beta-blockers remain the treatment of choice; the evidence for nondihydropyridines remains inconclusive. Stable angina calls for beta-blockers as first-line therapy and nondihydropyridines as second-line therapy, whereas in ventricular dysfunction, safety data for nondihydropyridines are lacking. Initial reports of cancer, bleeding, and suicide have been contradicted by subsequent data, making the associations uncertain or unlikely. Remaining questions await completion of ongoing trials to better define the indications for these agents.",

In the lisinopril group 20 patients (60.6%) reversed to normoalbuminuria compared to 6 patients (24%) in the placebo group (p<0.02). ii) Clinical BP measurements revealed no differences between groups, but by AMBP significant reductions were detectable in the lisinopril group, primarily in night AMBP (systolic/diastolic: - 6.9 +/- 8.6/- 6.0 +/- 5.3 mmHg, p<0.01) as opposed to increases in the placebo group (3.1 +/- 9.3/1.9 +/- 7.3 mmHg). iii) Changes in UAE and changes in filtration fraction (FF) were positively correlated in the intervention group (r=0.9, p<0.01), i.e. the patients who showed the greatest fall in UAE were the ones with the greatest fall in FF.", 
    "706": "ACE-i treatment in patients with low-grade microalbuminuria reduces 24 h AMBP without attenuating diurnal blood pressure variation, reduces UAE significantly, with changes in UAE being strongly associated with changes in FF.

    "707": "Angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, but it remains controversial as to the best approach to effectively block the actions of this hormone in the kidney. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of long-term treatment (8 months) with a combination of an angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, irbesartan (15 mg/kg per day), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (100 mg/kg per day), in diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Captopril treatment reduced blood pressure (163+/-3 mmHg versus diabetic 201+/-3 mmHg), but not albumin excretion rate (43.8x//1.3 mg/day versus diabetic 46.8x//1.4 mg/day). Irbesartan treatment was associated with a similar reduction in blood pressure (173+/-3 mmHg) to captopril, and albumin excretion rate was reduced (14x//1.5 mg/day). The combination of irbesartan and captopril induced further reductions in blood pressure (140+/-3 mmHg) and albumin excretion rates (4.0x//1.5 mg/day). Gene expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 was reduced by all treatments to a similar level as assessed by in situ hybridization. These results demonstrate the additive hypotensive and anti-albuminuric effects of an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor, suggesting that combination therapy is an approach not only more effective at reducing blood pressure, but also at retarding the development of diabetic nephropathy.",

DN accounted for 50.5% of ESRD cases among AA females, but for less than 20% among AA males. In contrast, hypertension was the ESRD diagnosis in 48% of AA males. Patients observed in our nephrology clinic were analyzed further (n=171). At presentation, patients had advanced disease (serum creatinine [Cr]=5.92 mg/dL), were hypertensive, obese, and not likely to be on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Determinants of TTE in univariate analysis were race (AA did better), initial blood urea nitrogen and plasma serum Cr levels, starting an ACE inhibitor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the level of mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the course of follow-up. On multivariate analysis only initial Cr and race remained significant The 142 AA diabetics (111 female) were analyzed separately. The only significant sex difference was body mass index (female, 33.6 vs male, 28.4 kg/m2; P=0.0069), but females tended to have relatively shorter TTE and higher blood pressure (BP). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the same factors as above as determinants of TTE; however, among AAs, presenting on a calcium channel blocker was negatively correlated with TTE in univariate analysis. Among the entire cohort and the AAs, patients who had MAP between 100 and 110 mm Hg during the course of follow-up did better in terms of renal survival than those who fell outside of that range.",

This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate for the treatment of ED in men with CVD who were receiving treatment with beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium-channel blockers, but not nitrates. Treatment with sildenafil was associated with significant increases in the mean end-of-treatment scores for the questions from the International Index of Erectile Function that assess the ability to achieve and maintain erections (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, 71% of patients taking sildenafil reported improved erections compared with 24% taking placebo (p = 0.0001). This study also showed that sildenafil was well tolerated in patients with CVD and ED. Besides flushing, no treatment-related cardiovascular adverse events were noted for sildenafil.", 
    "713": "Antihypertensive treatment is presently recommended in most type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. The long-term effect of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-i) treatment on exercise urinary albumin excretion (E-UAE) and exercise blood pressure (E-BP) in type 1 diabetic patients with low grade microalbuminuria is not well documented. In addition, the possible predictive effect of baseline E-UAE on the progression of overnight UAE remains to be clarified.", 
    "714": "In a randomized placebo controlled double blind study the effects of 2 years treatment with either lisinopril (20 mg o.d.) or placebo was evaluated in 21 normotensive type 1 diabetic patients with overnight UAE between 20 and 70 microg min-1. Determinations of E-UAE and E-BP were performed after exercise on an ergometercycle with a load of 70% of estimated maximal VO2 for 20 min. Patients in the placebo and lisinopril groups were similar with regard to age (35.8 +/- 11.3 vs. 29.3 +/- 8.6 years), duration of diabetes (19.4 +/- 8.2 vs. 16.8 +/- 5.3 years), and HbA1c (9.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.4 +/- 1.7%).",

After 2 years treatment E-UAE had increased in the placebo group, whereas E-UAE was reduced in the lisinopril treated patients (placebo: 213.6 x or divide 6.9, lisinopril: 48.3 x or divide 3.1 microg min-1, P = 0.04). The relative increase in E-UAE (E-UAE/Pre-exercise UAE) was similar at baseline in both groups (3.7 x or divide 2.3 vs. 2.8 x or divide 2.0) but significantly higher in the placebo group after 2 years (4.4 x or divide 2.4 compared with 1.6 x or divide 1.7 in the lisinopril group, P < 0.01) These changes over two years in relative increase in E-UAE were significantly different (P = 0.03). Exercise blood pressure was similar in both groups at baseline and over 2 years increased in the placebo group (from 166.5 +/- 15.1-179.9 +/- 35.6 mmHg), in contrast to the lisinopril group where E-BP was slightly reduced (from 168.5 +/- 20.6-165.1 +/- 16.6 mmHg) but the difference in blood pressure over the 2 years did not reach statistical significance. Exercise urinary albumin excretion and E-BP were closely associated (correlation for year 2: r = 0.734, P < 0.001), and also changes over the 2 years in E-UAE and E-BP were positively correlated (r = 0.53, P = 0.01). At year 2, overnight UAE, pre-exercise UAE (pre-E-UAE), E-UAE and E-BP were all closely linked (r-values between 0.6 and 0.9, P-values < 0.01). In the prediction of changes in overnight UAE over 2 years, neither baseline E-UAE nor baseline E-BP conveyed explanatory information in comparison with baseline overnight UAE and HbA1c.", 
    "716": "In type 1 diabetic patients with low-grade microalbuminuria, 2 years of ACE-i treatment with lisinopril significantly reduced E-UAE. Strong correlations were found between E-UAE and E-BP and also changes over 2 years in these parameters were significantly associated.", 
    "717": "Effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, imidapril and enalapril, on kaolin-induced writhing reaction, which is believed to be caused by bradykinin (BK), were examined in mice. The number of writhes was increased significantly by 200 microg/kg of imidapril and by 100 and 200 microg/kg of enalapril. The intensity of writhing reaction was significantly suppressed by 1,000 nmol/kg of icatibant, a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, in the imidapril-, but not in the enalapril-treated groups. These results suggest that the potentiating effect of enalapril on kaolin-induced writhing reaction is greater than that of imidapril. This might depend on the difference of their inhibitory effects on BK degradation.", 
    "718": "The acute coronary syndrome is the manifestation of a plaque rupture in a coronary artery, which can lead to intermittent or prolonged regional myocardial ischemia. In such a situation, the underlying atherosclerotic lesion is a complex one. Moreover, the mechanisms leading to the instability of an atherosclerotic plaque are complex themselves. This makes it problematic to systematically analyze the nature of the acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, no animal model is available to study this process.", 
    "719": "Substantial insights into the basis of the acute coronary syndrome have been gathered by pathomorphological analyses, which have helped to identify a number of criteria describing a vulnerable plaque. Clinical studies have helped to identify the thrombotic component as an important aspect of the clinical manifestation of the acute coronary syndrome. Based on such data, well-defined antithrombotic strategies play an important role in today's therapy of the acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "720": "Concerning the triggering mechanisms for an acute coronary syndrome, there is a number of suspected processes, the most important of which is local inflammation of the coronary plaque. Inflammatory processes have recently been recognized as important stimulators of vascular modeling during atherogenesis. These inflammatory mechanisms involve a number of different cytokines, cells of the immune system and other components of the immune systems such as the complement cascade. C-reactive protein may even be a link between systemic and local inflammatory processes, because it has been shown to be systemically elevated in patients with unstable angina, and--most recently--has been shown to be involved in the initiation and progression of early atherosclerotic lesions. Local inflammation of the atherosclerotic plaques induces the expression of a number of growth factors and other potent molecules that contribute to vascular remodeling. These substances are acting on smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts as well as on the extracellular matrix and include growth factors, matrixmetalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase. Another component of potential significance within the unstable plaque is the process called plaque-angiogenesis. Plaque-angiogenesis occurs within complicated atherosclerotic plaques, the process of angiogenesis leads to destabilization of the extracellular matrix and, moreover, newly formed capillaries are more likely to rupture and may therefore be an important trigger of plaque rupture and of the acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "721": "A number of molecular strategies including inhibition of matrix metalloproteinasis or inhibitors of angiogenesis may turn out to stabilize the vulnerable plaque. Until these therapeutic concepts may be used in the clinic, our therapeutic repertoire will mostly consist of antithrombotic and entire antiinflammatory approaches.", 
    "722": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve endothelial function, inhibit experimental atherogenesis, and decrease ischemic events. The Quinapril Ischemic Event Trial was designed to test the hypothesis that quinapril 20 mg/day would reduce ischemic events (the occurrence of cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty, or hospitalization for angina pectoris) and the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in patients without systolic left ventricular dysfunction. A total of 1,750 patients were randomized to quinapril 20 mg/day or placebo and followed a mean of 27 +/- 0.3 months. The 38% incidence of ischemic events was similar for both groups (RR 1.04; 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22; p = 0.6). There was also no significant difference in the incidence of patients having angiographic progression of coronary disease (p = 0.71). The rate of development of new coronary lesions was also similar in both groups (p = 0.35). However, there was a difference in the incidence of angioplasty for new (previously unintervened) vessels (p = 0.018). Quinapril was well tolerated in patients after angioplasty with normal left ventricular function. Quinapril 20 mg did not significantly affect the overall frequency of clinical outcomes or the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. However, the absence of the demonstrable effect of quinapril may be due to several limitations in study design.", 
    "723": "Sixteen patients with mild to moderate heart failure were examined to investigate whether sympathetic deactivation plays a role in the improvement in the failing heart by chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Measurements, including echocardiography, blood examinations, neurohumoral samplings (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), norepinephrine), and spectral heart rate variability analysis by Holter electrocardiography, were carried out before and 6 months after the administration of lisinopril (5-10 mg/day). Quality of life assessment was accomplished by the Specific Activity Scale (SAS) questionnaire. Treatment with lisinopril for 6 months resulted in a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. The left ventricular diastolic dimension significantly decreased and fractional shortening significantly increased on echocardiography. Of the 16 patients, 8 had improvement in their symptoms as measured by the SAS. Lisinopril did not significantly reduce the plasma norepinephrine concentration, but there was a significant reduction in the plasma ANP and BNP concentrations. In the heart rate power spectral analysis, total spectral power, high-frequency components and low/high frequency ratios did not change significantly with lisinopril. The mechanism by which ACE inhibitors improve mild to moderate heart failure is not by suppressing sympathetic activity.", 
    "724": "Cyclosporine (CsA) treatment in solid organ transplantation has represented one of the greatest advances in the past 20 years, reducing acute rejection and increasing long-term survival. However, CsA has an important side effect, producing renal vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension. The main histological findings in the kidney are vascular lesions in the endothelium and smooth muscle cells. On proximal tubule cells, severe atrophy, vacuolization and thickening of the basal membrane can be found. The main mechanisms of vasoconstriction are secondary to endothelium disorders, increasing vasoconstrictor substances like endothelin, thromboxane, free radicals, etc., and reducing vasodilator substances like nitric oxide and prostaglandins. CsA acute nephrotoxicity produces haemodynamic changes with minor histological lesions, which will disappear when the medication is discontinued. Long-term CsA nephrotoxicity has been widely discussed in the literature. For some authors, a limited number of patients can develop end-state renal failure but others did not suffer these complications. Nevertheless, it seems clear that high doses of CsA can produce renal lesion and renal insufficiency, being difficult to evaluate in renal transplant patients because of the frequent association with chronic rejection lesions. Several types of drugs have been used to treat CsA nephrotoxicity in renal transplant patients but calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors are the most frequently used, especially the former due to their effect on the afferent arteriole vasodilatation, their natriuretic properties and their reducing intracellular calcium. The greatest experience has been with nifedipine, but other drugs like verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, etc., have also been used. Lacidipine, a 1,4-dihydropiridine, has demonstrated a beneficial effect during the short term after renal transplantation, and a multicentre, multinational, double-bind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the long term currently ongoing.", 
    "725": "The emphasis on evidence-based medicine and the use of safe, cost-effective therapeutic strategies demands that management decisions be based upon evidence derived from clinical studies. Whilst prospective double blind clinical trials are regarded as the gold standard, there is no doubt that meta-analysis has proved valuable in defining the benefits of antihypertensive therapy. The antihypertensive efficacy of lacidipine has been assessed in a retrospective meta-analysis of a series of clinical studies in which the drug was compared with placebo and all the major classes of antihypertensive agent. All of the studies entered into the meta-analysis were parallel group double blind trials. Efficacy was based upon the reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the effect on heart rate at trough immediately prior to dosing during maintenance therapy. In placebo controlled trials a clear dose response relationship was apparent with blood pressure reductions that were significantly greater than that observed with placebo at doses of 2 mg lacidipine and above. In active control trials, diastolic blood pressure reductions of 10-15 mmHg were observed at the end of the monotreatment phases (> 6-8 weeks) with a final reduction of 15-20 mmHg with the efficacy of lacidipine being equivalent to that of the comparator drug. Comparable results were also achieved for the response rates to therapy which varied between 70 and 85% at the end of the monotreatment phase and 82-98 when combination with other antihypertensive agents was permitted. There was no evidence of cardio-acceleration in any of the trials where significant blood pressure reduction was detected. This retrospective analysis in a large population base confirms the documented antihypertensive efficacy of lacidipine and demonstrates the suitability of the drug as a first line antihypertensive agent.", 
    "726": "To study whether administration of 1.25 and 5.0 mg ramipril daily, compared with placebo treatment, reduces the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes.", 
    "727": "Ramipril was administered double blind at two different doses (1.25 [n = 19] and 5.0 mg [n = 18]), and compared with placebo (n = 18) after a single-blind placebo period of 1-4 weeks. The patients (total, n = 55; women, n = 14) were followed for 2 years. To document an effect on the renin-angiotensin system, ACE activity and plasma-renin activity (PRA) were measured. In addition, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was recorded at baseline and repeated after 1 and 2 years using a Spacelab 90207 ambulatory BP recording device (Spacelab, Redmont, CA).", 
    "728": "Both doses of ramipril were sufficient to reduce ACE activity and to increase PRA significantly as compared with placebo (P < 0.05 for both). On the other hand, neither ambulatory nor clinic BP was affected by either dose of ramipril compared with the placebo group. There was no progression of UAER in the placebo group during the 2 years of the study. Analysis of covariance showed no differences in UAER between the three treatment groups at year 1 (P = 0.94) or year 2 (P = 0.97), after adjusting for baseline. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant changes from baseline UAER within any of the three treatment groups.", 
    "729": "Treatment with ramipril did not affect microalbuminuria or clinic or ambulatory BP in this study. On the basis of the present study, we question the clinical use of ACE inhibitors in stably normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria in whom a concomitant reduction in BP is not demonstrated.", 
    "730": "Both aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ACE inhibitors are often used concomitantly, especially in patients with both heart failure and ischaemic heart disease, which is the most common underlying cause of heart failure. The safety of the association has been questioned because both drugs affect a related prostaglandin-mediated pathway. Thanks to their vasodilating properties, prostaglandins play an important role in heart failure where peripheral vasoconstriction occurs. Some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors might be related to reduced degradation of bradykinin that enhances the synthesis of prostaglandins, while aspirin, through inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, inhibits the production of prostaglandins. To date no prospective study has been conducted to investigate the effect of long term aspirin treatment in the postinfarction period allowing the possible impact of the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors upon survival to be confirmed or negated. However, the practitioner needs to know how to optimise the treatment of his or her patients. In order to stimulate arguments for and against the use of aspirin in patients with heart failure receiving ACE inhibitors, we searched MEDLINE from 1960 to 2000 using the key words heart failure, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors for English language articles and conducted a review of the available data. We report on the potential mechanisms of the interaction and the results of experimental studies on haemodynamic parameters. Results of retrospective clinical studies, subgroup analysis that were undertaken to evaluate the overall action upon haemodynamic parameters and survival of the association are summarised. Conflicting conclusions have been reported in the literature. Many explanations can be advanced to try to understand these conflicting conclusions: differences in study design (results of retrospective trials have to be interpreted with caution); differences in the choice of the evaluation parameter (problem of the clinical relevance of haemodynamic parameters); differences in the characteristics of the patient (different underlying cardiopathy, e.g. heart failure, hypertension or ischaemic cardiopathy); and differences in the type and the dosage of each treatment (especially ACE inhibitors and aspirin since an interaction might occur more often with dosage of aspirin greater than 250mg).", 
    "731": "The possible contributions of the angiotensin receptor subtypes 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) to angiotensin II-induced changes in collagen secretion and production were studied using the specific angiotensin receptor AT1 and AT2 antagonists telmisartan and P-186. The role of the renin-angiotensin system and its interaction with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in collagen deposition in cardiac fibroblasts in relation to the development of myocardial fibrosis is also discussed. Cardiac fibroblasts (from normal male adult rats) from passage 2 were cultured to confluency and incubated in the presence of angiotensin II (ANG II) in a concentration range of 10(-10)-10(-6) M in serum-free Dulbecco's MEM medium for 24 h. Collagen production and secretion were assayed by [3H]-proline incorporation and noncollagen production and secretion were also analyzed. ANG II dose-dependently increased collagen secretion and production in rat adult cardiac fibroblasts in culture. Noncollagen secretion and production were also concentration-dependently increased by ANG II. Addition of 100 nmol/l ANG II increased (p < 0.01) collagen secretion and production by 75 +/- 6 (SEM) and 113 +/- 23%, respectively, and noncollagen secretion and production by 65 +/- 6 and 57 +/- 16%, respectively. Pretreatment of cardiac fibroblasts with telmisartan completely blocked the ANG II-induced increase in collagen secretion (p < 0.001) and production (p < 0.05) and in noncollagen secretion (p < 0.01) and production (p < 0.01). P-186 had no effect on the ANG II-induced increase in collagen secretion and production. Addition of telmisartan and P-186 did not affect collagen secretion and production in basal cardiac fibroblasts. TGF-beta 1 also concentration- and time-dependently increased the secretion and production of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that the effects of ANG II on collagen secretion and production in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts in culture are AT1-receptor mediated since they were abolished by the specific AT1-receptor antagonist telmisartan but not by the specific AT2-receptor antagonist P-186. The ability of ANG II to induce collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts may be mediated by increased TGF-beta 1 production.", 
    "732": "Renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the central nervous system participates in the processing of sensory information, learning and memory processes. Inhibitors of RAS, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists are reported to have potential nootropic effects in various learning and memory paradigms. The neurochemical basis underlying nootropic effect of ACE inhibitors are unclear due to wide range of substrate for this enzyme. In this study, we compared the effect of ACE inhibitor captopril and a selective AT(1)receptor antagonist losartan in a step-up shock avoidance (active avoidance) task. Captopril (5-10 mg/kg) but not losartan (5-10 mg/kg) improved learning in the second trial of the acquisition test. However, both these drugs were equally effective in enhancing retention of memory when administered prior to training. Retention enhancing effect of captopril and losartan were reversed by post-acquisition test administration of L-NAME (15 mg/kg), dizocilpine (0.05 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg). On the basis of above observations, it is concluded that decrease in endogenous Ang II activity in the brain might result in improved cognitive performance by enhancing cGMP pathways. However facilitation of acquisition only by captopril may be due to other putative mechanisms.", 
    "733": "Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for the development of hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, and heart failure. It reflects a disturbance of glucose metabolism and potentially worsens metabolic efficiency of both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. The exact mechanisms of insulin resistance are not known, but the finding of significant insulin resistance occurring as a consequence of heart failure raises interesting possibilities as to its pathogenesis. While sympathetic nervous system overactivity can acutely reduce insulin sensitivity, it is not clear to what extent, in stable optimally treated chronic heart failure (CHF), the neurohormonal overactivity of this syndrome is the major cause of insulin resistance. Other potential mechanisms include the loss of skeletal muscle bulk, impaired endothelial function and reduced skeletal muscle blood flow, and a possible direct action of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The consequences of insulin resistance in heart failure are not known, but the severity of the abnormality appears to parallel symptomatics and exercise limitation in this condition, and, in particular, be related to the impairment of gross skeletal muscle function. While specific therapies to correct insulin resistance in CHF have not been evaluated, there are several exciting possibilities on the horizon. Several nonpharmacological therapies have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in patients with normal left ventricular function, and if these benefits could be duplicated in CHF, they may offer symptomatic benefit. These include weight reduction in the obese, regular exercise training and the use of dietary manipulation such as low-fat, high-fibre diets. Drug treatments with positive effects on insulin sensitivity include some angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors as well as newer drug groups, such as the glitazones and moxonidine, a centrally active agent with effects on the recently described imidazoline I-1 receptor that inhibits central sympathetic tone. The role of these agents in reversing the insulin resistance of chronic heart failure warrants further investigation.",

Carvedilol also decreased the mean number of hospitalizations per patient (for cardiovascular reasons 30% [p = 0.02], for heart failure 53% [p = 0.03]).

Since angiotensin II receptor antagonists can inhibit the effects of angiotensin II via ACE-independent pathways, e.g., chymase, they were considered to be more effective than ACEIs. On the other hand, ACE inhibitors can increase bradykinin, and thus, nitric oxide, which may cause potent cardioprotection, inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation and attenuation of inflammation mechanisms. It appears that angiotensin II receptor antagonists and ACEIs may mediate cardioprotection in different ways. This is the rationale to explore the possibility of a combined administration of both drugs for the treatment of chronic heart failure and other cardiovascular pathology. In this review we try to analyze the role of ACE, kinins and chymase inhibition in the pathophysiology and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "755": "The causes of chronic heart failure at the end of the 20th century are quite different from those 30 or 50 years ago. The last data from the Framingham study indicate that ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension are the main cause in as many as 90% patients. The prevalence of chronic heart failure in European countries, 0.4-2%, implies 40-200,000 patients in the Czech Republic. Pharmacological treatment during the last 15 years revealed clearly that the drugs of choice which prolong life are inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) which are combined with other drugs as needed by the patient. A combination of five drug groups (ACE-I, digitalis, diuretics, beta-blockers, and spironolactone) are nowadays the basic treatment. In the 4S study (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study--4,444 patients with ischaemic heart disease followed up for 5.4 years) 412 (9.2%) developed chronic heart failure requiring treatment, i.e. 228 (10.3%) in the placebo group and 184 (8.3%) patients in the group treated with simvastatin (p < 0.015). In the group of patients with signs of heart failure 73 of 228 died the placebo group and 47 of 184 in the simvastatin group (reduction of the relative risk by 19%, p = 0.014), to save one life (NNT) it was necessary to treat 15 patients for a period of 5 years. From the aspect of the number of patients it was necessary to treat six times as many patients without heart failure than with heart failure to save one life in five years. Hypolipidaemic treatment should be an obvious part of treatment of heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Hyperlipoproteinaemia is described in 60-80% patients after transplantation of the heart. Treatment involves diet, reduction or discontinuation of corticoids, maintenance of cyclosporin at the lowest effective level and treatment wit statins.",

No differences in efficacy in reducing glycaemia were found in the intensive treatment between sulphonylurea, insulin and metformin, but all of them were more effective than diet alone. However, mean baseline glucose concentrations in all treatment groups steadily increased over the entire study period. The reduction of macrovascular complications was seen only in the group of obese diabetics with metformin monotherapy. The great reduction of macrovascular complications was seen in the group of good blood pressure, and no differences between ACE-inhibitor and betablocker were established. There were no more ischemic complications among patients receiving sulphonylurea's medication and there were no more atherosclerotic complications in patients receiving insulin.",

    "762": "The DD genotype for the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE I) deletion allele (D) polymorphism is a possible genetic risk factor for restenosis after coronary stent implantation. We aimed to establish whether or not blockade of ACE with high doses of ACE inhibitors could reduce this risk of angiographic restenosis.", 
    "763": "We characterised the ACE I/D polymorphism in 345 consecutive patients who were undergoing coronary stenting. 115 had the DD genotype. We assigned 91 of these 115 patients to quinapril 40 mg daily (n=46) or placebo (n=45). Treatment was started within 48 h after stent implantation and continued for 6 months. 79 patients complied with the protocol and underwent follow-up angiography after 6 months.",

Secondary endpoints also showed consistent trends towards increased angiographic restenosis in the treatment group.",

    "766": "A local renin angiotensin (ANG) system has been identified in the bladder. To our knowledge little is known about this system. To define further the physiology of this system we performed this study.", 
    "767": "The circulating and bladder tissue concentrations of ANG I and ANG II were examined in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley female rats in estrus, diestrus or pregnancy. Each was given an intravenous bolus infusion of ANG I, the ANG converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat or saline.", 
    "768": "The mean concentrations of ANG I and ANG II were markedly higher in bladder tissue than in whole blood at the highest levels in pregnancy. The concentration of ANG I and ANG II increased significantly in the bladder tissue and circulation after the ANG I infusion in estrus and diestrus. In pregnancy only circulatory ANG I increased, while circulatory ANG II, tissue ANG I and ANG II remained unchanged. Enalaprilat infusion was associated with an increased concentration of whole blood ANG I in all groups and decreased plasma ANG II in estrus and diestrus but not in pregnancy. The bladder tissue ANG I response was unchanged in all groups. Bladder tissue ANG II was decreased in estrus and diestrus but unchanged in pregnancy.", 
    "769": "These data support the hypothesis that ANG converting enzyme is deactivated and an alternate pathway is activated in pregnancy. The data also demonstrate that tissue absorption of ANG peptide is diminished in pregnancy. Compared with responses in similarly studied male rats the circulating conversion of ANG I to ANG II is delayed in female rats and responses to ANG converting enzyme inhibition are enhanced, thus, suggesting subtle differences in the sexes in the renin ANG system. Enalapril appears to have more effect at the tissue level in nonpregnant females than in pregnant females and male rats.", 
    "770": "The study presented here demonstrates that the antihypertensive drug captopril ([2S]-N-[3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L-proline) is an irreversible non-competitive inhibitor and an irreversible competitive inhibitor of the monophenolase and diphenolase activities of mushroom tyrosinase when L-tyrosine and L-DOPA were assayed spectrophotometrically in vitro, respectively. Captopril was rendered unstable by tyrosinase catalysis because of the interaction between the enzymatic-generated product (o-quinone) and captopril to give rise to a colourless conjugate. Therefore, captopril was able to prevent melanin formation. The spectrophotometric recordings of the inhibition of tyrosinase by captopril were characterised by the presence of a lag period prior to the attainment of an inhibited steady state rate. The lag period corresponded to the time in which captopril was reacting with the enzymatically generated o-quinone. Increasing captopril concentrations provoked longer lag periods as well as a concomitant decrease in the tyrosinase activity. Both lag period and steady state rate were dependent of captopril, substrate and tyrosinase concentrations. The inhibition of both monophenolase and diphenolase activities of tyrosinase by captopril showed positive kinetic co-operativity which arose from the protection of both substrate and o-quinone against inhibition by captopril. Inhibition experiments carried out using a latent mushroom tyrosinase demonstrated that captopril only bound the enzyme at its active site. The presence of copper ions only partially prevented but not reverted mushroom tyrosinase inhibition. This could be due to the formation of both copper-captopril complex and disulphide interchange reactions between captopril and cysteine rich domains at the active site of the enzyme.", 
    "771": "The number of patients who needs for dialysis therapy is increasing rapidly among the older population. Although control of hypertension can delay or arrest the progression of renal failure, there are lacking of studies about antihypertensive treatment of chronic renal failure in the elderly. We have studied the effects of treating hypertension with a calcium antagonist, benidipine, on renal function and blood pressure in 58 patients (mean age: 71 +/- 9) with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency (the levels of creatinine ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mg/dl). The underlying disease included glomerulopathies (in 33), diabetic nephropathy (in 15), and other causes (in 10). Forty two patients who had been treated with other antihypertensive drugs other than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antihypertensive drugs were withdrawn 2 weeks before the entry. At the entry, patients should have sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) of above 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of above 90 mmHg. In total, both SBP and DBP decreased from 169/95+/-12.5/8.9 to 148/81+/-16.1/8.0 mmHg (p<0.001) with remaining the serum creatinine levels from 2.2+/-0.8 vs 2.4+/-1.3 mg/dl (P>0.05). Retrospective analysis revealed that in 4 of 4 patients treated with benidipine and 2 of 3 patients with benidipine and ACE inhibitors with systolic blood pressure more than 160 mmHg at the end of the study, the levels of serum creatinine increased from 2.5+/-0.3 to 2.8+/-0.4 with significance (P<0.05). If systolic blood pressure was reduced less than 159 mmHg, 38 of 48 patients did not show any deterioration of renal function. Compared to the significance of SBP in preserving renal function, DBP did not associate with the changes in renal function. No patients died during the study. One patient had transient ischemic attack and one patient had stroke in benidipine treated group. One patient had angina pectoris in benidipine-ACE inhibitors treated group. The results of our trial seem to give some support for the idea that long-acting calcium antagonists such as benidipine are renoprotective through reduction of SBP in the elderly people with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. However, if systolic blood pressure was not reduced below 160 mmHg throughout a year, the substantial declines in renal function would be expected.",

    "774": "During the first 12 weeks, the percentage of subjects continuing with their initial angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (40.7%) was substantially lower than that of subjects continuing with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA) (66.2%), alpha-blockers (63.0%), calcium channel blockers (CCB) (61.3%), beta-blockers (55.8%), and diuretics (53.5%), respectively (P < 0.01). The following adverse reactions were detected: cough (7.5%), headache (6.1%), dizziness (3.9%), flushing (3.7%) and impotence (2.4%). Cough, headache, and flushing were more frequent in women, and impotence and loss of libido were more frequent in men (P < 0.05).

For captopril these values reached 21.2 and 26.9%, 0.51 +/- 0.14 and 0.47 +/- 0.10, respectively. Differences by SI between the two drugs were statistically insignificant. Both drugs did not raise the rate and index of AP morning rise significantly.",

The synthesis and enzymatic conversion of 2-keto-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid 3 to L-6-hydroxynorleucine 2 was demonstrated by reductive amination using beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase. To avoid the lengthy chemical synthesis of the ketoacid 3, a second route was developed to prepare the ketoacid by treatment of racemic 6-hydroxy norleucine [readily available from hydrolysis of 5-(4-hydroxybutyl) hydantoin 4] with D-amino acid oxidase from porcine kidney or Trigonopsis variabilis followed by reductive amination to convert the mixture completely to L-6-hydroxynorleucine in 98% yield and 99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.). The enzymatic synthesis of (S)-2-amino-5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-pentanoic acid (allysine ethylene acetal, 5) was demonstrated using phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PDH) from T. intermedius. Phenylalanine dehydrogenase was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Using PDH from E. coli or P. pastoris, the enzymatic process was scale-up to prepare kg quantity of allysine ethylene acetal 5. The reaction yields of >94% and e.e. of >98% were obtained for allysine ethylene acetal 5. An enzymatic process was developed for the synthesis of [4S-(4a,7a,10ab)]1-octahydro-5-oxo-4 [[(phenylmethoxy)carbonyl]amino]-7H-pyrido-[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazepine-7-carboxylic acid [BMS-199541-01].

This enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli and a process was developed using the recombinant enzyme.", 
    "785": "Along with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have gradually emerged to be standard in the therapy of heart failure. Individual beta-blockers that have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure include bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol. Carvedilol distinguishes from the other beta-blockers as being a non-selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor blocker with (1)-receptor blockade effect and anti-oxidant properties. The drug does not have sympathomimetic activity and has vasodilatory effects attributable to its (1)-receptor blockade property. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed carvedilol's vasodilator, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which may contribute to its effect in reversing cardiac remodelling in animal models and patients with heart failure. These pharmacological properties render carvedilol a potentially useful agent in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Early studies of carvedilol in heart failure have reported beneficial haemodynamic effects but variable effects on exercise tolerance and clinical well being. The large-scale US Carvedilol Heart Failure Program and the Australian/New Zealand Heart Failure Collaborative Research Group reported beneficial effects of carvedilol on mortality, morbidity and clinical well being in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. The recently reported but yet unpublished preliminary results of the COPERNICUS study suggest that carvedilol improves mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure and severe symptoms. At this time, it is unclear whether the ancillary pharmacological properties of carvedilol can be translated to more superior clinical benefit compared to the other beta-blockers. Preliminary studies examining surrogate end points suggest that carvedilol may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than metoprolol. More conclusive information regarding their relative effects of clinical outcomes will await the completion of the COMET study, which compares the effect of metoprolol and carvedilol on mortality and morbidity, expected at the end of the year 2002.", 
    "786": "Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease have all been linked to inadequate control of blood pressure. Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a sizeable number of adverse health-related outcomes, control of the disease remains considerably suboptimal. Available data demonstrate that in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control, a large number of patients require therapy with more than one medication. Fixed dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, rates of adherence, adverse effects and cost have been identified. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel), Novartis) is a fixed dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor possesses substantial blood pressure lowering capabilities. Whereas adverse events tend to become more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials often correlates with rates ascribed to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is capable of sustaining blood pressure control over a 24 h period and appears to be minimally affected by an occasional dose omission. Unlike the older calcium antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause alterations in myocardial contractility. Additionally, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs less than the same therapy administered as the individual components. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider therapy with amlodipine/benazepril in appropriate patients after an adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.", 
    "787": "The effects of a synthetic preparation of an active constituent of garlic, allicin, were studied on blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, and insulin levels in Sprague-Dawley rats in which high fructose feeding elicited hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. Results were compared with those of the antihypertensive drug enalapril. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 5 weeks. During the last 2 weeks 10 animals received only fructose, 10 received allicin, and 10 received enalapril. Blood pressure, insulin level, and triglyceride levels were measured at the beginning of the experiment and after 3 and 5 weeks on the fructose diet, fructose/allicin diet, or fructose/enalapril diet. Allicin lowered BP from the maximal level (after 3 weeks of fructose) of 153.4 +/- 8 mm Hg to 139.7 +/- 12 mm Hg after 2 weeks on allicin; insulin from 11.7 +/- 3.7 ng/mL on fructose diet to 6.92 +/- 3.3 ng/mL on allicin; and triglycerides from 132.8 +/- 18 mg/dL on fructose to 59.6 +/- 27 mg/dL on allicin. The similar effect of allicin and enalapril on BP, insulin, and triglycerides reinforces the trend toward combining the nonpharmacologic approach with drug therapy.", 
    "788": "Angiotensin II and nitric oxide (NO) may play a role in hypertensive cardiovascular remodeling. We evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), ACE, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in the left ventricle and evaluated these relations to myocardial remodeling in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats were induced with weekly injections of DOCA (30 mg/kg) and 1% saline in drinking water after right nephrectomy. Quinapril (DOCA-QUI, 10 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose) or AT1 receptor antagonist TCV-116 (DOCA-TCV, 5 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose) or vehicle (DOCA-V) were given after induction of DOCA-salt hypertension for 5 weeks, and age-matched sham-operated rats (ShC) served as a control group. The eNOS expression in the left ventricle were significantly decreased in DOCA-V compared with ShC, and were significantly increased in DOCA-QUI and DOCA-TCV compared with ShC and DOCA-V. The gene expression of ACE, AT1 receptor, and type I collagen mRNA were significantly increased in DOCA-V compared with ShC, and significantly suppressed in DOCA-QUI compared with DOCA-V. The DOCA-V rats demonstrated a significant increase of the wall-to-lumen ratio, perivascular fibrosis, and myocardial fibrosis, with all these parameters being significantly improved by quinapril. Myocardial remodeling in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was significantly ameliorated by a subdepressor dose of quinapril, which may be due to an increase in eNOS mRNA and protein expression and a decrease in ACE and AT1 receptor mRNA expression in the left ventricle.", 
    "789": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effect of long-term (2-year) lisinopril treatment on cardiovascular end-organ damage in patients with previously untreated isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). All patients with ISH were derived from a population screening program. End-organ damage measurements, done initially and after 6 and 24 months of treatment, included measurements of aortic distensibility and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and diastolic function. Blood pressure was measured by office and ambulatory measurements. Of the 97 subjects with ISH selected from the screening, 62 (30 lisinopril) completed the study according to protocol. Office blood pressure decreased in both groups, but ambulatory results significantly decreased with lisinopril-treatment only. Aortic distensibility increased significantly with lisinopril, as opposed to a decrease in placebo-treated subjects. The main effect of increased distensibility occurred between 6 and 24 months, whereas ambulatory blood pressure changed mainly in the first 6 months of treatment. LVMI decreased in both treatment groups, with a significantly higher reduction in lisinopril-treated subjects. Left ventricular diastolic function showed no significant changes in either group. The vascular pathophysiologic alterations of ISH-a decreased aortic distensibility-can be improved with long-term lisinopril treatment, whereas values deteriorate further in placebo-treated subjects. These results, in one of the first studies including subjects with previously untreated ISH only, indicate that lisinopril treatment might favorably influence the cardiovascular risk of ISH.", 
    "790": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria.", 
    "791": "Increased polyol pathway flux has been linked to nerve complications in diabetic rats, which are attenuated by aldose reductase inhibitors, defective nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation being a particular target. Diabetes also elevates the endothelial angiotensin system, increasing vasa nervorum vasoconstriction. The aim was to assess whether promotion of vasodilation by treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor, ZD5522 (3',5'-dimethyl-4'-nitromethylsulphonyl-2-(2-tolyl)acetanilide), coupled with reduced vasoconstriction using the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, interacted positively to improve neurovascular function. After 8 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, sciatic nerve blood flow and motor conduction velocity were 51% and 21% reduced, respectively. Two weeks of lisinopril treatment dose-dependently corrected the conduction deficit (ED(50) approximately 0.9 mg kg(-1)). Low-dose lisinopril (0.3 mg kg(-1)) or ZD5522 (0.25 mg kg(-1)) had modest corrective (10-20%) effects on nerve conduction and perfusion. However, when combined, blood flow and conduction velocity reached the nondiabetic range. The ZD5522 dose used gave a approximately 45% nerve sorbitol reduction but had no significant effect on fructose content; lisinopril co-treatment did not alter ZD5522 action on polyols. Thus, there was a marked neurovascular synergistic interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme and aldose reductase inhibition in diabetic rats. This points to a potential therapeutic benefit, which requires evaluation in clinical trials.", 
    "792": "Long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system exerts adverse biologic effects that are mediated through alpha(1), beta(1) and beta(2) receptors and that contribute importantly to the progression of heart failure. As a result, beta blockers are no longer considered to be contraindicated for use in these patients but instead now play a critical role in the successful management of chronic heart failure. Beta blockers have been evaluated in >15,000 patients with heart failure who have participated in placebo-controlled trials. The results of these studies indicate that, like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, long-term treatment with beta blockers can lessen symptoms and improve clinical status and can reduce the risk of death as well as the combined risk of death or hospitalization. The database supporting the use of beta blockers is now as persuasive (and arguably more persuasive) than the database supporting the use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure (which comprises about 7,000 patients). Yet, the benefits of beta blockers are seen in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, suggesting that combined blockade of two neurohormonal systems (renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system) can produce additive effects.", 
    "793": "Heart failure exacts a severe human and public health toll. In the United States, heart failure afflicts approximately 5 million patients and is responsible for or contributes to 3 million hospitalizations and 300,000 deaths yearly. Physicians can have a major impact on this disease by using effective agents for the treatment of heart failure (particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and beta blockers), yet the actual clinical use of these drugs (especially the use of beta blockers by primary physicians) is disappointingly low. Many physicians appear to be reluctant to prescribe beta blockers for two reasons. First, they are concerned about the potential interference of beta blockers with important compensatory mechanisms that support the failing heart and fear that such interference may lead to clinical deterioration. Second, they fail to identify patients with heart failure (especially those with mild or moderate symptoms) or regard such patients as being too well to require additional treatment. These reasons should no longer be used as excuses to avoid the use of these drugs, given the persuasive evidence that beta blockers can improve symptoms and prolong life in patients with heart failure. Instead, physicians must recognize that long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system primarily exerts deleterious (rather than compensatory) effects in patients with heart failure and that these actions can be antagonized effectively and safely by the appropriate use of beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "794": "Multidrug therapy offers several advantages in the management of mild-to-moderate heart failure. Treatment with a combination of agents, such as diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers, can provide relief of symptoms while also addressing specific pathophysiologic factors. By allowing therapy to be tailored to the individual, the multidrug approach can slow progression of the disease, reduce or prevent the need for hospitalization, and decrease health-care costs. Evidence of the benefit of the multidrug approach has come from numerous trials in which newer treatments for heart failure have been evaluated in the context of the background therapy considered standard at the time of the trial. Compliance may be a challenge with multidrug therapy, particularly for patients who generally feel well and do not experience symptoms that interfere with normal daily function. The clinician must ensure that patients understand the need to comply with the prescribed regimen to prevent more serious problems in the future. Multidrug therapy may also require that patients be more closely monitored so that dosages of the individual medications can be adjusted to provide maximum benefit with a minimum of side effects.", 
    "795": "Clinical trials of beta blockers in heart failure have generally required that patients be receiving optimal drug therapy before randomization to the study medication. Therefore, because beta blockers are used in addition to conventional drug therapy, review of the standard drug therapy of mild-to-moderate heart failure before the advent of beta blockade is essential to understanding the role of beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. The conventional medical management of systolic heart failure includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which should be used as first-line therapy; diuretics, for the management of body fluid-volume excess; digoxin; and some other vasodilators. These therapies have been evaluated in large-scale, randomized, controlled trials. ACE inhibitors have been shown to significantly attenuate disease progression and improve outcome (ie, morbidity and mortality) in patients with mild-to-moderate systolic heart failure. Controversial or unproven therapies include nonglycoside inotropic agents, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, antiarrhythmic agents, anticoagulants, and calcium channel blockers. The pharmacologic management of diastolic heart failure is largely empirical and is directed at reducing symptoms. Symptoms caused by increased ventricular filling pressures may be treated with diuretics and long-acting nitrates. Some calcium channel blockers and most beta blockers prolong diastolic filling time by slowing heart rate, thereby potentially improving the symptoms of diastolic heart failure. Calcium antagonists, beta blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors may also promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and thus improve ventricular compliance, possibly preventing the development of diastolic dysfunction. Because randomized controlled trials of diastolic heart failure are lacking, this review focuses on the conventional management of mild-to-moderate systolic heart failure before the advent of beta blockade.", 
    "796": "Heart failure is a changing paradigm. The hemodynamic model, which served our needs well from the 1950s through the early 1980s, has now been largely abandoned, except for the management of decompensated patients in the hospital. The pathophysiology is exceedingly complex and involves structural changes, such as loss of myofilaments, apoptosis and disorganization of the cytoskeleton, as well as disturbances in Ca(2+) homeostasis, alteration in receptor density, signal transduction, and collagen synthesis. A more contemporary working hypothesis is that heart failure is a progressive disorder of left ventricular remodeling, usually resulting from an index event, that culminates in a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and circulatory congestion. This change in the framework of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure is predicated on the results of numerous clinical trials conducted during the past 20 years. New therapies are now evolving that are designed to inhibit neuroendocrine and cytokine activation, whereas drugs specifically designed to heighten cardiac contractility and \"unload\" the left ventricle have proven to be unhelpful in long-term management of patients with chronic heart failure. However, the hemodynamic model is still relevant for patients in the hospital with decompensated heart failure, where positive inotropic drugs and vasodilators are still widely used. The modern treatment of chronic heart failure is now largely based on the neurohormonal hypothesis, which states that neuroendocrine activation is important in the progression of heart failure and that inhibition of neurohormones is likely to have long-term benefit with regard to morbidity and mortality. Thus, the evolution of treatment for chronic heart failure as a result of clinical trials has provided much enlightenment for our understanding of the fundamental biology of the disorder, a reversal of the usual flow of information from basic science to clinical investigation.", 
    "797": "There is strong evidence that imbalance of the fibrinolytic system is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic cardiovascular events. A reduction in fibrinolytic function may also mediate part of the adverse response of the vasculature to conditions of low nitric oxide production. Because reduced nitric oxide activity predisposes to the development of atherosclerosis, imbalance of the fibrinolytic system is heavily implicated in the development of cardiovascular pathology. The renin-angiotensin system exerts substantial control over the fibrinolytic system, and pharmacologic interventions that reduce the activity of angiotensin II also have favorable effects on fibrinolytic balance and on the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. This review summarizes the evidence for a link between activation of the renin-angiotensin system, fibrinolytic imbalance, and cardiovascular pathology.", 
    "798": "Hypertension is associated with a number of adverse morphologic and functional changes in the cardiovascular system. These include remodeling of the left ventricle, alterations in the morphology and mechanical properties of the vasculature, and the development of endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that angiotensin II is capable of mediating these changes via its interaction with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. These nonhemodynamic effects of angiotensin II are independent of its effect on blood pressure. Thus, elevated levels of angiotensin II may lead directly to many hypertension-associated pathologies. Recent evidence that mechanical strain, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and aldosterone can cause upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptors indicates that activation of the renin-angiotensin system is not necessary for the actions of angiotensin II to be amplified. Because the strain on the vessel wall may be increased under conditions of hypertension, increased arterial pressure may amplify the actions of angiotensin II without a discernible increase in plasma angiotensin II levels. In both the myocardium and the peripheral vasculature, fibrosis is a major component of the remodeling that occurs in hypertension. There is substantial evidence that transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta(1)) mediates angiotensin-II-induced fibrosis in patients with hypertension and in those with a variety of nephropathies. Mechanical strain also induces fibrosis in a mechanism mediated by TGF-beta(1). This cytokine thus represents a common pathway by which angiotensin II and increased arterial pressure may induce cardiovascular fibrosis.", 
    "799": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of normal blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of hypertension has long been appreciated. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was originally thought to only influence blood pressure, but the results of many preclinical and clinical studies now suggest that Ang II has an important and distinct role in other cardiovascular pathologies. Drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are now widely accepted for the treatment of chronic renal failure and heart failure. Recent studies have shown that Ang II acts directly on the myocardium to cause ventricular hypertrophy, a response that can be prevented or reversed by selective Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists. The utility of angiotensin receptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic renal failure has been demonstrated, and the results of ongoing clinical trials can be expected to prove their benefit in other cardiovascular pathologies.", 
    "800": "In this study we use a novel similarity search technique called latent semantic structure indexing (LaSSI) with joint chemical probes as queries to mine the MDL drug data report database. LaSSI is based on latent semantic indexing developed for searching textual databases. We use atom pair and topological torsion descriptors in our calculations. The results obtained with LaSSI are compared with another in-house similarity search technique TOPOSIM. The results from the similarity searches using joint chemical probes are significantly better than searches using single chemical probes for both LaSSI and TOPOSIM. The selected molecules are closely related in activity to their queries and are ranked among the top 300 scoring molecules of the 82 860 entries in the database. Our implementation of LaSSI is very fast and efficient in finding active compounds. The results also show that LaSSI consistently retrieves more diverse chemical structures representative of the joint chemical probes in comparison to TOPOSIM. The use of multimolecule topological probes to identify compounds complements the use of searching databases with 3D pharmacophore hypotheses.", 
    "801": "The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to progression of renal failure are only partly understood. Several studies in immune- and non-immune-mediated models of renal damage have recently implicated the endothelin (ET) system as a major player in these processes. In animal models, ET receptor antagonists have been shown to be highly effective in abrogating the progression of renal failure. Furthermore, cardiac structural alterations seen in hypertension and/or renal insufficiency, e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy, thickening of intramyocardial arterioles, and the increase in non-vascular interstitial tissue, are largely prevented by ET receptor antagonists. In this context it is of interest that these beneficial renal and cardiac effects are, at least in most studies, independent of systemic blood pressure. In addition to the specific pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system [ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists], blockade of ET receptors or ET converting enzyme (ECE) may be a new tool to interfere with progression of renal failure and cardiovascular remodeling in humans.", 
    "802": "The benefits of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers may be smaller in black patients than in patients of other races, but it is unknown whether race influences the response to carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "803": "In the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, 217 black and 877 nonblack patients (in New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV and with a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 0.35) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or carvedilol (at doses of 6.25 to 50 mg twice daily) for up to 15 months. The effects of carvedilol on ejection fraction, clinical status, and major clinical events were retrospectively compared between black and nonblack patients.", 
    "804": "As compared with placebo, carvedilol lowered the risk of death from any cause or hospitalization for any reason by 48 percent in black patients and by 30 percent in nonblack patients. Carvedilol reduced the risk of worsening heart failure (heart failure leading to death, hospitalization, or a sustained increase in medication) by 54 percent in black patients and by 51 percent in nonblack patients. The ratios of the relative risks associated with carvedilol for these two outcome variables in black as compared with nonblack patients were 0.74 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.34) and 0.94 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 2.05), respectively. Carvedilol also improved functional class, ejection fraction, and the patients' and physicians' global assessments in both the black patients and the nonblack patients. For all these measures of outcome and clinical status, carvedilol was superior to placebo within each racial cohort (P<0.05 in all analyses), and there was no significant interaction between race and treatment (P> 0.05 in all analyses).", 
    "805": "The benefit of carvedilol was apparent and of similar magnitude in both black and nonblack patients with heart failure.", 
    "806": "Black patients with heart failure have a poorer prognosis than white patients, a difference that has not been adequately explained. Whether racial differences in the response to drug treatment contribute to differences in outcome is unclear. To address this issue, we pooled and analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) prevention and treatment trials, two large, randomized trials comparing enalapril with placebo in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "807": "We used a matched-cohort design in which up to four white patients were matched with each black patient according to trial, treatment assignment, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, and age. A total of 1196 white patients (580 from the prevention trial and 616 from the treatment trial) were matched with 800 black patients (404 from the prevention trial and 396 from the treatment trial). The average duration of follow-up was 35 months in the prevention trial and 33 months in the treatment trial.", 
    "808": "The black patients and the matched white patients had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, but the black patients had higher rates of death from any cause (12.2 vs. 9.7 per 100 person-years) and of hospitalization for heart failure (13.2 vs. 7.7 per 100 person-years). Despite similar doses of drug in the two groups, enalapril therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with a 44 percent reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 57 percent) in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among the white patients (P<0.001) but with no significant reduction among black patients (P=0.74). At one year, enalapril therapy was associated with significant reductions from base line in systolic blood pressure (by a mean [+/-SD] of 5.0+/-17.1 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (3.6+/-10.6 mm Hg) among the white patients, but not among the black patients. No significant change in the risk of death was observed in association with enalapril therapy in either group.", 
    "809": "Enalapril therapy is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among white patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but not among similar black patients. This finding underscores the need for additional research on the efficacy of therapies for heart failure in black patients.", 
    "810": "Antihypertensive drugs are frequently changed because of inefficacy and adverse effects. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of changes of the new classes of drugs from the classical beta-blockers and diuretics. We also have calculated the probability of continuing with each class of drug.", 
    "811": "Clinical reports of hypertensive patients of a general practice centre were examined. All changes of treatment and their causes were registered between october 1997 and september 1999. The incidences for global changes and also for intolerance and inefficacy changes were calculated for each drug. Relative risks for beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors of anhidride carbonic enzyme and angiotensine II-receptor-antagonists were analized. The cumulated probability for continuing therapy was also studied.", 
    "812": "27.6% out of 786 courses of treatment were changed, 51.4% due to intolerance and 29,8% due to inefficacy. The probability for continuing was 88% after 3 months, 81% after 6 months, 71% after one year and 54% after 2 years. The probability for discontinuing because of intolerance was higher in the first 3 months (51%), but afterwards it remained stable along the time.", 
    "813": "Antihypertensive drugs are discontinued more frequently than what it would be desirable and their continuing rates are low. Differences observed among each class of drugs are not argument enough for changing the general recommendation of using beta-blockers and diuretics as first choice drugs for initial treatment of hypertension.", 
    "814": "Although a wide range of antihypertensive agents is available, adequate blood pressure control is achieved in only about 25% of hypertensive patients. Poor control rates are often due to inadequate patient compliance and unacceptable side-effects. The importance of once-daily dosing is now fully acknowledged, but it is crucial that therapy when given once a day must be effective at the end of the dosing interval to order to minimize the likelihood of sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a thorough assessment of the blood pressure-lowering characteristics of an antihypertensive agent throughout the dosing interval and can more accurately evaluate differences in the duration of the antihypertensive effect of different agents. Telmisartan, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, has been extensively studied in clinical trials using ABPM. When compared with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan has proved superior in diminishing ambulatory blood pressure throughout the 24-h period between doses. Telmisartan also has excellent tolerability and in clinical trials demonstrates no increase, irrespective of dose level, over placebo in the incidence of adverse events. Thus, telmisartan given once daily provides high efficacy and tolerability, and will hopefully assist in improving both blood pressure control rates and cardiovascular outcomes in the future.", 
    "815": "Diabetic nephropathy, which develops in about 30% of patients with diabetes, is a progressive condition. It is characterized by increased blood pressure, declining glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Lowering of blood pressure in diabetic patients is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk and renal protection. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are the current gold standard treatment for hypertension in patients with type I diabetes because, in addition to their blood pressure lowering ability, they are thought to oppose the increased intraglomerular pressure that is mediated in part by angiotensin II. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists, a more recently developed class of antihypertensive agents, appear to be as effective as ACE inhibitors in delaying the progression of renal injury in animal models of diabetes. They act by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor and may, therefore, offer a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than ACE inhibitors. The renal and antihypertensive effects of this class of drug in patients with diabetes are now being investigated in long-term clinical trials. The multicentre Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And EnalaprIL (DETAIL) study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of the renal and antihypertensive effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan and the ACE inhibitor enalapril in 272 patients with type II diabetes. The primary outcome is change in glomerular filtration rate over the 5 years of the study.",

    "817": "A multicenter, randomised, double-blind parallel group study was performed in Finland, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Three-hundred-and-ninety-five men and women in the age range 20-80 years with primary hypertension were randomised to an 8-week double-blind treatment period with either candesartan cilexetil 8-16 mg or enalapril 10-20 mg once daily, with forced dose titration after 4 weeks. Non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure was measured for 36 h at baseline and after 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean diastolic and systolic ambulatory blood pressure 22-24 h post-dose.", 
    "818": "There was a significant difference in the adjusted mean difference for the change from baseline to week 8 between candesartan cilexetil and enalapril 22-24 h post-dose by -3.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval, CI: -6.8 to -0.3 mmHg; p < 0.032) in ambulatory systolic blood pressure and -3.0 mmHg (95% CI: -5.1 to -0.8 mmHg; p < 0.008) in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. There was a significant difference in adjusted mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure 24-36 h post-dose by -4.2 mmHg (95% CI: -6.8 to -1.6 mmHg; p < 0.002)/-3.5 mmHg (95% CI: -5.1 to -1.8 mmHg; p < 0.001). Both drugs were generally well tolerated.", 
    "819": "The results of the present study suggest that advantages may be attributed to the use of candesartan cilexetil, as compared to enalapril in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. In comparison with enalapril 20 mg, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg more effectively lowered blood pressure at trough and in particular on the day following the day after the last dose.", 
    "820": "Pathologic remodeling of the extracellular matrix is a critical mechanism in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to alter vascular wall remodeling in other conditions, their effects on AAAs are unknown. In this study we assessed the effect of ACE inhibitors in a rodent model of aneurysm development.", 
    "821": "Male Wistar rats underwent transient aortic perfusion with porcine pancreatic elastase, followed by treatment with one of three ACE inhibitors (captopril [CP], lisinopril [LP], or enalapril [EP]), an angiotensin (AT)1 receptor antagonist (losartan [LOS]), or water alone (9 rats in each group). Blood pressure and aortic diameter (AD) were measured before elastase perfusion and on day 14, with an AAA defined as an increase in AD (DeltaAD) of more than 100%. The structural features of the aortic wall were examined by means of light microscopy.", 
    "822": "Aneurysmal dilatation consistently developed within 14 days of elastase perfusion in untreated rats, coinciding with the development of a transmural inflammatory response and destruction of the elastic media (mean DeltaAD, 223% +/- 28%). All three ACE inhibitors prevented AAA development (mean DeltaAD: CP, 67% +/- 4%; LP, 18% +/- 12%; and EP, 14% +/- 3%; each P <.05 vs controls). ACE inhibitors also attenuated the degradation of medial elastin without diminishing the inflammatory response. Surprisingly, the aneurysm-suppressing effects of ACE inhibitors were dissociated from their effects on systemic hemodynamics, and LOS had no significant effect on aneurysm development compared with untreated controls (mean DeltaAD, 186% +/- 19%).", 
    "823": "Treatment with ACE inhibitors suppresses the development of elastase-induced AAAs in the rat. Although this is associated with the preservation of medial elastin, the mechanisms underlying these effects appear to be distinct from hemodynamic alterations alone or events mediated solely by AT1 receptors. Further studies are needed to elucidate how ACE inhibitors influence aortic wall matrix remodeling during aneurysmal degeneration.", 
    "824": "Extensive animal studies and a growing number of human clinical trials have now definitively demonstrated the central role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the expression and modulation of cardiovascular disease. In contrast to the original hypothesis, the benefits of angiotensin antagonism do not emanate from the antihypertensive effect alone. Subsequent extensive investigations of angiotensin blockade suggest that the benefits of this approach may also result from the pharmacologic alteration of endothelial cell function and the ensuing changes in the biology of the vasculature. The more recent availability of direct antagonists of the AT(1) angiotensin receptor has introduced an element of doubt into this realm of clinical decision making. The receptor antagonists and the more widely studied converting-enzyme inhibitors share many endpoint attributes. Nevertheless, the partially overlapping mechanisms of action for the two classes of angiotensin antagonists confer distinct pharmacologic properties, including side effect profiles, mechanisms of action, and theoretic salutary effects upon the expression of cardiovascular disease. The current review will attempt to contrast the biology of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition with angiotensin II receptor antagonism. A discussion of the differential effects of these drug classes on endothelial cell function and on the modulation of vascular disease will be utilized to provide a theoretic framework for clinical decision making and therapeutics.",

The arterial pH on admission was 7.3 +/- 0.1 and the plasma bicarbonate was 18 +/- 5 mmol/L. The main causes for acute renal failure were dehydration (n = 12) and worsening heart failure (n = 9). The mean daily dose of spironolactone was 57 +/- 32 mg and 12 patients were concomitantly treated with other drugs that may cause hyperkalemia. Two patients died, and 2 patients were resuscitated but survived. Hemodialysis was necessary in 17 patients; 12 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. The mean duration of hospitalization was 12 +/- 6 days. Two patients needed to be started on maintenance hemodialysis therapy.",

Patients treated with ACE inhibitors were more likely to have a prior diagnosis of heart failure and less likely to have undergone revascularization, whereas those treated with beta blockers were more often treated with thrombolytic therapy and aspirin. Patients treated with ACE inhibitors [hazard ratio (HR = 0.80), 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73 to 0.87] or beta blockers (HR = 0.76, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.90) had lower adjusted 1-year mortality than those who were not treated with either medication. The combination of both medications was associated with additional benefit (HR = 0.68, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.80). The relative benefit of each medication was greatest among patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, a serum creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL or greater, or both.

Both higher levels of TGFbeta1 (undetectable vs 298 +/- 43 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and lower levels of CA125 in dialysate effluent (0.94 +/- 0.5 U/L vs 0.11 +/- 0.1 U/L, p > 0.05) were determined in the Dx group.", 
    "854": "These findings show that peritoneal morphology and function tests were dramatically deranged in the Dx group. The same properties were partially preserved in the ENA group. The production of TGFbeta1 was significantly reduced but peritoneal thickness was not completely inhibited. In conclusion, by inhibiting the production of TGFbeta1, enalapril can preserve peritoneal histology, peritoneal function, and remodeling of mesothelial cells.", 
    "855": "The limitations of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the role of angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy are discussed. Although ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, two important class-related adverse effects are cough, which is common, and angioedema, which is rare but serious. Cough and angioedema appear to be less frequent with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. ARBs seem to be as capable as ACE inhibitors of producing renal dysfunction. ARBs may offer more complete inhibition of angiotensin II than ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of action is based on selective binding to angiotensin type 1 receptors. Many clinical studies have shown that ARBs lower blood pressure as effectively as other antihypertensive agents, including ACE inhibitors. ARBs do not appear to have a greater clinical effect than ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. Some studies of combination ARB and ACE inhibitor therapy for heart failure indicate advantages of the combination over therapy with either class. ARBs may exert renal protective effects in diabetic nephropathy. ARBs offer an alternative to ACE inhibitors in the management of hypertension, especially for ACE-inhibitor-intolerant patients. ACE inhibitors remain the drugs of choice for patients with heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after MI, and diabetic nephropathy; ARBs offer these patients an alternative when ACE inhibitor therapy is not tolerated.", 
    "856": "To examine whether the progression of early diabetic renal disease to end-stage renal failure may be slowed by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for reasons other than their antihypertensive properties, so that they have value in the treatment of normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria.",

    "860": "Albumin excretion rate fell for patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 12 of the 13 studies but did so for only two of the 13 groups on placebo. Treatment provided a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate in both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Treatment with either captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with control patients. A significantly greater lowering of blood pressure was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group. Average glycosylated haemoglobin fell a little in the treated patients and rose in the controls, the difference being just significant. The difference in changes in glomerular filtration rate did not reach statistical significance.", 
    "861": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can arrest or reduce the albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric normotensive diabetics, as well as reduce or prevent an increase in blood pressure. But, given the drop in blood pressure in patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, it is not certain that the reduction of albumin excretion rate is due to a separate renal effect. A direct link with postponement of end-stage renal failure has not been demonstrated. There appear to be no substantial side effects.", 
    "862": "Underlying causes and precipitating causes of congestive heart failure (CHF) should be treated when possible. Older persons with CHF and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction should have maintenance of sinus rhythm, treatment of hypertension and myocardial ischemia, slowing of the ventricular rate below 90 beats/minute, and reduction of salt overload. First-line drug treatment in the management of these persons is the use of loop diuretics combined with beta blockers as tolerated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be administered if CHF persists despite diuretics and beta blockers. If persons are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors because of cough, rash, or altered taste sensation, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists should be given. If CHF persists despite diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors or the person is unable to tolerate beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be administered. Calcium channel blockers should be used if CHF persists despite administration of diuretics and the person is unable to tolerate beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, and isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine. Digoxin, beta blockers, verapamil, and diltiazem may be used to slow a rapid ventricular rate in persons with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Digoxin should not be used in persons with CHF in sinus rhythm with normal LV ejection fraction.", 
    "863": "Long-term renin-angiotensin system blockade is beneficial in a variety of renal diseases. This study examines the long-term (34 weeks) effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor type I blocker L158,809 in the Fisher to Lewis rat model of chronic renal transplant failure. Treatment in allografted rats with lisinopril or L158,809 was initiated 10 days after transplantation, or at the time when proteinuria exceeded 50 mg/24 h. Untreated allografts and syngrafts served as controls. In contrast to syngrafts, untreated allografts developed proteinuria, hypercholesterolaemia, interstitial damage, and glomerulosclerosis. Lisinopril or L158,809 treatment in allografts starting at day 10 after transplantation completely prevented this, with the exception of interstitial damage, but this treatment also caused a reduction in blood pressure and renal function. Moreover, the intimal surface area of the renal arteries was dramatically increased in allografts treated with either lisinopril or L158,809 compared with untreated allografted rats. Treatment once proteinuria had developed was less effective in preventing glomerulosclerosis, but also caused less intimal expansion. Thus, chronic renin-angiotensin system blockade preserves glomerular morphology in the absence of proteinuria, but enhances intimal hyperplasia and reduces renal function in experimental transplantation. In view of these results, it should be questioned whether such treatment benefits renal transplant patients in the long term.", 
    "864": "Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have an increased risk for sudden death. This increased risk has been associated with increased QT dispersion (QTd), a reflection of the heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to decrease heart size as well as decreasing morbidity and mortality in moderate-to-severe CHF. The aim of this study was to determine if ACE therapy is associated with a decrease in QTd, a marker for increased electrical instability. Ninety-seven patients were evaluated. The normalized QTd after 2 months of ACE therapy decreased from 16 +/- 4 to 12 +/- 3, a 25% reduction in dispersions. QTd also decreased from 61 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 12 (P < .001) and QTc dispersions decreased from 71 +/- 18 to 52 +/- 14 (P < .001). After 2 months of ACE inhibitor therapy, heart rate slowed significantly (RR intervals 765 +/- 198 before and 838 +/- 186 after ACE). There was a negative correlation between ejection fraction and QTd (r = -0.8; P < .001). The study also found no correlation between ACE level, percent converting enzyme inhibition, and QTd. The effects of ACE therapy appear early on in terms of repolarization changes. The reduction in QTd may explain the reduced sudden death mortality in patients with heart failure who are treated with ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "865": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and clinical effects of fosinopril in patients with heart failure. This was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients 18 to 80 years of age who were receiving diuretics with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 90 mm Hg, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > or = 18 mm Hg, and a cardiac index (CI) < or = 2.6 L/min/m(2) were eligible. A total of 179 patients were randomized to a single, double-blind oral dose of placebo or fosinopril at 1, 20, or 40 mg, and hemodynamic monitoring was performed for 24 hours postdose; 155 patients with SBP > or = 90 mm Hg were re-randomized to 10 weeks of double-blind fosinopril at 1, 20, or 40 mg once daily. Hemodynamic monitoring was repeated at the last visit, beginning at 24 hours postdose (trough) and continuing for 12 hours thereafter. Significant decreases in preload (PCWP) and afterload (mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] and systemic vascular resistance [SVR]) were evident 3 to 4 hours after a single dose of fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg and continuing for up to 8 to 12 hours postdose for PCWP and SVR and for up to 24 hours postdose for MABP (P < or = .05 v placebo and baseline). Sustained decreases in PCWP, MABP, SVR, and heart rate and increases in CI and stroke volume index were observed after 10 weeks of treatment with fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg once daily (P < or = .05 v 1 mg group for PCWP and MABP at most time points and P < or = .05 v baseline for other parameters at most time points). Dose-related trends toward reduced supplemental diuretic use (P = .027) and reduced symptoms of dyspnea (P = .008) were observed with the 20-mg and 40-mg fosinopril dose groups. Once daily administration of fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg was safe and well tolerated, provided a sustained beneficial hemodynamic effect, improved left ventricular performance, and reduced symptoms of dyspnea, resulting in a reduced need for supplemental diuretic therapy.",

Laboratory parameters, 24-h urinary protein excretion, and mean 24-h arterial blood pressure (MAP) were checked after 3 weeks treatment with enalapril, after a wash-out period of 2 weeks, and before and after a 3-week treatment course with losartan.", 
    "868": "Both drugs slightly reduced MAP (losartan from 97+/-6 to 94+/-9 and enalapril to 93+/-8 mmHg). Serum potassium levels significantly increased during enalapril therapy (from 4.3+/-0.5 to 4.8+/-0.4 mmol/l, P<0.05), as did, although not significantly, uric acid concentrations (from 7.8+/-1.9 to 8.2+/-1.8 mg/dl, P=0.5). Losartan, on the contrary, only mildly affected serum potassium (4.3+/-0.5 vs 4.5+/-0.5 mmol/l, P=0.25) and serum uric acid decreased (from 7.8+/-2.4 to 7.3+/-1.8 mg/dl, P=0.6). Serum aldosterone and urinary aldosterone excretion were significantly reduced only during ACE inhibitor treatment, which might explain the variable effects on potassium homeostasis.",

    "874": "Methamidophos (Met) is a weak inhibitor of housefly head AChE but at the same time it is highly toxic to the common housefly. The lethality of Met is believed to be due to AChE inhibition. An extensive QSAR study may help in determining the mode of action of Met in vivo and in vitro and provide a rational for its high insecticidal toxicity. Acephate (Ace), like Met, is a poor inhibitor of AChE in vitro and has a comparable to Met insect toxicity in vivo. Contrary to Met, though, Ace has much lower mammalian toxicity. Understanding the structural properties which make insecticides toxic to insects but not to mammals is of great importance, since mammals (including humans) are inadvertently exposed to these compounds. Our results were consistent with the model in which both the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of Met depends on the inhibition of the active center of AChE by the unchanged Met. An optimal susceptibility to hydrolysis is needed for Met and its analogs to have high insecticidal activity since in order to phosphorylate AChE they need to be hydrolyzed and at the same time their stability is of great importance in vivo for accumulating at the site of action. The insecticidal activity of Ace analogs may be due to direct interaction with the active center of the AChE. The mammalian toxicity of Ace analogs may be due to interaction with an 'allosteric' reaction center in the AChE.",

In healthy men, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) infusion attenuates reflex increases in MSNA and reduces LF components of HRV spectral power.

    "879": "Hyperuricemia is associated with the vascular injury of hypertension, and purine oxidation may play a pivotal role in this association, but the pathophysiology is not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that in hypertensive patients, the excess amount of the purine metabolite, hypoxanthine, derived from skeletal muscles, would be oxidized by xanthine oxidase, leading to myogenic hyperuricemia as well as to impaired vascular resistance caused by oxygen radicals.", 
    "880": "We investigated the production of hypoxanthione, the precursor of uric acid and substrate for xanthine oxidase, in hypertensive patients and found that skeletal muscles produced hypoxanthine in excess. We used the semi-ischemic forearm test to examine the release of hypoxanthine (deltaHX), ammonium (deltaAmm) and lactate (deltaLAC) from skeletal muscles in essential hypertensive patients before (UHT: n = 88) and after treatment with antihypertensive agents (THT: n = 37) in comparison to normotensive subjects (NT: n = 14).", 
    "881": "deltaHX, as well as deltaAmm and deltaLAC, were significantly higher in UHT and THT (P< 0.01) than in NT.

Administration of doxazosin (n = 4), bevantolol (n = 5) and alacepil (n = 8) for 1 month significantly suppressed the ratio of percentage changes in deltaHX by -38.4 +/- 55.3%, -51.3 +/- 47.3% and -76.3 +/- 52.2%, respectively (P< 0.05) but losartan (n = 3), atenolol (n = 7) and manidipine (n = 10) did not reduce the ratio of changes; on the contrary, they increased it in deltaHX by +188.2 +/- 331%, +96.2 +/- 192.2% and +42.6 +/- 137.3%, respectively. The elevation of deltaHX after exercise correlated significantly with the serum concentration of uric acid at rest in untreated hypertensive patients (y = 0.194 - 0.255x; R2 = 0.185, n = 30: P < 0.05). The prevalence of reduction of both deltaHX and serum uric acid was significantly higher in the patients treated with alacepril, bevantolol and doxazosin (67%: P < 0.02) than in the patients treated with losartan, atenolol and manidipine (12%).", 
    "882": "It is concluded that the skeletal muscles of hypertensive patients released deltaHX in excess by activation of muscle-type adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase, depending on the degree of hypoxia. The modification of deltaHX by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha1-blockers influenced the level of serum uric acid, suggesting that the skeletal muscles may be an important source of uric acid as well as of the substrate of xanthine oxidase in hypertension."
