In addition, AF itself can lead to atrial structural and/or electrophysiologic remodeling by activating the RAS. This remodeling serves as an arrhythmogenic substrate for AF. Thus, the inhibition of RAS with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers may be a strategy to prevent occurrence and recurrence of AF in certain patients such as those with heart failure and hypertension in associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, it may facilitate the cardioversion of AF. In this review, we overview the effect of RAS blockers on cardioversion success and recurrence of AF.",

Experimentally, vagal stimulation (VS) is protective both during acute myocardial ischemia and in chronic heart failure. In man, VS is used in refractory epilepsy but has never been used in cardiovascular diseases. Thus, there is a strong rationale to investigate the effects of chronic VS in patients with CHF. We assesses the feasibility and safety of chronic VS with CardioFit (BioControl Medical), a VS implantable system delivering pulses synchronous with heart beats to the right cervical vagus nerve in a preliminary pilot study in eight advanced CHF patients with favorable results, and subsequently in a larger multicenter study. Overall, 32 patients have been successfully implanted (mostly in NYHA Class III; mean age 56 years, ischemic etiology in 69%; prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in 63%; concomitant beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 100%). Preliminary results confirm feasibility of the study, an acceptable side effect profile and promising preliminary efficacy data. Several mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial effect observed in patients with heart failure. Should these results be confirmed in larger controlled studies, chronic vagal stimulation could be a further treatment option for CHF patients, possibly integrated with defibrillator and resynchronization therapies.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 4 per group) had either sham operation or UUO alone, with A&A (combined aqueous and ethanol extract equivalent to 2.1 g dried herbs), with Enalapril (in drinking water at 200 mg/mL) or with both treatments. Kidney and liver were collected for protein extraction or fixed for histologic stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microscopy. Enalapril or A&A individually were antifibrotic. Transforming growth factor-beta1, fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, macrophage accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis were all decreased. The combination of the two drugs was significantly more effective than Enalapril alone in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha, collagen accumulation, activation of fibroblasts, and tubular cell apoptosis. In conclusion, Enalapril with A&A significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with Enalapril alone.

However, it is unknown whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar effects on the long-term outcomes in HF patients encountered in routine clinical practice. The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology enrolled HF patients hospitalized with worsening symptoms and they were followed during an average of 2.2 years. The outcome data were compared in patients with LVSD by echocardiography (ejection fraction, EF <40%) according to the predischarge use of ACE inhibitors (n=356) or ARBs (n=372). The clinical characteristics were similar between patients with ACE inhibitor and ARB use, except for higher prevalence of hypertensive etiology and diabetes mellitus. There was no significant difference between ACE inhibitor and ARB use in all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.958, 95% confidence interval 0.601-1.527, P=0.858) and rehospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.964, 95% confidence interval 0.683-1.362, P=0.836). The effects of ACE inhibitor and ARB use on the outcomes were generally consistent across all clinically relevant subgroups examined, including age, sex, etiology, EF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and beta-blocker use. Discharge use of ARBs provided comparable effects with ACE inhibitors on outcomes in patients hospitalized for HF. These findings provide further support for guideline recommendations that ARBs can be used in patients with HF and LVSD as an alternative of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "21": "The protective effect exerted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in cardiovascular diseases caused by endothelial injury and aging has been attributed to the restoration of endothelial cell functions. Recently, we demonstrated a central role of the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)/FGF receptor-1 system in mediating the acquisition of an angiogenic phenotype in coronary microvascular endothelium exposed to ACEI. Here, we report on the rescuing effect of ACEI on impaired endothelium and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that lead endothelial cells to enter apoptosis and to senesce. Conditions mimicking pathological cell damage (serum deprivation) lead to endothelial apoptosis as evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity. ACEI enhanced cell survival through activation of prosurvival and antiaging signals involving Akt phosphorylation, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activation, FGF-2 and telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) up-regulation, and delayed senescence. In microvascular endothelial cells exposed to ACEI, Akt/eNOS pathway-dependent FGF-2 was necessary for gene transcription of TERT. These protective effects were particularly evident for sulfhydryl-containing ACEI (zofenoprilat), which were reported to exhibit potent antioxidant effects. In conclusion, ACEI with antioxidant properties up-regulate eNOS, FGF-2, and TERT mRNA, which favor endothelial cell survival and prolong their lifespan, thus restoring endothelial cell functions after vascular damage. These effects could explain the beneficial effects of these drugs in various cardiovascular diseases associated with endothelial injury and aging.",

Plasma renin activity (PRA) is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, even for patients receiving ACEIs and ARBs.

One hundred ninety-six (126 male, 69+/-10 years) chronic heart failure patients were studied prospectively for 12 months regarding survival. Serum concentrations of CITP were measured at study entry. Chronic heart failure patients were divided into groups according to whether (n=114) or not (n=82) they received ACE-inhibitor as well as to their CITP levels.

ACE-inhibitor related improvement in mortality was most predominant in chronic heart failure patients with high CITP levels.

Systemic or local aldosterone has emerged as a multifunctional hormone exhibiting profibrotic and proinflammatory actions that extend beyond the classical hemodynamic effect. The incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers has led to experimental and clinical efforts using aldosterone inhibition.

Incomplete inhibition of the RAAS has been postulated as one of the reasons for unsatisfactory therapeutic responses to RAAS inhibition in some patients. Inhibition of renin, a rate-limiting step in the RAAS activation cascade, is the logical approach to overcome at least some of the above-mentioned problems associated with the treatment with traditional RAAS inhibitors.

In present study, we examined whether combination therapy with SMP-534 and the antihypertensive agent, lisinopril is more effective than single therapy with SMP-534 or lisinopril on five-sixths nephrectomized (5/6Nx) rat model. Combination therapy with SMP-534 (50 mg/kg) and lisinopril (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased urinary albumin excretion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine and increased creatinine clearance in 5/6Nx rats. On the other hands, single treatment with SMP-534 or lisinopril did not improve renal function at this dose. In addition, combination therapy with SMP-534 and lisinopril significantly decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in renal glomeruli and tubulointerstitial injury.

    "54": "A significant progress in the treatment of heart failure occurred during the last 20 years. These advances were associated with the introduction and subsequent widespread use of angiotensin- -converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, but also with progress in device therapy and cardiac surgery. Overall, prognosis in patients with severe heart failure is similar to outcomes reported in multicenter randomized clinical trials, such as CONSENSUS, CIBIS II, MERIT-HF, and COPERNICUS. In 2003-2007, a registry of patients with severe heart failure was established in Poland (POLKARD-HF) that included all patients initially considered candidates for heart transplantation (HTX). Mean duration of follow-up was 601 days (range 1-1462 days). One-year mortality (defined as death or super-urgent HTX) was 20% and differed from data presented by Stewart (2001). In addition, patient survival in the POLKARD-HF registry depending on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class changed significantly in comparison to outcomes reported in the late 1980s. However, one-year mortality among NYHA class IV patients is still high and exceeds 50%. As reported in the POLKARD-HF registry, one- -year risk of death among patient who underwent elective HTX was about 20%, and 3-year risk was about 22%, significantly different from the risk of death among medically treated patients with heart failure. These results are similar to other European data and warrant reconsideration of appropriatness of HTX in elective patients (UNOS 2 status). Undoubtedly, NYHA class IV patients are candidates for HTX and should remain under specialist care in cardiac transplantation centers, and HTX should be performed in this group when indications for this procedure become urgent (UNOS 1 and 1a status). A specialized system of care for patients with severe heart failure should be created in Poland, particularly for patients referred for HTX. There is also an urgent need to introduce modern systems of mechanical cardiac support (left ventricular assist devices, LVAD) that would allow precise determination of indications and contraindications to HTX and create opportunities for long-term treatment.",

It is of interest to assess the treatment efficacy simultaneously with respect to both the recurrent events and the terminal event in many applications. In this paper we propose joint covariate-adjusted score test statistics based on joint models of recurrent events and a terminal event. No assumptions on the functional form of the covariates are needed. Simulation results show that the proposed tests can improve the efficiency over tests based on covariate unadjusted model. The proposed tests are applied to the SOLVD data for illustration.",

In particular, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 is a major enzyme involved in the reconstruction of the arterial intima through activation of other MMPs. We analyzed MMP-3 genotypes in hypertensive and normotensive adolescents and sought to determine if a particular genotype is a predictor of cardiovascular complications.",

Serum aldosterone, renin, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), insulin, homocysteine, vitamin B(12), folate, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 were measured. MMP-3 genotypes were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer. The carotid intima media thickness (IMT), diameter, and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were evaluated using ultrasound.",

Serum MMP-9 was higher in the 5A/6A group than in the control group. Aldosterone, insulin, and homocysteine were higher in the 6A/6A group than in the control group, and vitamin B(12) and folate were lower in the 6A/6A group than in the control group.",

    "68": "Angiotensin II is a potent growth factor involved in arterial wall homeostasis. In resistance arteries, chronic increases in blood flow induce a rise in diameter associated with arterial wall hypertrophy. Nevertheless, the role of angiotensin II in this remodeling is unknown. We investigated the effect of blocking angiotensin II production or receptor activation on flow-induced remodeling of mesenteric resistance arteries. Arteries were ligated in vivo to generate high-flow arteries compared with normal flow (control) vessels located at a distance. Arteries were isolated after 1 week for in vitro analysis. Arterial diameter, media surface, endothelial NO synthase expression, superoxide production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation were higher in high-flow than in control arteries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (perindopril) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (candesartan) prevented arterial wall hypertrophy without affecting diameter enlargement. The nonselective vasodilator hydralazine had no effect on remodeling. Although perindopril and candesartan increased endothelial NO synthase expression in high-flow arteries, hypertrophy remained in rats treated with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and mice lacking endothelial NO synthase. Perindopril and candesartan reduced oxidative stress in high-flow arteries, but superoxide scavenging did not prevent hypertrophy. Both Tempol and the absence of endothelial NO synthase prevented the rise in diameter in high-flow vessels. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation in high-flow arteries was prevented by perindopril and candesartan and not by hydralazine. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibition in vivo (U0126) prevented hypertrophy in high-flow arteries. Thus, a chronic rise in blood flow in resistance arteries induces a diameter enlargement involving NO and superoxide, whereas hypertrophy was associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation by angiotensin II.", 
    "69": "Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves Ang II to form Ang-(1-7). Here we examined whether soluble human recombinant ACE2 (rACE2) can efficiently lower Ang II and increase Ang-(1-7) and whether rACE2 can prevent hypertension caused by Ang II infusion as a result of systemic versus local mechanisms of ACE2 activity amplification. rACE2 was infused via osmotic minipumps for 3 days in conscious mice or acutely in anesthetized mice. rACE2 caused a dose-dependent increase in serum ACE2 activity but had no effect on kidney or cardiac ACE2 activity. After Ang II infusion (40 pmol/min), rACE2 (1 mg/kg per day) resulted in normalization of systolic blood pressure and plasma Ang II. In acute studies, rACE2 (1 mg/kg) prevented the rapid hypertensive effect of Ang II (0.2 mg/kg), and this was associated with both a decrease in Ang II and an increase in Ang-(1-7) in plasma. Moreover, during infusion of Ang II, the effect of rACE2 on blood pressure was unaffected by a specific Ang-(1-7) receptor blocker, A779 (0.2 mg/kg), and infusing supraphysiologic levels of Ang-(1-7) (0.2 mg/kg) had no effect on blood pressure. We conclude that, during Ang II infusion, rACE2 effectively degrades Ang II and, in the process, normalizes blood pressure. The mechanism of rACE2 action results from an increase in systemic, not tissue, ACE2 activity and the lowering of plasma Ang II rather than the attendant increase in Ang-(1-7). Increasing ACE2 activity may provide a new therapeutic target in states of Ang II overactivity by enhancing its degradation, an approach that differs from the current focus on blocking Ang II formation and action.", 
    "70": "The angiotensin (Ang) type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) is highly expressed on renal nuclei and stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not known whether other functional components of the Ang system regulate the nuclear Ang II-AT(1)R ROS pathway. Therefore, we examined the expression of Ang receptors in nuclei isolated from the kidneys of young adult (1.5 years) and older adult (3.0 to 5.0 years) sheep. Binding studies in renal nuclei revealed the AT(2)R as the predominant receptor subtype ( approximately 80%) in young sheep, with the Ang-(1-7) (AT(7)R; Mas protein) and AT(1)R antagonists competing for the remaining sites. Conversely, in older sheep, the AT(1)R accounted for approximately 85% of nuclear sites, whereas the Ang type 2 receptor and AT(7)R subtypes comprise approximately 20% of remaining sites. Ang II increased nuclear ROS to a greater extent in older (97+/-22%; n=6) versus young animals (7+/-2%; P=0.01; n=4), and this was abolished by an AT(1)R antagonist. The AT(7)R antagonist D-Ala(7)-Ang-(1-7) increased ROS formation to Ang II by approximately 2-fold (174+/-5% versus 97+/-22%; P<0.05) in older adults. Immunoblots of renal nuclei revealed protein bands for the AT(7)R and Ang-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which metabolizes Ang II to Ang-(1-7). The ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 also exacerbated the Ang II-dependent formation of ROS (156+/-15%) and abolished the generation of Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. We conclude that an ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-AT(7)R pathway modulates Ang II-dependent ROS formation within the nucleus, providing a unique protective mechanism against oxidative stress and cell damage.",

The most frequently studied antihypertensive agents were calcium channel blockers (7 studies), diuretics (6 studies), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (6 studies).

Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references. Randomized, double-blind, controlled studies that assessed the effects of HF pharmacotherapy on morbidity and mortality outcomes were included. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Clinical Guidelines on Management of Chronic HF and associated studies are discussed.", 
    "83": "A total of 40 clinical studies were included in the present review. The ACC/AHA recommended that evidence-based therapy for HF be used in elderly patients, with individualized consideration of the elderly patient's altered ability to metabolize or tolerate standard medications. HF pharmacotherapies that have been associated with mortality benefits in elderly patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction include ACE inhibitors or ARBs; beta-blockers; aldosterone antagonists; and, in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs or who are black, a combination of hydralazine and nitrates. For symptom control and morbidity benefit, therapies include diuretics and digoxin. For HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), no particular pharmacotherapeutic agent has been found to have mortality benefits. Managing the underlying cause for the HF symptoms is the key approach to treatment of HF-PEF. There was a lack of clinical trials that assessed the effects of HF treatment exclusively in elderly patients. Most clinical trials of HF pharmacotherapy have not specified the number of elderly patients included, or they included 30% to 50% elderly patients. This lack of data in the elderly leads to the necessity of applying clinical judgment to individual patient cases, together with consideration of their altered ability to metabolize or tolerate standard medications. Elderly patients also have variable responses to HF pharmacotherapy and might be susceptible to adverse events, such as orthostatic hypotension, renal dysfunction, electrolyte disturbances, and interactions with medications being received for the treatment of comorbidities. Elderly patients undergoing HF therapy should be closely monitored. The HF-related mortality rate is high in elderly patients. Discussing end-of-life issues and providing palliative care in patients with advanced disease are parts of an optimal care plan.",

Use of these agents in optimal doses is associated with significant improvements in heart failure-associated morbidity and mortality but also may increase serum potassium. Because potassium excretion already is impaired in many heart failure patients because of advanced age, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, the risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia during treatment is significant. This review discusses the mechanisms, incidence, predictors, and management of hyperkalemia in heart failure, emphasizing the importance of careful patient selection for medical treatment and regular surveillance of potassium and creatinine.", 
    "86": "This experiment on rats was aimed to investigate the expression of intermedin (IMD) in hypertrophic cardiac myoctye of renal vascular hypertension induced by incomplete ligation of the left renal artery, and so to detect and compare the changes of the expression after administration of Valsartan, Amlodipine and Enalapril respectively. The criterion for standard modeling was systolic pressure > or = 140 mmHg. At 4 weeks after successful modeling, 60 SD male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, namely the hypertrophy group, the 3 drug-treatment groups, and the sham-operation group as control. Blood pressure, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and the left ventricular mean transverse diameter of myocardial cell (LVTDM) were investigated at the 10th week after model establishment. Gene expression of IMD mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the optical density of the band was measured by use of the Gel Documentation System. The ratio of IMD mRNA to beta-actin mRNA was considered the relative amount of IMD. When compared with control, the blood pressure increased significantly in the hypertrophy group. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups. No significant difference in heart rate was noted at 4 weeks after operation in all groups. LVMI and LVTDM levels were significantly higher in the hypertrophy group than in the other groups; LVMI and LVTDM levels showed no significant difference among the treatment groups but they were obviously higher than those of the Sham-operation group. The gene expression of IMD mRNA in the hypertrophy group was upregulated in the myocardium, when compared with that in the other groups. Meanwhile, although IMD mRNA in the treament groups was higher than that in the Sham-operation group, no statistically significant difference of myocardial IMD mRNA was found between the treament groups. These results suggested that, in this experiment, intracardiac IMD mRNA was upregulated and could participate in the regulation of cardiac remodeling in renal vascular hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This upregulation could improve the pathologic and physiologic process of cardiac hypertrophy, and could associate with the pressure loading or myocardia hypertrophy. However, the change did not display any difference that could be attributed to the variety of hypotensive drugs.",

In the collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra of the [M + H](+) ions, the abundance of the fragment ion of m/z 246 for lisinopril was about two times higher than the ion of m/z 245; however, the former fragment ion was noted to be a little lower than the latter for RSS isomer at all collision energies. In the CID mass spectra of the [M + Li](+) ion, the abundance of the rearrangement ion of m/z 315 for the RSS isomer was about three times higher than that for lisinopril. Furthermore, the difference was supported by the results of energy-resolved mass spectrometry (ERMS) in the test range of collision energies. Similar differences were also observed between the CID mass spectra of lisinopril and RSS isomer methylester, which indicated that the RSS isomer could be rapidly characterized by the CID mass spectra of both the protonated and lithium adduct ion. Elemental compositions of all the ions were confirmed by Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance ESI mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-ESI/MS). In addition, theoretical computations were carried out to support the experimental results.",

Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) receptors in the kidney results in the release of plasma renin, the conversion of peptide precursors to angiotensin II (a2), and ultimately the production of aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antagonists all act by inhibiting the activity of critical protein of this core pathway: the beta(1) receptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase.

Such studies will continue to define the role of renin-angiotensin pharmacogenetics in patients with heart failure due to underlying cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "96": "Current therapeutic guidelines for chronic heart failure (HF) recommend high (if possible, maximum) target doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. This is based on \"evidence\" from large-scale trials in selected patient populations. In \"real life\", however, many patients receive doses below defined targets, which is usually classified as \"under-treatment\". When considering whether everyday practice is suboptimal, an important question arises: is more always better and should dosage recommendations be followed in all patients? The superiority of high vs. low-to-moderate doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in reducing mortality from chronic HF has not been documented convincingly. In large trials with beta-blockers, the efficacy of below-target doses was not significantly different from that of high doses. With high-dose lisinopril, a reduction in the rate of hospitalizations was achieved at the cost of more adverse events. A combination of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in chronic HF may also cause more problems than benefits. The risks of high doses of spironolactone, digoxin and diuretics are well-known. Sicker elderly and multimorbid patients often do not tolerate the recommended targets but can still have a good clinical response with an improved outcome at lower doses. Therefore lower-than-target doses may not necessarily be wrong in certain patients and are better than \"no doses\", for example, failure to prescribe essential heart-failure drugs. Individualized doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers (best in combination) are indicated in most patients with chronic HF. Less rigid application of guideline recommendations may improve their acceptance.",

Much evidence also points to a link between the renin-angiotensin system, hypertension and dementia. Accordingly, the potential use of anti-inflammatory and antihypertensives might be beneficial agents in AD therapy. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms of Celecoxib (cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor), Perindopril (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) and their combination in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of AD. Mice were injected with LPS (0.8 mg/ kg, i.p.) once then divided into three groups: the first was treated with Celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.), the second with Perindopril (0.5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and the last group with a combination of both drugs. Learning and memory function were tested using a Y-maze and locomotor activity was assessed using an open-field test. Cerebral specimens were subjected to histopathological studies. Brain tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 levels were measured. LPS decreased locomotor activity and percentage of correct choices in the Y-maze test. It also produced a significant increase in the percentage area of vascular angiopathy, area of lamellated plaques, and apoptotic index. These were associated with increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Administration of either Celecoxib or Perindopril partially improved cognitive impairment, decreased inflammatory cytokines and amyloid deposition. Combined therapy of both drugs completely prevented LPS induced neurodegenerative and cognitive changes. In conclusion, these findings establish a link between COX-2, ACE activity and cognitive impairment in AD and provided a promising strategy for the complete cure of AD.", 
    "98": "Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease where atheromatous plaque is the basic lesion. A number of studies have shown that atherosclerotic lesions progress over time, when risk factors such as arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia are present. Many clinical trials have been conducted in the last decade, both with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. These trials demonstrated that progression of atherosclerosis can be halted and even regression can be achieved. In studies with lipid-lowering drugs, the best results were achieved with a dramatic decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, obtained with statins, particularly when combined with a concomitant increase in HDL cholesterol. The treatment of hypertension provided better results on the endpoint atheromatous plaque with antihypertensive drugs belonging to the class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or calcium antagonists. Some studies were conducted both with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and a better control of lesion progression, together with its partial regression, was obtained. The best approach seems to be achieved with the combination of a specific intervention on lipid profile together with a targeted control of blood pressure.",

Thus, effective RAS inhibition has been a major achievement to improve the treatment of patients at risk for CVDs, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Three substance classes that block RAS-activation are currently available, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (ARB) and renin inhibitors. Although the overall goal of these drugs remains the blockade of RAS activation, their individual targets in this system vary and may substantially influence the clinical benefit derived from the long term use of these substances. Here, we summarize the evidence available for the use of ARBs in different cardiovascular pathologies and the impact of this evidence on current treatment guidelines for patients at risk for CVD. Today, ARBs represent a good alternative in case of ACE-inhibitor intolerance due to their outstanding tolerability. ARBs in comparison to ACE-inhibitors have been proven to exert similar effective in the treatment of systolic heart failure, primary prevention of stroke, new onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 and DM type 2 dependent macroalbuminuria. ARBs should be considered as alternatives to ACE-inhibitors in subjects post-myocardial infarction. Overall however, there is no profound proof for a specific cardiovascular protection by blockade of the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor that exceeds the impact of ACE-inhibition or synergises with ACE-blockade. In fact, combination of ARBs and ACE-inhibitor result in an increased rate of adverse effects and, therefore, this combination should not be encouraged. To summarize, the initial hope for a more specific impact on cardiovascular diseases by inhibition of the AT1-receptor in comparison to ACE-inhibition has not come true. However, ARBs have been proven to be equally effective as ACE-blockade in a large variety of clinical settings.",

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease of the airways associated with increased prevalence worldwide and with increasing mortality. It is commonly associated with cardiovascular comorbid conditions and this association may impact reciprocally on disease morbidity and mortality. Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are known for their effects on cardiovascular mortality reduction, and several studies have demonstrated their effects on mortality in COPD patients (particularly for statins). e study by Mortensen et al. was a large, retrospective analysis on the impact of statins and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prehospitalization on 90-day mortality in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations. It demonstrated the significant effects on mortality rate reduction of these two classes of compounds, highlighting their effects on mortality in several subsets of COPD patients with high-risk cardiovascular comorbid conditions.",

    "106": "Many of the quality measures for patients with heart failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) require the completion of comprehensive discharge instructions, including instructions about medications to be taken after discharge. To improve compliance in a tertiary care teaching hospital with these evidence-based quality measures, a clinical-decision-support system (CDSS) that uses an electronic checklist was developed. The CDSS prompts clinicians at every training level to consistently create comprehensive discharge instructions addressing quality measures. The authors compared compliance during the 15-month preintervention and postintervention periods. Compliance with discharge measures for AMI (i.e., aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI], or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] use) and for HF (i.e., discharge instructions, left ventricular systolic function [LVSF] evaluation, and ACEI/ARB use) was assessed. The delivery of discharge instructions showed significant improvement from the preintervention period to the postintervention period (37.2% to 93.0%; P < .001). Compliance with prescription of ACEI or ARB also improved significantly for HF (80.7% to 96.4%; P < .001) and AMI (88.1% to 100%; P = .014) patients. Compliance with the remaining measures was higher before intervention, and, thus, the modest improvement in the postintervention period was not statistically significant (AMI patients: aspirin, 97.5% to 98.8%; P = .43; and beta-blocker, 97.9% to 98.7%; P = .78; HF patients: LVSF, 99.3% to 99.1%; P = .78). Implementation of a CDSS with computerized electronic prompts improved compliance with selected cardiac-care quality measures. The design of quality-improvement decision-support tools should incorporate educational missions in their message and design.", 
    "107": "Paenibacillus barcinonensis is a soil bacterium bearing a complex set of enzymes for xylan degradation, including several secreted enzymes and Xyn10B, one of the few intracellular xylanases reported to date. The crystal structure of Xyn10B has been determined by x-ray analysis. The enzyme folds into the typical (beta/alpha)(8) barrel of family 10 glycosyl hydrolases (GH10), with additional secondary structure elements within the beta/alpha motifs. One of these loops -L7- located at the beta7 C terminus, was essential for xylanase activity as its partial deletion yielded an inactive enzyme. The loop contains residues His(249)-Glu(250), which shape a pocket opened to solvent in close proximity to the +2 subsite, which has not been described in other GH10 enzymes. This wide cavity at the +2 subsite, where methyl-2,4-pentanediol from the crystallization medium was found, is a noteworthy feature of Xyn10B, as compared with the narrow crevice described for other GH10 xylanases. Docking analysis showed that this open cavity can accommodate glucuronic acid decorations of xylo-oligosaccharides. Co-crystallization experiments with conduramine derivative inhibitors supported the importance of this open cavity at the +2 subsite for Xyn10B activity. Several mutant derivatives of Xyn10B with improved thermal stability were obtained by forced evolution. Among them, mutant xylanases S15L and M93V showed increased half-life, whereas the double mutant S15L/M93V exhibited a further increase in stability, showing a 20-fold higher heat resistance than the wild type xylanase. All the mutations obtained were located on the surface of Xyn10B. Replacement of a Ser by a Leu residue in mutant xylanase S15L can increase hydrophobic packing efficiency and fill a superficial indentation of the protein, giving rise to a more compact structure of the enzyme.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of tissue renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, lipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and cytokine TNF-alpha in the development of ectopic adipogenesis and lipid deposition. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: untreated uninephrectomized (UNX) rats, UNX rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril, and sham-operated rats. All animals were euthanized at 10 mo postoperation. The untreated UNX rats showed increased protein expression of renin, angiotensinogen, PPARgamma, and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) but reduced protein expression of AT1R and TNF-alpha in their remnant kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased reactivity of angiotensinogen and angiotensin I/II in renal tubular cells and adipocytes of the untreated UNX rats. ACEI treatment largely prevented these disorders in association with restored normolipidemia and normalized renal adipogenesis and lipid deposition. These findings support the notion that tissue RAS, PPARgamma, and TNF-alpha collectively play an important role in the renal adipogenesis and lipid metabolism.", 
    "109": "The purpose of this thesis work was to establish an experimental mouse model for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. Uremia was induced by surgical 5/6 nephrectomy in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice and led to development of severe aortic atherosclerosis independently of BP and plasma homocysteine levels. Also, the accelerated atherosclerosis could not be fully explained by changes in total plasma cholesterol. Morphologic and biochemical analyses of aortas suggested that accelerated initiation and expansion rather than a specific uremic lesion composition characterize atherosclerosis in the uremic mice. Increased expression of inflammatory genes in aortas of uremic mice suggests that an augmented inflammatory response in the arterial wall might be an important impetus for accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. A marked downregulation of expression of smooth muscle cell assigned genes indicates that besides intimal atherosclerosis, uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice is characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Oxidative stress could also be important for the development of atherosclerotic lesions in uremia. In the mouse model, uremia led to a marked increase of titers of antibodies against oxidized LDL (OxLDL), and increased circulating levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6. Treatment with enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) almost completely prevented the development of accelerated aortic atherosclerosis in uremic mice. This effect was parallelled by reductions of aortic expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule VCAM-1, and plasma titers of IgM antibodies against OxLDL, and was at least partly independent of BP-lowering. To test the involvement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in development of uremic atherosclerosis, uremic mice were treated with a neutralizing RAGE-antibody. This treatment reduced the aortic plaque area fraction by 59% in parallel with reductions of the plasma levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6, and titers of IgG antibodies against OxLDL. As opposed to rats and CD-1 mice, apoE-/- mice did not have impaired cardiac structure and function (as assessed by echocardiography, histology, gene expression analysis) upon the induction of uremia. Since the uremic apoE -/- mouse is normotensive and did not develop myocardial calcifications, it is possible that these factors may be important for the development of cardiac dysfunction in uremia. In conclusion, the mice studies by Bro et al. showed that uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice, besides accelerated intimal atherosclerosis, was characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Furthermore, the studies suggested that vascular inflammation and systemic oxidative stress may explain some of the proatherogenic effects of uremia in mice. Interestingly, the accelerated atherosclerosis could be prevented by RAS inhibition, or markedly reduced by RAGE blockade, probably through anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The new uremic mouse model has provided a tool to identify molecular responses of the arterial wall to uremia, and may help identify new approaches for treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease in uremia. Also, the data obtained with the mouse model provide a platform for further studies in humans.",

This molecular-dynamics (MD) study uses a resolved structure of the human CES1 (hCES1) to investigate some mechanistic details of temocapril hydrolysis. The ionization constants of temocapril (pK1 and pK3) and temocaprilat (pK1, pK2, and pK3) were determined experimentally and computationally using commercial algorithms. The constants so obtained were in good agreement and revealed that temocapril exists mainly in three ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, and an anion), whereas temocaprilat exists in four major ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, an anion, and a dianion). All these ionic forms were used as ligands in 5-ns MS simulations. While the cationic and zwitterionic forms of temocapril were involved in an ion-pair bond with Glu255 suggestive of an inhibitor behavior, the anionic form remained in a productive interaction with the catalytic center. As for temocaprilat, its cation appeared trapped by Glu255, while its zwitterion and anion made a slow departure from the catalytic site and a partial egress from the protein. Only its dianion was effectively removed from the catalytic site and attracted to the protein surface by Lys residues. A detailed mechanism of product egress emerges from the simulations.",

    "120": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia that now stands at epidemic proportion, with more than 2.3 million people affected in the USA and over 4.5 million people affected in Western Europe. AF is an expression of underlying heart disease and is increasingly associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodeling of the atria, which relates to AF itself, to changes associated with aging and to progression of the underlying heart disease. Traditionally, AF has been addressed only after it has already presented with pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies designed for rhythm or rate control (secondary prevention). Although secondary prevention is the most feasible approach at present, the concept of primary prevention of AF with therapies aimed at preventing the development of substrate and correcting the risk factors for AF has emerged as a strategy, which is likely to produce a larger effect in the general population. Recent experiments provided new insights into AF pathophysiology, which generated background for new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. In this respect, drugs that are not traditionally antiarrhythmic such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown an antiarrhythmic potential in addition to any treatment effect on the underlying disease. These agents are thought to have an advantage of targeting both the occurrence and progression of the substrate for AF, thus, providing primary and secondary prevention of the arrhythmia. Although first experimental and hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses have been encouraging, several larger, properly designed, prospective trials have not confirmed earlier observations. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventative and reverse remodeling role of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.",

This Review focuses on the evidence that suggests that direct renin inhibitors might block the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney more completely than either angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

    "123": "The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) showed that the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan 80 mg was not inferior to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril 10 mg, and the combination no more effective than ramipril alone, in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease or high-risk diabetes. Although therapy targeting angiotensin II is known to decrease left ventricular (LV) mass and volume, the relative influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker, and their combination, on the heart remains unclear in this population. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 287 patients enrolled in ONTARGET, across 8 centers in 6 countries, at randomization and after 2-year treatment (90, 100, and 97 patients in the ramipril, telmisartan, and combination therapy groups, respectively). Baseline patient characteristics showed higher frequencies of coronary artery disease, Asian ethnicity, and use of statins and beta blockers than the main ONTARGET trial. LV mass decreased in all groups (p <0.0001 for each), but there were no significant differences in change in LV mass or volume among groups, except that LV mass index decreased more on combination versus telmisartan (p = 0.04). Key determinants of LV mass decrease were a history of hypertension (p = 0.03), baseline mass (p <0.0001), and decrease in systolic blood pressure (p <0.0001). The best magnetic resonance imaging predictor of composite events was end-systolic volume (p <0.0001). In conclusion, telmisartan and ramipril had similar effects on LV mass and volume, and combination therapy was not more effective, in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. These results are consistent with the major outcome findings of the main ONTARGET study.",

In particular, RAAS activation is one of the major pathways involved in maladaptive cardiac remodeling, a process that results in progressive cardiac dysfunction. Not surprisingly, strategies targeting the RAAS have substantial benefits in HF. These therapies, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists, have emerged as cornerstones of HF therapy, particularly in patients with systolic dysfunction. Their role in HF with preserved ejection fraction, however, is less certain. New information and approaches targeting RAAS activation continue to emerge.

    "133": "Systemic and pulmonary congestion is a central aspect of both acute and chronic heart failure and directly leads to many of the clinical manifestations of these syndromes. Therefore, diuretic therapy to treat congestion plays a fundamental role in heart failure management. However, although diuretics are the most common drugs prescribed for heart failure, there is limited quality evidence to guide their use. Unlike other components of the heart failure armamentarium, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics (with the exception of aldosterone antagonists) have not been shown to decrease heart failure progression or improve mortality. Additionally, some observational data suggest that diuretics may actually be harmful in heart failure, contributing to neurohormonal activation, renal dysfunction, and potentially mortality. Despite these concerns, diuretics remain ubiquitous in heart failure management because of the need to address symptoms of congestion and the lack of alternative strategies. Recently, the development of a variety of potential adjuncts or alternatives to diuretic therapy has suggested the need for an active reappraisal of diuretic therapy for heart failure. The main classes of diuretics are the loop diuretics, potassium-sparing diuretics, and thiazides. Loop diuretics, the mainstay of acute and chronic therapy for heart failure, are \"threshold drugs\"; therefore, an adequate dose to achieve a pharmacodynamic effect (ie, to increase urine output) must be prescribed for effective therapy. The minimum dose to achieve diuresis and manage congestion should be used to minimize adverse effects. For patients refractory to initial dosing of intravenous diuretics, options include dose escalation, use of continuous infusion rather than intermittent boluses, or combination therapy with the addition of a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (eg, metolazone). Management of chronic heart failure often includes patient-directed titration of diuretics based on changes in symptoms or body weight in an attempt to decrease hospitalizations, although the efficacy of this strategy has not been tested in well-designed trials. Aldosterone antagonists, which are used primarily as neurohormonal agents rather than for their diuretic effects, are indicated for patients with systolic failure and moderate to severe symptoms, as long as renal function and serum potassium are stable and monitored closely. All diuretic therapy requires careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. Whether newer modalities for managing congestion (vasopressin antagonists, adenosine A(1) antagonists, and ultrafiltration therapy) will be an improvement over diuretic therapy will be determined by the results of multiple ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "134": "This study investigated the effect of 8 weeks of treatment with ramipril or losartan on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, echocardiographic parameters and lipid profiles in patients after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Patients were randomly assigned to receive up to 10 mg/day ramipril (n = 27) or up to 100 mg/day losartan (n = 26). No significant differences in any of the tested variables were observed between the two treatment groups, either before or after treatment. Within the losartan-treated group a significant decrease in levels of NT-proBNP (211.1 +/- 211.5 versus 94.7 +/- 150.1 pg/ml), total cholesterol (5.7 +/- 1.0 versus 4.6 +/- 1.1 mmol/l), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (3.5 +/- 0.9 versus 2.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/l) was observed after treatment compared with baseline.

    "135": "1. Total body sodium (TBS) is known as major determinant of arterial blood pressure (ABP) when TBS is increased, but little is known about ABP control following a deficit in TBS. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) controls ABP by controlling TBS via the Na-retaining effects of angiotensin (Ang) II and aldosterone, as well as through the vasoconstrictor action of AngII. In the present study, we investigated the role of RAAS elements in ABP control following moderate TBS deficit. 2. Balance studies of 4 days duration were performed in dogs. On Day 1, TBS was reduced by peritoneal dialysis (-3.5 mmol/kg bodyweight). On Days 1 and 2, dogs were on low Na intake (LSI; 0.5 mmol Na/kg bodyweight), whereas on Days 3 and 4 dogs were on high Na intake (HSI; 5.5 mmol Na/kg). In Protocol 1, the RAAS was left intact; in Protocol 2, angiotensin-converting enzyme was inhibited by infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (7 microg/kg per min) on Days 2-4; and in Protocol 3, in addition to ACE inhibition (ACE-I), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) were blocked using 300 mg, p.o., spironolactone twice daily on Days 2-4. 3. During LSI, the TBS deficit could not be replenished and osmoregulation resulted in a deficit in total body water (TBW) of -12 to -15 mL/kg bodyweight. The RAAS was massively stimulated. In dogs with an intact RAAS, ABP did not decrease despite the TBW deficit. This was achieved by the vasoconstrictor action of AngII. At the same TBW deficit, ACE-I significantly lowered ABP by approximately 17 mmHg. In dogs with an intact RAAS, the deficit in TBS and TBW was immediately replenished when enough Na was offered (HSI). Even during ACE-I, the deficit was almost replenished. This was accomplished by AngII-independent stimulation of aldosterone release. Arterial blood pressure increased in parallel with TBW. With additional blockade of MR, the deficit was not replenished and ABP remained reduced. 4. These results indicate that with a moderate deficit in TBS and TBW, the RAAS is the major factor controlling ABP. First, the vasoconstrictive action of AngII fully compensates for the volume deficit. Second, stimulation of both renin release (and, thus, AngII and aldosterone) and aldosterone release independent of AngII is crucial for the restoration of TBS and TBW, thus controlling ABP.",

The probability of redeemed prescriptions for an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist according to the guideline during the first year following diagnosis was 51%. High initial BP was associated with prescription redemption. No other analysed individual or organisational characteristics were found to be associated with treatment initiation.", 
    "141": "The consultation attendance was reasonably high, and treatment initiation with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist according to the guideline was found in half of the cases. High initial BP increased the probability of treatment initiation.", 
    "142": "Statistically significant correlation structure-activity relationships for two groups of oligopeptides (48 dipeptide fragments of analogues of inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and 21 pentapeptide structural analogues of bradykinin) were obtained by the methods of regression analysis. Geometric, hydrophobic, and electron descriptors of the component amino acids were applied to the characteristics of the molecular structure of the peptides. The electron properties (electronegative charge, polarity of the molecules, and ability to form hydrogen bonds) were shown to have the greatest influence on the bioactivity of the studied compounds. A satisfactory fit between the calculated and experimental values of the bioactivity (IgA) of the peptides proved the validity of the four-parametrical equation for the evaluation of the unknown IgA values of oligopeptides on the basis of the physicochemical parameters of the participating amino acids.", 
    "143": "Differential renal expression of a homolog of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), that is, ACE2, has been implicated as a genetic basis of polygenetic hypertension in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat model. However, data on the role of ACE2 in hypertension are still inconclusive. Therefore, we analyzed kidney ACE2 mRNA, ACE2 protein and ACE2 enzyme activities in the adult polygenetic stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) and the monogenetic TGR(mREN2)27 rat models, in comparison with their normotensive reference strains, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Spraque-Dawley (SD) rats, respectively. Kidney ACE2 mRNA was studied using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in cortex and medulla, whereas protein expression was scored semiquantitatively in detail in different renal structures using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, total renal tissue ACE2 activity was measured using a fluorimetric assay that was specified by the ACE2 inhibitor DX600. In SHRSP and homozygous TGR(mREN2)27 rats with established hypertension, kidney ACE2 mRNA, protein and tissue ACE2 activities were not different from their respective WKY and SD reference strain, respectively. In addition, when we looked at renal localization, we found ACE2 protein to be predominantly present in glomeruli and endothelium with weak staining in distal and negative staining in proximal tubuli. Thus, our data challenge previous work that implicates ACE2 as a candidate gene for hypertension in SHRSP by reporting a significant reduction of ACE2 in the kidneys of SHRSP. Taken together, renal ACE2 is not altered in the SHRSP and TGR(mREN2)27 genetic rat models with established hypertension.", 
    "144": "Poor adherence to antihypertensive medication is one of the major problems in the treatment of hypertension. Electronic monitoring is currently considered to be the gold standard for assessing adherence, but it may trigger patients to open the pill bottle without taking medication or to take out more than prescribed. In adjunct to electronic monitoring, pill count could be a valuable tool for exploring adherence patterns, and their effects on blood pressure reduction.", 
    "145": "Among a total of 228 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, adherence to treatment was measured by means of both the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count. Patients were followed-up for seven visits over a period of 1 year. At each visit to the physician's office, patient's adherence was assessed by both methods.", 
    "146": "Adherence is defined as the percentage of days with correct dosing; median adherence according to MEMS was lower than median adherence according to pill count (91.6 vs. 96.1; P < 0.001). Both methods agreed in defining patients as adherent in 107 (47%) and nonadherent in 33 (14%) patients. Thirty-one (14%) patients were adherent only by MEMS and 59 (25%) patients only by pill count. At the end of the study, patients in the four categories reached comparable blood pressure values and reductions.", 
    "147": "Pill count could be a useful adjunct to electronic monitoring in assessing adherence patterns. Although deviant intake behavior occurred frequently, the effect on achieved blood pressure and blood pressure reduction was not remarkable.", 
    "148": "Although antihypertensive therapy reduces cardiovascular events, it is unclear whether there are differences in cardiac remodeling and function between treatments with nifedipine retard and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). It is also not clear how antihypertensive therapy influences cardiac remodeling and function.", 
    "149": "Hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to the nifedipine retard (n = 108) or ACE inhibitors groups (n = 102) and treated for 3 years. The primary endpoints were changes in end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) as indices of cardiac remodeling, whereas the secondary endpoints were changes in ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI) and regional wall motion as indices of cardiac function. Left ventriculography was performed at baseline and after 3 years of treatment. Fifty-eight and 61 patients, respectively, were subjected to the final analysis.", 
    "150": "Comparable changes in remodeling and function were obtained in the nifedipine retard group and the ACE-Is group. Both groups showed a significant reduction of EDVI and ESVI, and a significant increase in EF, SVI, and CI, whereas the decreased regional wall motion significantly improved. In both groups, weak but significant correlations were noted between treatment-induced changes of systolic blood pressure and those of primary and secondary endpoints.", 
    "151": "The above findings show that treatments with nifedipine retard or ACE-Is cause a comparable change in remodeling and cardiac function. Lowering of the blood pressure by either drug leads to reverse remodeling or improvement of cardiac function. In addition to alleviation of coronary artery damage by reducing blood pressure, there is a favorable effect on the left ventricular structure and function. Reducing the blood pressure is critically important for hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "152": "Aldosterone promotes glomerular and tubular sclerosis independent of angiotensin II in animal models of diabetic nephropathy. Most human studies testing the renoprotective benefit of adding an angiotensin receptor blocker or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to a regimen based on inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) used relatively low doses of ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies did not determine whether antiproteinuric effects were independent of BP lowering. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 81 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > or =300 mg/g) who all received lisinopril (80 mg once daily). We randomly assigned the patients to placebo, losartan (100 mg daily), or spironolactone (25 mg daily) for 48 wk. We obtained blood and urine albumin, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, A1c, and ambulatory BP at baseline, 24, and 48 wk. Compared with placebo, the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased by 34.0% (95% CI, -51.0%, -11.2%, P = 0.007) in the group assigned to spironolactone and by 16.8% (95% CI, -37.3%, +10.5%, P = 0.20) in the group assigned to losartan. Clinic and ambulatory BP, creatinine clearance, sodium and protein intake, and glycemic control did not differ between groups. Serum potassium level was significantly higher with the addition of either spironolactone or losartan. In conclusion, the addition of spironolactone, but not losartan, to a regimen including maximal ACE inhibition affords greater renoprotection in diabetic nephropathy despite a similar effect on BP. These results support the need to conduct a long-term, large-scale, renal failure outcomes trial.",

Of 24 patients, 11 (46%) showed de novo proteinuria >0.15 g/d after 12 months, only 2 developed proteinuria > 1 g/d. The total number of proteinuria >1 g/d after 12 months including patients with pre-existing proteinuria >1 g/d (n = 3) was seven of 55 patients (13%). Multivariate regression analysis revealed pre-existing proteinuria > 0.15 g/d and reduced glomerular filtration rate as independent predictors for the development of proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus.", 
    "156": "Reduced glomerular filtration rate and pre-existing proteinuria but not therapy with ACEI/ARB are independent predictors for proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus. Treatment with ACEI/ARB did not reduce pre-existing proteinuria after conversion except in single cases with severe proteinuria.", 
    "157": "In recent decades, the most successful strategy for controlling blood pressure has been inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibitors of chemical synthesis (captopril, enalapril, ramipril and trandolapril) have been widely used clinically to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, and in patients with recent myocardial infarction and heart failure or marked left ventricular dysfunction. In addition to preventive and therapeutic drugs, increased attention has been paid to identifying dietary compounds that may contribute to cardiovascular treatment and prevention. ACE inhibitory peptides, derived from a multitude of plant and animal proteins such as milk, soy or fish, represent sources of health-enhancing components. These ACE inhibitory peptides can be enzymatically released from precursor proteins in vitro and in vivo, respectively during food processing and gastrointestinal digestion. They have shown the ability to lower blood pressure by limiting the vasoconstrictory effects of Angiotensin II and potentiating the vasodilatory effects of Bradykinin. By using specific procedures they may be generated in or incorporated into functional foods for the development of 'natural' beneficial health products. Several products containing peptides with ACE inhibitory properties are currently on the market or in development. This review focuses on the use, application and future perspective of bioactive peptides with properties relevant to cardiovascular health.", 
    "158": "The fusion of therapeutics and diagnostic medicine in an effort to provide individualized pharmacotherapy frequently requires the manipulation of drugs that target different enzymes and receptors. To this end, and as a strategy to increase the efficiency of drug development pipelines, new chemical entities are often developed that interact with more than one target. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), its homologue ACE2, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) are metallopeptidases that are involved in the metabolism of biologically active peptides that impact on the regulation of the cardiovascular system. The benefit of the ACE/NEP; NEP/ECE and ACE/NEP/ECE dual and triple inhibitors is not only their possible increased efficacy with respect to blood pressure control, but also their other activities, such as antiproliferative, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory, mediated by angiotensin II and atrial natriuretic peptide. Over the last few years a number of three-dimensional structures of these metallopeptidases have advanced our understanding of the mode of interaction between various ligands and their target binding sites. This information is invaluable in the rational design of new and improved drugs. Here we review the structural basis for the design of single and multiple metallopeptidase inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, we present recent advances in the development of ACE/ECE-1 inhibitors that are likely to have high potency and improved side effect profiles.", 
    "159": "Proteinuria and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are parameters that can lead to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. All components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activate the TGF-beta. Aldosterone may not be inhibited with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) due to aldosterone escape. We aimed to evaluate the effect of spironolactone on parameters leading to fibrosis.", 
    "160": "This prospective study included 30 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated with ACEIs and/or ARBs. The patients were divided into two groups that are similar in terms of demographic parameters. 25 mg of spironolactone was added to group 1 (n = 15) for six months, though it was not administered to group 2 (n = 15).

    "163": "The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) was a 25,620 patient study program comparing telmisartan with ramipril or the combination thereof in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Ramipril had previously been proven to prevent cardiovascular events in a similar population within the HOPE-trial. However, ramipril and other ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) may have limited tolerability that might restrict their use in patients requiring secondary prevention, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are suggested to be better tolerated. However, no ARB had been compared with the standard treatment, ramipril, in these cardiovascular patients at increased risk. ONTARGET showed that telmisartan was as effective as ramipril in preventing cardiovascular events, but was better tolerated. The combination of ramipril and telmisartan was not superior to either monotherapy. Taken together, ONTARGET demonstrated that telmisartan is as effective as ramipril in a broad cardiovascular increased-risk population in the middle of the cardiovascular continuum. In these patients who are intolerant to ACE-Is or who do not achieve blood pressure control, the ARB with the best evidence for secondary prevention is telmisartan according to the results of the ONTARGET trial.", 
    "164": "Genetic polymorphisms may affect platelets' responses to the antiplatelet therapy. Our aim was to determine the role of genetic polymorphisms on aspirin resistance in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 126 consecutive patients (35-85 years old, 32% women) with chronic stable CHD was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) and collagen and adenosine diphosphate (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time of less than 186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. Factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1), glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms were determined by three consecutive steps: isolation and amplification of DNA and reverse hybridization. We determined that 30 patients (23.8%) had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 74 +/- 12 s (51-104 s). Ten of the 30 patients with aspirin resistance were women (33.3%). Genetic polymorphisms were determined in 30 aspirin-resistant and 17 aspirin-sensitive patients. No statistically significant relationship was determined between aspirin resistance and the genetic panel. In our study we did not determine a significant relationship between the aspirin resistance and factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, PAI-1, glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms.", 
    "165": "Vessels from pregnant animals show a blunted response to adrenergic agonists. In this work, we explored if pregnancy reduces alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR)-mediated vascular smooth muscle protein expression as well as agonist-induced contraction in rat aorta, and if angiotensin II (Ang II) levels during pregnancy are related to these changes. Female Wistar rats were divided randomly into nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant groups (first week: P1, second week: P2, third week: P3). Subsets of animals were treated with captopril (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 7 days; n = 6). Phenylephrine (PHE) concentration-response curves were constructed (1 x 10(-9) to 3.1 x 10(-5) mol/l) and alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR were measured in the aorta by immunoblot. Captopril decreased alpha-AR expression in the NP group. In contrast, pregnancy decreased alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR levels and captopril prevented this reduction. PHE sensitivity was decreased in the thoracic and abdominal aorta in the P2 group, with no changes in E(max ), and E(max) was decreased in the abdominal aorta in all experimental groups. Our results suggest that Ang II levels during pregnancy are related to a decrease in aortic alpha(1)-AR expression. The physiological meaning of this finding remains to be established.", 
    "166": "To examine the functional interaction between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and NADPH oxidase activity, we assessed renal responses to acute intra-arterial infusion of ANG II (0.5 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)) before and during administration of a SOD inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), in enalaprilat-pretreated (33 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) rats (n = 11). Total (RBF) and regional (cortical, CBF; medullary; MBF) renal blood flows were determined by Transonic and laser-Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Renal cortical and medullary tissue NADPH oxidase activity in vitro was determined using the lucigenin-chemiluminescence method. DETC treatment alone resulted in decreases in RBF, CBF, MBF, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow (V), and sodium excretion (U(Na)V) as reported previously. Before DETC, ANG II infusion decreased RBF (-18 +/- 3%), CBF (-16 +/- 3%), MBF [-5 +/- 6%; P = not significant (NS)], GFR (-31 +/- 4%), V (-34 +/- 2%), and U(Na)V (-53 +/- 3%). During DETC infusion, ANG II also caused similar reductions in RBF (-20 +/- 4%), CBF (-19 +/- 3%), MBF (-2 +/- 2; P = NS), and in GFR (-22 +/- 7%), whereas renal excretory responses (V; -12 +/- 2%; U(Na)V; -24 +/- 4%) were significantly attenuated compared with those before DETC. In in vitro experiments, ANG II (100 muM) enhanced NADPH oxidase activity both in cortical [13,194 +/- 1,651 vs. 20,914 +/- 2,769 relative light units (RLU)/mg protein] and in medullary (21,296 +/- 2,244 vs. 30,597 +/- 4,250 RLU/mg protein) tissue. Application of DETC (1 mM) reduced the basal levels and prevented ANG II-induced increases in NADPH oxidase activity in both tissues. These results demonstrate that renal excretory responses to acute ANG II administration are attenuated during SOD inhibition, which seems related to a downregulation of NADPH oxidase in the deficient condition of SOD activity.",

    "187": "ACEIs have been at the forefront of hypertension therapy for several years, especially in hypertensive at-risk patients. However, their use is restricted by burdensome side-effects and their limited ability to reach target blood pressure. Newer ARBs, such as telmisartan, have more sustained blood pressure control throughout the 24-h dosing period compared with ACEIs and other ARBs. For uncomplicated hypertension, ARBs are preferred to ACEIs because of their superior tolerability and adherence. In specific patient populations, namely heart failure patients, ARBs have previously shown equal cardiovascular protection to ACEIs. ONTARGET showed that an ARB, in this case telmisartan, was as effective as ramipril in reducing cardiovascular events in a wide cross-section of at-risk cardiovascular patients, but was better tolerated even though patients were screened for ACEI tolerance.", 
    "188": "Telmisartan is currently the only ARB to have demonstrated equivalence to ramipril in reducing cardiovascular events in a broad patient population. In practical terms, telmisartan is superior to the reference standard ramipril because of more powerful blood pressure lowering and superior tolerability. However, in many countries, guidance to physicians prioritizes ACEIs. In these countries, telmisartan should be the first choice ARB for hypertensive at-risk patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control with an ACEI, or for whom tolerability is a concern.", 
    "189": "Macrovasculature and microvasculature are deeply interrelated, since microvascular structure is not only the site of vascular resistance but probably also the origin of most of the wave reflections generating increased central systolic blood pressure. In fact, preliminary data suggest that some index of large artery stiffness is related with the media to lumen ratio of subcutaneous small resistance arteries of hypertensive patients. Microvascular structural alterations and changes in the mechanical properties of the macrovessels represent potent predictors of prognosis. Hypertension-related damage to the micro- and macrovascular system may be corrected by pharmacological agents. Among them, beta-blocking agents and diuretics have a negligible effect on microvascular structure, while renin-angiotensin system antagonists and calcium entry blockers have favorable actions, improving large artery mechanics and possibly reducing central wave reflections.",

It is not known if current residency curriculum adequately prepares a future internist in this aspect of CKD care. We performed an online questionnaire survey of internal medicine residents in the United States to determine knowledge of CKD complications and their management. Four hundred seventy-nine residents completed the survey with postgraduate year (PGY) distribution 166 PGY1, 187 PGY2, and 126 PGY3. Most of the residents correctly recognized anemia (91%) and bone disease (82%) as complications at estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m; however, only half of the residents identified coronary artery disease (54%) as a CKD complication. For a patient with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m, two thirds of the residents would workup for anemia (62%), whereas half of them would check for mineral and bone disorder (56%). With regard to anemia of CKD, less than half of the residents knew the CKD goal hemoglobin level of 11 to 12 g/dL (44%); most would supplement iron stores (86%), whereas fewer would consider nephrology referral (28%). For mineral and bone disorders, many residents would recommend dietary phosphorus restriction (68%) and check 25-hydroxyvitamin D (62%); fewer residents would start 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (40%) or refer to the nephrologist (45%). Residents chose to discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for medication-related complication of greater than 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (68%) and potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L (93%). Mean performance score improved with increasing PGY (PGY1 59.4% \u00b1 17.6%, PGY2 63.6% \u00b1 15.6%, and PGY3 66.2% \u00b1 16.5%; P = 0.002).

    "192": "Angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics all cause reactive rises in plasma renin concentration, but particularly high levels have been reported with aliskiren. This prompted speculation that blockade of plasma renin activity with aliskiren could be overwhelmed, leading to paradoxical increases in blood pressure. This meta-analysis of data from 4877 patients from 8 randomized, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled trials examined this hypothesis. The analysis focused on the incidence of paradoxical blood pressure increases above predefined thresholds, after > or =4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg of aliskiren, angiotensin receptor blockers (300 mg of irbesartan, 100 mg of losartan, or 320 mg of valsartan), 10 mg of ramipril, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo. There were no significant differences in the frequency of increases in systolic (>10 mm Hg; P=0.30) or diastolic (>5 mm Hg; P=0.65) pressure among those treated with aliskiren (3.9% and 3.1%, respectively), angiotensin receptor blockers (4.0% and 3.7%), ramipril (5.7% and 2.6%), or hydrochlorothiazide (4.4% and 2.7%). Increases in blood pressure were considerably more frequent in the placebo group (12.6% and 11.4%; P<0.001). None of the 536 patients with plasma renin activity data who received 300 mg of aliskiren exhibited an increase in systolic pressure >10 mm Hg that was associated with an increase in plasma renin activity >0.1 ng/mL per hour. In conclusion, the incidence of blood pressure increases with aliskiren was similar to that during treatment with other antihypertensive drugs. Blood pressure rises on aliskiren treatment were not associated with increases in plasma renin activity. This meta-analysis found no evidence that aliskiren uniquely causes paradoxical rises in blood pressure.",

Eight consecutive PCKD patients were given sirolimus (1 mg/d PO) for 6 consecutive months, in addition to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), namely telmisartan. Another 8 PCKD patients served as a control group given only telmisartan. All PCKD patients had a serum creatinine value <2 mg/dL with a negative urine culture before enrollment. All patients were diagnosed by renal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure renal volumes. After a 6-month follow-up, patients were rescanned to remeasure the MRI volumes. Renal function was stable in 5/8 subjects in the sirolimus group, improved in 2 cases, and worsened in 1 with an increase of serum creatinine to >2 mg/dL resulting in his withdrawal after 5 months of follow-up. In contrast, the serum creatinine value was stable in 3 control group subjects, worsen in 3, and improved in 2. Four patients in the sirolimus group experienced infectious complications, namely, urinary tract infections (UTI) in 2 which were treated with antibiotics, and monilial pharyngitis in 2, who were treated and cured with a topical antifungal. In the control group, only 2 developed and were treated for UTIs. Hematologic tests were normal in all patients. There was an insignificant rise in kidney volume as measured by MRI in the sirolimus group (2845 vs 3221 mL after 6 months; P = NS) compared with a significant increase in the control group (2667 vs 3590 mL after 6 months; P < .05).

Recently, we found that Wen-pi-tang-Hab-Wu-ling-san (WHW) extract, which has been used to treat renal diseases in herbal medicine for a long time, plays anti-fibrogenic. Here, we investigated the role of WHW in the kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in mice. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to UUO on day 0 and then administered with either WHW (2, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight) or vehicle orally from 1 day after UUO to finish the experiment. WHW-administration significantly mitigated the UUO-induced kidney fibrotic changes including tubular atrophy and dilatation, collagen accumulation, expansion of interstitial space and leukocyte infiltration. WHW prevented the increases of oxidative stress by the prevention of UUO-induced decreases of catalase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), resulting in reduced production of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WHW reduced transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 stimulated by UUO. In conclusion, WHW prevented kidney fibrosis following UUO by the inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and TGF-beta/Smad2/3 signaling pathway.",

Our goal is to demonstrate a statistical approach to directly obtain appropriate estimates of variance of the main effects in regression models.",

    "208": "Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) used in the treatment of hypertension. In large, randomized trials, eprosartan (with or without hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]) demonstrated superior antihypertensive efficacy to that of placebo and, when administered at comparable dosage regimens, had similar blood pressure-lowering effects to enalapril. Eprosartan was generally well tolerated in clinical trials and had a lower incidence of persistent dry cough than enalapril. Eprosartan has a neutral effect on metabolic parameters, such as serum lipid levels and glucose homeostasis, and a low propensity for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. The use of eprosartan or other ARBs in combination with HCTZ tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretics. Independent of its antihypertensive effects, eprosartan was associated with improved clinical outcomes (primary composite endpoint of all causes of mortality and all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including all recurrent events) compared with nitrendipine in a randomized, secondary prevention trial in hypertensive patients with previous cerebrovascular events (MOSES trial). Eprosartan also reduced blood pressure and was associated with a modest improvement in cognitive function in a large observational study in patients > or =50 years of age with newly diagnosed hypertension (OSCAR study). In both of these trials, additional antihypertensive therapy, such as HCTZ, was permitted. Therefore, eprosartan is a useful treatment option in the management of a broad range of patients with hypertension, and its use with HCTZ provides a rational combination regimen.", 
    "209": "Valsartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin receptor antagonist that selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. The efficacy, tolerability and safety of valsartan have been demonstrated in large-scale studies in hypertension, heart failure (HF) and post-myocardial infarction (MI). This review focuses on what was learned from the valsartan clinical research programme and other comparative trials published from 1997 to the present. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of valsartan in lowering blood pressure (BP) in a variety of patient populations (including elderly, women, children, obese patients, patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD], patients at high risk of cardiovascular [CV] disease, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asians) and in improving outcomes in CV disease and CKD. In hypertension, valsartan exhibits dose-dependent efficacy in reducing both systolic and diastolic BP over the once-daily dose range of 80-320 mg; doses as high as 640 mg/day have been studied and found to be efficacious and safe. BP control can be enhanced with a more consistent 24-hour BP-lowering profile by using single-pill, fixed-dose combination therapy with valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The cardioprotective benefits of valsartan have been demonstrated in large-scale outcome trials and include significant reductions in CV morbidity and mortality in HF, following MI, and in patients with co-morbid hypertension and coronary artery disease and/or HF; reductions in HF hospitalizations; and reductions in the incidence of stroke. The magnitude of these effects is comparable with that demonstrated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, valsartan has a more favourable tolerability profile, with a significantly lower incidence of cough and only rare reports of angio-oedema, both class effects of ACE inhibitor use. Consistent with its angiotensin receptor-blocking effects, valsartan also reduces circulating levels of biochemical markers that are associated with angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction and CV risk (e.g. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or oxidized low-density lipoprotein). Improvements in CKD with valsartan include statistically and clinically meaningful reductions in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients with CKD. In short-term studies, valsartan has improved or stabilized various indices of metabolic function in at-risk patients, including those with co-morbid hypertension, obesity and/or metabolic syndrome. Because of this, valsartan is being prospectively investigated for its ability to reduce the incidence of new-onset diabetes and provide cardioprotection in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Valsartan and valsartan/HCTZ are well tolerated. In clinical trials, adverse events during valsartan treatment were similar to those occurring with placebo. The combination of valsartan/HCTZ was better tolerated than HCTZ alone. Valsartan is administered once daily for hypertension; doses are usually taken upon awakening. In patients with HF or MI, valsartan is administered twice daily.",

This study explored alterations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during the development of hypertension induced by prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, the effects of an inhibitor of the nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) on this process were assessed. Pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=8): a control group, an LPS group, a PDTC group and an LPS+PDTC group. The rats in these groups were intraperitoneally administered vehicle, 0.79 mg kg(-1) LPS, 100 mg kg(-1) PDTC or LPS plus PDTC, respectively. LPS was given on the 8th, 10th and 12th days, whereas PDTC was given from the 8th to the 14th day during gestation. At various ages from day 1 to 25 weeks, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, renal function, glomerular number, mRNA expression levels of renal cortex renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the number of Ang II-positive cells and NF-kappaB activation were determined. The results showed that prenatal exposure to LPS resulted in significantly lower glomerular numbers and creatinine clearance rates and higher urinary protein and renal cortex ACE mRNA expression in adult offspring. Prenatal LPS also decreased the renal cortex renin mRNA expression and the number of Ang II-positive cells in offspring at 1 day of age, but these increased at 7, 16 and 25 weeks, whereas the plasma renin activity and Ang II concentration remained unchanged. Simultaneously, PDTC treatment markedly reversed the action of LPS. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to LPS resulted in alteration of the intrarenal RAS and renal damage in adult offspring rats.",

They restore the balance between the vasoconstrictive salt-retentive and hypertrophy-causing peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) and bradykinin, a vasodilatory and natriuretic peptide. As ACE is a promiscuous enzyme, ACE inhibitors alter the metabolism of a number of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate and promote natriuresis. They have been proven effective in the treatment of hypertension, and reduce mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. They inhibit ischemic events and stabilize plaques. Furthermore, they delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy and act as antioxidants. Ongoing studies have elucidated protective roles for them in both memory-related disorders and cancer. Lastly, N- and C-domain selective ACE inhibitors have led to new uses for ACE inhibitors.",

In the present study we investigated the effects of bilateral lesions of the CeA on the facilitation of water and 0.3 M NaCl intake produced by the blockade of serotonergic mechanisms or activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors with bilateral injections of methysergide or moxonidine, respectively, into the LPBN. Male Holtzman rats (n=5-8) with bilateral sham or electrolytic lesions of the CeA (2 mA; 10 s) and stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally in the LPBN were used. In sham rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg b.w.) combined with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg b.w) subcutaneously, bilateral injections of moxonidine (0.5 nmol) or methysergide (4 microg) into the LPBN increased 0.3 M NaCl intake (29.8+/-5.1 and 19.5+/-3.7 ml/2 h, respectively, versus vehicle: 8.3+/-1.4 ml/2 h) and water intake (17.9+/-3.7 and 23.3+/-2.8 ml/2 h, respectively, versus vehicle: 11.5+/-1.6 ml/2 h). Lesions of the CeA (5-18 days) abolished the increase in 0.3 M NaCl and water intake produced by bilateral injections of moxonidine (10.3+/-2.8 and 6.8+/-2.3 ml/2 h, respectively) and reduced the increase produced by methysergide (13.6+/-2.5 and 14.5+/-3.2 ml/2 h, respectively) into the LPBN. The present results show that the increase in water and 0.3 M NaCl intake produced by serotonergic blockade and alpha(2)-adrenergic activation in the LPBN depends on the integrity of the CeA, suggesting that facilitatory mechanisms present in the CeA are essential for the increase of water and hypertonic NaCl intake produced by the blockade of the inhibitory mechanisms of the LPBN.", 
    "218": "The approach to the pediatric patient with membranous nephropathy (MN) can be challenging to the practitioner. The clinical presentation of the child with this histologic entity usually involves some degree of proteinuria ranging from persistent, subnephrotic-ranged proteinuria to overt nephrotic syndrome. Patients often have accompanying microscopic hematuria and may have azotemia or mild hypertension. Children presenting with nephrotic syndrome are often steroid resistant; as such, their biopsy for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome results in the diagnosis of MN. The practitioner treating MN in the pediatric patient must weigh the risks of immunosuppressive therapy against the benefits. In general, the child with subnephrotic proteinuria and normal renal function can likely be treated conservatively with angiotensin blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Those with nephrotic syndrome are usually treated with steroids initially and often followed by alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil). Calcineurin inhibitors may also be useful, but the relapse rate after their discontinuation remains high. The absence of controlled studies in children with MN makes treatment recommendations difficult, but until they are available, using the patient's clinical presentation and risk of disease progression appears to be the most prudent approach.",

There are no established guidelines on the diagnostic workup or management of nephrotic syndrome. Imaging studies are generally not needed, and blood tests should be used selectively to diagnose specific disorders rather than for a broad or unguided workup. Renal biopsy may be useful in some cases to confirm an underlying disease or to identify idiopathic disease that is more likely to respond to corticosteroids. Treatment of most patients should include fluid and sodium restriction, oral or intravenous diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Some adults with nephrotic syndrome may benefit from corticosteroid treatment, although research data are limited. Intravenous albumin, prophylactic antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation are not currently recommended.", 
    "232": "Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been claimed to have a specific renal protective effect in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present short-term study reports on the feasibility of dual blockade in a consecutive group of patients with CKD stage 3-5.",

Thereafter, the complementary drug was added in incremental doses over a period of 5 weeks aiming at combined enalapril 20 mg and candesartan 16 mg for 3 weeks. Seventy-five percent of the patients were known to be RAS blockade tolerant. Blood samples and BP were measured every 2-3 weeks. Doses of study medication were reduced in case of hyperkalemia >5.5 mmol/l, a sustained rise in p-creatinine >30% or symptomatic hypotension.",

Hyperkalemia >5.5 mmol/l was seen in seven patients (15%). The reduced-dose group had baseline lower eGFR and diastolic BP.", 
    "235": "Forty-five percent of CKD stage 3-5 patients did not tolerate dual RAS blockade with 20 mg enalapril and 16 mg candesartan daily, primarily due to loss of renal function or hypotension. Hyperkalemia could be managed in most patients. Caution is recommended when giving this treatment to patients with advanced CKD.", 
    "236": "After exposure to contrast medium (CM), about 10% of patients will develop contrast medium-induced nephropathy (CIN), with severe consequences for their prognosis. Although numerous studies evaluated risk factors for CIN development, it is still a matter of debate whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or AT-1 blockers increases the frequency of CIN after exposure to CM or not.", 
    "237": "We performed a prospective, single-centre study (January 2001-July 2004) to compare different treatments for CIN prevention. Creatinine levels within 72 h after CM application and in-hospital outcomes were documented. The impact of RAAS blockade on the frequency of CIN was assessed retrospectively.", 
    "238": "Four hundred twelve patients were included (83.5% men, 29.1% diabetes mellitus, 74.6% hypertension). Of these, 269 patients (65.3%) were taking ACE-I (n = 236) or AT-1 blockers (n = 33). There were no significant differences in mean age (P = 0.075), creatinine levels (P = 0.113), gender (P = 0.281), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.172) or left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.09) between patients treated or not treated with RAAS blockade. Univariate analyses concerning development of CIN depending on treatment with RAAS blockade within 72 h found CIN to be significantly higher in patients treated with RAAS blockade (11.9 vs 4.2%, P = 0.006). Multivariate analyses (logistic regression) identified RAAS blockade to be an independent predictor of CIN (odds ratio 3.082, 95% confidence interval 1.234-7.698, P = 0.016).",

    "244": "There is little prevalence data for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Ireland and it has been suggested that rates of diagnosis of CKD in primary care are low. The aim of this cross sectional study was to examine the prevalence, diagnosis and standards of care for CKD. All patient records in three general practices in the West of Ireland were reviewed. In 2602 patients > 50 years in the community, 435 (16.7%) had chronic kidney disease defined as eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Of these 435 individuals, only 58 (13.3%) had a diagnosis of CKD documented in their patient record. Among all patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, those with a documented diagnosis of CKD were significantly more likely to be prescribed an ACE/ARB and a lipid-lowering agent and were more likely to have had an ACR/PCR checked in the previous twelve months. Blood pressure was being appropriately monitored in the majority of patients but irrespective of eGFR level or a documented diagnosis of CKD, less than a fifth of patients had achieved a target of <130/80 mmHg. CKD is common in primary care but remains largely undiagnosed and blood pressure control remains suboptimal. A key step in improving care appears to be documenting the diagnosis which in turn appears to lead to improved standards of care and risk factor management.", 
    "245": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a disease that consists of a broad spectrum of different entities with different pathophysiologies that require varied approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The two most common causes of RAS are fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis, which consist of approximately 10 and 90% of RAS, respectively. Renovascular diseases are divided into two broad subtypes: hypertension and nephropathy. While models explaining the pathophysiology of RAS indicate a direct relationship between RAS and renovascular hypertension and nephropathy, this has not been fully seen in humans with chronic arterial narrowing. Furthermore, clinical data from humans has not fully demonstrated the benefit one would expect from treatment of RAS with regards to improvement in renovascular hypertension and nephropathy. The goal of this article is to review the pathophysiology of RAS, and discuss outcomes of treatment with regard to renovascular hypertension and nephropathy.", 
    "246": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a prime target for cardiovascular drug therapy. Inhibition of the RAS lowers blood pressure and confers protection against cardiovascular and renal events. These latter benefits cannot be entirely attributed to blood pressure lowering. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been studied extensively and, while there is irrefutable evidence that these agents mitigate the risk for cardiovascular and renal events, their protection is incomplete. In outcomes studies that have employed ACE-inhibitors or ARBs there has been a relatively high residual event rate in the treatment arm and this has been ascribed, by some, to the fact that neither ACE-inhibitors nor ARBs completely repress RAS. For this reason, combined RAS blockade with an ACE-inhibitor and ARB has emerged as a therapeutic option. In hypertension, combined RAS blockade elicits only a marginal incremental drop in blood pressure and it does not further lower the risk for cardiovascular events. In chronic heart failure and proteinuric renal disease, combining these agents in carefully selected patients is associated with a reduction in clinical events. Irrespective of the setting, dual RAS blockade is associated with an increase in the risk for adverse events, primarily hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. The emergence of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has afforded clinicians a new strategy for RAS blockade. Renin system blockade with aliskiren plus another RAS agent is the subject of ongoing large-scale clinical trials and early studies suggest promise for this strategy. Currently, combined RAS blockade with an ACE-inhibitor and an ARB should not be routinely employed for hypertension; however, the combination of an ACE-inhibitor or ARB with aliskiren might be considered in some patients given the more formidable blood pressure-lowering profile of this regimen. In carefully selected patients with heart failure or kidney disease, combination therapy with two RAS inhibitors should be considered.", 
    "247": "Hypertension is a comorbidity of Type 2 diabetes, and blood pressure lowering has been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) and renal disease progression in this population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors have demonstrated reduction in CV mortality and myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure in patients with diabetes. Evidence suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have similar CV protective effects, particularly in patients post-myocardial infarction and in those with heart failure, and their renoprotective effects have reduced proteinuria in patients with or without diabetes. In addition, ARBs have been shown to reduce diabetic nephropathy and complications related to nephropathy. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint trial (ONTARGET) is the first trial to demonstrate that the ARB, telmisartan, is as effective as the ACE-inhibitor, ramipril, in CV protection in a high-risk, ACE-tolerant population. Whether all ARBs are equally cardioprotective is uncertain. Data indicate that the beneficial effects of telmisartan may be drug specific rather than constitute a 'class effect.'", 
    "248": "Diabetes causes approximately 2.9 million deaths yearly, mainly through an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In hypertensive diabetics, blood pressure reduction determines a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular and renal events. Conversely, reaching the generally recommended target of lower than 130/80 mmHg is a difficult challenge and, in most cases, two or more antihypertensive drugs are required. Until recently, there was a general consensus that combination treatment should include a diuretic as one of the two fundamental agents. However, recently published trials using calcium channel blockers plus renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents showed that such a combination reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events, provides greater renoprotection, and improves metabolic outcomes as compared with diuretic-based combinations. The present review explores the potential for an 'optimal' combination therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, in view of recent experimental and clinical evidence.", 
    "249": "The International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), a randomized trial of 22,576 predominantly elderly patients with an average 2.7-year follow-up, compared a calcium antagonist-led strategy (verapamil SR plus trandolapril) with a beta-blocker-led strategy (atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide) for hypertension treatment and prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients. Patients received individualized dose and drug titration following a flexible, multi-drug, guideline-based treatment algorithm, with the objective of achieving optimal blood pressure (BP) control individualized for comorbidities (e.g., diabetes). The primary outcome (PO) was first occurrence of death (all-cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke. The strategies resulted in significant and very similar BP reduction, with approximately 70% of patients in both strategies achieving BP control (<140/90 mmHg). Increasing number of office visits with BP in control was associated with reduced risk of the PO. Overall, there was no difference in the PO comparing the strategies; however, new-onset diabetes occurred more frequently in those assigned the atenolol strategy. This report summarizes findings from INVEST and puts them in perspective with our current state of knowledge derived from other large hypertension treatment trials. INVEST findings support that BP reduction is important for prevention of adverse cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and selection of antihypertensive agents should be based on patient comorbidities and other risk factors (e.g., risk for diabetes) and not necessarily that any one drug be given to all.", 
    "250": "A new series of phosphinic inhibitors able to interact with both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) C-domain and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), while sparing neprilysin (NEP), has been developed. The most potent and selective inhibitor in this series (compound 8(F2)) displays K(i) values of 0.65 nM, 150 nM, 14 nM and 6.7 microM toward somatic ACE C-domain, ACE N-domain, ECE-1, and NEP, respectively. Remarkably, in this series, the inhibitor's ability to discriminate between ECE-1 and NEP was observed to depend on the stereochemistry of the residue present in the inhibitor's P(1)' position. After iv administration, compound 8(F2) (10 mg/kg) lowered mean arterial blood pressure by 24 +/- 2 mmHg in spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with controls. Mixed ACE/ECE-1 inhibitor may lead to a new generation of vasopeptide inhibitors that should reduce the levels of angiotensin-II and endothelin-1, without interfering with bradykinin cleavage.", 
    "251": "Hypertensive crisis is an acute, life-threatening condition associated with a substantial sudden increase in blood pressure. If the increase is accompanied by a damage of brain, cardiovascular system, eye ground or kidneys, it is referred to as an emergent hypertensive situation. In case of complaints comprising chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, epistaxis, weakness, faintness or seizure alone without organ damage, it is referred to as an urgent hypertensive situation. Treatment of emergent situations is parenteral and is conducted under a permanent monitoring in an intensive care unit. Nitrates, urapidil, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and clonidin are used with respect to organ damage and accompanying diseases. Rate of blood pressure reduction and target values depend on a type of organ damages. An escalation of per oral medication is used in the treatment of urgent situations. Parenteral medication is indicated only in case of failure of this approach.", 
    "252": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). We studied the effect of lisinopril (LP) and fosinopril (FP), the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and of losartan (LT), the antagonist of Angiotensin II receptors, on the behavior of multifunctional mast cells (MCs) under experimental HF. The inhibitors of RAS were daily injected during 4 weeks in 4 weeks after two (at 24-h interval) isoproterenol injections. MCs of different degrees of maturity were identified on paraffin sections stained with Alcian blue and Safranin. Expressiveness of HF was estimated by functional parameters with the help of echocardiogram and by morphological markers. The MC density in the myocardium of the intact rats as well as of the rats with HF, both treated and untreated with the preparations, was relatively low: from 3 to 4 cells/mm2. The MC density in the pericardium of the intact rats was several times higher than in the myocardium: 35 +/- 7 cells/mm2. The density ofpericardial MC under HF was 1.7 higher than that in the intact rats at the expense of the increase in the density of Alcian-positive immature cells (P < 0.05). The injections of LP increased the MC density still in 1.4 times at the expense of the density of Safranin-positive mature cells (P < 0.01). The injections of FP and LT had no influence on the MC density and the balance of cells of different degrees of maturity in the pericardium. 96-99% of MCs in lung were Alcian-positive cells. The density of such cells in the intact rats, in the rats with HF, and in the rats with HF treated with FP was 30 cells/mm2. The injections of LP and LT decreased the density of pulmonary MCs up to 7 cells/mm2 (P < 0.01) and 19 cells/mm2 (P < 0.05), respectively. Functional parameters of the hearts were consistent with the data of morphological analyses. Myocardium function improvement was noted only in the rats with HF treated with FP and LT. The reaction of MCs (as cell elements of \"tissue\" RAS) to injections of inhibitors of RAS was various in the myocardium, pericardium and lung of the rats with HF. The injections of LP stimulated maturation of the resident MCs in the pericardium and the replenishment of the population through immature cells migrating from the outside. It allows us to suppose an intensification of secretory activity of the cells. In contrast, the injections of LP and LT reduced the pulmonary MC population.", 
    "253": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease continue to pose major healthcare challenges. Early initiation of therapy aimed at slowing the progression of CKD is essential. Increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activity and, in particular, elevated levels of angiotensin II (AII) play important roles in the development and progression of CKD. Therefore, pharmacologic therapies that block the effects of AII and reduce its pathogenic effects are cornerstones of clinical management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to have renoprotective effects in addition to their ability to control blood pressure. There is accumulating clinical evidence that the combination of an ACEI and an ARB provides greater renal protection, particularly in decreasing proteinuria, than does either agent alone.", 
    "254": "Blood pressure (BP) is a continuous risk factor for ischemic and atherosclerotic events such as stroke and ischemic heart disease, and controlling BP is a well-established component of any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk reduction regimen. In most patients, > or =2 medications with different mechanisms of action will be necessary to reach recommended BP goals. The neuroendocrine effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) have proven to be excellent therapeutic targets for BP lowering. A number of antiatherosclerotic effects have been attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in addition to their antihypertensive effects. Because they have complementary actions on the RAAS, combination therapy with these agents has become the focus of recent clinical trials. This review describes the clinical data assessing the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers individually and in combination in reducing the risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease.", 
    "255": "The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is high and still on the rise. In 2004, an estimated 5.2 million adults in the United States carried the diagnosis of HF with a mortality rate of >19%. The incidence of HF is higher in individuals 65 years or older. As the US population grows older, the personal and economic costs of this disease are expected to grow. More than 75% of patients with HF have a history of hypertension, and blood pressure control can reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events and death in this population. In addition to lowering blood pressure, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can reduce the negative effects of chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation on the progression of HF. This review discusses the clinical data supporting the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers, alone or in combination, for improving outcomes in patients with HF.", 
    "256": "Few studies have addressed the profile of adherence among ethnic Chinese patients. This study evaluated the factors associated with adherence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), an increasingly common antihypertensive drug of choice. The authors included all adult patients who were prescribed an ACEI and paid at least 2 consecutive visits to any primary care clinics of one large territory of Hong Kong from January 2004 to June 2007. The determinants of good adherence to ACEI, as defined by a medication possession ratio > or = 80%, were evaluated by multivariate regression analysis. From 6408 eligible patients, 88.0% were adherent. Patients attending family medicine specialist clinics (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.91, P = .005) and follow-up visitors (AOR = 2.98, 95% CI: 2.49-3.55, P < .001) were significantly more likely and attendees of staff clinics (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.94, P = .033) were less likely to be adherent to ACEIs. Patients' age, gender, socioeconomic status, district of residence, and the number of comorbidities were not found to be associated with good adherence. Adherence-enhancing strategies should therefore be particularly focused on the new visitors (likely to be drug naive), and future research directions should delineate the best health service setting that could facilitate adherence to ACEIs.",

    "259": "Clinical trials in hypertensive patients comparing ACEI and ARB with other drugs generally showed no difference in the primary cardiovascular outcome (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group, Captopril Prevention Project, Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension 2, Japan Multicenter Investigation for Cardiovascular Diseases-B Randomized Trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study Group, Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation). Where the primary, or major secondary, cardiovascular end-point favors one of the treatment arms, it was always the arm with the lower achieved blood pressure that saw the better clinical result as in Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study, Captopril Prevention Project, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, and Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation. Trials comparing ACEI or ARB against placebo in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events have not showed a consistent result; cardiovascular outcomes were reduced in Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, and the Jikei Heart Study, but were not significantly reduced in Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study, Comparison of Arnlodipine vs Enalapril to Limit Occurrences of Thrombosis Trial, Prevention of Events with ACEIs Trial, Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease Trial, and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes Trial. In the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, combining ACEIs with ARBs in high-risk patients did not reduce cardiovascular or renal outcomes compared with ACEI monotherapy alone. This absence of a reduction in cardiovascular outcome from the ACEI and ARB combination arm is further evidence suggesting that these drugs do not have any special cardiovascular protective effect. This objective review thus shows that the rennin-angiotensin antagonists do not have special cardiovascular protective properties.",

    "261": "We investigated the influence of captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) treatment during pregnancy and lactation period on hydromineral balance of the male adult offspring, particularly, concerning thirst and sodium appetite. We did not observe significant alterations in basal hydromineral (water intake, 0.3M NaCl intake, volume and sodium urinary concentration) or cardiovascular parameters in adult male rats perinatally treated with captopril compared to controls. However, male offspring rats that perinatally exposed to captopril showed a significant attenuation in water intake induced by osmotic stimulation, extracellular dehydration and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, captopril treatment during perinatal period decreased the salt appetite induced by sodium depletion. This treatment also attenuated thirst and sodium appetite aroused during inhibition of peripheral angiotensin II generation raised by low concentration of captopril in the adult offspring. Interestingly, perinatal exposure to captopril did not alter water or salt intake induced by i.c.v. administration of angiotensin I or angiotensin II. These results showed that chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme during pregnancy and lactation modifies the regulation of induced thirst and sodium appetite in adulthood.",

A similar effect is suggested for cutaneous melanoma. We aimed to investigate the possible association between use of ACEi and ARb and the risk of cutaneous melanoma. A general population-based case control study with the PHARMO database, containing drug-dispensing records from community pharmacies and the national pathology database (PALGA) was conducted. Cases were patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma between January 1st 1991 and December 14th 2004, aged > or =18 years and having > or =3 years of follow-up prior to diagnosis. Finally, 1272 cases and 6520 matched controls were included.

Thus, in this study, the use of ACEi or ARb does not seem to protect against the development of cutaneous melanoma. However, we cannot exclude an association between ACEi and ARb exposure and an increased or decreased incidence of cutaneous melanoma.",

Data were collected on tryptase concentration, age, sex, culprit insect, cardiovascular medication, and the number of preceding minor systemic reactions before the index field sting. A severe reaction was defined as anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness, or cardiopulmonary arrest. The index sting was defined as the hitherto first, most severe systemic field-sting reaction. Relative rates were calculated with generalized additive models.",

    "268": "Aliskiren, the first orally effective direct renin inhibitor, is an effective antihypertensive agent with distinctive properties including placebo-like tolerability, pharmacologic effects that persist after drug discontinuation, and a unique mechanism of action. When combined with agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or beta-blockers, additional blood pressure reduction reflects more complete RAAS blockade. Concern that marked elevation in plasma renin concentration following aliskiren administration might lead to RAAS-induced paradoxical blood pressure increases appears unfounded, based upon analyses of patients participating in clinical trials. Studies in animals and humans indicate that aliskiren accumulates in renal tissue, blocks the intrarenal RAAS, and interferes with deleterious cellular effects of angiotensin II by mechanisms that may include enzymatic blockade of renin and prorenin at the site of the (pro)renin receptor. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, adding aliskiren to losartan resulted in an additional 20% reduction in urinary protein excretion. In patients with heart failure, aliskiren reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels when added to other RAAS inhibitors, suggesting an additional hemodynamic effect. The ASPIRE HIGHER clinical trials program is assessing whether the promising pharmacologic properties of aliskiren translate into long-term clinical benefits.", 
    "269": "Selected di- and tripeptides exhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in vitro. However, the efficacy in vivo is most likely limited for most peptides due to low bioavailability. The purpose of this study was to identify descriptors of intestinal stability, permeability, and ACE inhibitory activity of dipeptides. A total of 228 dipeptides were synthesized; intestinal stability was obtained by in vitro digestion, intestinal permeability using Caco-2 cells and ACE inhibitory activity by an in vitro assay. Databases were constructed to study the relationship between structure and activity, permeability, and stability. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling was performed based on computed models using partial least squares regression based on 400 molecular descriptors. QSAR modeling of dipeptide stability revealed high correlation coefficients (R > 0.65) for models based on Z and X scales. However, amino acid (AA) clustering showed the best results in describing stability of dipeptides. The N-terminal AA residues Asp, Gly, and Pro as well as the C-terminal residues Pro, Ser, Thr, and Asp stabilize dipeptides toward luminal enzymatic peptide hydrolysis. QSAR modeling did not reveal significant correlation models for intestinal permeability. 2D-fingerprint models were identified describing ACE inhibitory activity of dipeptides. The intestinal stability of 12 peptides was predicted. Peptides were synthesized and stability was confirmed in simulated digestion experiments. Based on the results, specific dipeptides can be designed to meet both stability and activity criteria. However, postabsorptive ACE inhibitory activities of dipeptides in vivo are most likely limited due to the very low intestinal permeability of dipeptides.", 
    "270": "Renin inhibitors, similar to all renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, increase the plasma concentration of renin because they attenuate the negative feedback effect of angiotensin (Ang) II on renin release. The increase in renin has been suggested to be higher than that during other types of RAS blockade. This could potentially limit the effectiveness of renin inhibition, either because Ang II generation might occur again ('Ang II escape'), possibly even at the levels above baseline, as has been described before for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or because high levels of renin will stimulate the recently discovered (pro)renin receptor, and thus induce effects in an Ang-independent manner. This review shows first that the cause(s) of the renin increase during treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren is the consequence of a combination of factors, including an assay artifact, allowing the detection of prorenin as renin, and a change in renin half-life. When correcting for these phenomena the increase is unlikely to be as excessive as originally thought. The review then critically describes the consequence(s) of such a increase, concluding (i) that an Ang II escape is highly unlikely, given the [aliskiren]/[renin] stoichiometry, and (ii) that renin and prorenin downregulate their receptor (similar to many agonists). On the basis of the latter, one could even speculate that this will be more substantial when the renin and prorenin levels are higher. Thus, from this point of view the larger increase in renin during renin inhibition will cause a stronger reduction in (pro)renin receptor expression, and a greater suppression of (pro)renin receptor-mediated effects than other renin-Ang blockers.",

F2-isoprostanes were not increased by Ang II; however, female mice had significantly higher levels than males. Renal cortical expression of catalase and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) was not different between experimental groups. Urinary protein was higher in male mice when compared to females, but was not changed after treatment with Ang II in either group.",

    "277": "Angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of stroke than placebo with an OR of 0.91 (0.84 to 0.98). Angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with no significant reduction in the risk of stroke compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR, 0.93; 0.84 to 1.03) and calcium antagonists (OR, 1.16; 0.91 to 1.48).",

    "279": "Experimental data, results of retrospective studies and of small randomized trials suggest an efficacy of upstream therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, statins and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These drugs seem to act by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, all factors that play an important role in the genesis of the substrate of AF and atrial remodeling. However, the recent Italian GISSI-AF study, which is the first large, multicenter, prospective and randomized trial (valsartan vs placebo) dealing with upstream therapy in the secondary prevention of AF, offered negative results. A trend toward a lower incidence of AF recurrence was apparent only in the valsartan group in patients presenting with heart failure, even if statistical significance was not reached. On the basis of these recent data, we analyzed the contributions offered by the literature on upstream therapy of AF in patients with heart failure in order to evaluate a possible use of this treatment in clinical practice. Six retrospective studies dealing with the primary prevention of AF (3 with ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and 3 with statins) have been published; in these studies, upstream therapy was constantly effective. A recent meta-analysis, which included trials dealing with the primary prevention of AF with ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, showed that patients with heart failure benefited the most. Up to now, the contributions on upstream therapy in the secondary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure are very few. These results are still not enough to recommend the clinical use of upstream therapy of AF in patients with heart failure because of the retrospective design of the studies. However, it emerges a background to plan a large-scale prospective, randomized trial on upstream therapy in the primary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure.", 
    "280": "Angioneurotic edema of upper airway tissues due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) usage is a known perioperative complication of this class of medications. Swelling can begin rapidly, and typically involves the tongue and oral cavity. We have recently encountered four cases in which supraglottic edema developed after onset of tongue swelling and progressed despite resolving tongue edema. We present a representative case. This observation suggests that all patients with ACEI-induced angioedema should undergo laryngeal fiberoptic examination and appropriate airway management.", 
    "281": "This multicentre, double-blind, trial in subjects with severe hypertension compared the efficacy and tolerability of two parallel drug regimens: A/B (amlodipine/benazepril: 5/20 or 10/40 mg daily, if necessary) with A (amlodipine: 5 or 10 mg daily, if necessary). The principal dependent variable was the proportion of patients achieving goal blood pressures (BP<140/90 mm Hg or BP<130/80 mm Hg in diabetes or chronic kidney disease) in the two groups within 6 weeks. In the 259 randomized subjects, BP control rates were higher with A/B at 2, 4 and 6 weeks (10.5, 22, and 33.6%, respectively) compared with A (5.7, 16, and 25.8 %, respectively). Corresponding trended BP reductions from baseline at 2, 4 and 6 weeks were about 5 mm Hg greater with A/B (-21+/-16, -26+/-17 and -30+/-17 mm Hg, respectively, compared with A (-16+/-17, -23+/-18 and 25+/-19 mm Hg, respectively, P<0.01). Both regimens were well tolerated; incidences of peripheral oedema at weeks 4 and 6 were similar (A/B: 13 and 20% versus A: 20 and 22%, P=not significant). We conclude that titration of amlodipine and benazepril in single-pill combinations is more effective than titration of amlodipine alone for rapid BP control in patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "282": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), are recommended by the American Diabetes Association for blood pressure control and prevention or management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, some investigators have suggested that ARBs may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients. Activation of the RAS is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic events. Angiotensin II stimulates the production of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a powerful predictor of cardiovascular disease. ACE inhibitors are reported to reduce PAI-1 levels and activity, while ARBs do not reduce or may even elevate levels of this atherogenic marker. The objective of this study was to determine whether the ACE inhibitor imidapril reduces PAI-1 levels in hypertensive patients already being treated with an ARB.", 
    "283": "This was a prospective cohort study carried out in primary care with a follow-up period of 6 months. Estimating the alpha error (p-value) at 0.05, the power of the test as 80%, and the difference in PAI-1 levels as 10 + or - 15 ng/mL, the required sample size was calculated to be 40. Participants were hypertensive patients taking ARBs for more than 8 weeks, and having dyslipidaemia, obesity or abnormal glucose metabolism. Imidapril 5-10 mg/day was prescribed for 6 months to reduce blood pressure to <130/80 mmHg. The main outcome measure, PAI-1 level, was measured before and 6 months after the addition of imidapril to ARBs in 21 subjects (13 men, eight women), all with abnormal glucose metabolism, nine with dyslipidaemia, and six who were obese. Bodyweight, body mass index, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, glycosylated haemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and high molecular weight adiponectin levels were measured as secondary outcomes.",

Despite this, the BP of many patients with hypertension in primary health care remains poorly controlled. The ACE inhibitor perindopril has proven BP-lowering efficacy as well as protective effects against cardiovascular events among patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors. The PREFER study assessed the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of perindopril 5-10 mg/day among hypertensive patients who were unresponsive to treatment with other ACE-inhibitor-based regimens.",

At study entry, current ACE inhibitor treatment was replaced by perindopril 5 mg/day. Patients were followed up monthly for 3 months and the dosage of perindopril could be increased to 10 mg/day in cases of failure to achieve BP control. No other change in antihypertensive therapy was permitted.",

Mean pulse pressure (PP) was reduced by 13.6 mmHg (from 65.7 to 52.1 mmHg) with greater decreases seen in patients aged >70 years or with isolated systolic hypertension. BP control was achieved in 48.1% of the previously uncontrolled population. Antihypertensive efficacy was observed across patient subgroups regardless of the severity of hypertension at baseline and number of cardiovascular risk factors.

Fourteen normotensive healthy persons served as controls. Six M-mode echocardiographic measurements (transducer was turned off and on again each time) were performed.", 
    "293": "The probability of misclassifying a person with LVH (> 130 g/m(2)) as having normal LVM or vice versa was calculated as a function of the number of measurements. The probability was high for single measurements, but was substantially reduced by performing six repeated measurements. Thus, the risk of misclassification was reduced from 20% to 6% in persons with LVM of 120 g/m(2) or 140 g/m(2) and from 13% to 1% in persons with LVM of 115 or 145 g/m(2). However, for persons whose LVM were close to 130 g/m(2), the probability for misclassifications remained high 20% despite repeated measurements.",

We have determined the trends of BP control of the same patients during 15 years in a hypertension clinic. One hundred three patients (age 32-91, mean 68 +/- 11 years in 2006), who were followed at our hypertension clinic between 1991-2006, were retrospectively investigated. We compared the clinical characteristics of the patients in 2006 to those in 1991, 1996, and 2001, using the averaged BP determined at two occasions of each year for our analysis. The average BP decreased from 144 +/- 17/87 +/- 10 mmHg to 132 +/- 12/75 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.01) during the 15 years between 1991 and 2006. When good BP control was defined as < 140/90 mmHg, the rate of patients with good BP control increased from 35% in 1991 to 45% in 1996, to 54% in 2001 (p < 0.01 vs. 1991), and to 72% in 2006 (p < 0.01 vs. 1991). The number of anti-hypertensive drugs used in 2006 significantly increased compared to those in 1991, 1996, and 2001. More specifically, the use of diuretics and alpha-blockers increased significantly during this period. Results suggest that BP control improved in the 15 years studied, and the increased use of the anti-hypertensive drugs, as well as the increased awareness of the importance of strict BP control, seems to have contributed to improve the BP control.", 
    "296": "Peanut hydrolysate obtained after 6 h of digestion by Alcalase was used to isolate angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. After centrifugation and ultrafiltration through a 0.2 microm nylon filter, the hydrolysate was filtered through the polyethersulfone membrane with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 10 kDa. The resulting permeate was then separated by primary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Eluate was divided into six major fractions according to eluation time. The fraction with eluting time 50-60 min showed the most potent ACE inhibition and was subjected to further purification by the secondary RP-HPLC. Four peaks were found to have strong ACE inhibitory activities, and their IC(50) values were determined. Peptide mass for the most potent peak was obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI), and sequence was determined by MALDI tandem TOF-TOF (time-of-flight) mass spectrometer (MS/MS) to be Lys-Ala-Phe-Arg.",

The results show that antiplatelet drugs are underused in ischemic patients, but especially in women. The maximum use of preventive drugs in women was registered after acute myocardial infarction (beta blockers 85.7%, statins 50%, aspirin 60.7%, ACEI 75%). In turn, the myocardial revascularization by CABG and PCI is low in both groups, but much less in women than in men: CABG 1.1% in women, 4.6% in men p>0.05, PCI 5.3% in women and 13.8% in men p<0.05.",

Time from initial NIDCM diagnosis to implant was 11+/-6 months and duration of medical treatment before implant was 8+/-5 months. Treatment at the time of implant included ACE inhibitors or ARBs (85%), beta blockers (77%), spironolactone (53%), loop diuretic (63%) and digoxin (50%). Repeat EF assessment was available in 309/332 (93%) 8+/-6 months after implant. EF improved to >35% in 37/309 (12%) patients.

A 3(2) full factorial design was employed for optimization using captopril to Compritol ATO 888 ratio (X1) and extragranular fraction of ethyl cellulose (X2) as independent variables. The percentage drug released in 1 h (Y1) and the time required to release 80% of the drug (Y2) were selected as dependent variables. Eutectic blend of camphor and menthol was used as a solvent to facilitate the drug distribution in matrix. The optimized batch containing 50 mg captopril, 160 mg Compritol ATO 888 and 220 mg ethyl cellulose was formulated by overlapping the contour plots of Y1 and Y2. The responses Y1 and Y2 of optimized batch were 25% and 520 min, respectively. The kinetics of drug release was best explained by Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The results of artificial neural network were superior in prediction power than the factorial design for both the responses (Y1 and Y2).", 
    "307": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) are consist of central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. Previous studies have reported possible association of migraine and MetS were reviewed. Migraine is a prevalent disabling disorder and have been regarded as an episodic and functional disorder. However, recent evidence suggests that in some cases, the disease may follow a chronic and progressive course. On the basis of available evidence, obesity is considered to be associated with migraine frequency and progression. The association between diabetes and migraine is unclear. Similarly, association of migraine with hypertension is also unclear. Female migraineurs commonly have an unfavorable cholesterol profile, i.e. one with high total cholesterol and low HDL levels. Obesity can be considered as a proinflammatory state in which increased inflammatory mediators, vascular hyperreactivity, plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentrations and decreased adiponectin concentrations are observed. These alterations can cause an increase in the frequency of migraine attacks developed of central sensitization, and thereafter, chronic migraine. Migraine and obesity may share some neurobiological abnormalities. Orexins modulate both pain and metabolism. Dysfunction in the orexin pathways seems to be a risk factor for both conditions. The methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene exhibit polymorphism. C677Tmutation in the MTHFR gene and the D-allele of the ACE gene are the shared risk factors for the development of migraine and cardiovascular disease. Certain beta-blockers, Ca blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angionten II receptor blocker (ARB) have excellent efficacy in migraine prophylaxis. The pharmacological mechanism of these agents do not seem to stand on their antihypertensive effect, but the other mechanism of action. Appropriate meal, sleep, and exercise are important for the management of MetS and migraine headaches.", 
    "308": "Oral drug delivery is generally the most desirable means of administration, mainly because of patient acceptance, convenience in administration. Intestinal absorption mechanisms of anionic drugs have been mainly explained by the passive diffusion of nonionized compounds. However, several studies have suggested the involvement of specific transporters in intestinal absorption of weak acids including monocarboxylates. (-)-N-(trans-4-Isopropylcyclohexanecarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine (nateglinide) is a oral hypoglycemic agent possessing a carboxyl group and a peptide-type bond in its structure. Although nateglinide quickly reaches the maximal serum concentration after oral administration, nateglinide itself is not transported by PepT1 or MCT1. We demonstrated that nateglinide transport occurs via a single system that is H(+) dependent but is distinct from PepT1 or MCT1. In clinical, patients usually take many kinds of drugs at the same time. Thus, drug-drug interactions involving transporters can often directly affect the therapeutic safety and efficacy of many drugs. However, there have been few studies on food-drug interactions involving transporters. Dietary polyphenols have been widely assumed to be beneficial to human health. Polyphenols are commercially prepared and used as functional foods. We reported that ferulic acid, which is widely used as a functional food, affects the transport of clinical agents. The major dose-limiting toxicity after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride, 7-ethyl-10-(4-[1-piperidino]-1-piperidino)-carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11) is severe diarrhea. We have found that a specific transport system mediates the uptake of active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) across the apical membrane in Caco-2 cells. Baicalin and sulfobromophthatlein inhibit this transporter. Inhibition of this transporter would be a useful means for reducing late-onset diarrhea.",

    "313": "Erythroxylum species have several traditional uses in different countries, including the treatment of hypertension. The ethanol extract from E. gonocladum aerial parts, a species endemic to the Brazilian cerrado, elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (pIC(50)=4.53+/-0.05). Extract fractionation led to the isolation of two compounds, whose structures were assigned by spectrometric data as astilbin and beta-sitosterol, along with a mixture of palmitic, stearic and linolenic acids. This is the first report on the occurrence of these compounds on E. gonocladum. Astilbin promoted significant ACE inhibition in vitro (pIC(50)=5.86+/-0.33) and its activity did not differ from captopril, when both compounds were assayed at 10 microM concentration.",

Hypertension and, in particular diabetes, are significant contributors to the global burden of chronic kidney disease. Although it might increase costs, screening for, and improved management of, persons at increased risk of progressive kidney disease could improve health outcomes. We therefore sought to estimate the costs and health outcomes of alternative strategies to prevent end-stage kidney disease, compared with usual care.",

    "316": "Intensive treatment of inadequately controlled diabetes was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A133) and more effective (with an additional 0.075 QALYs per patients) than conventional management. Intensive management of hypertension had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) $A2588 per QALY gained. Treating all known diabetics with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A825 per patient) and more effective than current treatment (resulting in 0.124 additional QALYs per patient). Primary care screening for 50- to 69-year-olds plus intensive treatment of diabetes had an ICER of $A13,781 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for hypertension (between ages 50 and 69 years) plus intensive blood pressure management had an ICER of $A491 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for proteinuria (between ages 50 and 69 years) combined with prescription of an ACE inhibitor for all persons showing proteinuria and all known diabetics had an ICER of $A4793 per QALY gained.",

    "318": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been extensively used for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease, but several concerns have been raised about their efficacy in African American (AA) patients with heart failure, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy. In this study the authors assessed the effect of ACE inhibitors on total and cardiovascular mortality in high-risk AA patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD). This was a retrospective analysis of 810 AA men who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography between 1995 and 2003. All patients had demonstrable CAD and had undergone a complete ischemic workup. Follow-up was from 3 to 10 years. ACE inhibitors were administered to 237 patients, while the remaining 537 patients were not taking ACE inhibitors. Patients taking ACE inhibitors had significantly more comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, severe CAD) at baseline, compared with patients not taking ACE inhibitors (P<.05 for all comorbidities). Despite the unfavorable baseline profile, patients taking ACE inhibitors had significantly lower mortality from CAD during follow-up than patients who were not taking ACE inhibitors (P=.006). Stroke mortality rates were similar in both groups. Cox regression analysis showed an 80% higher relative risk in patients not receiving ACE inhibitors. These data indicate a substantial benefit from ACE inhibitor therapy in high-risk AA patients with CAD.", 
    "319": "Long-term allograft survival poses a major problem in pediatric renal transplantation, with allograft nephropathy being the principal cause of graft failure after the first post-transplant year. The mechanisms of nephron loss resulting in graft dysfunction are multiple, comprising both immunologic factors such as acute and chronic antibody- or T-cell-mediated rejection and non-immunologic components. The latter include peri-transplant injuries and renovascular lesions (renal artery stenosis, thrombosis) as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Another relevant issue leading to progressive nephron loss and declining kidney transplant function is acute and chronic nephrotoxicity induced by the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) ciclosporin (cyclosporine microemulsion) and tacrolimus. Furthermore, the presence of an abnormal lower urinary tract as well as bacterial (recurrent pyelonephritis) and viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV], polyomavirus [BK virus; BKV]) infections are crucial factors involved in the incidence of chronic allograft dysfunction and graft failure. Renovascular lesions and lower urinary tract obstruction are typical indicators for surgical intervention. The aim of treatment in pediatric patients with renal failure secondary to a dysfunctional lower urinary tract is to create a sterile, continent, and nonrefluxive reservoir. Surgical techniques such as bladder augmentation and the introduction of intermittent catheterization and anticholinergic therapy have significantly improved graft outcome. Arterial hypertension, another factor responsible for graft function deterioration in pediatric renal transplant recipients, is controlled preferably by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, which are known to possess nephroprotective properties in addition to their potent antihypertensive effects. Although treatment of subclinical rejection with augmented immunosuppression has been associated with better graft survival, an increase of the immunosuppressive level to avoid subclinical rejection should be weighed against the risk of infection. The majority of viral infections affecting kidney allografts are caused by CMV and BKV. Antiviral CMV prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy with ganciclovir has been shown to have beneficial effects in the pediatric renal transplant population. Treatment of BKV-induced nephropathy is based on reduction of the immunosuppressant therapy, although specific antiviral agents such as cidofovir and leflunomide are known to inhibit BKV. However, cidofovir itself is nephrotoxic and should therefore be administered cautiously to pediatric renal transplant patients. Since CNIs are likewise known for their nephrotoxic effects, especially with long-term use, alteration of the immunosuppressant regimen is necessary in case of deteriorating graft function due to CNI-induced histopathologic changes. Complete CNI avoidance seems inappropriate because, in this situation in pediatric renal transplant recipients, other relatively potent immunosuppressant agents such as lymphocyte-depleting antibodies, which are frequently accompanied by a higher incidence of infections, are needed for rejection prophylaxis. CNI withdrawal and switching of the immunosuppressant regimen from CNI therapy to sirolimus may be an option for some pediatric renal transplant patients with less advanced graft function deterioration. Nevertheless, potential adverse events such as aggravation of proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, myelosuppression, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism have to be considered, and controlled studies are lacking. At present, an immunosuppressant maintenance therapy composed of low-dose tacrolimus or ciclosporin (CNI minimization) and mycophenolate mofetil with low-dose corticosteroids appears to be the most promising strategy to adopt in pediatric renal transplant recipients at low or normal immunologic risk.",

Microalbuminuria is an independent risk marker, and routine monitoring of urinary albumin is mandatory in patients with diabetes and hypertension. The therapeutic goal of antihypertensive treatment is < 130/80 mm Hg, however in the presence of nephropathy < 125/75 mm Hg should be achieved. Therapy is based on lifestyle-interventions including 1) weight reduction, 2) regular moderate physical activity, 3) modification of diet with restriction of salt- and alcohol consumption as well as 4) cessation of smoking.

It has been reported that eplerenone has a potential antihypertensive effect, with a profile slightly different from that of spironolactone, and has fewer adverse reactions, suggesting that it may become a first-line treatment for hypertension. However, clinical data on hypertensive patients in Japan are lacking for eplerenone. In this study, we explored the clinical efficacy of eplerenone when it is added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) in 68 (31 males, 37 females) Japanese patients with essential hypertension. After adding 50 mg of eplerenone to their basal treatment, blood pressure was significantly reduced at 4 weeks, and further reduced after 24 weeks of eplerenone treatment. Urinary albumin excretion decreased significantly after 24 weeks. There were no significant differences in general biochemical test values or electrolytes, but fasting serum triglycerides were significantly decreased after eplerenone treatment. The serum potassium level showed no significant change during treatment. There were no significant correlations between plasma renin activity or plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) before eplerenone treatment and blood pressure after eplerenone treatment, showing that the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone is not affected by the patient's renin profile or pretreatment PAC values. Eplerenone was also effective in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, eplerenone, when coadministered with an ACE inhibitor or a long-acting CCB, caused an extremely beneficial antihypertensive effect in Japanese patients with essential hypertension, without few clinically important adverse events.",

We showed that treating rats acutely with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril decreases PT salt and water reabsorption and provokes rapid redistribution of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), Na(+)/Pi cotransporter 2 (NaPi2), and associated proteins out of the microvilli. The aim of the present study was to determine whether acute ANG II infusion increases the abundance of PT NHE3, NaPi2, and associated proteins in the microvilli available for reabsorbing NaCl. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with a dose of captopril (12 microg/min for 20 min) that increased PT flow rate approximately 20% with no change in blood pressure (BP) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When ANG II (20 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 20 min) was added to the captopril infusate, PT volume flow rate returned to baseline without changing BP or GFR. After captopril, NHE3 was localized to the base of the microvilli and NaPi2 to subapical cytoplasmic vesicles; after 20 min ANG II, both NHE3 and NaPi2 redistributed into the microvilli, assayed by confocal microscopy and density gradient fractionation. Additional PT proteins that redistributed into low-density microvilli-enriched membranes in response to ANG II included myosin VI, DPPIV, NHERF-1, ezrin, megalin, vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, aminopeptidase N, and clathrin. In summary, in response to 20 min ANG II in the absence of a change in BP or GFR, multiple proteins traffic into the PT brush-border microvilli where they likely contribute to the rapid increase in PT salt and water reabsorption.",

Patients with CKD have significant morbidity (ie, increased risk of CVD) and progression to end-stage renal disease. Increase in albuminuria over time to levels greater than 300 mg/d, in spite of blood pressure being at goal, is an independent predictor for nephropathy progression. Data provide support, however, for reducing proteinuria by at least 30% after treatment is initiated in patients with proteinuria. Pharmacologic blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) slows progression of advanced proteinuric CKD more effectively than other antihypertensive agents. In post hoc analyses, this slowed progression has been correlated to reductions in proteinuria of 30% or more after blood pressure-lowering therapy is initiated. Increases in proteinuria, in spite of blood pressure reduction, are associated with faster declines in kidney function regardless of whether RAAS blockers are used.",

Uncontrolled hypertension promotes the initiation and perpetuation of AF through atrial remodeling.

Retrospective analysis of several large clinical trials and small prospective trials suggests the beneficial role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in preventing the onset and recurrence of AF in different populations. Several large prospective trials with longer follow-up periods are in progress. These trials may provide definitive evidence for the use of these agents in the prevention of AF.",

Presently, diastolic heart failure accounts for about 50% of the heart failure population. Fatigue, dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and peripheral edema are common presenting complaints. As a group, patients with diastolic heart failure are older and predominantly female. Diuretics are effective for treating congestive symptoms. beta Blockers and heart rate-lowering calcium blockers show benefit in smaller studies but have not been evaluated in definitive clinical trials. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers reduce blood pressure, LVH, and myocardial fibrosis; however, long-term studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers demonstrate little effect on symptoms or survival, and inconsistent effects on heart failure hospitalization. At present, evidence-based treatment includes antihypertensive therapy to reduce progression from hypertension to heart failure.

Furthermore, high-dose avosentan treatment was also associated with reduced expression of the genes for ETA, ETB and angiotensin receptor 1.

In the last decade, evidence has accumulated that the central RAS might also play a role in Parkinson's disease. Although the exact cause of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the basal ganglia remains unidentified, inflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested to be key factors in the pathogenesis and the progression of the disease. Since angiotensin II is a pro-inflammatory compound that can induce the production of reactive oxygen species due to activation of the NADPH-dependent oxidase complex, this peptide might contribute to dopaminergic cell death. In this review, three different strategies to interfere with the pathogenesis or the progression of Parkinson's disease are discussed. They include inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor.", 
    "355": "Suppression of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or blockade of the angiotensin II receptor by angiotensin receptor blockers is a powerful therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of renal disease. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers provide only imperfect protection against the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal failure. Hence, innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with chronic kidney disease off dialysis. Angiotensin II activates at least two receptors, namely the angiotensin II type 1 (AT( 1)) and angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors. The majority of the effects of angiotensin II, such as vasoconstriction, inflammation, and matrix deposition, are mediated via the AT(1) receptor. It is thought that the AT(2) receptor counteracts these effects and plays a role in nephroprotection. However, recent data support the notion that the AT(2) receptor transduces pro-inflammatory effects and promotes fibrosis and hypertrophy. Therefore, the question of whether stimulation of the AT(2) receptor could represent a silver bullet for the treatment of chronic kidney disease or may, on the contrary, exert detrimental effects on renal physiology remains unresolved. Recent data from AT(2) receptor-knockout mice demonstrate that the loss of AT(2) receptor signalling is associated with increased renal injury and mortality in chronic kidney disease. This raises the expectation that pharmacological stimulation of the AT(2) receptor may positively influence renal pathologies. However, further research is needed to explore the question whether AT(2) receptor stimulation may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.",

Hypertensive TXP trended toward lower HMWr compared with nonhypertensive TXP (0.40+/-0.09 vs. 0.47+/-0.11, P=0.064). Levels did not differ according to sex, obesity or dipper status. In univariate analyses, total adiponectin and HMWr were negatively and significantly correlated with indexed BP in the daytime, nighttime, and 24-hr periods (R=-0.35 to -0.57). After adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate, fat mass, anti-hypertensive medication and fasting glucose, (1) lower total adiponectin was significantly and independently associated with greater elevations in all ABPM indexes except for nighttime systolic indexed BP, and (2) HMWr was inversely associated with all ABPM indexes. Lower adiponectin levels (P=0.049) and HMWr (P=0.042) were associated with greater odds of hypertension. CONCLUSION.: These data indicate that lower total adiponectin and HMWr were significantly and independently associated with greater ambulatory blood pressure.",

Landmark analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to predict SCD during hospitalization, from discharge to 30 days, 30 days to 6 months, and 6 months to 3 years. The cumulative incidence of SCD was 8.6% (n = 965). Initially, higher baseline heart rate [HR 1.20 per 10 b.p.m. (95% CI 1.06-1.37)] and impaired baseline creatinine clearance [HR 0.82 per 10 mL/min (95% CI 0.74-0.91)] were stronger predictors of SCD. With long-term follow-up, prior MI [HR 1.71 (95% CI 1.39-2.10)], initial left ventricular ejection fraction <40% [HR 0.67 per 10% (95% CI 0.58-0.78)], and recurrent cardiovascular events [HR 1.47 for rehospitalization (95% CI 1.17-1.86)] were more robust risk stratifiers for SCD.

    "380": "Increasing evidence implies beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors beyond those of their original indications to control hypertension. One of the most attractive non-hemodynamic properties of ACE inhibitors is their ability to regulate cytokine production. The mechanism(s) underlying the role of ACE inhibitors on cytokine synthesis are not well understood but they have traditionally been attributed to the inhibition of angiotensin (Ang) II formation. In fact, it has been extensively demonstrated that ACE inhibitors decrease Ang II-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, it is not well described if inhibition of endogenous Ang II generation by ACE inhibitors modulates systemic cytokine production in mice. To verify that, in this work, we investigated the effects of treatment with the ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril on cytokine synthesis in C57Bl/6 and Balb/c mice. Our results show that enalapril up regulates IL-10 produced by splenocytes from Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice and captopril increased it only in Balb/c mice. Furthermore, CD4(+)CD103(+) presented increased IL-10 production after enalapril treatment. Enalapril as well as captopril short-term treatment enhanced IL-2 synthesis in Balb/c mice. Besides, enhanced IL-2 and IL-10 levels correlates with increased CD4(+)CD103(+)CD25(negative) T cells numbers in spleens from enalapril-treated mice.",

Only one-half of women with PAD are symptomatic. Symptomatic and asymptomatic women with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from coronary artery disease. Modifiable risk factors that predispose women to PAD include active cigarette smoking, passive smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, increased plasma homocysteine levels and hypothyroidism. With regard to management, women who smoke should be encouraged to quit and referred to a smoking cessation program. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism require treatment. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in women with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin or especially clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins should be given to all women with PAD. Beta blockers are recommended if coronary artery disease is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol increase exercise time until intermittent claudication develops. Chelation therapy should be avoided as it is ineffective. Indications for lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or bypass surgery in women are (1) incapacitating claudication interfering with work or lifestyle; and (2) limb salvage in women with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and/or infection or gangrene.

For patients who begin pregnancy with an abnormal creatinine (> 2 mg/dl is ill advised), risks include hypertension, preeclampsia, high rate of fetal loss, and possible further deterioration of renal function. Discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mycophenalate is mandatory. Elevated levels of sVEGF-1 may be a harbinger of preeclampsia. For patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies detected in the frst trimester of pregnancy, the lupus anticoagulant per se may be the strongest predictor of pregnancy complications.

Chronic kidney failure is associated with hypertension and an accelerated form of arteriosclerosis. Demise from cardiovascular affliction is a leading cause of death in renal patients (chronic renal failure stages II-IV, renal failure requiring dialysis, renal transplantation). What, then, is the role of antihypertensive treatment in such patients, and, specifically, what is achieved by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system modifying agents? Two meta-analyses have recently investigated these issues. An article in The Lancet evaluated eight studies on dialysis patients (n = 1679). It concluded that antihypertensives are beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, we criticize these conclusions and show that the data are not convincingly in favor of antihypertensive treatment. A meta-analysis in the American Heart Journal assessed the role of antihypertensive agents and RAA system modifying drugs in 45,758 patients (from 25 studies), who were in stages I-III of renal failure, i.e., not (yet) requiring dialysis. The authors claim that angiotensin- -converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) significantly reduced cardiovascular outcomes. However, our analysis of the data is not consistent with their conclusions. It showed that the results were quite mixed, that the authors may have overemphasized the positive results, and that considering all the results, it should be concluded that antihypertensive treatments, including those with ACEI/ARB, may not be superior to placebo (sic!) in renal patients. Rather than doing meta-analyses, larger primary studies are needed to reveal the real role of antihypertensive treatments in renal patients.",

To determine if these effects are associated with changes in the mouse intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT), renin, ACE, angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) mRNA (by quanitative RT-PCR) and protein [by Western blot (WB) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC)] were analyzed. C57BL/6J male mice (9-12 wk old) were distributed as controls (n = 10), ANG II infused (ANG II = 8, 400 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 12 days), ACEi only (ACEi = 10, lisinopril, 100 mg/l), and ANG II infused + ACEi (ANG II + ACEi = 11). When compared with controls (1.00), AGT protein (by WB) was increased by ANG II (1.29 +/- 0.13, P < 0.05), and this was not prevented by ACEi (ACEi + ANG II, 1.31 +/- 0.14, P < 0.05). ACE protein (by WB) was increased by ANG II (1.21 +/- 0.08, P < 0.05), and it was reduced by ACEi alone (0.88 +/- 0.07, P < 0.05) or in combination with ANG II (0.80 +/- 0.07, P < 0.05). AT(1)R protein (by WB) was increased by ANG II (1.27 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05) and ACEi (1.17 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05) but not ANG II + ACEi [1.15 +/- 0.06, not significant (NS)].

No significant changes were observed in AGT, ACE, or AT(1)R mRNA. In summary, reduced responses of intrarenal tubular renin, ACE, and the AT(1)R protein to the stimulatory effects of chronic ANG II infusions, in the presence of ACEi, are associated with the effects of this treatment to ameliorate augmentations in blood pressure and intrarenal ANG II content during ANG II-induced hypertension.", 
    "398": "Combination therapy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT(1) receptor blockade has been shown to provide greater renoprotection than ACE inhibitor alone in human diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that ACE-independent pathways for ANG II formation are of major significance in disease progression. Studies were performed to determine the magnitude of intrarenal ACE-independent formation of ANG II in type II diabetes. Although renal cortical ACE protein activity [2.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.1 arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) x mg(-1) x min(-1)] and intensity of immunohistochemical staining were significantly reduced and ACE2 protein activity (16.7 +/- 3.2 vs. 7.2 +/- 2.4 AFU x mg(-1) x min(-1)) and intensity elevated, kidney ANG I (113 +/- 24 vs. 110 +/- 45 fmol/g) and ANG II (1,017 +/- 165 vs. 788 +/- 99 fmol/g) levels were not different between diabetic and control mice. Afferent arteriole vasoconstriction due to conversion of ANG I to ANG II was similar in magnitude in kidneys of diabetic (-28 +/- 3% at 1 microM) and control (-23 +/- 3% at 1 microM) mice; a response completely inhibited by AT(1) receptor blockade. In control kidneys, afferent arteriole vasoconstriction produced by ANG I was significantly attenuated by ACE inhibition, but not by serine protease inhibition. In contrast, afferent arteriole vasoconstriction produced by intrarenal conversion of ANG I to ANG II was significantly attenuated by serine protease inhibition, but not by ACE inhibition in diabetic kidneys. In conclusion, there is a switch from ACE-dependent to serine protease-dependent ANG II formation in the type II diabetic kidney. Pharmacological targeting of these serine protease-dependent pathways may provide further protection from diabetic renal vascular disease.", 
    "399": "The spectrum of presentation of pediatric myocarditis ranges from minor flu-like illness with chest pain to acute cardiogenic shock in a previously healthy child. A major change in the diagnostic evaluation of myocarditis is a shift in focus away from endomyocardial biopsy and histologic confirmation toward cardiac MRI for noninvasive diagnosis and prognostication of acute myocarditis. Cardiac MRI may be particularly useful in pediatric patients, considering the risks associated with biopsy in children. Some of the MRI characteristics seen in pediatric patients with acute myocarditis also may serve as predictors of outcome. The approach to managing myocarditis varies according to the severity of presentation; it is primarily supportive while spontaneous recovery of cardiac function is awaited. For subacute heart failure, the mainstay of therapy is still supportive management with oral heart failure medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics. Acute myocarditis presenting with severe symptomatology, termed fulminant myocarditis, has a high recovery rate. Aggressive supportive care, including mechanical circulatory support, is indicated in fulminant myocarditis. With the increasing availability of and experience with paracorporeal pulsatile mechanical assist devices for children, more and more young patients are being bridged to transplantation or recovery. Despite promising results from several uncontrolled pediatric studies using immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating therapy with intravenous gamma-globulin, the translation of these results into a recommended, routine therapy for pediatric myocarditis has been complicated by the high rate of spontaneous improvement of myocarditis with supportive care and the lack of demonstrable benefit for such therapies in blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adult myocarditis. Further clinical studies are necessary to define the possible utility of immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory, and antiviral therapy.

Thus, we need to reconsider our practice in the examination of the hypertensive child and redefine the place of non-invasive methods for screening of renovascular hypertension, and specifically, to evaluate the value of captopril-enhanced renal scintigraphy at the two ends of the palette: the obese child with hypertension and the severely hypertensive prepubertal child. Renal artery stenosis in children is mainly due to fibromuscular dysplasia and stenoses associated with syndromes involving single or multiple smaller branch vessels. This explains the low specificity and sensitivity of the color-Doppler ultrasound method and captopril renal scintigraphy. Even the more sophisticated computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiographic techniques are, at present, not sensitive enough to exclude stenoses of the small branches definitely. Thus, children in whom there is a strong suggestion of renovascular hypertension should undergo angiography with a view to endovascular treatment, as non-invasive imaging has no significant benefit and might lead to a delay in treatment. In the cases when the probability of renovascular disease is moderate a basic assessment of renal function and structure is sufficient. In the neonate, catheter-associated thromboembolic disease is among the most common causes hypertension. It should be controlled medically until the patient is old enough to undergo angiography and angioplasty successfully.

Kinetic studies showed a K(m) of 30.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(-6) M for HHL and V(max) of 1.3 +/- 0.01 x 10(-6) mol/min for porcine lung ACE. This assay coupled with captopril and lisinopril showed IC(50) values of 1.1 +/- 0.05 x 10(-9) and 2.5 +/- 0.03 x 10(-9) M, respectively. A 96-well microplate format of this method was used to screen the ACE inhibitory potential of peptides fractionated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of arachin. The precision, accuracy, reproducibility, and excellent correlation demonstrated between the colorimetric and the often-used HPLC method renders this extraction-free method a powerful tool for high-throughput screening of ACE inhibitors.",

We studied the variations of those kininases in the myocardium of rats in experimental diabetes. ACE and NEP activities were significantly decreased in heart membranes 4-8weeks post-streptozotocin (STZ) injection. However, insulin-dependent diabetes did not modify significantly bradykinin (BK) half-life (t(1/2)) while the effect of both ACE (enalaprilat) and ACE and NEP (omapatrilat) inhibitors on BK degradation progressively decreased, which may be explained by the upregulation of other unidentified metallopeptidase(s). In vivo insulin treatment restored the activities of both ACE and NEP. ACE and NEP activities were significantly higher in hearts of young Zucker rats than in those of Sprague-Dawley rats. BK t(1/2) and the effects of peptidase inhibitors on t(1/2) varied accordingly. It is concluded that kininase activities are subjected to large and opposite variations in rat cardiac tissue in type I and II diabetes models. A number of tissue or molecular factors may determine these variations, such as remodeling of cardiac tissue, ectoenzyme shedding to the extracellular fluid and the pathologic regulation of peptidase gene expression.",

Comparative studies with different antihypertensive drug classes have demonstrated the good efficacy and tolerability of this compound in the management of the patient with mild-moderate hypertension. Zofenopril may also be combined with hydrochlorothiazide, a combination which has proved to be effective and safe as compared with monotherapy with either agent in three studies, including more than 600 patients. In addition, recent post hoc analyses in high-risk patients, such as those with the metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose or diabetes, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and impaired renal function, have confirmed the superiority of zofenopril 30 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once-daily combination as compared with zofenopril monotherapy also in these high-risk populations of patients with hypertension. These data suggest the usefulness of this fixed combination in the treatment of patients with hypertension requiring more prompt, intensive, and sustained blood pressure reduction, according to guidelines recommendation.", 
    "439": "It is known that various preparations of garlic and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as captopril (CAP) have beneficial effects on the left ventricular function and cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction (MI) when used individually. There is no reported interaction between garlic homogenate (GH) and CAP during and after acute MI. Thus the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the possible pharmacodynamic interaction of GH with CAP on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial damage in rat. Female Wistar albino rats were treated with GH at three different doses of 125; 250 and 500 mg/kg orally for 30 days and CAP (30 mg/kg, p.o.) was incorporated in the interactive groups during the last seven days of GH treatment. Myocardial damage was induced by administration of ISO (150 mg/kg, s.c.) for two consecutive days. Biochemical parameters were studied in serum and heart tissue homogenate of all animals. The GH 250 mg/kg was found to dislodge the effect of ISO on superoxide dismutase and catalase and retained the activities of LDH and CK-MB. Incorporation of CAP during GH treatment provided further protection to myocardium from injury. However, higher dose of GH alone or with CAP failed to prevent damaging effect of ISO. Histopathological determinations confirmed biochemical findings. Thus it is concluded that the combination needs to be used carefully when garlic is consumed at high doses.",

He re-presented at the medical emergency unit of the hospital two days later with swellings involving the lips and the lower face of 10 hours duration. There was associated difficulty in swallowing but no stridor or hoarseness of voice. He did not have skin rashes or pruritus. There was no history of previous similar episodes. Physical examination revealed a middle aged man with swollen lips and lower part of the face. The pharynx was oedematous. The respiratory and cardiovascular system examinations revealed features of hypertensive heart disease in biventricular failure. Clinical assessment of hypertensive heart disease in failure with Lisinopril induced Angioedema was made. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that this adverse drug event was probable.

    "444": "Atherosclerosis is a complex disease process in which genetic, lipid, cellular and immunological factors combine to determine the location, severity and timing of lesion development and clinical events. It has been demonstrated, however, that inflammation governs atherosclerosis during the course of development of atherosclerosis. It has also been demonstrated that regulation of the inflammatory reaction (e.g. statins) is effective in decreasing the cardiovascular events and improving the prognosis of atherosclerotic diseases. Other anti-atherosclerosis agents introduced in this study are adiponectin, testosterone, defibrase, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dextromethorphan, paeonol, 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors, curcumin, interferon-beta, quercetin, AGI-1067, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands and garlic. Some antiplatelet drugs described here are aspirin, clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. The mechanism of action of these agents is depicted. A new way of targeting anti-atherosclerosis and antiplatelet drugs to atherosclerosis areas is introduced. The author uses an antioxidized low-density lipoprotein antibody that is also conjugated to a mixture of anti-atherosclerosis agents or antiplatelet drugs to target these agents specifically to the atherosclerosis area. With this kind of targeting, we can use a much higher dose of anti-atherosclerosis agents or antiplatelet drugs and have much fewer side effects.",

The combination of any 4 classes of drug were used in 65% of patients. Almost all patients who did not receive aspirin or a statin had clinical contraindications and were on alternative drugs. In about 12% of patients without an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and 7% of patients without a beta blocker, no reason to withhold such treatment was identified. Branded drugs were used in 52% of patients; the most commonly prescribed being atorvastatin in 33%. Clinical reasons for using branded rather than generic drugs were identified in 13% of cases.",

    "452": "Baseline endothelium-dependent and non-endothelium-dependent vasodilations (EDVD and NEDVD) in cardiovascular patients were lower than in the controls while Ve and Ee were higher. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse blood pressure (PBP), stress SBP and EDVD correlated. The treatment led to reduction of mean circadian, diurnal and nocturnal SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), PBP, Ve and Ee, to elevation of EDVD.",

Sixty outpatients with grade II-III AH (mean age 55.3 +/- 9.6 yr) were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 30) comprised patients with AH and DM2, group 2 (n = 30) included patients with AH alone. Combined therapy with daily doses of 23.3 +/- 9.8 g accupro and 1.5 mg indapamide reduced systolic and diastolic AP by 30.2 and 27.3% respectively in group 1 and by 27.6 and 27.1% in group 2. In patients with AH and DM2, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels decreased by 7.3 and 5.2% and HbA1c by 8.9% (p < 0.05). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol tended to decrease in both groups. HDL cholesterol significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 11.1% in group 1 and 10% in group 2 Side effects were documented only in 8.3% of the patients and did not require withdrawal of therapy. It is concluded that antihypertensive treatment with quinapril (accupro), an ACE inhibitor, and diuretic indapamide SR may be recommended for long-term therapy of AH concomitant with DM2.", 
    "455": "In patients with heart failure (HF), assessment of functional capacity plays an important prognostic role. Both 6-minute walk and cardiopulmonary exercise testing have been used to determine physical function and to determine prognosis and even listing for transplantation. However, as in HF trials, the number of women reported has been small, and the cutoffs for transplantation have been representative of male populations and extrapolated to women. It is also well known that peak VO(2) as a determinant of fitness is inherently lower in women than in men and potentially much lower in the presence of HF. Values for a female population from which to draw for this important determination are lacking.",

To characterize differences between men and women in the interpretation of final cardiopulmonary exercise testing models, the interaction of individual covariates with sex was investigated in the models of (1) VE/VCO(2), (2) VO(2) at ventilatory threshold (VT), (3) distance on the 6-minute walk, and (4) peak VO(2).", 
    "457": "The women were younger than the men and more likely to have a nonischemic etiology and a higher ejection fraction. Dose of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) was lower in the women, on average. The lower ACEI dose may reflect the higher use of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in women. Both the peak VO(2) and the 6-minute walk distance were significantly lower in the women than in the men. Perhaps the most significant finding in this dataset of baseline characteristics is that the peak VO(2) for women was significantly lower than that for men with similar ventricular function and health status.", 
    "458": "Therefore, in a well-medicated, stable, class II-IV HF cohort of patients who are able to exercise, women have statistically significantly lower peak VO(2) and 6-minute walk distance than men with similar health status and ventricular function. These data should prompt careful thought when considering prognostic markers for women and listing for cardiac transplant.",

These patients were also far more likely either to die in hospital or to have a length of stay >10 days (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 7.57; P=0.005). Additional risk factors for developing vasoplegia that were identified included the additive euroSCORE, procedure type, prebypass mean arterial pressure, length of bypass, administration of pre-CPB vasopressors, core temperature on CPB, pre- and post-CPB hematocrit, the preoperative use of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the intraoperative use of aprotinin.",

In the present study, casein hydrolysate containing the lactotripeptides, Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), which has been found to have an antihypertensive effect in a number of clinical studies, was investigated for its ability to improve hemodynamic parameters, including central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), in hypertensive subjects. Twelve hypertensive subjects who were not on prescribed medication were monitored for various hemodynamic parameters, including brachial blood pressure (peripheral blood pressure), cSBP, and augmentation index (AI), at the start and then after 3, 6, and 9 weeks of a daily treatment comprising four tablets containing VPP and IPP. Compared with basal levels, treatment with casein hydrolysate for 6 and/or 9 weeks showed a significant reduction in peripheral systolic and diastolic blood pressure, AI, and cSBP, but not in heart rate or pulse pressure. cSBP showed a reduction sooner and greater (-21.8 mm Hg) than did brachial systolic blood pressure (-16.4 mm Hg) during the 9-week treatment.

Plasma samples were collected up to 168 h post-dosing for the determination of ramipril and its active metabolite, ramiprilat, by LC-MS/MS. The evaluation of bioequivalence was based on the following pharmacokinetic parameters that were calculated by standard non-compartmental methods: the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUCt) and that extrapolated to infinity (AUC) and the maximum observed concentration (Cmax). The 90% confidence interval of the ratios (test/reference) (obtained by analysis of variance, ANOVA) were 0.83-1.20 for Cmax of ramipril, 0.90-1.10 for Cmax of ramiprilat, 0.95-1.23 for AUC(0-48) of ramipril, 0.97-1.11 for AUC(0-168) of ramiprilat, 0.96-1.23 for AUC of ramipril and 0.98-1.15 for AUC of ramiprilat, i.e. within the predefined acceptable range for the conclusion of bioequivalence.

    "507": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the prevention and correction of cardiovascular diseases. Agents that block the RAS such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are major in this league. There have been numerous clinical trials looking at the use of ACEIs and ARBs in hypertension, heart failure (HF), and other special population who remain at high risk for cardiovascular and cardiometabolic abnormalities. Overall, ACEIs are the first line agents, recommended for high cardiovascular risk patients and are supported suitably by worldwide therapeutic guidelines including class IA recommendation from American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association. These recommendations are based on, large body of clinical results which overall supports ACEIs in reducing mortality, MI, stroke, and new-onset congestive heart failure, and their unique cardioprotective benefits in patients with diabetes, independent of coexistent atherosclerosis and concomitant nephropathy. Although, theoretically, ARBs offer improved blockade of the RAS system than ACEIs, their relative effectiveness in the treatment of HF and other comorbid cardiovascular conditions remains controversial as evident from clinical trial and meta-analysis results which shows that ARBs are not as effective in reducing mortality, rate of hospitalisation, prevention of nephropathic progression, etc. The results from the latest ONTARGET 'non-inferiority' trial has further elucidated the fact that ARBs are no better than ACEIs at reducing fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events including MI and CV death. Although theoretically, combination of ACEIs and ARBs is an attractive therapeutic option as none of them block RAS completely, but it may also open the gate for supplementary collection of adverse events as has been evidenced in recent trials. Although, there are no data at present to precisely suggest the efficacy differences between all available ACEIs, there are trials which support that ramipril, a long acting ACEI with good tissue penetration, potent long-lasting inhibition of ACE may not be applicable to other available ACEIs. Ramipril also specifically reduces major adverse coronary and cerebrovascular events in post MI patients when compared to other ACEIs or placebo. When clinicians are faced with the choice of using either an ACEI or an ARB in high-risk patients, they should be mindful of the unique differences between each class of medication, particularly with respect to MI and CV death, and also the range of indications, cost and individual convenience.",

The control group was given tap water for 4 weeks, while the experimental groups were given water containing SP (1 g/kg/d) or an ACE inhibitor, captopril (8 mg/kg/d). Treatment with SP and captopril decreased ACE activity in the kidney, aorta, and mesentery. There were no differences in fasting blood glucose levels among the three groups, whereas SP and captopril administration significantly suppressed the increase in blood glucose after glucose loading in the control SHRSPs.

In a rat model of myocardial infarction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy was only partially able to protect cardiac mitochondrial function and transcription cascade. Expression of proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha and its transcription cascade were evaluated after a 48-hour exposure of cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes to endothelin-1, angiotensin II, aldosterone, phenylephrine, or isoprenaline. Endothelin-1 (-30%) and, to a lesser degree, angiotensin II (-20%) decreased proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha mRNA content, whereas other hormones had no effect (phenylephrine) or even increased it (aldosterone, isoprenaline).",

Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding their external validity. For the present study we evaluated the MITRA Plus registry and included 20,175 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We defined RCT-ineligible patients as patients fulfilling >or=1 of the following criteria: age >or=75 years, prehospital delay >12 hours, prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock, impaired renal function, and previous stroke. Those patients (n = 9,369, 46.4%) were compared to patients eligible for enrollment in RCTs (n = 11,806, 53.6%). Ineligible patients were older (p <0.0001), more often were women (p <0.0001), and more often had concomitant diseases (p <0.0001). Ineligible patients less often received early reperfusion therapy (p <0.0001), aspirin (p <0.0001), clopidogrel (p <0.0001), and statins (p <0.0001). Ineligible patients had a higher hospital mortality (20.1% vs 4.9%; p <0.0001) and a higher rate of nonfatal strokes (1.5% vs 0.4%, p <0.0001) compared to eligible patients. Early reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis and/or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) in ineligible patients was associated with a significant decrease of hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.79), with primary PCI being more effective than thrombolytic therapy (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.65). In conclusion, about 50% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction seen in clinical practice are usually excluded from RCTs. Hospital mortality in those patients is very high. Primary PCI improves the prognosis and is therefore the preferred reperfusion strategy in these patients.",

We defined high risk as the onset of Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III angina within 2 months or stabilized acute coronary syndrome within 2 weeks of enrollment. The primary end point was death or myocardial infarction after 4.6 years. Of the 2,287 patients enrolled in the COURAGE trial, 264 (12%) were high risk and had a relative risk of 1.56 for death or myocardial infarction (p = 0.0008) compared to those with non-high-risk features. A total of 35 primary events occurred in the OMT group and 32 in the percutaneous coronary intervention plus OMT group (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.79; p = 0.68). No significant difference was found in the prevalence of angina between the 2 groups at 1 year. During the first year of follow-up, 30% of the OMT patients crossed over to the revascularization group. In conclusion, an initial strategy of OMT alone for high-risk patients in the COURAGE trial did not result in increased death or myocardial infarction at 4.6 years or worse angina at 1 year, but it was associated with a high rate of crossover to revascularization.", 
    "534": "Large clinical trials demonstrate that control of blood pressure or hyperlipidemia reduces risk for cardiovascular events by approximately 30%. Factors that may further reduce remaining risk are not definitively established. One potential target is atherosclerosis, a crucial feature in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases whose development is determined by multiple mechanism including complex interactions between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance as well as cross-talk between hyperlipidemia and the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may contribute to development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, one appealing strategy for prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis may be to simultaneously address several risk factors with combination therapies that target multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Combination therapy with statins, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor agonists, and rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers demonstrate additive beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance when compared with monotherapies in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Additive beneficial effects of combined therapy are mediated by both distinct and interrelated mechanisms, consistent with both pre-clinical and clinical investigations. Thus, combination therapy may be an important concept in developing more effective strategies to treat and prevent atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and co-morbid metabolic disorders characterized by endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.",

Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 2.1 mm Hg higher in women (150.6+/-0.35 mm Hg, n=8357/18 017) than in men (148.5+/-0.35 mm Hg; P<0.0001, n=9526/18 017), whereas no difference in diastolic BP was seen (88.2+/-0.20 vs 88+/-0.20 mm Hg; P=0.198). Gender differences in SBP were more pronounced in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients (3.5 vs 1.7 mm Hg, n=4272 vs n=13 611; P<0.0001) and became evident at an age 55 years old. Overall BP-control rate was 33.6% in men and 30.6% in women (P<0.0001) and was lower in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients. In all, 30% of patients used one, 40% used two and 30% used > or = 3 drugs without gender differences. Response rates to different drug regimens appeared to be similar. However, women received more frequently thiazides and beta-blockers, and less frequently ACE-inhibitors as monotherapy. Major efforts are required to improve BP-management, especially in women.", 
    "536": "Hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In addition to lowering blood pressure, the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers) may further reduce cardiovascular risk by improving endothelial function when used alone or in combination. In fact, the beneficial effects of the combination of amlodipine and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker on endothelial function have been found to be greater than the effect of either drug alone, likely due to additive effects on nitric oxide activity. This review summarizes the observed effects of these agents on endothelial function and the complementary mechanisms by which they act, thus providing rationale (beyond blood pressure benefits) for their use in combination.", 
    "537": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important regulator of blood pressure. Observational and experimental studies suggest that alterations in blood pressure and components of the brain RAS contribute to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in changes that can lead or contribute to cognitive decline. The complexity of the RAS and diversity of its interactions with neurological processes have recently become apparent but large gaps in our understanding still remain. Modulation of activity of components of the brain RAS offers substantial opportunities for the treatment and prevention of dementia, including AD. This paper reviews molecular, genetic, experimental and clinical data as well as the therapeutic opportunities that relate to the involvement of the RAS in AD.", 
    "538": "Sensitivity enhancement via summation of multiple MRM transition pairs is gaining popularity in tandem mass spectrometric assays. Numerous validation experiments describing the assays for two model substrates, clopidogrel and ramiprilat, were performed. The quantitation of clopidogrel was achieved by the summation of transition pairs m/z 322.2 to m/z 212.0 and m/z 322.2 to m/z 184.0, while that of ramiprilat was achieved by the summation of transition pairs m/z 389.2 to m/z 206.1 and m/z 389.2 to m/z156.1. The use of summation approach achieved sensitivities of >2 fold for both compounds as compared with the reported single MRM transition pair assays. The validation experiments addressed some important assay development issues, such as: (a) lack of impact of matrix effect; (b) unequivocal verification of the percentage contribution of each MRM transition pair towards sensitivity; (c) sensitivity enhancement factor achieved by summation approach of MRM transition pairs; and (d) accurate prediction of quality control samples using summation approach vs a single MRM transition pair. In summary, the appropriateness of using two MRM transition pairs for quantitation was demonstrated for both clopidogrel and ramiprilat. Additionally, pharmacokinetic application of the MRM transition pair assays using a summation approach was established for the two compounds.",

    "544": "1. The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is likely to balance the status of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by degrading angiotensin (Ang) II and generating Ang-(1-7). Earlier demonstrations that ACE2 is insensitive to ACE inhibitors prompted us to evaluate the effect of ACE inhibitors on ACE2 expression. 2. Liver fibrosis was induced in rats with 40% CCl(4) (2.5 mL/kg, s.c., twice per week). Half the rats were further treated with perindopril (2 mg/kg, p.o., daily). After 2 and 4 weeks treatment, ACE2 immunoreactivity was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, ACE2 protein expression was determined by western blot and mRNA expression of ACE2 and the Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 3. As an in vitro study, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were treated with AngII (0.1-10 micromol/L) alone or in combination with the synthesized peptide ACEI (Sigma-Aldrich). Western blot and RT-PCR were used to evaluate ACE2 expression and Mas mRNA levels. Furthermore, after treatment of HSC with the Mas antagonist A779 (1 micromol/L), the protein expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was detected to evaluate the interaction between AngII, ACEI and the ACE2-Mas axis. 4. Expression of both ACE2 mRNA and protein and Mas mRNA was markedly upregulated in both CCl(4)-injured rat liver and AngII-treated HSC. Further significant upregulation was observed following additional administration of ACEI. In addition, ACEI treatment of HSC inhibited AngII-induced overexpression of connective tissue growth factor and this effect was ameliorated by blockade of the Mas receptor with A779. 5. The findings of the present study suggest that ACE inhibitors are able to upregulate ACE2 under conditions of liver injury both in vivo and in vitro, which may indicate potential benefits of ACE inhibitors in the therapeutic treatment of liver fibrosis.", 
    "545": "Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte abnormality that can lead to severe consequences. Paralysis induced by hyperkalemia has been described in only a few reports. We describe a 60-year-old man who experienced paralysis presumably due to hyperkalemia. He presented to the emergency department with severe weakness in all extremities. The patient's serum potassium concentration was greater than 8 mEq/L and his serum creatinine concentration was 7 mg/dl. Findings on electrocardiography were abnormal. Of note, his drug therapy included lisinopril and naproxen. After treatment for hyperkalemia, the patient's symptoms resolved; however, he was admitted for further workup for renal failure. The patient was discharged after approximately 1 week with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 5) between the patient's paralysis and hyperkalemia. Although hyperkalemia as a cause of paralysis is extremely rare, clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening, noncardiac toxicity.",

The results of the placebo-controlled ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN MR Controlled Evaluation) trial, conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes, are exemplary in this respect. The systematic use of a fixed-dose combination containing the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide afforded substantial protection against cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction, while providing important renoprotection, reducing the development of micro- and macroalbuminuria, and allowing regression of nephropathy. The beneficial effects were obtained regardless of baseline BP and whether or not the patients were receiving antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "547": "Non-immunological factors in the progression of kidney disease in transplant patients are the following: high blood pressure, proteinuria, dislypidemia, etc. 1. Arterial hypertension treatment: Blood pressure must be measured periodically in all transplant patients. Similarly to native kidneys, in renal transplant patients arterial hypertension is a risk factor in the progression of kidney disease. Arterial hypertension represent a clinical marker of chronic allograft nephropathy and contributes to graft loss and to the morbid- mortality of these patients (Evidence level C). Blood pressure control should be < 130/80 mm Hg for renal transplant patients without proteinuria and 125/75 mm Hg for proteinuric patients (> 1 g/24 hours). Hypertension and proteinuria are frequently associated in the same patients, a global treatment of both seems more rational (Evidence level C). General measures should be instigated first with pharmacological therapy. All antihypertensive drugs are useful in renal transplant patients and the majority of patients will need two or more drugs. In proteinuric patients an angiotensin receptor antagonist or an ACE-inhibitor should be initiated. It is advisable to monitor the serum potassium and creatinine after the start of this drugs or during the treatment periodically, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV-V. 2. Proteinuria treatment: Proteinuria has been strongly correlated with reduced function and graft survival. Lowering proteinuria to values as near to normal as possible (< 0.5 g/24 hours). To reduce proteinuria, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an ACE-inhibitor or a combination of both are required, with serum potassium or creatinine monitoring, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV-V. 3. Dyslipidemia treatment: For kidney transplant recipients the assessment of dyslipidemias should include a complete fasting lipid profile with total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Evidence from the general population indicates that treatment of dyslipidemias reduces cardiovascular disease and evidence in kidney transplant patients suggests that judicious treatment can be safe and effective in improving dyslipidemia. Therapeutic goal must be LDL < 100 mg/dl. (Evidence level C). 4. Others: Cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance or diabetes control and obesity should be assessed.",

Plasma adiponectin and insulin concentrations were measured before and after treatment. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis assessment index (HOMA-IR). Treatment with preterax (P=0.003) and cilazapril (P=0.031) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (BP), but only preterax reduced diastolic BP (P=0.024). Cilazapril treatment significantly increased the plasma adiponectin concentration (P=0.025) and reduced plasma triglycerides (P=0.041), whereas preterax treatment increased the plasma insulin concentration (P=0.041) and tended to increase HOMA-IR.",

    "555": "Results from the ONTARGET trial remind us that acute haemodynamically mediated renal dysfunction, triggered by low arterial pressure or volume depletion, can occur in high-risk cardiovascular patients (who usually have some degree of diseased intrarenal vessels) treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (especially in combination). However, nephroprotection could not be properly assessed in the trial, as the population was at low renal risk. Although albuminuria remains a useful marker in many patients, it can neither predict acute renal dysfunction nor replace end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as the endpoint in clinical trials. Recent trials using surrogate endpoints suggest that some RAS blockers (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, the renin inhibitor aliskiren) may be more nephroprotective than others, but proving this requires comparing them (alone or in combination) in populations with identified renal disease (mainly diabetic nephropathy) and the use of hard endpoints. RAS-blocker dosages are critical: as some patients need much larger doses to decrease proteinuria than do others, the efficacy of a high-dose RAS blocker needs to be assessed in patients with persistent proteinuria. In patients with massive proteinuria despite maximum RAS-blocker dosages, combination RAS blockade should be considered by nephrologists, but will require close monitoring of renal function; also, the treatment needs to be withdrawn (at least temporarily) as soon as volume depletion or excessively low arterial pressure arises. In recent trials, lowering blood pressure towards values recommended by the current guidelines (130/80mmHg) has reduced microvascular (lower levels of urinary albumin excretion) and macrovascular events in diabetic patients.", 
    "556": "Target blood pressure levels are not being achieved with the current hypertension treatment. Monotherapy that normalizes BP in about 20% of patients does not provide sufficient control to reach this goal and thus combination therapy is required. Results from recent clinical studies showed that a combination of an angiotenzin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) provide better results and reduced incidence of cardiovascular events than a combination of a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor. Combination therapy based on rennin-angiotenzin system blockade: ACEi with a CCB, ACEi with a diuretic or angiotenzin receptor blocker (AT1) with a diuretic as a first-line treatment of the stage 2 hypertension might lead to significantly better control of blood pressure than monotherapy.",

Anesthetized dogs (n = 90) underwent CAO, followed by three-dimensional activation mapping of inducible VT. Dogs without VT in 1-3 h after CAO received AGII, and those with VT received either PD or losartan. Focal endocardium excised from ischemic sites was studied in vitro with standard microelectrode. Of 33 dogs with no inducible VT, AGII infusion resulted in sustained VT of only focal Purkinje origin in 13 (39%) compared with 0 of 20 dogs with saline. Of 26 dogs with inducible VT at baseline, given PD, reinduction was blocked in 8 of 10 (P < 0.05) focal VT, but only 1 of 15 with reentry. In contrast, of 11 dogs given losartan, reinduction of either mechanism was not blocked. In vitro triggered activity in Purkinje was blocked by PD in 13 of 19 (P < 0.05), but not by losartan in 8. Also, triggered activity was promoted by AGII, losartan, or the combination in 9 of 12 tissues. AGII promotes only focal, mainly Purkinje ischemic VT. PD, but not losartan, preferentially blocked focal VT, which is likely due to triggered activity due to delayed afterdepolarizations in Purkinje.", 
    "567": "A new method development and validation approach is proposed in order to develop a reliable method for the simultaneous quantitation of ramipril and ramiprilat in the presence of numerous labile metabolites. This new approach involves the usage of a synthesized labile acyl glucuronide of ramipril as well as individual and pooled incurred (study) samples in the development and validation process. Following the method validation and prior to its application to a large clinical study, a mini pilot study was performed to evaluate the performance of the method. When the samples from the mini pilot study were analyzed by two different scientists, 100% of the results from incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) matched within 8% of difference and the mean differences were 0.21% and 1.40% for ramipril and ramiprilat, respectively. The validated concentration range reported in this article is 0.2-80 ng/mL for both analytes. Various stabilities, such as bench-top, autosampler, freeze/thaw, and long-term, were also successfully evaluated.

As life expectancy has increased the occurrence of dementia has also increased. Hypertension during middle adulthood is correlated with a significantly elevated risk of cognitive impairment later in life. Treatment with antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), has been reported to reduce the likelihood and slow the progression of AD; however, the use of ACE inhibitors may be accompanied by an increase in amyloid beta protein(1-42) accumulation. This review summarizes available information regarding the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and specifically the efficacy of ACE inhibitors as anti-dementia agents, and considers the recently discovered AT(4) receptor and associated agonist drugs as potential new therapeutic targets to treat memory impairments associated with AD. We conclude with a description of recent efforts by members of our laboratory to develop blood-brain barrier penetrant angiotensin IV analogue drugs that facilitate cognition in animal models of AD.

We report the synthesis of captopril-cobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B(12) in which captopril is bound via its thiol group at the beta-axial site of cobalamin. Characterization of captopril-cobalamin by (1)H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction shows that captopril-cobalamin exists in both solution and the solid state as a mixture of geometric isomers. Kinetic studies on the formation of captopril-cobalamin have been carried out, and the data fits a model in which the thiol form (RSH, k(1) = 40.9 +/- 1.2 M(-1) s(-1)) and the thiolate form of captopril (RS(-), k(2) = 660 +/- 170 M(-1) s(-1)) react rapidly with aquacobalamin.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which are known to favor bradykinin (BK) bioactivity by reducing its metabolism, may have a positive impact on preventing the microvascular structural rarefaction that occurs in these diseases. Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that BK, via B2 receptors (B2R), protects the viability of the microvascular endothelium exposed to the necrotic and apoptotic cell death inducers H(2)O(2) and LPS independently of hemodynamics. Expression (RT-PCR and radioligand binding) and functional (calcium mobilization with fura-2AM, and p42/p44MAPK and Akt phosphorylation assays) experiments revealed the presence of functional B2R in pig cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (pCMVEC). In vitro results showed that the cytocidal effects of H(2)O(2) and LPS on pCMVEC were significantly decreased by a BK pretreatment (MTT and crystal violet tests, annexin-V staining/FACS analysis), which was countered by the B2R antagonist HOE 140. BK treatment coincided with enhanced expression of the cytoprotective proteins COX-2, Bcl-2, and (Cu/Zn)SOD. Ex vivo assays on rat brain explants showed that BK impeded (by approximately 40%) H(2)O(2)-induced microvascular degeneration (lectin-FITC staining). The present study proposes a novel role for BK in microvascular endothelial protection, which may be pertinent to the complex mechanism of action of ACEi explaining their long-term beneficial effects in maintaining vascular integrity.",

There is also a consensus that long-lasting oral treatments such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers should be administered to patients unless they are hemodynamically unstable. The diagnosis of AHF is based on clinical signs. However, electrocardiography and chest X-ray should be performed in all AHF patients. Natriuretic peptides should be measured in doubtful cases to either confirm or exclude the diagnosis of AHF. Echocardiography should be promptly performed by cardiologists.

Simultaneously, we continue to experience an increasing epidemic of acute renal failure (ARF) both in community-based and in hospital-based studies. Even though other factors would be contributing to this ARF epidemic, recent published data have raised concerns of a plausible connection between increased use of the RAAS blocking agents and this ARF epidemic. In our 4-nephrologist northwestern practice, we have, in recent years, anecdotally encountered an increasing number and severity of ARF, often with hyperkalemia, sometimes requiring dialysis intervention, in patients concurrently on these agents. Over the 3-day Christmas weekend in 2007, we treated 3 cases of severe ARF (peak serum creatinine of 7.0 (3.3-9.2) mg/dL), all on RAAS blockade. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade was promptly discontinued. All patients received intravenous fluid repletion. Kidney function rapidly normalized in 2 within 1 week. One patient required hemodialysis for 14 days before his serum creatinine returned to normal after 5 weeks. All 3 patients have continued to maintain baseline serum creatinine several months later, still off RAAS blockade. The mean baseline eGFR for the 3 patients was 46 (41-51) mL/min/1.73 m(2) body surface area. This phenomenon of ARF exacerbation, which may have implications for chronic kidney disease progression to ESRD especially in the elderly, merits further study. We support the recommendation that (older, >65 years old) chronic kidney disease patients on RAAS blocking agents should have the medications temporarily suspended during any acute illness, before major surgical procedures, and before iodinated contrast or oral phosphate sodium administration.", 
    "590": "IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common lesion causing primary glomerulonephritis in the world. The main clinical predictors of progression are: elevated blood pressure, high histological score and proteinuria. Although elevated serum creatinine concentration at diagnosis, increased excretion of cytochines, age at onset, obesity and genetic factors may all influence clinical outcome, it is quite clear that proteinuria is the hallmark of renal damage in IgAN. Patients with IgAN and little or no proteinuria (<500 mg/day) have low risk of progression in the short term, while the rate of decline in renal function is 25-fold faster in those with sustained proteinuria >3 g/day. The product of duration (years) and urinary protein excretion (g/day) at the time of renal biopsy is more significantly correlated with progression. So, this so called proteinuria index may be a useful predictor for glomerular and interstitial histopathological changes and the fate of renal function in IgAN. The progression of IgAN may be slowed by antihypertensive and antiproteinuric therapy, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, that can minimize secondary glomerular injury. Proteinuria has been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor in IgAN, with a strong relationship between proteinuria and prognosis and established importance of remission. Consequently, targeting proteinuria may be a valid surrogate for individualized kidney protective therapy.", 
    "591": "Amyloid beta-protein 1-42 (Abeta42) is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD), although it is a minor part of Abeta. In contrast, Abeta40 is the predominant secreted form of Abeta and recent studies have suggested that Abeta40 has neuroprotective effects and inhibits amyloid deposition. We have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Abeta42 to Abeta40, and its inhibition enhances brain Abeta42 deposition (Zou, K., Yamaguchi, H., Akatsu, H., Sakamoto, T., Ko, M., Mizoguchi, K., Gong, J. S., Yu, W., Yamamoto, T., Kosaka, K., Yanagisawa, K., and Michikawa, M. (2007) J. Neurosci. 27, 8628-8635). ACE has two homologous domains, each having a functional active site. In the present study, we identified the domain of ACE, which is responsible for converting Abeta42 to Abeta40. Interestingly, Abeta42-to-Abeta40-converting activity is solely found in the N-domain of ACE and the angiotensin-converting activity is found predominantly in the C-domain of ACE. We also found that the N-linked glycosylation is essential for both Abeta42-to-Abeta40- and angiotensin-converting activities and that unglycosylated ACE rapidly degraded. The domain-specific converting activity of ACE suggests that ACE inhibitors could be designed to specifically target the angiotensin-converting C-domain, without inhibiting the Abeta42-to-Abeta40-converting activity of ACE or increasing neurotoxic Abeta42.",

A kinetic analysis shown that tiliroside was a competitive inhibitor for monophenolase and diphenolase with K(i) values of 0.052 mM and 0.26 mM, respectively. Furthermore, tiliroside showed 34.5% (p < 0.05) inhibition of intracellular tyrosinase activity and 54.1% (p < 0.05) inhibition of melanin production with low cytotoxicity on B16 mouse melanoma cells at 0.168 mM. In contrast, arbutin displayed 9.1% inhibition of cellular tyrosinase activity and 29.5% inhibition of melanin production at the same concentration.

    "593": "Blood pressure-lowering therapy reduces left ventricular mass, but the question of whether differences exist among drug classes has not been fully resolved. Our aim was to compare the effects of diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers on left ventricular mass regression in patients with hypertension on the basis of prospective, randomized comparative studies. We performed meta-analyses, involving pooled pairwise comparisons of the drug classes and of each class versus other classes statistically combined, and meta-regression analyses to identify the determinants of the regression. The 75 relevant publications involved 84 pairwise comparisons and 6001 patients. Regression of left ventricular mass was significantly less (P=0.01) with beta-blockers (9.8%) than with angiotensin receptor blockers (12.5%), but none of the other analyzable pairwise comparisons between drug classes revealed significant differences (P>0.10). In addition, beta-blockers showed less regression than the other 4 classes statistically combined (P<0.01), and regression was more pronounced with angiotensin receptor blockers versus the others (P<0.01). In multivariable meta-regression analysis on all of the treatment arms, beta-blocker treatment was a significant and negative predictor of the regression (-3.6%; P<0.01), but this was not the case for the other drug classes, including angiotensin receptor blockers. In conclusion, beta-blockers show less regression of left ventricular mass, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers may induce larger regression. The inferiority of beta-blockers appears to be more convincing than the superiority of angiotensin receptor blockers.",

Analysis of short-term (5 min) heart rate variability (HRV) provides a non-invasive probe of autonomic regulation of sino-atrial (SA) node automaticity. 2. We hypothesized that antihypertensive drug therapy would be associated with an increase in 5 min overall HRV, along with a decrease in blood pressure (BP), at 8 weeks follow up in subjects with newly diagnosed, never-treated essential hypertension. 3. One hundred and fifty patients (84 men and 66 women; mean (+/-SD) age 48 +/- 10 years) with newly diagnosed essential hypertension were divided to five groups of 30 patients each to receive one of the following antihypertensive drugs (or drug combinations): 5 mg/day amlodipine; 50 mg/day atenolol; 5 mg/day enalapril; 25 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide; or a combination of 5 mg/day amlodipine and 50 mg/day atenolol. 4. The only significant change in HRV indices was an increase in total variability of RR intervals and an increase in high-frequency (HF) RR interval spectral power in the amlodipine + atenolol-treated group (P < 0.05). 5. The results indicate that there is a dissociation between changes in short-term HRV and mean RR interval and BP lowering in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. 6. We interpret the increase in HF RR interval spectral power in the amlodipine + atenolol-treated group as being due to an increase in vagal modulation of RR intervals and/or diminution in sympathetic restraint of respiratory sinus arrhythmia.", 
    "598": "Our review of cohort studies and clinical trials evaluating antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of cognition decline and all dementia in patients with hypertension indicates that two antihypertensive drug classes have greater protective effects, independent of blood pressure decrease: dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers as shown in the Syst-Eur trial and angiotensin-AT1 receptor blockers as found in the MOSES and ONTARGET trials. By contrast, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs) prevent dementia only in patients with a stroke history, provided they are combined, and prevent stroke recurrence. A Japanese cohort study and a small trial in patients already suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest, however, that the BBB-penetrating ACEI may slow down cognitive decline. Only cohort studies support the hypothesis that diuretics, (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), may decrease the risk of AD. beta-blockers worsen cognition decline, or are neutral, according to whether or not they cross the BBB. Centrally-acting sympatholytic agent have a negative impact on cognition as BBB-penetrating beta-blockers, probably by blunting the adrenergic pathways. The AD protective effect of DHP appears related to the blockade of neuronal calcium channels. The ambiguous effect of ACEI on cognitive decline and dementia prevention may be explained by the fact that brain ACE is not specific for angiotensin-I. Brain ACE also catabolizes cognition-enhancing brain peptides, amyloid peptides and converts toxic Abeta(42) into less toxic Abeta(40). Therefore, ACEIs may have short-term cognition-enhancing properties and may increase in the long term Abeta(42) brain burden and cognitive decline. The clinical relevance of this scenario, mainly observed in animals, cannot be excluded in man, since the ACE gene has been associated with AD via the human whole genome analysis. To support the hypothesized deleterious effect of ACEI on human AD, confirmation that the ACE gene polymorphism DD is associated with protection against AD is necessary, since this polymorphism increases ACE activity. Independently of their preventive impact on beta-amyloid degenerative neuropathological process by overexpressing insulin degrading enzyme which catabolyses amyloid, the angiotensin AT1-receptor-blockers may have greater cognition protective effects than ACEI (observed in the ONTARGET trial), as they share with ACEI cognition-enhancing effects directly linked with a common AT1-blunting effect. In addition, they increase angiotensin II and IV formation and therefore stimulate non-opposed AT2 and AT4 receptors, whose activation in cognitive processes is well established.", 
    "599": "First, an update of the vascular systemic and tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is provided to explain how it is regulated at the systemic and tissue levels, and how many angiotensin peptides and receptors can be modulated by the various antihypertensive drugs. Second, experimental data is presented to support the hypothesis that antihypertensive drugs that increase angiotensin II formation, such as diuretics, AT1-receptor blockers and dihydropyridines, may have greater brain anti-ischemic effects than antihypertensive drugs that decrease angiotensin II formation, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, because they increase activation of angiotensin AT2 and AT4 receptors. Indeed, these trigger brain anti-ischemic mechanisms by favouring cerebral blood flow (angiogenesis and recruitment of pre-existing collateral circulation, specifically in the ischemic brain where AT2 receptors are overexpressed) or by directly increasing neuronal resistance to anoxia. Third, we review most of the large primary and secondary stroke prevention trials as well as the ACCESS acute stroke trial in which antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. With the exception of the secondary stroke prevention trial PRoFESS, most trials support the hypothesis that angiotensin II-increasing drugs confer specific blood pressure-independent brain ischemia protection when compared with angiotensin II-decreasing drugs or placebo. A careful analysis of the PRoFESS trial, however, reveals study design limitations, the main one being that diastolic BP (<80 mmHg) in the first month post-stroke may have been too low in at least one third of the population with baseline systolic blood pressure less than 130 mmHg, because a high dose of telmisartan was given after a very short post-stroke delay (median 15 days) without discontinuation of the baseline antihypertensive treatment.",

    "601": "The effects of enalapril and sodium depletion on renin synthesis and secretion were studied in mice with a left hydronephrotic kidney caused by unilateral ureteral ligation (UUL). In the control animals, there was no difference in plasma renin concentration between the right and left renal veins. In mice with left ureteral ligation, the renin concentration in the vein draining the hydronephrotic kidney was similar to or lower than that in the aorta under control conditions and after either stimulation with enalapril or depletion of sodium. Enalapril and sodium restriction increased plasma renin concentration, and this increase was due to secretion from the nonhydronephrotic kidney. The renin concentration per gram of kidney tissue and the mRNA for renin per gram of kidney tissue were similar in both the control and hydronephrotic kidney, and the values rose 3-4-fold in both kidneys after enalapril or sodium depletion. Immunostaining for renin confirmed these findings and indicated that renin per glomerulus was higher in the hydronephrotic kidney. Thus, removal or reduction of angiotensin II activity or depletion of sodium stimulated synthetic activity to a similar extent in the normal and hydronephrotic kidneys; however, secretion from the kidney without a macula densa (hydronephrotic) was not increased. Thus, the signals that control synthesis and secretion are different, and for these stimuli, secretion appears to require an intact macula densa.",

    "606": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are important mediators of kidney injury in diabetes. VEGF expression is increased in proximal tubules of mice with type 1 diabetes. In mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells (MCT) cultured with 30 mM glucose (HG) for 24h, VEGF expression is increased at the protein and the mRNA level, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism. HG stimulation of VEGF synthesis is prevented by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and, by losartan, a specific antagonist of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1), suggesting that VEGF synthesis is mediated by Ang II. Synthesis of angiotensinogen (AGT), a precursor of angiotensin II, is increased in MCTs cultured in HG. Although synthesis of renin and ACE is not affected by HG, their activity is increased in the conditioned medium. Concentrations of Ang I and Ang II are also increased in conditioned medium from HG-treated MCTs and captopril prevents increased Ang II, but not Ang I, synthesis. Finally, AT1 is activated in MCTs treated with HG, and its activation is prevented by captopril and losartan. The ERK pathway is activated by HG within minutes of stimulation and lasting for up to 24h. The initial phase of ERK activation is due to HG itself and leads to AGT upregulation and the sustained phase is mediated for the most part by Ang II-activated AT1 receptor and leads to increased VEGF synthesis. These data show that: (1) HG increases AGT synthesis and activation of renin and ACE by MCTs, leading to local production of Ang I and Ang II. (2) Ang II activates endogenous AT1 and stimulates synthesis of VEGF. (3) HG activation of ERK starts within minutes and lasts for up to 24h. Early ERK activation is involved in AGT upregulation and sustained ERK activation, mediated via AT1, is responsible for VEGF synthesis. In conclusion, our study shows that MCTs express an endogenous renin-angiotensin system that is activated by high glucose to stimulate the synthesis of VEGF, through activation of the ERK pathway.",

Other functions of Ang II include effects on immune response, inflammation, cell growth and proliferation, which are largely mediated by Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)). Several experimental studies have demonstrated that Ang II acts through AT(1) as a mediator of normal aging processes by increasing oxidant damage to mitochondria and in consequences by affecting mitochondrial function. Recently, our group has demonstrated that the inhibition of Ang II activity by targeted disruption of the Agtr1a gene encoding Ang II type 1A receptor (AT(1A)) in mice translates into marked prolongation of life span. The absence of AT(1A) protected multiple organs from oxidative damage and the alleviation of aging-like phenotype was associated with increased number of mitochondria and upregulation of the prosurvival gene sirtuin 3. AT(1) receptor antagonists have been proven safe and well-tolerated for chronic use and are used as a key component of the modern therapy for hypertension and cardiac failure, therefore Ang II/AT(1) pathway represents a feasible therapeutic strategy to prolong life span in humans.",

    "620": "Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is defined as an entity characterized by clinical manifestations and immunopathological serum findings similar to those of idiopathic lupus but which is temporally related to continuous drug exposure and resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug. Similar to idiopathic lupus, DILE can be divided into systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE). Based on the literature review and retrospective analysis of our case series, we focused on the dermatological aspects of DILE. The cutaneous features of drug-induced SLE are protean, including particularly purpura, erythema nodosum and photosensitivity as well as the skin lesions characterizing both urticarial and necrotizing vasculitis. The typical laboratory profile of systemic DILE consists of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antihistone antibodies, the latter being regarded as the serum marker of this subset. The drugs most frequently implicated in the development of systemic DILE are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid and minocycline. Drug-induced SCLE usually presents with annular polycyclic or papulosquamous cutaneous manifestations as in the idiopathic form, but blisters or targetoid lesions mimicking erythema multiforme cannot rarely be associated. The clinical presentation is often generalized, with involvement of the lower legs that are usually spared in idiopathic SCLE. ANA and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are usually present, whereas antihistone antibodies are uncommonly found. Drugs associated with SCLE include particularly calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, terbinafine and the recently reported tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists. Drug-induced CCLE is very rarely described in the literature and usually refers to fluorouracile agents or TNF-alpha antagonists. The picture is characterized by the occurrence of classic discoid lesions, but aspects of lupus tumidus can occasionally develop. ANA are demonstrated in around two-thirds of the cases. Management of DILE is based on the withdrawal of the offending drug. Topical and/or systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents should be reserved for resistant cases.",

Primary analyses used Cox models to investigate the potential attenuation of the treatment effect with higher baseline heart rate on total cardiovascular events and procedures (TCVP) via introduction of an interaction term. Secondary analyses assessed coronary and total stroke outcomes.", 
    "624": "Primary unadjusted analyses included 12,759 patients and 1,966 TCVP. At the final visit, mean heart rate reduction from baseline was 12.0 (SD 13.7) and 1.3 (SD 12.1) beats/min in atenolol- and amlodipine-based groups, respectively. There was a reduction in TCVP in those allocated amlodipine-based therapy compared with atenolol-based therapy (unadjusted hazard ratio: 0.81, p < 0.001). This benefit was unattenuated at higher heart rates (interaction p value = 0.81). Similar results were obtained for coronary and total stroke outcomes.", 
    "625": "There was no evidence that the superiority of amlodipine-based over atenolol-based therapy for patients with hypertension uncomplicated by coronary heart disease was attenuated with higher baseline heart rate. These data suggest that, in similar hypertensive populations without previous or current coronary artery disease, higher baseline heart rate is not an indication for preferential use of beta-blocker-based therapy.", 
    "626": "This study characterized CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in patients with mitral valve disease and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). Forty-eight patients with chronic AF formed two groups based on whether they were treated with or without renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (AF + RAS group; n = 25, or AF - RAS group; n = 23). The controls comprised 17 mitral valve disease patients with sinus rhythm (SR group). CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels in the left atria were significantly higher in the AF - RAS and AF + RAS groups than in the SR group. CXCR4 expression was significantly lower in the AF + RAS group than the AF - RAS group. More CD34(+) cells expressed CXCR4 in the AF - RAS and AF + RAS groups than in the SR group. Angiotensin II, collagen I and left atrial diameter significantly positively correlated with CXCR4 expression in the AF - RAS group. These results suggest that CXCR4 expression is up-regulated in chronic AF patients with mitral valve disease, is associated with atrial remodelling, and that these effects are attenuated by RAS blockers.", 
    "627": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation in bone marrow in an autocrine-paracrine manner, and it modulates normal and neoplastic haematopoietic cell proliferation. This study aimed to assess expressions of the RAS components, renin, angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), during imatinib mesylate treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Expressions of RAS components were studied in patients with CML at the time of diagnosis (n = 83) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis (n = 35) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. De novo CML patients had increased ACE, angiotensinogen and renin mRNA levels and these expression levels decreased following administration of imatinib. The RAS activities were significantly different among Sokal risk groups of CML, highlighting the altered biological activity of RAS in neoplastic disorders. The results of this study confirm that haematopoietic RAS affects neoplastic cell production, which may be altered via administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate.",

The influence of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on endothelial dysfunction has also been studied. The present study investigated the duration of the effects of RAAS-blocking drugs on endothelial function in 44 consecutive, never-treated, outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients (11 per group) received an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; irbesartan 300 mg/day or valsartan 160 mg/day) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi; fosinopril 10 mg/day or quinapril 20 mg/day). If target blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) was not achieved, 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide was added. Endothelial function, assessed by measuring brachial artery diameter, did not change significantly after 6 weeks, 1 year or 3 years of treatment in any group. Across all groups, endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation increased significantly after 6 weeks but, after 1 year, decreased below baseline and was at a similar level after 3 years; groups did not differ significantly. Both ACEi and ARB had similar effects on endothelial function; improvement occurred at the start of treatment but was not maintained. Endothelial dysfunction may be a resistant or irreversible feature of hypertension, requiring high doses of antihypertensive drugs and above-average patient compliance.",

Here we compared the individual renal protective efficacy of paricalcitol and trandolapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in obstructive nephropathy, and examined any potential additive effects of their combination on attenuating renal fibrosis and inflammation. Mice underwent unilateral ureteral obstruction and were treated individually with paricalcitol or trandolapril or their combination. Compared to vehicle-treated controls, monotherapy with paricalcitol or trandolapril inhibited the expression and accumulation of fibronectin and type I and type III collagen, suppressed alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and Snail1 expression, and reduced total collagen content in the obstructed kidney. Combination therapy led to a more profound inhibition of all parameters. Monotherapy also suppressed renal RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression and inhibited renal infiltration of T cells and macrophages, whereas the combination had additive effects. Renin expression was induced in the fibrotic kidney and was augmented by trandolapril. Paricalcitol blocked renin induction in the absence or presence of trandolapril. Our study indicates that paricalcitol has renal protective effects, comparable to that of trandolapril, in reducing interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. Combination therapy had additive efficacy in retarding renal scar formation during obstructive nephropathy.", 
    "635": "Hypertension can be detected very often in patients with diabetes mellitus. In some cases, hypertension develops as a consequence of diabetic nephropathy. Although diabetic nephropathy may occur both in type 1 and in type 2 diabetes, some differences can be observed in the clinical picture according to the type of diabetes. In the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, the pathomechanism of hypertension can be explained by the concept of the metabolic syndrome. In order to avoid or decrease target organ damage, the goal of antihypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus is to be set at <130/80 mmHg. The initial antihypertensive therapy is usually based on the evaluation of the global cardiovascular risk. Apart from modifying nutrition and lifestyle, pharmacological treatment with combination of antihypertensive drugs is generally required in order to achieve treatment goal. Diabetic or antidiabetic properties of antihypertensive drugs and antihypertensive characteristics of some antidiabetic drugs should be considered in the everyday clinical practice.",

Newer antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II (AII)- receptor blockers and calcium blockers) do not have this effect. Conventional therapy can also prevent cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Several studies on hypertension have shown that drugs' ability to reduce blood pressure is most decisive for their prevention of events.",

    "641": "The growing knowledge about genetic influence on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) combined with the recently generated amounts of genomic data hold promise to the identification of new markers for atherosclerotic CVD. Cardiovascular pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics have now the potential for leading to identification of genetic contributors and therefore to the development of predictive genetic tests that could optimize drugs efficacy and minimize toxicity. Clinical studies have shown that genetic variations within cytochromes P450 (CYPs), 3-Hydroxyl-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGCR) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes influence individual's response to lipid lowering statins. Furthermore, development of antagonists or inhibitors of molecules such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin receptors and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha could be another alternative to prevent atherosclerosis. In addition, novel molecules under the name of biologics including family of peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), urocortin, apelin and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could be considered as new targets for the prevention and treatment of CVD. In this article, we will focus mainly on recent genomic advances in the development of new markers and therapeutic agents for CVD. We present an array of molecules that could have pharmacological benefit for the treatment of heart disease. We also discuss in details new strategies including biologics, which are actually the focus of companies for clinical development of therapeutic drugs. All these efforts provide optimism and attractive promise to cure CVD.", 
    "642": "Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) represents an anti-atherosclerotic principle. NO bioavailability is decreased in atherosclerosis due to increased NO inactivation by reactive oxygen species and reduced NO synthesis. Various types of vascular pathophysiology are associated with oxidative stress, with NADPH oxidases as the major source of reactive oxygen species. These inactivate NO. Also, oxidative stress is likely to be the main cause for oxidation of the essential NOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). A lack of BH(4) leads to eNOS uncoupling (i.e., uncoupling of oxygen reduction from NO synthesis in eNOS). Based on these pathomechanisms, the therapeutic potential of a number of compounds is discussed in this review: (1) NO donors; (2) L-arginine; (3) folic acid; (4) BH(4) and its precursor sepiapterin; (5) compounds that upregulate eNOS and concomitantly maintain eNOS activity (e.g. midostaurin, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, AVE9488 and AVE3085); (6) compounds that enhance the de novo synthesis of BH(4) by stimulating expression or activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I; and (7) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) and drugs interrupting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Statins, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone and the renin inhibitor aliskiren enhance NO bioactivity and reduce atherosclerosis progression through multiple mechanisms.",

A total of 285 subjects with DHF confirmed by echocardiography were recruited in the period between 1995 and 2003. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, prior history, medication, and echocardiographic findings) and genetic polymorphisms (ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism; T174M, M235T, G-6A, A-20C, G-152A, and G-217A polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene; and A1166C polymorphisms of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R)) were collected and matched (by propensity score) in those who received and those who did not receive ACE inhibitors. The patients were followed up to 10 years. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models were used to demonstrate the survival trend. The 85 patients who received ACE inhibitors and the other 85 patients who did not were found to have comparable baseline characteristics and polymorphism distribution. Prescription of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant decrease in overall mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.83; P=0.01), and a lower rate of cardiovascular events at 4000 days (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90; P=0.02). In addition, ACE I/D gene D allele was associated with higher overall mortality as compared with the I allele (HR, 2.04; P=0.003). This effect was diminished in those who received ACE inhibitors. The use of ACE inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in long-term mortality and cardiovascular events in the patients with DHF. Genetic variants in the renin-angiotensin system genes were also associated, but their effects could be modified by the use of ACE inhibitors.",

Substantial evidence also suggests that drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also prolong the time to onset of clinical diabetes. An open question is whether delay of new-onset diabetes with antidiabetic or antihypertensive agents reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

HF differences appeared early, leading to questions about the possible influence of pre-enrollment antihypertensive drugs. A post hoc study evaluated hospitalized HF events. During year 1479 individuals had HF, with pre-entry antihypertensive medication data obtained on 301 patients (63%). Case-only analysis examined interactive effects (interaction odds ratio [OR, ratio of ORs]) of previous medication and ALLHAT treatment on HF outcomes, eg, did treatment effect differ by pre-entry antihypertensive class? Among cases, 39%, 37%, 17%, and 47% were taking pre-entry diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, respectively.

    "652": "In the recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the immune response is also influenced by mediators which were first discovered as regulators in the nervous or also cardiovascular system. Here, small peptide hormones may play an important role. Kinins like bradykinins act on the endothelium and play a role for trafficking of lymphocytes over the blood-brain barrier. Neuropeptides like vasoactive intestinal peptide or neuropeptide Y also directly act on T cells and favour the differentiation of Th2 cells or regulatory T cell populations. Recently, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) came into the focus of interest. Inhibition of the RAS at different levels may influence autoimmune responses and involve T cells as well as antigen-presenting cells, probably via different signalling pathways. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and antagonists of the angiotensin 1 receptors are used in the treatment of hypertension, kidney disease or stroke by millions of people worldwide. These inexpensive and safe pharmaceuticals may also represent an interesting and innovative approach for the (combination) treatment of autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis.",

We searched the literature (PubMed/Medline) to determine the clinical significance and assess the management of renal dysfunction in these patients. The results of our literature search suggest that impaired renal function is a frequent finding in patients with PAD. The presence of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, as well as the occurrence of cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death). Additionally, impaired renal function negatively affects survival, limb salvage, and graft patency rates when these patients undergo lower extremity revascularization procedures. The use of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with improved renal function and reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with PAD. Based on current evidence, renal function should be assessed and regularly monitored in all patients with PAD. More importantly, initiation of appropriate treatment (e.g., statins and ACE inhibitors) should be implemented to preserve renal function and improve vascular morbidity and mortality in these patients.", 
    "654": "Glutamatergic mechanisms have been implicated in the control of fluid ingestion. In the present study, we investigated whether non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) are involved in the control of water and sodium intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats had cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN. They were acutely depleted of water and sodium by injections of the diuretic furosemide (Furo; 10 mg/kg, bw) and given a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (Cap; 5 mg/kg, bw). Bilateral LPBN injections of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist DNQX (2 and 5 nmol/0.2 microl) increased the ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water of Furo/Cap treated rats. The increased ingestion produced by DNQX was abolished by pretreating the LPBN with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), a non-NMDA receptor agonist. AMPA injected alone into the LPBN reduced water and 0.3 M NaCl intake. Injections of DNQX (5 nmol/0.2 microl) into the LPBN also produced ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl after sc injections of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, a hypotensive drug that typically produces only water intake. Food intake, arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not altered by DNQX LPBN injections. We conclude that agonists acting on non-NMDA receptors in the LPBN exert an inhibitory influence on sodium intake during acute fluid depletion with hypotension and after isoproterenol treatment. A possible interaction of serotonin with glutamate within the LPBN is discussed.",

Exercise performance remained unchanged.", 
    "668": "At readmission, we observed an increase in CVD risk factors, although, physical fitness remained stable. Thus, failure of lifestyle modification after CR indicates the cause for concern. Reinforcement of home setting sessions of CR patients or other strategies to enhance long-term compliance to lifestyle changes could reduce the observed attrition in CR benefits.",

    "670": "Seventy-six consecutive patients were divided into captopril and control groups following successful repair of TOF. The captopril group was treated with oral captopril (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 12 months. Venous blood was taken before and after the surgery for the analysis of ET-1. Systolic PAP and ventricular function were assessed by Doppler echocardiography. In the control group, there was an increase in ET-1 and systolic PAP following the surgery (p < 0.05). In the captopril group, there was no significant increase in the systolic PAP and ET-1 during the 12-month follow-up. The PAP and ET-1 values in the captopril group were lower than those in the control group following the surgery (p < 0.05).",

In recent years, a new cardiac syndrome-named \"Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy\" for the particular shape of the end systolic ventricle-has been described in adults. In the absence of coronary artery obstruction, it mimics acute myocardial infarction with chest pain and typical electrocardiography changes. Emotional or physical stress usually precedes this cardiomyopathy. At present, this entity has only been described in adults, with a strong predominance in postmenopausal women. We report a case of acute ischemic cardiomyopathy after extreme stress in a child that may share the same pathophysiology.",

Use of evidence-based medications and patientperceived health status were measured in a telephone survey administered 6 to 12 months (mean [SD] = 10 [3.5] months) after hospital discharge. Surveys were conducted from January 2002 through March 2005. Subjects were included in the survey if they were prescribed at least 1 of the 4 evidence-based drug categories at the time of discharge. Each patient was assigned to 1 of 5 groups (range: 0 to 4) based on the number of drug categories self-reported by the patient as current at the time of the survey. Patient-perceived health status was assessed using the question \"How would you rate your health at the present time?\" using a 5-point scale from excellent (1) to poor (5). Mean perceived health status scores for each of the 4 evidence-based medication categories were compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Multivariate logistic regression determined the association between patient-perceived health status-dichotomized to excellent/ very good/good versus fair/poor - and the evidence-based medication group, controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

    "679": "The generation of bradykinin (BK; Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) in blood and kallidin (Lys-BK) in tissues by the action of the kallikrein-kinin system has received little attention in non-mammalian vertebrates. In mammals, kallidin can be generated by the coronary endothelium and myocytes in response to ischemia, mediating cardioprotective events. The plasma of birds lacks two key components of the kallikrein-kinin system: the low molecular weight kininogen and a prekallikrein activator analogous to mammalian factor XII, but treatment with bovine plasma kallikrein generates ornitho-kinin [Thr6,Leu8]-BK. The possible cardioprotective effect of ornitho-kinin infusion was investigated in an anesthetized, open-chest chicken model of acute coronary occlusion. A branch of the left main coronary artery was reversibly ligated to produce ischemia followed by reperfusion, after which the degree of myocardial necrosis (infarct size as a percent of area at risk) was assessed by tetrazolium staining. The iv injection of a low dose of ornitho-kinin (4 microg/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure from 88 +/- 12 to 42 +/- 7 mmHg and increased heart rate from 335 +/- 38 to 402 +/- 45 bpm (N = 5). The size of the infarct was reduced by pretreatment with ornitho-kinin (500 microg/kg infused over a period of 5 min) from 35 +/- 3 to 10 +/- 2% of the area at risk. These results suggest that the physiological role of the kallikrein-kinin system is preserved in this animal model in spite of the absence of two key components, i.e., low molecular weight kininogen and factor XII.", 
    "680": "Isolated rat hearts were perfused for 120 minutes in the presence or in the absence of 10 microM zofenoprilat, the active metabolite of zofenopril. At the end of perfusion, cardiac tissue was used to assay sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (45)Ca uptake and SR calcium release, which was determined by automatized quick filtration technique after SR vesicle loading with (45)Ca. The expression of genes involved in the control of calcium homeostasis was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. In chronic experiments, SR (45)Ca uptake and gene expression were measured in hearts derived from rats treated with 15 mg*kg(-1)*day(-1) zofenopril for 15 days. Acute or chronic zofenopril administration did not produce any change in contractile performance. In acute experiments, SR (45)Ca uptake was significantly increased after exposure to zofenoprilat. The rate constant of calcium-induced calcium release was slightly although not significantly higher, and the calcium leak measured under conditions promoting SR channel closure was significantly increased. In the chronic model, significant increase in the rate of SR (45)Ca uptake was confirmed. Gene expression was not modified, except for decreased phospholamban expression, which is observed in the acute but not in the chronic model. In conclusion, zofenopril increases SR calcium cycling and stimulates active calcium uptake into the SR.",

Forty-six patients with resistant hypertension and stages 2 or 3 CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 56.5 + or - 16.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) were evaluated for safety and efficacy of aldosterone blockade added to preexisting BP-lowering regimens. All patients were on three mechanistically complementary antihypertensive agents including a diuretic and a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Patients were evaluated after a median of 45 treatment days. The primary endpoint was change in systolic BP. Secondary endpoints included change in serum potassium, creatinine, eGFR, diastolic BP and tolerability.", 
    "683": "The mean age of the patients studied was 64.9 + or - 10.7 years, all were obese and 86% had type 2 diabetes, with 82% being African-American. Addition of aldosterone antagonism yielded a further mean reduction in systolic BP of 14.7 + or - 5.1 mm Hg (p = 0.001). Females with BMI >30 and those with a baseline systolic BP >160 mm Hg were more likely to have a greater BP reduction to aldosterone antagonism. In total, 39% of the patients had a >30% decrease in eGFR when the BP goal was achieved. The mean increase in serum potassium was 0.4 mEq/l above baseline (p = 0.001), with 17.3% manifesting hyperkalemia, i.e. serum potassium >5.5 mEq/l. Predictors of hyperkalemia included a baseline eGFR of < or = 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in whom serum potassium was >4.5 mEq/l on appropriately dosed diuretics.

    "685": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to reductions in proteinuria and in progression of chronic kidney disease. Indeed, monotherapy with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to decrease proteinuria and slow the decline of chronic kidney disease, but incompletely. Therefore, there is increasing interest in whether combination strategies will provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, which may translate into superior renoprotective and cardioprotective effects compared with either agent alone. There have been several reports on combination strategies. However, the recent report of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) has received much of the attention. The renal outcomes in ONTARGET suggest that combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy contributes to a higher rate of adverse renal outcomes than monotherapy. Therefore, this review explores data from ONTARGET in relation to other available evidence on the use of combination therapies.", 
    "686": "Hypertension remains a common comorbidity and cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the number of patients with CKD grows, so does the need to identify modifiable risk factors for CKD progression. Data on slowing progression of CKD or preventing end-stage renal disease with aggressive blood pressure control have not yielded definitive conclusions regarding ideal blood pressure targets. Shifting the focus of antihypertensive therapy to alternative markers of end-organ damage, specifically proteinuria, has yielded some promise in preventing the progression of CKD. Nevertheless, proteinuria and decline in estimated GFR may represent an irreversible degree of injury to the kidney that limits the impact of any therapy. The identification and use of novel markers of kidney injury to assess the impact of antihyper-tensive therapy may yield clearer direction with regard to optimal management of hypertension in the setting of CKD.", 
    "687": "Proteinuria is both a marker and a mediator of progressive renal damage; higher levels are associated with greater cardiovascular and renal risk. At normal and low levels of proteinuria (in the microalbuminuria range), the rate of hard renal events (dialysis and doubling of creatinine) is much lower than the mortality rate. At higher levels of proteinuria, the renal event rate surpasses the mortality rate. In the overt nephropathy range (proteinuria > 0.5 g/L), patients who achieve lower proteinuria with therapy have improved hard renal outcomes, but this result has not been demonstrated in the micro-albuminuria range. For patients with more severe overt nephropathy, there is a basic rationale for additional blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Dual blockade of this system and supramaximal dosing with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) have been demonstrated to reduce proteinuria in these patients more than therapy using the maximum recommended doses of these agents. However, evidence that dual blockade provides additional benefits for hard renal and cardiovascular outcomes is lacking, and only one study shows a benefit for supramaximal dosing. Both treatment strategies increase the risk for complications such as hyperkalemia. Therapy for patients with nephropathy should include treatment with the maximum recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor or ARB in addition to lowering blood pressure to target. For patients with overt nephropathy, more research is required on the role of dual therapy or supramaximal dosing to reduce hard renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Practitioners using either of these strategies to manage proteinuria should monitor their patients carefully.", 
    "688": "Hypertension is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); it causes early loss of kidney function and accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. African American patients with hypertension and genetic disposition are at an even higher risk for renal disease and ultimately renal failure. Hypertensive patients with CKD should aim for stringent blood pressure (BP) control (target < 130/80 mm Hg) requiring more than one drug with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade as a component of therapy targeting both hyper-tension and proteinuria. Management of hypertension in the dialysis population should focus on ambulatory measurements of BP and the use of longer-acting antihypertensive drugs, with their dosage and timing adjusted according to their dialytic clearances. Hypertension is also common among kidney transplant recipients and contributes to graft loss and premature death. The target BP in transplant recipients is the same as in the CKD population, with no preference for one drug group over another. Unless contraindicated, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the drugs of choice for hypertension in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, in whom diastolic cardiac dysfunction is a prominent feature.", 
    "689": "Hypertension remains uncontrolled in more than 50% of treated patients. Barriers to hypertension control include those that are patient-related, physician-related, and related to the health system. Identification of uncontrolled hypertension, pseudoresistant hyper-tension, and resistant hypertension require thoughtful attention to accurate blood pressure measurement, lifestyle factors, evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, and proper treatment. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of aggressive treatment and referral to hypertension specialists for patients with resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite the use of three appropriate anti-hypertensive agents.", 
    "690": "Although primary (essential) hypertension is detectable in childhood, secondary causes of hypertension must be considered in evaluating and managing hypertension in children and adolescents. Very young children and children with severe hypertension may have an underlying cause of the hypertension. Interventions to control elevated blood pressure (BP) are clinically important for all children with high BP. Nonpharmacologic approaches are recommended for all asymptomatic children with hypertension and prehypertension. Some children and adolescents will require pharmacologic therapy to control BP and to optimize organ protection. Recent advancements in pediatric clinical trials of antihypertensive agents have provided data on BP-lowering effects and safety in children. Little has been published on the choice and use of various classes of antihypertensive drugs for management of secondary hypertension in children and adolescents. This review focuses on the clinical management of specific types of secondary hypertension in pediatric patients.",

There are some situations, however, that qualify as hypertensive emergencies or urgencies. It is important, therefore, to diagnose these acute conditions, in which immediate treatment of hypertension is indicated. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies depends on consideration of the clinical manifestations as well as the absolute level of blood pressure. Manifestations of hypertensive emergencies can be quite profound, but they vary depending on the target organ that is affected. Thus, an accurate clinical diagnosis is necessary to render appropriate therapy. Fortunately, effective drug therapy is available to lower the blood pressure quickly in hypertensive emergencies. Physicians should be familiar with the pharmacologic and clinical actions of drugs in treating hypertensive emergencies. With proper clinical diagnosis, hypertensive emergencies can be successfully treated, and complications can be largely prevented with timely intervention.",

    "693": "Angiotensin II (AT-II) is a peptide that plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. Traditionally, the RAA system has been related with states of systemic hypertension and hypoperfusion as a counterbalance mechanism. Recently, AT-II has been studied for its properties in the process of fibrosis in several organs, especially in the liver. AT-II is capable to stimulate the activated hepatic stellate cells, which increase expression of profibrogenic molecules like tumor growth factor-beta, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and collagen I, among others. At the same time, AT-II is implied in the hemodynamic balance of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Due to its profibrogenic and vasoactive properties, blockade of AT-II actions constitutes an important therapeutic target to inhibit fibrotic processes and reduction of risk of complications of portal hypertension as well. Some drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or the angiotensin II receptor blockers have been studied as alternatives for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis with promising results. Nonetheless, additional research is required in order to consider these drugs as a part of the integral treatment of the patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.",

The Ramipril can remarkably quench the luminescence intensity of the Sm(3+) ion in Sm(3+)-doxycycline complex at lambda(ex)=375 nm in sol-gel matrix. In the same time the intensity of the emission band of the Ramipril in DMSO at 454 nm is increased due to the energy transfer from the Sm(3+)-doxycycline complex to Ramipril in the excited stated. The quenching of luminescence intensity of Sm(3+)-doxycycline complex doped in the sol-gel matrix and the enhancement of the emission band of Ramipril at 454 nm are directly proportion to the concentration of Ramipril with a dynamic ranges of 3.4x10(-9) - 1.0x10(-7)mol l(-1) and 2.4x10(-9) - 1.0x10(-7)mol l(-1) and detection limits of 6.0x10(-10) and 5.2x10(-10)mol l(-1), respectively.",

Further studies of this relationship may lead to new interventions that decrease health disparities in the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "699": "Impaired muscle blood flow at the onset of heavy-intensity exercise may transiently reduce microvascular O(2) pressure and decrease the rate of O(2) transfer from capillary to mitochondria in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, advances in the pharmacological treatment of CHF (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and third-generation beta-blockers) may have improved microvascular O(2) delivery to an extent that intramyocyte metabolic inertia might become the main locus of limitation of O(2) uptake (Vo(2)) kinetics. We assessed the rate of change of pulmonary Vo(2) (Vo(2)(p)), (estimated) fractional O(2) extraction in the vastus lateralis (approximately Delta[deoxy-Hb+Mb] by near-infrared spectroscopy), and cardiac output (Qt) during high-intensity exercise performed to the limit of tolerance (Tlim) in 10 optimally treated sedentary patients (ejection fraction = 29 + or - 8%) and 11 controls. Sluggish Vo(2)(p) and Qt kinetics in patients were significantly related to lower Tlim values (P < 0.05). The dynamics of Delta[deoxy-Hb+Mb], however, were faster in patients than controls [mean response time (MRT) = 15.9 + or - 2.0 s vs. 19.0 + or - 2.9 s; P < 0.05] with a subsequent response \"overshoot\" being found only in patients (7/10). Moreover, tauVo(2)/MRT-[deoxy-Hb+Mb] ratio was greater in patients (4.69 + or - 1.42 s vs. 2.25 + or - 0.77 s; P < 0.05) and related to Qt kinetics and Tlim (R = 0.89 and -0.78, respectively; P < 0.01). We conclude that despite the advances in the pharmacological treatment of CHF, disturbances in \"central\" and \"peripheral\" circulatory adjustments still play a prominent role in limiting Vo(2)(p) kinetics and tolerance to heavy-intensity exercise in nontrained patients.", 
    "700": "The aortic blood pressure curve involves two components: a steady component, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is dependent on cardiac output and vascular resistance, and a pulsatile component pulse pressure (PP), which is dependent on arterial stiffness and pulse wave reflections. The transduction mechanisms of MAP and PP differ markedly, involving focal adhesion kinase for MAP and oxygen free radicals for PP. Angiotensin II (ANG II) and its blockade are associated with changed vascular resistance and MAP; however, their effects on PP (peripheral and mostly central PP) have been inadequately investigated. In hypertensive rats, when compared with their normotensive controls, ANG II blockade normalizes central PP (<50 mmHg) but not MAP when the same drug dosage is used for each. In hypertensive patients, ANG II blockade reduces arterial stiffness and pulse wave reflections, but with the same reduction in MAP, there is a greater reduction in central than peripheral PP, thereby increasing carotid-brachial PP amplification. With long-term ANG II blockade, the hypertensive arteriolar hypertrophy observed at baseline is corrected in association with reduced arteriolar reflection coefficients, reduced carotid arterial attachments linking alpha(5)-integrin to its ligand fibronectin, and decreased circulating C-reactive protein. When given a normal salt diet, each of these factors contributes separately in reducing arterial stiffness and wave reflections. These responses disappear with a high-salt diet, a condition that usually involves the activation of the local vascular renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and can be prevented by its selective blockade. Thus ANG II inhibition seems to contribute independently in reducing central PP and aortic stiffness.", 
    "701": "The investigators review the evidence of the potential role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers in delaying or preventing the onset and progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease and the suggested mechanisms by which these agents exert their favorable metabolic and cardiovascular effects. Data from clinical trials suggest that RAS blockade not only reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with DM but also may prevent or delay DM onset in at-risk subjects. These observations set the stage for further studies evaluating the risk for developing DM as a primary end point: the Diabetes Reduction Approaches With Ramipril And Rosiglitazone Medications (DREAM) trial, in which ramipril significantly increased regression to normoglycemia (although it did not reduce the primary end point of new-onset DM or death), and the ongoing Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) trial, the only DM prevention trial also powered to evaluate whether a reduced risk for DM is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease events. In conclusion, overwhelming evidence suggests that the RAS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DM and its associated cardiovascular risks.",

Thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) was predicted using BIOPEP database as the enzyme that would theoretically produce the most angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from oat. Experimental evidence confirmed that strong ACE-inhibitory activity was produced under various hydrolysis conditions. Hydrolysates produced under high enzyme-to-substrate ratio (3%) short time (20 min) (HEST) and low enzyme-to-substrate ratio (0.1%) long time (120 min) (LELT) conditions had IC(50) values of 30 and 50 microg/mL, respectively. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, the IC(50) of the HEST hydrolysate was 35 microg/mL whereas the IC(50) of the LELT hydrolysate was higher at 85 microg/mL.

    "712": "The clinical benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are well established in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies. But despite appearance, the magnitude of this effect has been questioned particularly in mild, proteinuric nephropathies. Given that the single agents can achieve only partial and not durable suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), it has been hypothesized that dual blockage with ACE inhibitors and ARBs would be most beneficial in the management of progressive CKD than either agent alone. Available evidence indicates significant anti-proteinuric effect, but long-term data in CKD patients are lacking. Recently, the findings of the ONTARGET trial even questioned the safety of this therapeutic approach. Given that preventing cardiovascular complications is extremely important in CKD and RAS inhibition may be useful in this setting, benefits of RAS blockade must be weighed against its possible adverse effects particularly in elderly patients.",

The beneficial effects of MRBs on mortality in patients with cardiac disease have been well described. We review the role of aldosterone in end-organ damage, the rationales for using MRBs as adjuncts to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in treating CKD, and the adverse effects that may occur when these agents are used in combination. Suggestions are included for avoiding serious adverse events in CKD patients treated with MRBs. There is a clearly defined need for prospective outcome studies focused on cardiovascular mortality as well as progression of CKD in patients treated with MRBS and other inhibitors of the RAAS.",

Risk factors were male sex, vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and pre-morbid use of nephrotoxic medications (p<0.01). Inpatient, 30- and 120-day mortality was higher in the ARD group 19%, 22% and 41% respectively, versus 0%, 4% and 13% in the non-ARD group (p<0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the ARD group. Pre- and post-operative complications were 12 and 5 times more frequent respectively in the ARD group (p<0.01).

Given the renal and cardioprotective effects of RAAS blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, DRIs may increase the armamentarium for further organ protection. Over the last two decades the effects of DRIs on biomarkers for renal and cardiovascular disease have been investigated. This systematic review aims to delineate the effects of DRIs on surrogate markers of renal and cardiovascular function.",

Preclinical and clinical studies showed profound effects of DRIs on markers of renal function, including clear increases in renal plasma flow and reductions in albuminuria. These effects were observed either alone or in combination with other RAAS inhibitors and suggest potential large renal protective benefit. DRIs improved hemodynamic cardiovascular parameters, such as total peripheral resistance, arterial pressure and left ventricular mass index, to a similar extent as those observed with other RAAS inhibitors. Furthermore, addition of DRIs to optimal heart failure treatment resulted in further reductions in B-type natriuretic peptide.",

The abdominal aorta of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats was constricted with a ligature between the renal arteries, and pressure was monitored on either side during acute constriction. Left renal perfusion pressure was reduced to 70 +/- 1 mmHg (n = 6), whereas right renal perfusion pressure was 112 +/- 4 mmHg. In control (nonconstricted) rats (n = 5), pressure to both kidneys was similar at 119 +/- 6 mmHg. After 5 min of reduced perfusion, femoral venous samples were taken for plasma renin activity (PRA) and the kidneys excised. The cortex was dissected, minced, sieved, and biotinylated. Lower perfusion left kidneys showed a 41% increase (P < 0.003) in the amount of Na-K-ATPase in the plasma membrane compared with right kidneys. In controls, there was no difference in cell surface Na-K-ATPase between left and right kidneys (P = 0.47). PRA was 57% higher in experimental animals compared with controls. To test the role of angiotensin II in mediating the increase in Na-K-ATPase, we repeated the experiments (n = 6) in rats treated with ramiprilat. When angiotensin-converting enzyme was inhibited, the cell surface Na-K-ATPase of the two kidneys was equal (P =0.46). These results confirm our hypothesis: rapid changes in blood pressure regulate trafficking of Na-K-ATPase in the kidney cortex.", 
    "724": "We have made striking progress in our understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology that underlies liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, including the development of strategies and agents to prevent and reverse fibrosis and incipient cirrhosis. However, translation of this knowledge into clinical practice has been hampered by the limitation of many in vitro and in vivo models to confirm mechanisms and to test antifibrotic agents, as well as the lack of sensitive methodologies to quantify the degree of liver fibrosis and the dynamics of fibrosis progression or reversal. Furthermore, while cirrhosis and subsequent decompensation are accepted hard clinical end-points, fibrosis and fibrosis progression alone are merely plausible surrogates for future clinical deterioration. This review focuses on basic mechanisms that underlay liver fibrosis progression and reversal and optimized strategies for preclinical antifibrotic drug development and validation. Therapies include several drugs that are of proven safety for other indications, agents that interfere with major fibrogenic or fibrolytic mechanisms, targeted drug delivery to the fibrogenic liver cells, and their potential combinations with hepatocyte or stem cell replenishment.",

Nonoperative treatment options have been suggested involving radiation therapy, vitamin E, local injection therapy suing calcium channel blockers, interferon, corticosteroids or collagenase. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its downstream Smad signalling system is well established as a key player during fibrogenesis. A number of in vitro experiments have been assessed the blockade of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta 2. Clinically, a number of antifibrotic agents are available such as N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC) as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or AT II antagonists. However, to date none of the well known substances has been tested clinically in fibromatosis such as Dupuytren's disease especially to prevent recurrences after surgical release. Antifibrotic medication using a combination of N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) and ACE inhibitor can prevent the recurrence of Dupyutren's disease. Given the fact that recurrence rate in Dupuytren's disease is high and unpredictable after surgical release, an antifibrotic intervention might be worthwhile to consider in the clinical setting. Antifibrotic agents inhibit TGF-beta1, which play a key role in fibromatosis. Thus, antifibrotic medication might reduce the recurrence rate in fibromatosis such as Dupuytren's disease in a clinical significant way.",

We investigated a possible contribution of chymase to AngII formation and to renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Eight-week-old Syrian hamsters were subjected to UUO and treated with vehicle, the specific chymase inhibitor (CI) 4-[1-(4-methyl-benzo[b]thiophen-3-ylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl]-butyric acid (50 mg/kg, twice a day, p.o.), or the selective AT(1)-receptor blocker olmesartan (10 mg/kg per day, p.o.) for 14 days. UUO-induced renal interstitial fibrosis was associated with increases in renal mRNA levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), type I collagen, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. The UUO hamsters showed markedly higher AngII contents and increased AT(1)-receptor mRNA level in the obstructed kidney than sham-operated ones. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) protein expression was significantly lower in UUO hamsters. In UUO hamsters, treatment with CI or olmesartan significantly decreased AngII levels in renal tissue and mRNA levels of alpha-SMA, type I collagen, and TGF-beta and ameliorated tubulointerstitial injury. On the other hand, neither CI nor olmesartan changed systolic blood pressure, renal ACE, and AT(1)-receptor protein levels. These data suggest that chymase-dependent intrarenal AngII formation contributes to the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys of hamsters.",

After only 10 min of EME, the peptides were isolated from diluted plasma (pH 3) with extraction recoveries between 25 and 43%. After optimization, the extraction system was evaluated using spiked plasma samples of angiotensin 2. The evaluation was performed by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry, showing linearity of angiotensin 2 in the range 2.5-125.0 ng/mL (r(2)=0.989), and repeatability (RSD) between 5.6 and 11.6% (n=6).

Agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists [angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs]) are preferred for the management of hypertension in most patients exhibiting subclinical target organ damage, or established cardiovascular or renal diseases. Unless contraindicated they should be one of the components of fixed-dose combinations, whereas the other component may be either a calcium channel antagonist or a thiazide diuretic. Fixed-dose combinations containing an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel antagonist appear particularly effective in preventing complications of coronary heart disease.",

Data including exercise, alcohol intake, and use of aspirin, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were prospectively recorded. Multivariate analysis was used to compare 76 cases of severe anaphylaxis (SA) with 235 cases of mild to moderate food allergy (mmFA). The M/F sex ratio was 54.6% in SA and 36% in mmFA (p < .003). SA represented 17.3% of all food allergies below 45 years and 54.6% over this age. Drug intake did not differ between the two age categories. Drug use was noted in 40.8% of SA and 14.9% of mmFA (p < .0005). Aspirin, NSAIDs, betablockers and ACEI were associated with respectively 15.8%, 6.6%, 10.5% and 5.3% of SA, and with 1.7%, 0.9%, 1.7% and 0.4% of mmFA (p < .003). The respective odds ratios were 10.8, 8.2, 6.8 and 13.0. No other drugs were associated with FA. Exercise and alcohol intake were associated to drugs with respectively 10.5% and 27.6% of SA and 0.4% and 8.1% of mmFA (p < .0005). Exercise drastically increased the risk of drugs. We conclude that aspirin, NSAIDs, betablockers and ACEI are significant risk factors for severe IgE-dependent food allergy. The underlying mechanisms are discussed. Adults with food allergy or sensitization should avoid taking aspirin and NSAIDs before meals and should receive drug families other than ACEI and betablockers for hypertension. In case of pre-existing heart disease, the benefit-risk ratio of ACEI and beta-blockers has to be carefully considered.",

    "748": "The main objective of antifibrotic treatment is to avoid the complications of chronic liver disease where its cause cannot be treated. Three main therapeutic endpoints can be targeted: cause; comorbidity; and fibrosis. Antifibrotic treatment is any intervention independent of cause that is intended to modify the course and/or level of fibrosis through direct action on the mechanisms of fibrosis. Several modalities are here considered: reduction of fibrosis course; reversion of fibrosis; and reversion of cirrhosis. Semiquantitative histological staging and morphometry are complementary techniques for monitoring fibrosis. The degree of fibrosis should preferentially be estimated by fibrosis progression based on measurements taken at baseline and during treatment, rather than by raw static measurements. Surrogate markers are the only tools for assessing drug efficacy in clinical practice, and are especially useful for checking compliance and identifying poor or non-responders. We propose to define non-response as no decrease in fibrosis progression. The renin-angiotensin system is a good candidate target for antifibrotic treatment, and angiotensin-II type-1 receptor blockers, such as sartans, are probably effective. Clinical trials are currently ongoing using marketed drugs, while new multitargeted drugs are likely to emerge from basic research.",

Male Holtzman rats with bilateral stainless steel guide-cannulas implanted into KF/A7 area or LPBN were used. FURO+CAP-induced 0.3 M NaCl intake strongly increased after bilateral injections of noradrenaline (80 or 160 nmol/0.2 microl) into LPBN (26.5+/-5.9 and 20.7+/-2.0 ml/2 h versus saline: 4.4+/-0.9 ml/2 h) or into the KF/A7 area (31.5+/-6.1 and 25.9+/-4.7 ml/2 h versus saline: 7.2+/-1.6 ml/2 h). Water intake increased with noradrenaline injected in KF/A7 area, however, this treatment reduced 0.06 M sucrose intake, suggesting that the increase of water and NaCl intake is not related to non-specific effect. Bilateral injections of RX 821002 (160 nmol/0.2 microl) into LPBN or KF/A7 area abolished the effects of noradrenaline (160 nmol/0.2 microl) in the same areas on 0.3 M NaCl intake (7.5+/-2.5 and 9.8+/-4.4 ml/2 h, respectively). Moxonidine (0.5 nmol/0.2 microl) injected bilaterally into the KF/A7 area increased 0.3 M NaCl intake (39.5+/-6.3 ml/3 h) and water intake, while methysergide (4 microg/0.2 microl) into the KF/A7 area did not alter 0.3 M NaCl or water intake.

The median INR was 2.1 at discharge and 1.90 at 6 months. Although the incidence of stroke was low, 40% of ischemic strokes occurred in patients with INRs < 1.5 and 33% of hemorrhagic strokes were in patients with INRs > 3.0. The highest incidence of bleeding was at INRs > 2.5.", 
    "757": "The rate of thromboembolism during long-term outpatient support with the HeartMate II is low.

However, some authors have reported poor outcomes of renal function if the switch to m-TOR inhibitors is made in the presence proteinuria > 0.8 g/d. The present study sought to provide a retrospective analysis of the clinical outcome of 63 kidney recipients diagnosed with chronic allograft dysfunction whose therapy was converted to rapamycin including 35 subjects with renal biopsy-proven chronic allograft nephropathy. At the time of conversion, patients were divided into three groups: group I (negative proteinuria), group II (proteinuria between 0.3 and 0.8 g/d), and group III (proteinuria > 0.8 g/d). On conversion, 21 recipients had no proteinuria (group I). After a follow-up of 24.6 +/- 12.8 months, they showed a significant improvement in renal function (previous MDRD4 = 39.9 +/- 11.5 mL/m/1.73 m(2), current MDRD4 50.3 +/- 13.3 mL/m/1.73 m(2), P < .05). Fifteen patients (71.4%) developed proteinuria, which was generally mild (0.8 +/- 0.7 g/d) and controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (42.8%). In group II (n = 18), renal function clearly stabilized after a follow-up of 23.2 +/- 14.4 months (previous MDRD4 = 30 +/- 8.8 mL/m/1.73 m(2), current MDRD4 = 37 +/- 12.2 mL/m/1.73 m(2), NS), although there was a progressive deterioration of previous proteinuria levels (previous proteinuria 0.4 +/- 0.15 g/d, current proteinuria 1.2 +/- 2 g/d, P < .05), which was more frequent and intense in patients whose treatment with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) was suspended (with CNI 0.9 +/- 1.7 g/d, without CNI 1.6 +/- 2.2 g/d, P < .05). Group III (n = 24) had a greater degree of renal insufficiency and a worse outcome after 25.9 +/- 18 months of follow-up, with a frank and progressive deterioration in renal function (previous MDRD4 = 38 +/- 17 mL/m/1.73 m(2), current MDRD4 = 32.5 +/- 19.2 mL/m/1.73 m(2), P < .05) and proteinuria (previous proteinuria = 1.5 +/- 0.7 g/d, current proteinuria = 2.5 +/- 2.2 g/d, P < .05) after conversion. Again, the deterioration in proteinuria was more intense in the patients whose previous CNIs were suspended (with CNI = 1.1 +/- 0.9 g/d, without CNI = 4.2 +/- 2.3 g/d, P < .05). In conclusion, for patients with chronic allograft dysfunction who do not present with proteinuria or whose proteinuria is less than 0.8 mg/d, switching to rapamycin is useful, since it clearly improves or stabilizes renal function, although there may be a discrete increase in proteinuria in the second case. However, among patients with proteinuria greater than 0.8 mg/d accompanied by a greater degree of renal insufficiency, conversion to rapamycin leads to deterioration of proteinuria levels and renal function. These data show that conversion to rapamycin in cases of chronic allograft dysfunction must be made early when there is no proteinuria or it is minimal, and that proteinuria is a predictor of the outcome of allograft function.",

Attempts to improve clinical outcomes by combining angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have yielded mixed results. Adverse effects of RAAS blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may relate to compensatory increases in plasma renin activity (PRA). The first-in-class direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, blocks the RAAS at its point-of-activation, suppressing PRA and attenuating increases associated with other antihypertensives. Aliskiren (with or without other agents) provides significant and prolonged blood pressure reductions in a broad range of hypertensive patients and is well tolerated. Initial results from organ-protection studies are promising. Long-term outcomes studies should yield valuable information regarding the significance of direct renin inhibition in clinical practice.",

Patients were taller, heavier, and had higher body mass index than average for age and sex. By the fourth visit, SBP was <90th percentile in 79%. Ninety percent could be controlled, although 32 lost control at some point (at least 16 due to noncompliance). At the last visit, 46 were controlled, and 5/8 patients off medication remained normotensive.

However, inhibition of the RAS does not control all pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension or cardiovascular risk and many patients continue to suffer from cardiovascular events and metabolic disturbances despite being treated with an ARB, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or both, in addition to other standard therapies for cardiovascular disease. Recently, it has become apparent that bifunctional molecules can be designed that do more than just block AT(1) receptors and that can target additional mechanisms of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes besides just increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Specifically, next generation ARBs are becoming available that are intended to not only antagonize AT(1) receptors, but also block endothelin receptors, function as nitric oxide donors, inhibit neprilysin activity and increase natriuretic peptide levels, or stimulate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). In this review, we: (1) discuss the potential importance of multifunctional ARBs that can reduce cardiovascular and metabolic risk through multiple mechanisms that go beyond just inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and (2) describe specific examples of next generation ARBs in development that are intended to do more than simply block AT(1) receptors.",

Although recommended in international guidelines, sodium restriction is not a spearhead in treating renal patients. Sodium status is only rarely mentioned in recent large intervention studies in CKD. Sodium intake in CKD is similar to that in the general population. Reduction of sodium intake to the target of 50-85 mmol/24 h in patients with CKD reduces blood pressure and proteinuria, the latter by approximately 30%, and should be actively pursued to improve outcome in CKD.",

Lone AF patients were initially thought to have a good prognosis with respect to thromboembolism and mortality, compared with the general AF population, but more recent data suggest otherwise. This review focuses on the clinical epidemiology and management aspects of lone AF, as well as various associated novel risk factors, such as familial, genetic and socioeconomic factors, alcohol, sports activity and biochemical markers.", 
    "778": "High glucose causes increased matrix synthesis by glomerular mesangial cells and angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to mediate this effect of glucose. These studies investigate whether inhibition of Ang II formation can block high glucose-induced increase in mesangial matrix. Human mesangial cells were incubated with 25 mM glucose (HG) along with captopril, an ACE inhibitor, to block Ang II formation. In other experiments, cells were nucleofected with siRNA to knockdown angiotensinogen (Agt), the precursor of Ang II, and then exposed to high glucose. Captopril blocked high glucose-induced increase in Ang II levels in the cell media (extracellular) but failed to inhibit it in the cell lysate (intracellular). Moreover, captopril treatment did not block the stimulatory effect of high glucose on TGF-beta1 and fibronectin. In contrast, knockdown of the Agt gene prevented high glucose-induced increase in both extracellular and intracellular Ang II levels, and was accompanied by normalization of TGF-beta1 and fibronectin. These data suggest that intracellular Ang II may play an important role in the mediation of the high glucose effect on matrix and that ACE inhibitors may not be effective in blocking intracellular Ang II formation in mesangial cells.",

    "797": "Hypertension is an important contributor to the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, yet success in achieving blood pressure (BP) control has been limited. Most patients will require 2 or more medications to control their BP. Nurse practitioners play a vital role in treating patients with hypertension and can help overcome barriers to reaching BP goals. Measures to improve therapeutic adherence include educating the patient and simplifying the medication regimen. Use of single-pill combination therapy, which reduces the pill burden, can contribute to improved medication persistence and compliance. Rational combination therapy combines medications with complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor; it is often more efficacious than monotherapy and allows the use of lower doses of the individual components, which usually results in improved tolerability. Current guidelines support the first-line use of combination therapy in many patients. Initiating therapy with a RAAS inhibitor-based combination can reduce BP and cardiovascular risk and may be more effective for some patients than traditional combinations such as a beta-blocker with a diuretic. Adverse events associated with any medication can compromise its therapeutic usefulness. Peripheral edema is a common and dose-dependent adverse event seen with dihydropyridine CCBs, which can cause marked patient distress, reduce adherence to therapy, and result in dose reduction or even discontinuation of therapy. In most cases, CCB-induced peripheral edema can be managed successfully, and CCB therapy need not be abandoned. Management strategies include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Several clinical trials have shown a lower incidence of peripheral edema in patients receiving combination therapy with a CCB and a RAAS blocker compared with CCB monotherapy.",

It exerts its various actions on the cardiovascular and renal system, mainly via interaction with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), which contributes to blood pressure regulation and development of hypertension but may also mediate effects on the immune system. Here we study the role of the RAS in myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE), a model mimicking many aspects of multiple sclerosis. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed an up-regulation of renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, as well as AT1R in the inflamed spinal cord and the immune system, including antigen presenting cells (APC). Treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren, the angiotensin II converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril, as well as preventive or therapeutic application of the AT1R antagonist losartan, resulted in a significantly ameliorated course of MOG-EAE. Blockade of AT1R did not directly impact on T-cell responses, but significantly reduced numbers of CD11b+ or CD11c+ APC in immune organs and in the inflamed spinal cord. Additionally, AT1R blockade impaired the expression of CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10, and reduced CCL2-induced APC migration. Our findings suggest a pivotal role of the RAS in autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system and identify RAS blockade as a potential new target for multiple sclerosis therapy.",

The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and promoted antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases.",

We have now investigated the enzymatic routs by which Ang II is converted to Ang-(3-4). Membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases and neprilysin were identified using fluorescent substrates. HPLC showed that Plummer's inhibitor but not Z-pro-prolinal blocks Ang II metabolism, suggesting that carboxypeptidase N catalyzes the conversion Ang II--> Ang-(1-7). Different combinations of bestatin, thiorphan, Plummer's inhibitor, Ang II and Ang-(1-5), and use of short proteolysis times, indicate that Ang-(1-7)--> Ang-(1-5)--> Ang-(1-4)--> Ang-(3-4) is a major route. When Ang III was combined with the same inhibitors, the following pathway was demonstrated: Ang III--> Ang IV--> Ang-(3-4). Ca(2+)-ATPase assays with different Ang II concentrations and different peptidase inhibitors confirm the existence of these pathways in BLM and show that a prolyl-carboxypeptidase may be an alternative catalyst for converting Ang II to Ang-(1-7). Overall, we demonstrated that BLM have all the peptidase machinery required to produce Ang-(3-4) in the vicinity of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, enabling a local RAS axis to effect rapid modulation of active Ca(2+) fluxes.", 
    "815": "Although women account for a significant proportion of the growing heart failure epidemic, they have been poorly represented in clinical trials. As emerging epidemiologic data reveal a growing prevalence and burden of disease among women, it is increasingly important that treating physicians and researchers recognize sex-based differences. Despite the overall incidence of heart failure being lower in women compared with men, the magnitude of improvement in survival over the last several decades has been less apparent in women. Women with heart failure are more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While clinical trials have demonstrated improved outcomes among heart failure patients, they have predominantly included men, yielding results that are sometimes inadequately powered to detect a benefit for women. Without adequate representation of women in clinical trials, one cannot assume that the same level of therapeutic evidence also applies to women. Nonetheless, it appears that beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide the same survival benefits in women with systolic dysfunction as in men. In addition, some studies suggest that angiotensin-receptor blockers may lead to a better survival in women when compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Focused research is needed to understand and guide the management of women with heart failure.",

    "844": "Alterations within the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) are pivotal for the development of renal disease. ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is expressed in the kidney and converts the vasoconstrictor AngII (angiotensin II) into Ang-(1-7), a peptide with vasodilatory and anti-fibrotic actions. Although the expression of ACE2 in the diabetic kidney has been well studied, little is known about its expression in non-diabetic renal disease. In the present study, we assessed ACE2 in rats with acute kidney injury induced by STNx (subtotal nephrectomy). STNx and Control rats received vehicle or ramipril (1 mg. kg (-1) of body weight . day (-1), and renal ACE, ACE2 and mas receptor gene and protein expression were measured 10 days later. STNx rats were characterized by polyuria, proteinuria, hypertension and elevated plasma ACE2 activity (all P<0.01) and plasma Ang-(1-7) (P<0.05) compared with Control rats. There was increased cortical ACE binding and medullary mas receptor expression (P<0.05), but reduced cortical and medullary ACE2 activity in the remnant kidney (P<0.05 and P<0.001 respectively) compared with Control rats. In STNx rats, ramipril reduced blood pressure (P<0.01), polyuria (P<0.05)and plasma ACE2 (P<0.01), increased plasma Ang-(1-7) (P<0.001), and inhibited renal ACE(P<0.001). Ramipril increased both cortical and medullary ACE2 activity (P<0.01), but reduced medullary mas receptor expression (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results show that ACE2 activity is reduced in kidney injury and that ACE inhibition produced beneficial effects in association with increased renal ACE2 activity. As ACE2 both degrades AngII and generates the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), a decrease in renal ACE2 activity, as observed in the present study, has the potential to contribute to the progression of kidney disease.",

The primary mechanism of action of ARBs is the selective blockade of the AT(1) receptor. There are 7 ARBs presently approved for clinical use in the United States, several with other indications in addition to blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension. While ARBs appear to be no more potent than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for lowering blood pressure when used as monotherapy, they are a beneficial alternative and even compelling in certain populations. This class of agents also has the added benefit of placebo-like side effects, potentially enhancing adherence. In this review, studies are presented as positive evidence supporting the use of ARBs in special populations (including persons with diabetic nephropathy), in patients with heart failure (especially with systolic dysfunction), for cardioprotection in high-risk cardiac patients (including postmyocardial infarction and stroke), and for delaying new-onset diabetes. Clinical information on the effects of ARBs related to race and ethnicity are also discussed, although the data in most large trials are not substantial. Despite the fact that African American patients have the highest prevalence of hypertension (with increased mortality and morbidity), studies have been less robust regarding ARBs and protection against cardiovascular disease in this population.

    "855": "High blood pressure (HBP) is one of the most prevalent conditions seen today by clinicians, affecting an estimated 73 million--or 1 in 3--adult Americans, only one third of whom have achieved control of their hypertension (HBP). Central to the management of this pervasive medical condition are the issues of accurate diagnosis and maintaining control through appropriate treatment. Accurate diagnosis depends primarily on reliable measurement. Over the years, it has become increasingly recognized that blood pressure (BP) measurement occurring in clinical settings produces far less accurate and reliable readings than do other methods, notably 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and home BP measurement. Beyond technique, there are additional challenges to obtaining accurate readings, including emotional factors that produce either falsely elevated or lowered results, having the potential to mislead the clinician. The need to overcome obstacles to proper diagnosis and determine effective treatments has reached heightened urgency, especially for patients with compelling comorbidities such as diabetes, renal disease, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. The continuing evolution of the management of HBP is reflected in updated guidelines from the American Heart Association and evidence-based information stemming from recent studies and randomized clinical trials. The appropriate selection of antihypertensive agents, at the proper doses, is a complex issue requiring greater understanding of our pharmacologic options. The contributions of some of the more recent and salient studies and trials are mentioned here, although there is no attempt in this brief review to match drug classes with compelling indications. The trials discussed involve such pharmacologic treatments as diuretic therapy, alpha-blockers, conventional beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Trial outcomes shed light on the relative benefits and drawbacks of these agents, often within the context of various patient characteristics such as age, comorbidities, and risk status. Successful management of HBP is a multi-faceted and ongoing endeavor, in which developing knowledge constantly tempered by new questions moves us toward the goal of improving the lives of our patients.", 
    "856": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) overactivity is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, a finding that may be explained by the key role of the RAAS in stimulating vascular and cardiac remodeling. Inhibition of RAAS activity with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and heart failure in high-risk patients without heart failure. These findings led to the evaluation of the ARB telmisartan versus the ACE inhibitor ramipril in the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), a cardioprotection trial conducted in high-risk patients without left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. The results of this trial showed that the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the ARB telmisartan are equally effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients without heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction but at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). These results confirm that RAAS inhibition, using ACE inhibitors or ARBs, is an effective approach to reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients without heart failure who are at high risk for CVD.",

Sensitivity analyses showed 30.2% probability of ACEi being not cost-effective in the ACE II/ID group, against an almost 100% probability of cost-effectiveness in the ACE DD group. A selective screen-and-treat strategy should incorporate an alternative therapy for patients with the ACE II/ID genotype with an at least 9.1% increase in survival time compared with ACEi therapy to be cost-effective.

    "865": "In Ireland, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death. However, blood pressure (BP) goal achievement is unsatisfactory. The authors aimed to document BP control and increase awareness. A total of 1534 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 64.7+/-11.9 years (53.8% women). Duration of hypertension was 8.7+/-7.7 years, and 14.6% had diabetes, 13.8% had coronary artery disease, and 40.5% were taking antihypertensive monotherapy. beta-Blockers (39.8%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (32.2%), and angiotensin receptor blockers (22.0%) were prescribed most frequently. Mean BP was 136.0+/-6.1 mm Hg/89.5+/-5.0 mm Hg in nondiabetic patients (48.6% <140/90 mm Hg) and 131.0+/-7.4 mm Hg/81.7+/-4.6 mm Hg in diabetic patients (16.7% <130/80 mm Hg). Diet, exercise, and lifestyle modifications (63.5%) were frequently recommended. Increased patient awareness and compliance together with the adherence of physicians to current guidelines and greater willingness to take action in patients with uncontrolled hypertension should help in improving BP control and thus reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "866": "Deciding who to treat should be based on estimation of the total cardiovascular risk, not just the blood pressure (BP), so that patients with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk of cardiovascular disease should have their BP lowered even though it may be in the \"normal range\". Drug treatment should build upon effective lifestyle measures. Meta-analyses from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration have shown that differences between drug classes are quite small, even across different age groups, compared to the benefits of maximizing the reduction in BP, especially the systolic pressure. The major guidelines now recommend a focus on building effective drug combinations rather than arguing about which drug to use, and they approve initiation of treatment with combinations in high risk groups. While clinical trials have demonstrated some differences in the efficacy of individual drug classes in reducing cause specific outcomes such as coronary disease, stroke or heart failure, there are still very few comparisons between drug combinations. Our own preferred combinations include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and diuretics, which comprise my first choice for Caucasians and Asians, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) which are best used with diuretics when ACEI are not tolerated. ACEI and calcium channel blockers (CCB) are also very effective and CCB and diuretics are preferred for black subjects or those with isolated systolic hypertension. Combinations to avoid in patients with uncomplicated hypertension include ACEI and beta-blockers and ACEI and ARBs, since their beneficial effects are not additive.", 
    "867": "Although a low prevalence of cancer in hypertensive patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was reported, the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. It is known that the Angiotensin- II (Ang- II) plays a fundamental role not only as a vasoconstrictor in controlling blood pressure and electrolyte/fluid homeostasis, but also as a mitogenic factor through the Ang- II type-1 (AT1) receptor in cardiovascular cells. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in the development of various cancers. Ang- II has been demonstrated to be a cytokine, especially acting as a growth factor. Of interest, the physiological function of Ang- II seems to be similar in prostate cancer and stromal cells as we previously reported. AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), a class of anti hypertensive agent, have the potential to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors through the AT1 receptor. We conducted a pilot clinical study to examine whether ARBs were able to elicit an anti proliferative effect on prostate cancer clinically, resulting in a PSA decline of hormone refractory cancer or delaying PSA progression after radical prostatectomy. As a number of investigators have clarified that Ang- II induces oxidative stress in vascular cells, we reported the hypothesis that Ang- II generated in the prostate gland maybe a cause of oxidative stress linked to prostatic carcinogenesis. This review provides an insight into the key role of Ang- II and AT1 receptor, and the possibility of ARBs for molecular targeting of mitogenesis and angiogenesis in prostate cancer.",

It was found that CAP possessed the highest ability to donate the hydrogen atom in -SH to DPPH and galvinoxyl, while 6-MPR had the strongest ability to reduce ABTS(+)(*). In the process of protecting DNA and erythrocytes against AAPH-induced oxidation, CAP can trap 0.5 and 1.3 radicals, 6-MP can trap 0.6 and 2.2, and 6-MPR can trap 1.0 and 3.0 radicals, respectively.

Failure of VSMCs to acquire and maintain the contractile phenotype plays a key role in a number of major human diseases, including arteriosclerosis. Although several regulatory circuits that control differentiation of SMCs have been identified, the decisive mechanisms that govern phenotypic modulation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse miR-143/145 cluster, expression of which is confined to SMCs during development, is required for VSMC acquisition of the contractile phenotype. VSMCs from miR-143/145-deficient mice were locked in the synthetic state, which incapacitated their contractile abilities and favored neointimal lesion development. Unbiased high-throughput, quantitative, mass spectrometry-based proteomics using reference mice labeled with stable isotopes allowed identification of miR-143/145 targets; these included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which might affect both the synthetic phenotype and contractile functions of VSMCs. Pharmacological inhibition of either ACE or the AT1 receptor partially reversed vascular dysfunction and normalized gene expression in miR-143/145-deficient mice. We conclude that manipulation of miR-143/145 expression may offer a new approach for influencing vascular repair and attenuating arteriosclerotic pathogenesis.",

The aim of this article is to review the current literature and propose the optimal treatment regimen in patients with all three disease states. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) should be universally administered. High-dose statin therapy to reach a target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 70-100 mg/dL is advocated, although patients with a history of cerebral bleeding must be carefully monitored for possible recurrence. Beta-blockers are appropriate after a recent coronary event, and amlodipine or thiazide diuretics should be used after a recent stroke (within 6 months). Patients with a history of stroke (with or without coexisting CAD and CKD) should receive aspirin (75-150 mg/day) indefinitely. Clopidogrel or aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) may be prescribed in patients allergic or resistant to aspirin. If stroke is attributable to cardiogenic embolism, anticoagulation is indicated. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (excluding ST-elevated myocardial infarct) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), aspirin plus clopidogrel is indicated for secondary prevention for up to 12 months. There are no data supporting the use of aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients with CKD who develop ACS. Aspirin plus clopidogrel is contraindicated for stroke prevention.",

CHD patients must achieve the highest grade of treatment implementation and risk factors control. The aims were to describe differences in medical treatment of CHD according to the medical specialities. For this purpose we conducted an observational, cross-sectional, and multicenter study of CHD patients attended by internal medicine (IM), outpatient clinic cardiologist (OCC), hospital cardiologist (HC), and general practitioners (PC). Burden of noncardiac diseases was evaluated by the Charlson index. Joint prescription of antiplatelets, statins, beta-blockade agents and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) was considered optimal medical treatment (OMT). A total of 2987 patients, mean age 67.4 (11.5) years and 71.5% males, were analyzed. Patients visited by IM physicians had slightly higher mean age and higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and noncardiac diseases (median Charlson index 3.0, 1.0-5.0, vs. 2.0, 1.0-4.0, of total sample). OMT was prescribed in 25.9% (95% CI 25.6-26.2) of the patients and was statistically more frequently carried out by HC (32.1%) and OCC (29.0%) compared to IM (22.0%) and PC practitioners (21.5%). Multivariate analysis showed an independent association between OMT prescription and HC (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.08-1.87) or OCC (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.04-1.67); this association remained after including the Charlson index.

We aimed to investigate the association between antihypertensive drugs and NOD. This was a retrospective cohort study performed using data from claim forms provided to the central region branch of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan from January 2002 to December 2007. Prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs before the index date were retrieved from a prescription database. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of NOD associated with antihypertensive drug use; nondiabetic subjects served as the reference group. A total of 4233 NOD cases were identified in 24,688 hypertensive patients during the study period. The risk of NOD after adjusting for sex and age was higher among users of diuretics (OR = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.01-1.20), beta-blockers (BBS; OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.21), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs; OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18) than among nonusers.

    "882": "Proteases constitute one of the primary targets in drug discovery. In the present review, we focus on extracellular proteases (ECPs) because of their differential expression in many pathophysiological processes, including cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and inflammatory, pulmonary, and periodontal diseases. Many new ECP inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation and a significant increase in new therapies based on protease inhibition can be expected in the coming years. In addition to directly blocking the activity of a targeted protease, one can take advantage of differential expression in disease states to selectively deliver therapeutic or imaging agents. Recent studies in targeted drug development for the metalloproteases (matrix metalloproteinases, adamalysins, pappalysins, neprilysin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, metallocarboxypeptidases, and glutamate carboxypeptidase II), serine proteases (elastase, coagulation factors, tissue/urokinase plasminogen activator system, kallikreins, tryptase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV) and cysteine proteases (cathepsin B) are discussed herein.", 
    "883": "The plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) plays a critical role in human physiology. The KKS encompasses coagulation factor XII (FXII), the complex of prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). The conversion of plasma prekallikrein to kallikrein by the activated FXII and in response to numerous different stimuli leads to the generation of bradykinin (BK) and activated HK (HKa, an antiangiogenic peptide). BK is a proinflammatory peptide, a pain mediator and potent vasodilator, leading to robust accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. Systemic production of BK, HKa with the interplay between BK bound-BK receptors and the soluble form of HKa are key to angiogenesis and hemodynamics. KKS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation, hypertension, endotoxemia, and coagulopathy. In all these cases increased BK levels is the hallmark. In some cases, the persistent production of BK due to the deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor, which controls FXII, is detrimental to the survival of the patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). In others, the inability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to degrade BK leads to elevated BK levels and edema in patients on ACE inhibitors. Thus, the mechanisms that interfere with BK liberation or degradation would lead to blood pressure dysfunction. In contrast, anti-kallikrein treatment could have adverse effects in hemodynamic changes induced by vasoconstrictor agents. Genetic models of kallikrein deficiency are needed to evaluate the quantitative role of kallikrein and to validate whether strategies designed to activate or inhibit kallikrein may be important for regulating whole-body BK sensitivity.", 
    "884": "Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. It has been linked to each of the known atherogenic risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cigarette smoking, menopause, etc. A number of recent studies have shown that the severity of endothelial dysfunction correlates with the development of coronary artery disease and predicts future cardiovascular events. Therefore, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction may be an early stage of coronary atherosclerosis. This phenomenon primarily reflects an imbalance between the vasodilating (nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor agents (endothelin-1). Several invasive (intracoronary or intrabrachial infusions of vasoacting agents) and non-invasive techniques (assessment of flow mediated vasodilatation in the brachial artery by ultrasound) have been developed during the last few years to evaluate endothelial function in the coronary and peripheral circulation. This new methodology has allowed assessing the severity of the abnormalities in vascular function and their regression by several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It is likely that restoration of endothelial function can regress the atherosclerotic disease process and prevent future cardiovascular events. Most pharmacological interventions attempting to improve endothelial dysfunction targeted the risk factors linked to endothelial dysfunction: hypertension (ACE-inhibitors, calcium antagonists), dyslipidaemia (lipid-lowering agents) and menopause (estrogens). Nevertheless, several pharmacological agents have been suggested to achieve vascular protection through different mechanisms beyond their primary therapeutic actions: ACE-inhibitors, statins, third generation of beta-blockers (nebivolol), endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthesis (tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4) and antioxidants agents. In this review we will focus on the current pharmacological management of the endothelial dysfunction.",

The NADPH oxidase constitutes a major source of superoxide anion in phagocytic cells, and its activation is associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 secretion by these cells. We investigated the effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan and its metabolites (EXP3174 and EXP3179) on NADPH oxidase activity and MMP-9 secretion in human phagocytic cells. EXP3179, but not losartan and EXP3174, dose-dependently inhibited (P<0.05) phorbol myristate acetate and insulin-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity. EXP3179 also inhibited phorbol myristate acetate-induced NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells. In addition, EXP3179 inhibited (P<0.05) both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated p47phox translocation from cytosol to membranes and protein kinase C activity. Affinity experiments and enzymatic assays confirmed that EXP3179 inhibited several protein kinase C isoforms. EXP3179 also inhibited (P<0.05) phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated MMP-9 secretion. In a study performed in 153 hypertensive patients, phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity was lower (P<0.05) in losartan-treated compared with untreated patients and in patients treated with other angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists or with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Plasma levels of MMP-9 were lower (P<0.05) in losartan-treated hypertensives compared with the other group of patients. Thus, EXP3179 acts as a blocker of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells by a potential mechanism that targets the protein kinase C signaling pathway. This effect can be involved in reduced MMP-9 secretion by these cells. It is proposed that the EXP3179 metabolite may confer to losartan the specific capacity to reduce oxidative stress mediated by phagocytic cells in hypertensive patients.",

Here, to understand the in vivo antihypertensive effects of well-characterized two peptides, Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), DNA microarray was used to analyze gene expression in SHRs fed these peptides for 5 days. By using an Affymetrix analyzer, gene profiling was performed in a target organ, the aorta, of SHRs after repeated administration of VPP and IPP for 5 days. The changes in gene expression were relatively mild; therefore, among the analyzed genes associated with blood pressure, those that showed changes over +/- 5% as compared to the control group were categorized as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, vascular function, arachidonic acid system, blood coagulation system, and cytokines and growth factors. Significant and marked differences were detected for the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene (1.89-fold, P<0.05) and the connexin 40 (gap junction 40) gene (2.81-fold, P<0.05). Administration of VPP and IPP led to a slight increase in the expression of the cyclooxigenase (COX-1) gene and a decrease in the expression of both the nuclear factor kappa B subunit (NF-kappaB) gene for vascular function and the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene.

Graft function and serum potassium level did not change significantly, two children developed mild hyperkalemia. Ramipril can reduce proteinuria in most transplanted children; its antiproteinuric effect is exhibited even without BP lowering effect.", 
    "900": "The propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have the same distribution of observed baseline characteristics. Four methods of using the propensity score have been described in the literature: stratification on the propensity score, propensity score matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. However, the relative ability of these methods to reduce systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects has not been examined. The authors used an empirical case study and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the relative ability of the 4 methods to balance baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects. They used standardized differences in the propensity score matched sample and in the weighted sample. For stratification on the propensity score, within-quintile standardized differences were computed comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects within the same quintile of the propensity score. These quintile-specific standardized differences were then averaged across the quintiles. For covariate adjustment, the authors used the weighted conditional standardized absolute difference to compare balance between treated and untreated subjects. In both the empirical case study and in the Monte Carlo simulations, they found that matching on the propensity score and weighting using the inverse probability of treatment eliminated a greater degree of the systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects compared with the other 2 methods. In the Monte Carlo simulations, propensity score matching tended to have either comparable or marginally superior performance compared with propensity-score weighting.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi), cornerstone for pharmacologic risk factor management in PAD patients, might also be interesting by protecting skeletal muscle energetic. We therefore determined whether chronic ACEi might reduce ischemia-induced mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in the frequent setting of hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion. Ischemic legs of rats submitted to 5 h ischemia induced by a rubber band tourniquet applied on the root of the hindlimb followed by reperfusion without (IR, n = 11) or after ACEi (n = 14; captopril 40 mg/kg per day during 28 days before surgery) were studied and compared to that of sham-operated animals (n = 11). The effect of ACEi on the non-ischemic contralateral leg was also determined in the ACEi group. Maximal oxidative capacities (V(max)) and complexes I, II and IV activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of the gastrocnemius muscle were determined using glutamate-malate, succinate and TMPD-ascorbate substrates. Arterial blood pressure was significantly decreased after ACEi (124 +/- 2.8 vs. 108 +/- 4.19 mmHg; P = 0.01). Ischemia-reperfusion reduced V(max) (4.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.5 micromol O2/min/g dry weight, -49%, P < 0.001), affecting mitochondrial complexes I, II and IV activities. ACEi failed to modulate ischemia-induced dysfunction (V(max) 5.1 +/- 0.7 micromol O2/min/g dry weight) or the non-ischemic contralateral muscle respiratory rate. Ischemia-reperfusion significantly impaired the mitochondrial respiratory chain I, II and IV complexes of skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic pre-treatment with ACEi did not prevent or increase such alterations. Further studies might be useful to improve the pharmacologic conditioning of PAD patients needing arterial revascularization.",

We wished to ascertain how these improvements have been implemented in our hospitals in the year 2003.",

The community-based Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome for the City of Zagreb for the year 2003 served as the source of data. Records on 1,733 ACS patients were analyzed. In 1,349 hospitalized patients, the following parameters were investigated: length of hospital stay; time from onset of symptoms to arrival in hospital; rate of angiography and reperfusion and medical therapy after discharge.",

    "911": "The objective of prehospital care of patients with acute coronary syndrom (ACS) [acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA)], is prompt diagnosis of the acute myocardial infarction, patient's risk assessment, drug administration in order to reduce patient's pain and fear, and prevention or treatment of heart failure. In hospital treatment therapeutic procedures include reperfusion therapy, limitation of infarction zone, treatment of complications (heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias), prevention of reinfarction, heart failure and eventually prevention of sudden cardiac death. Acute therapeutic procedures include revascularization, anti-ischemic and antithrombolytic treatment, possible surgical revascularization and treatment of complications (arrhythmias, heart failure). The patients with STEMI that present within 3-12 hours from the onset of chest pain should undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In case of presentation within 3 hours from the occurrence of chest pain, the administration of thrombolytic therapy in this period is equally efficient as PCI. Regardless of reperfusion regimen, the anti-ischemics administered including nitrates (nitroglycerin); intravenous analgesics (morphine-sulfate); O2 2-4 L/min; beta-adrenergic blockers; calcium channel blockers; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I); magnesium and glucose-insulin-potassium have proved to be efficient as shown by study results and clinical experience. The mechanism of action of anti-ischemics includes reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption achieved by a decrease of heart frequency, reduction of systemic blood pressure and reduction in myocardial contractility by vasodilatation and consequent better myocardial oxygen supply. The outstanding results of major clinical studies are presented, and main guidelines for anti-ischemic therapy of ACS adopted by the international professional associations are set forth.",

Renal biopsy is often mandatory, except in diabetes. Depending on aetiology specific treatment, often with immunosuppressive agents, may be implemented. In any cases nonspecific treatment should be started with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

However, the exact mechanisms linking the CD40/CD40L system and the soluble form of CD40 ligand (sCD40L) with atherothrombosis are currently a topic of intensive research. CD40L and sCD40L belong to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, and they are molecules with a dual prothrombotic and proinflammatory role. They are expressed in a variety of tissues such as the immune system (in both B and T cells), the vascular wall, and activated platelets. Soluble CD40L has multiple autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine actions, and it may trigger key mechanisms participating in atherothrombosis. CD40/CD40L may participate in the development of coronary atherosclerosis and the triggering of acute coronary syndromes, while sCD40L seems to have a prognostic role not only in subjects with advanced atherosclerosis but also in the general population. Although conventional cardiovascular medication such as antiplatelet therapy, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and many others have been shown to reduce both sCD40L and cardiovascular risk, it is still unclear whether specific treatments targeting the CD40/CD40L system will prove to be beneficial against atherothrombosis in the near future.",

    "923": "Acute phosphate nephropathy (APhN) is a clinical pathological entity characterized by acute and subsequent chronic renal failure following exposure to oral sodium phosphate (OSP) bowel purgatives. Renal biopsy findings include acute and chronic tubular injury with prominent tubular and interstitial calcium phosphate deposits. Risk factors for APhN include older age, female gender, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. The pathomechanism of APhN involves hypovolemia-induced avid proximal salt and water reabsorption, delivery of a large phosphate load to the distal nephron, and precipitation of calcium phosphate in the distal tubule and collecting duct. To date, 37 cases of biopsy-proven APhN have been reported, and epidemiologic studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) following the use of OSP purgatives. OSP solution was withdrawn from the market in December of 2008, but OSP tablets, offered by prescription only, remain available. Prevention of APhN is best achieved by avoiding OSP in high-risk patients, aggressive hydration before, during, and after OSP administration, minimizing the dose of OSP, and maintaining a minimum of a 12 h interval between OSP administrations.", 
    "924": "In the present study, we evaluated the effect of simultaneously blocking angiotensin II synthesis and endothelin (ET)-1 activity as a multimodal intervention to implement renoprotection in overt diabetic nephropathy. Mechanisms underlying combined therapy effectiveness were addressed by investigating podocyte structure and function and glomerular barrier size-selective properties. Uninephrectomized rats made diabetic by streptozotocin received orally placebo, lisinopril (12.5 mg/l), the ET(A) receptor antagonist avosentan (30 mg/kg), or their combination from 4 (when animals had proteinuria) to 8 mo. Proteinuria, renal damage, podocyte number, nephrin expression, and glomerular size selectivity by graded-size Ficoll molecule fractional clearance were assessed. Combined therapy normalized proteinuria, provided complete protection from tubulointerstitial damage, and induced regression of glomerular lesions, while only a partial renoprotection was achieved by each drug alone. Lisinopril plus avosentan restored to normal values the number of podocytes. Single therapies only limited podocyte depletion. Defective nephrin expression of diabetes was prevented by each drug. Altered glomerular size selectivity to large macromolecules of diabetic rats was remarkably improved by lisinopril and the combined treatment. Avosentan ameliorated peritubular capillary architecture and reduced interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. The ACE inhibitor and ET(A) receptor antagonist induced regression of glomerular lesions in overt diabetic nephropathy. Regression of renal disease was conceivably the result of the synergistic effect of the ACE inhibitor of preserving glomerular permselective properties and the ET(A) antagonist in improving tubulointerstitial changes. These findings provide mechanistic insights to explain the antiproteinuric effect of this combined therapy in diabetes.", 
    "925": "1. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during pregnancy is contraindicated because of their association with increased risks of fetopathy, including central nervous systems malformations. In addition, some reports have shown that renin-angiotensin system components are expressed differently during embryonic development and adulthood in the rat. 2. Because angiotensin II and its derivative peptides have been implicated in anxiety and modulation of nociception, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether inhibiting ACE during prenatal and neonatal periods would alter behavioural plasticity in adult male offspring rats. 3. Female Wistar rats were treated with captopril (2 mg/mL water; approximately 200 mg/kg per day) during pregnancy and lactation. At adulthood, the offspring were subjected to the open field, elevated plus maze, social interaction, forced swimming and tail flick tests. 4. Perinatal captopril treatment significantly increased ambulation (33%; P < 0.05) and decreased resting time (37.5%; P < 0.05) in the open field test. Perinatal captopril treatment did not alter any of the behavioural parameters of the elevated plus maze; however, captopril treatment did cause a significant increase in social interaction (75.3%; P < 0.05). In the forced swimming test, there was an increased latency period (102.9%; P < 0.001) and a decreased immobility period (38.7, P < 0.05) in rats treated with perinatal captopril. In the tail flick test, perinatal captopril treatment significantly reduced the latency time (26.3%; P < 0.01). 5. The data show that ACE inhibition during prenatal and neonatal periods affects behavioural responses in adult offspring rats, suggesting that ACE is required for the development of neural systems that are associated with adult anxiety and nociceptive behavioural responses.", 
    "926": "In the UK and other developed nations, hypertension and its vascular complications are more common in ethnically African and South-Asian communities compared with Europeans. While these conditions are less common in rural India and Africa, they present a rising problem in expanding cities in all developing countries. Hypertension is, therefore, mainly related to environmental and lifestyle factors rather than genetically determined racial differences. Studies in the USA and elsewhere show that the striking differences in the prevalence of hypertension between people of African and European origin are greatly reduced after adjustment for socio-economic status. One important and probably genuine racial difference between ethnic groups is the significantly suppressed activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in African-origin hypertensive patients. As a consequence of this, they are rather more sensitive to a low-salt diet but significantly less sensitive to drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers) and beta-blockers. There is also evidence that renin suppression is common in Japanese and Chinese hypertensive patients as well, although no direct comparisons between these two groups with European-origin patients have been carried out. The management and control of hypertension is unsatisfactory in all ethnic groups and all nations. No one group needs particular targeting; all need better quality systematic care.",

In the past, fixed-drug combinations included a diuretic with another antihypertensive drug. Recently, combinations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers mostly with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been developed and approved for the treatment of hypertension. One of these, olmesartan medoxomil in combination with amlodipine besylate has been shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of hypertension. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Combination of Olmesartan medoxomil and Amlodipine besylate in Controlling High blood pressure [COACH]) of 1940 patients, the high-dose combinations of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate 40/10 mg/day reduced the sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 29/19 mmHg from baseline (p < 0.001) and resulted in 54% of patients achieving blood pressure goals. It also decreased the pedal edema induced by amlodipine monotherapy 10 mg/day by 36.1%. This drug combination, besides being effective, is also safe and well tolerated.",

Clinically and chronologically, post-stroke pneumonia is divided into two types of aspiration pneumonia. First, acute-onset post-stroke pneumonia occurs within 1 month after stroke. Second, insidious or chronic-onset post-stroke pneumonia occurs 1 month after the stroke. The mechanisms of pneumonia are apparent aspiration and dysphagia-associated microaspiration. Stroke and the post-stroke state are the most significant risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. The preventive and therapeutic strategies have been developed thoroughly and appropriate antibiotic use, and both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment of post-stroke pneumonia have been studied rigorously. Increases in substance P levels, oral care, and swallowing rehabilitation are necessary to improve swallowing function in post-stroke patients, resulting in a reduction in the incidence of post-stroke pneumonia in a chronic stage. The stroke must be a cause of aspiration pneumonia.",

Blockade of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II (ANG-II) receptor blockers (ARBs) lowers blood pressure, decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, and decreases proteinuria and the rate of decline in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although these drugs are highly effective and are widely used in the management of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, current treatment regimens with ACEIs and ARBs may not completely suppress the RAAS. Combinations of ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to be superior to either agent alone for some, but certainly not all, composite cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. With the growing appreciation of the role of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of cardiorenal diseases and the recent approval of the direct renin inhibitor (DRI), aliskiren, additional combination strategies have emerged that may offer novel ways to more fully suppress the RAAS. This review examines what is presently known about ACEI/ARB combination therapy and explores alternative combination strategies that include DRIs and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs).", 
    "946": "Angio-oedema (AE) is a known adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Over the past several decades, evidence of failure to diagnose this important and potentially fatal reaction is commonly found in the literature. Because this reaction is often seen first in the primary care setting, a review was undertaken to analyse and document the keys to both diagnostic criteria as well as to investigate potential risk factors for ACE-I AE occurrence. A general review of published literature was conducted through Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database, targeting ACE-I-related AE pathomechanism, diagnosis, epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical decision making and treatment. The incidence and severity of AE appears to be on the rise and there is evidence of considerable delay in diagnosis contributing to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. The mechanism of AE due to ACE-I drugs is not fully understood, but some genomic and metabolomic information has been correlated. Additional epidemiologic data and clinical treatment outcome predictors have been evaluated, creating a basis for future work on the development of clinical prediction tools to aid in risk identification and diagnostic differentiation. Accurate recognition of AE by the primary care provider is essential to limit the rising morbidity associated with ACE-I treatment-related AE. Research findings on the phenotypic indicators relevant to this group of patients as well as basic research into the pathomechanism of AE are available, and should be used in the construction of better risk analysis and clinical diagnostic tools for ACE-I AE.", 
    "947": "Human somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a membrane-bound dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that contains two extracellular domains (N and C). Although highly homologous, they exhibit different substrate and inhibition profiles. The phosphinic inhibitors RXPA380 and RXP407 are highly selective for the C- and N-domains, respectively. A number of residues, implicated by structural data, are likely to contribute to this selectivity. However, the extent to which these different interactions are responsible for domain selectivity is unclear. In this study, a series of C- and N-domain mutants containing conversions to corresponding domain residues were used to scrutinize the contribution of these residues to selective inhibitor binding. Enzyme kinetic analyses of the purified mutants indicated that the RXPA380 C-selectivity is particularly reliant on the interaction between the P2 substituent and Phe 391 (testis ACE numbering). Moreover, a C-domain mutant in which Phe 391 has been changed to a Tyr residue, in addition to containing an N-domain S2' pocket (S2'F/Y), displayed the greatest shift toward a more N-domain-like Ki. None of the single mutations within the N-domain caused a large shift in RXP407's affinity for these enzymes. However, the double mutant containing the Tyr 369 to Phe change as well as Arg 381 to Glu displayed a 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, confirming that the S2 pocket plays a major role in RXP407 selectivity. Taken together, these data advance our understanding regarding the molecular basis for the remarkable ACE domain selectivity exhibited by these inhibitors.", 
    "948": "Loss of physical function in older adults may be, at least in part, explained by sarcopenia, a phenomenon characterized by a reduction in number and size of muscle fibres and by increase in interstitial fat and connective tissue. Lifestyle intervention (i.e. physical activity and nutrition) have shown to impact on sarcopenia. However, several drugs were suggested, with various levels of scientific evidence, to have an impact on muscle outcomes. In this study we reviewed the effect of six classes of drugs on sarcopenia and muscular outcomes in older adults. We decided to focus our review on two commonly drugs which have recently showed promising effects on muscular outcomes in older adults (ACE inhibitors and statins) and on four drugs whose effect on skeletal muscle was already largely studied (creatine, Growth Hormone, testosterone, estrogens and tibolone).", 
    "949": "Until recently, it was assumed that hereditary angioedema was a disease resulting exclusively from a genetic deficiency of the C1 inhibitor. In 2000, families with hereditary angioedema, normal C1 inhibitor activity, and protein in plasma were described. Since then, numerous patients and families with this condition have been reported. Most of the patients were women. In many of the affected women, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy containing estrogens, and pregnancies triggered the clinical symptoms. In some families, mutations in the coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) gene were detected in the affected persons."
