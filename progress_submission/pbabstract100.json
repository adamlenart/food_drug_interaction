    "0": "The chronic administration of captopril to Sprague-Dawley rats was performed under the barrier system by feeding ad libitum with mixed diet in various concentrations of captopril with 3 months recovery period. The number of animals was 180 female and 180 male including 5 groups of control, 30, 100, 300 and 900 mg/kg/day. The maximum nontoxic dose was estimated as about 30 mg/kg/day for male but a little more than this for female rats. Body weight increase was significantly reduced in male but for the first 3 months in female rats. No death was ascribed to the toxic effect of captopril. Polydipsia and polyuria in male, and the significant increase in values of BUN and inorganic phosphate in both sexes were observed. The reduction in erythrocyte count, values of hemoglobin and hematocrit, hemosiderosis in reticulum cells of the spleen and Kupffer cells in the liver and the increase of erythropoieses indicated hemolytic anemia. Heart weight reduced while kidney weight increased. Pathological examination revealed hypertrophia and hyperplasia of JG cells and thickening of walls of afferent arterioles with hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells and increase of collagen fibers. Thickening of walls extended to walls of the interlobular arteries which remained after withdrawal of captopril for 3 months though JG granules attenuated. The age-related increases of incidences of proteinuria and myocardial fibrosis were attenuated dose-dependently which are probably due to hypotension induced by captopril.", 
    "1": "Subacute toxicity of captopril by daily oral administration at dose levels of 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, 900 mg/kg and 2700 mg/kg for one month was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2700 mg/kg group, 13 of 18 males and 17 of 18 females died with marked emaciation and abdominal distension. In the 900 mg/kg group, 1 of 18 males and 3 of 18 females died also during the administration period. In dead animals, a marked dilatation of gastrointestinal tract was noted showing multiple hemorrhagic erosions and/or ulcers in the glandular stomach. The remainder of these groups exhibited polydipsia and polyuria during the dosage period. In the 300 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg groups, all animals survived throughout the entire experimental period showing polydipsia and polyuria. In the 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups, all animals survived also throughout the entire dosage period without showing any toxic sign. Regarding plasma analysis, the BUN and creatinine concentration was significantly elevated in the group of 100 mg/kg or more. In the hematological examination, there was a decrease of erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin contents and hematocrit values in the group of 300 mg/kg or more. Pathological examinations revealed a marked thickening of the wall in afferent arterioles and interlobular arteries of the kidney in association with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells in 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, 900 mg/kg and 2700 mg/kg groups. In these groups, multiple hemorrhagic erosions with or without ulcer were also noted in the glandular stomach. In the spleen, a slight increase of extramedullary hematopoiesis and hemosiderosis was noted in the 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, 900 mg/kg and 2700 mg/kg groups, in which an increase of erythropoietic elements was also noted in the bone marrow. From these results, the maximum nontoxic dose was estimated as about 30 mg/kg/day by oral administration of captopril in the rats.", 
    "2": "The acute toxicity of captopril, a potential inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and ICR mice. In the oral administration, a decrease of spontaneous motor activity, lacrimation, salivation and decline of body temperature was noted in the rats and mice. In the mice, tarry stool was also noted. The LD50 was estimated as: 4249 mg/kg in male mice, 5050 mg/kg in female mice, 4336 mg/kg in male rats and 4245 mg/kg in female rats, In the dead animals, a hemorrhagic erosion or ulcer was recognized in the glandular stomach. An intravenous captopril in mice, caused immediate death by dyspnea in some animals within 3 minutes, but delayed death was also occurred within 24 hours showing a decrease of spontaneous motor activity and decline of body temperature. The LD50 was estimated as 3154 mg/kg in male mice and 3225 mg/kg in female mice. A single intravenous administration of captopril in dose of 1600 mg/kg did not cause any death in the rats of both sexes. The mice of both sexes well tolerated a single subcutaneous administration of captopril in a dose of 2400 mg/kg. No death occurred in rats of both sexes received subcutaneously captopril in a dose of 1200 mg/kg. At an injection site, a necrotic ulcer was noted in the skin of rats and mice which received subcutaneously captopril in a dose of 1600 mg/kg or more and 1200 mg/kg, respectively.", 
    "3": "To study effects on pituitary-adrenocortical activity of a sustained block of angiotensin II formation, six 'drug-resistant' patients with essential hypertension were studied before and during treatment with an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (Captopril, SQ 14,225). The drug was given in increasing doses (100-400 mg/day) for 2 weeks whilst patients received a moderately restricted sodium intake (60-80 mmol/day). Immunoreactive ACTH, cortisol, aldosterone, plasma renin activity (PRA) and the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were measured in blood samples drawn at 0800-0900 h. Urinary excretion of cortisol and aldosterone were measured in 24-h urine collections. Further information on pituitary-adreno-cortical function was obtained by measuring serial plasma corticosteroid levels after submaximal stimulation with a synthetic ACTH preparation. ACTH and cortisol did not change an observation which does not support the hypothesis that glucocorticoid activity is influenced by a decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentrations.", 
    "4": "1. The effects of the new oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor MK-421 on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, angiotensin-II, aldosterone and converting enzyme activity were assessed in 16 hypertensive patients followed for 6--18 weeks. 2. After an initial titration period, maintenance doses of 2.5--40 mg once daily produced satisfactory blood pressure control in 11 and a partial but significant decrease in the remainder. 3. Treatment was associated with no change in heart rate and no orthostatic hypotension. At 24 h after the first effective dose, blood pressure was still decreased, plasma ACE was suppressed to 16% of the baseline, plasma angiotensin to 58%, aldosterone to 42%, and plasma renin activity was elevated to 228% of the baseline. 4. Magnitude of blood pressure fall was significantly correlated with the height of pretreatment blood pressure but not with baseline levels of plasma renin activity.", 
    "5": "Normotensive and hypertensive headache sufferers were treated with D-phenylalanine, aprotinin or captopril--all inhibitors of endogenous opioid degradation. Inconsistent results were obtained using D-phenylalanine and aprotinin (acute administration at the start of a migraine attack). Satisfactory results were obtained by prophylactic treatment with captopril (an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme and of the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase--an enkephalin inactivating enzyme) compared with conventional drugs such as methysergide, lisuride, pizotifen, clonidine and beta-blocking agents. Excellent results were obtained with captopril on patients suffering from headache and arterial hypertension who had experienced no relief from beta-blocking agents and clonidine. Captopril could thus be a drug of choice in the therapy of headache associated with essential hypertension.", 
    "6": "(2R, 4R)-2-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3-mercaptopropionyl)-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (SA446) is a novel potent converting enzyme inhibitor having a sulfhydryl group in the molecule. SA446 inhibited the activity of semi-purified rabbit lung converting enzyme (IC50 = 6 nM). The contractile response of isolated guinea pig ileum to angiotensin I (AI) was markedly inhibited by SA446 (IC50 = 28 nM). On the other hand, SA446 augmented the contraction to bradykinin (BK) (AC50 = 0.7 nM), but did not affect the contraction caused by angiotensin II (AII), acetylcholine and histamine. These in vitro potencies of SA446 were 4 to 5 times larger than those of captopril. SA446 inhibited the pressor response to AI in rats (ID50 = 0.06 mg/kg, i.v., 0.48 mg/kg, p.o.) and dogs (ID50 = 0.01 mg/kg, i.v.). SA446 augmented the depressor response to BK (AD50 = 0.009 mg/kg, i.v.), but did not affect the pressor responses to AII and norepinephrine in rats. These in vivo activities of SA446 in dogs were more potent than those of captopril, but the reverse was seen in rats. Oral administration of SA446 had a hypotensive effect on two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats, at doses over 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. However, the blood pressure of normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was not affected by SA446, in doses up to 100 mg/kg. These results indicate that oral SA446 is a potent active inhibitor of converting enzyme and may be classed as an antihypertensive agent.", 
    "7": "Administration of Teprotide (SQ 20881), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor for up to 10 weeks at a dose of 3 mg. per kg., subcutaneously, twice a day in the rat, effected no change in the ultrastructure of the adrenal cortex nor in the concentration of serum aldosterone. A significant increase (p less than 0.05) in renin granulation indices which was already apparent after 3 weeks of treatment with Teprotide was even more definitive after 10 weeks (p less than 0.01). Moderate renal hypertrophy was present in rats receiving the drug for 3 weeks. Findings pertaining to aldosterone production differed from those reported following acute administration of Teprotide wherein a decrease in the production of serum aldosterone and an increase in plasma renin activity was observed. It has been suggested that decreased aldosterone production following acute administration of Teprotide is a consequence of decreased stimulus of the zona glomerulosa due to diminished synthesis of angiotensin II. If this is the case, mechanisms other than angiotensin II stimulation of the zona glomerulosa must control aldosterone synthesis, perhaps through hormones of the adrenal cortex. Another possibility could be that angiotensin II synthesis may be obtained, after an interval, through an alternative pathway.", 
    "8": "1. The kinetics of the inhibitory action of four different angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was evaluated in vitro with rat lung enzyme and the substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine. 2. Enzyme velocity against substrate concentration curves were fitted squares to hyperbolae by a weighted least squares iterative method to obtain apparent values of Km, Vmax. and K/V at each concentration of inhibitor. 3. The inhibitory constants Ki and Ki' were obtained by weighted linear regressions of K/V against i and 1/V against i respectively. 4. Teprotide was the least potent inhibitor with a Ki of near 20 nmol/l whereas captopril (SQ 14 225) and SA 446 were both approximately 10 times and MK 421 approximately 20 times more potent. 5. Two inhibitors which lacked thiol groups [teprotide or SQ 20 881 and N-(1-S-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-Ala-L-Pro or MK 421] produced a purely competitive pattern of inhibition with increased apparent Km but no change in apparent Vmax.. 6. Two inhibitors containing thiol groups [captopril or SQ 14 225 and 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3-mercaptopropanoyl)-4-thiazolidine carboxylic acid or SA 446] both produced a mixed competitive and non-competitive pattern of inhibition with increased apparent Km and decreased Vmax.. 7. It is possible that thiol-containing inhibitors might produce non-competitive inhibition of converting enzyme by forming strong bonds with zinc near the active site of the enzyme.", 
    "9": "1. Experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of converting enzyme inhibitors on autonomic nervous system function in the rat. 2. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, efferent postganglionic sympathetic activity and afferent nerve activity from the right renal nerves were recorded in anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing, non diuretic rats, either with an intact spinal cord or with a spinal cord transected at the T6 level, before, during and after intravenous injections of 0.5--1.0 mg/kg of teprotide or captopril. 3. After injection of drugs, efferent sympathetic nerve activity markedly increased and reached its peak value 4 min later, both in rats with an intact spinal cord (101 +/- 21% mean +/- SE, above the control discharge) and with a spinal cord transected at the T6 level (166 +/- 41%, above the control). 4. Afferent activity from the renal nerve, on the other hand, did not consistently change during converting enzyme blockade. 5. The results indicate that the efferent sympathetic excitation cannot be due either to a baroreceptor or to a renorenal reflex. This excitation might be responsible, at least in part, for the increase in renin secretion which follows the blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "10": "This review summarizes the available medical literature about plasma norepinephrine, which as been used as an indicator of sympathetic neural activity in clinical cardiology. Plasma norepinephrine levels are elevated myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and the norepinephrine concentration varies with severity of disease. Patients with ischemic heart disease at rest show essentially normal plasma norepinephrine, but no studies have assessed norepinephrine levels during spontaneously occurring typical angina pectoris. Plasma norepinephrine also is increased during hypertension occurring after coronary bypass surgery or repair of aortic coarctation. Propranolol increases plasma norepinephrine, and acute withdrawal of propranolol does not. Sodium restriction increases plasma norepinephrine in healthy persons, but no information is available about its effect on patients with congestive heart failure. Insufficient data are available to make strong inferences about sympathetic activity in cardiomyopathy, essential hypertension or pulmonary hypertension, and little or no information is available about plasma norepinephrine in ventricular fibrillation without myocardial infarction, the mitral valve prolapse syndrome, digoxin effect, syndromes associated with prolonged electrocardiographic Q-T interval and the hyperkinetic heart syndrome.", 
    "11": "Delayed cerebral vasospasm is an important determinant of the clinical outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage, but its prevention and treatment has met with limited success. Since cerebral arteries were found to be sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II, the possibility of angiotensin's contribution to this vasospasm was investigated. Delayed cerebral arterial spasm was documented angiographically 72 hours after introduction of blood in the subarachnoid space of dogs. Following injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, repeat cineangiograms at 30, 60, and 90 minutes demonstrated partial or total release of spasm of the basilar artery and its branches. It is concluded that angiotensin II participates in the delayed cerebral vasospasm after hemorrhage, and that angiotensin inhibition may release the spasm and prevent cerebral ischemia.", 
    "12": "Captopril is a specific inhibitor of kininase II which is responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I into the active angiotensin II and also for the inactivation of bradykinin. In different types of experimental and clinical hypertension, Captopril has a pronounced blood pressure-reducing action particularly when it is given together with a diuretic. Serious side-effects have hitherto restricted the use of Captopril to patients who do not respond or do not respond satisfactorily to routine antihypertensives. Since it has been shown that a considerable improvement in disturbed hemodynamics in hypertension and in certain forms of heart failure can be achieved with quite low doses of the preparation (2 x 2 mg daily) the use of Captopril may be indicated in greater amounts in moderate and severe hypertension.", 
    "13": "Antihypertensive effect of an orally active angiotensin I-Converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225 (Captopril) was assessed in 18 hypertensive patients, of whom 13 had essential hypertension, 2 had malignant hypertension, 2 had hypertension associated with chronic renal failure, and 1 had renovascular hypertension. Blood pressure decreased markedly not only in patients with high renin levels but also in those with low renin levels. Nevertheless, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was correlated with the pre-treatment plasma renin activity (r =-0.64, p less than 0.01 systolic, r =- 0.60, p less than 0.05 diastolic). There was a significant correlation between the fall in mean blood pressure and the decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration 3 weeks after treatment (r = 0.64, p less than 0.05). The serum potassium elevated from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 4.8 +/-0.9 mEq/L (p less than 0.05), and the change correlated inversely with the reduction of plasma aldosterone concentration (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02), while serum sodium slightly decreased from 140-+/- 2 to 138 +/- 3 mEq/L. There was neither finding of orthostatic hypotension nor escape from the antihypertensive effect. These results indicate that chronic inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme with an orally active compound offers an effective and well-tolerated approach to treatment of hypertension.", 
    "14": "Animal experiments indicate that angiotensin II can, under some circumstances stimulate the sympathetic nervous system at a number of different sites. In order to determine whether such a relationship of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous system exists in man, we increased (by intravenous infusion), or decreased (by administering the oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril) circulating angiotensin II levels and monitored plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline responses. Angiotensin II infusions did not increase plasma catechol-amines, and lowering of angiotensin II by captopril treatment in patients with severe hypertension or congestive heart failure failed to alter plasma adrenaline or nor-adrenaline levels. Whether physiological levels of angiotensin II are capable of interacting directly with the sympathetic nervous system in man remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "15": "Treatment with captopril has proved effective in some patients with resistant heart failure. Since cardiac output responses to captopril treatment are generally small, we infused the positive inotropic agent dobutamine in six patients already receiving captopril to determine whether cardiac output could be augmented without concomitantly increasing myocardial oxygen demands. At low infusion rates of dobutamine (2.5 and 5 microgram/kg per min), a substantial rise in cardiac output was observed yet myocardial oxygen uptake remained well below baseline (pre-captopril/dobutamine) levels. At higher rates of infusion (10 and 20 microgram/kg per min) the rise in cardiac output was accompanied by a pronounced increase in myocardial oxygen uptake, and the appearance of chest pain or multifocal ventricular extrasystoles in three patients. These data indicate that captopril treatment combined with low infusion rates of dobutamine can augment cardiac output in the short term, without increasing myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "16": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can improve haemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure and may enhance sodium excretion in hypertensive patients. In a metabolic unit we assessed the effects of one of these agents on renal function in nine patients with stable New York Heart Association functional class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure. Single blinded, the patients received placebo for three days, 25 to 100 mg of captopril three times a day for three days, and three more days of placebo. Mean blood pressure decreased during captopril, with little change in heart rate or respiration. Serum urea was slightly higher during captopril administration. The mean change in creatinine clearance during captopril was insignificant, but it decreased more than 25% in three of nine patients. Decreases in creatinine clearance correlated with lower blood pressure during captopril and were most obvious in patients with high baseline plasma renin activity. Urine output and both sodium and potassium excretion decreased during captopril. Thus captopril failed to improve natriuresis in patients with congestive heart failure and close monitoring of kidney function is necessary when using this agent in patients with congestive heart failure, particularly when blood pressure falls to lower levels.", 
    "17": "In conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) increased from a pretreatment value of 150 +/- 4 to 179 +/- 7mm Hg within 10 min (p less than 0.01) following an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of captopril (2 mg/kg body weight), and the plasma vasopressin concentration was increased eightfold (p less than 0.01). MAP than fell to 131 +/- 5 mm Hg at 120 minutes (p less than 0.01), and plasma vasopressin concentration returned to pretreatment levels. The initial increase in MAP was due in large part to increased plasma vasopressin levels since this increase was reduced 50% by pre-treatment with a specific antagonist of the pressor action of vasopressin. The reduction in MAP at 120 minutes in captopril-treated rats may been nonspecific, since a similar effect was observed in SHR given an i.c.v. injection of a control solution. In (Wistar-Kyoto) WKY rats, i.c.v. captopril was without a statistically significant effect on MAP, but the plasma vasopressin concentration increased three-fold (p less than 0.01). These findings may reflect an increased sensitivity of the control system for vasopressin release in the SHR.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin tachyphylaxis is rapidly induced in the mesenteric vascular circuit of the rat perfused with a saline solution. there is crossed tachyphylaxis among angiotensins (AI, AII, and AIII). The angiotensin antagonist Sar 1-Ileu 8-AII is ineffective when the vascular preparation is previously rendered tachyphylactic to AII, showing that the AII receptors are not available during tachyphylaxis. This finding supports the theory that angiotensin tachyphylaxis is caused by receptor occupancy by the agonist. By perfusing the vascular preparation with aII solutions that were too diluted to produce vasoconstriction, tachyphylaxis to AII was induced. Therefore, AII receptors can be slowly saturated without producing vasoconstriction. The recoveries of the vasoconstrictor effect of AII and AIII at 30 and 60 minutes after tachyphylaxis are similar; thus, the dissociation constants of the AII- and AIII-receptor complexes should be alike. After three bolus injections of AI, the vascular preparation is completely refractory to AI, AII, and AIII. When the conversion of AI to AII is inhibited with captopril, AI no longer induces tachyphylaxis to AII and AIII. Thus, tachyphylaxis to AII and AIII induced by AI seems to be due not to the occupancy of AII receptors by AI but to the AII formation from AI \"in situ.\"", 
    "19": "Methylprednisolone (M, 10 mg/kg/week subcutaneously) was administered to cause hypertension in rats, and the role of AV3V region was assessed before and after development of the hypertensive state. Participation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was evaluated by changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by administration of saralasin (S, 10 micron g/kg/min i.v.) or captopril (C, 20 mg/kg/p.o).aAnaAV3V lesion before M administration partially prevented and delayed the beginning appearance of M hypertension. Furthermore, a prior AV3V lesion abolished an angiotensin II (AII)-dependent pressor component normally identified by S and C administration in this type of hypertension. During the maintenance phase of the hypertension, an AV3V lesion caused a partial reduction in blood pressure. A spontaneous disappearance of a vasoconstrictor component mediated by AII was observed in the late phases of M hypertension. It is concluded that the AV3V region is essential to the full development and maintenance of M hypertension in the rat. Also in this model, integrity of the AV3V area is essential to the expression of the AII-mediated pressor component. Finally it is apparent tha M can cause hypertension even in the absence of the AV3V area or during chronic renin angiotensin blockade, indicating multiple pathogenetic mechanisms in this experimental model.", 
    "20": "The long-term effects of captopril on passive Na permeability and Na content in aortic smooth muscles of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined in relation to the mechanical properties of the muscles. Captopril or hydralazine when administered for 6 weeks exhibited antihypertensive action throughout the period. Cellular Na in both freshly excised aortas and incubated aortas from SHR leaked out more rapidly in cold Li-solution than those from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, suggesting increased permeability in SHR aortas. Long-term treatment with captopril decreased the \"permeability\" of the vascular membrane of SHR, whereas hydralazine failed to decrease it. Incubation of the aortas in K+-free Tyrode's solution produced a slowly developing contraction. The rate of rise of this contraction was faster in SHR aorta that in Wistar-Kyoto aorta. In aortas from captopril-treated SHR, the rate of rise in the contraction was suppressed. The contractile response to K+-free medium was related to the passive permeability to Na and thereby to the increment of cellular Na. It is suggested that, after prolonged administration, captopril alters the abnormal permeability to Na of the vascular smooth muscle membrane in SHR and that the alteration contributes to the antihypertensive effect of the agent.", 
    "21": "1. Sodium restriction increases adrenal and decreases vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II (ANG II). These responses may be mediated either by the circulating level of ANG II or other mechanisms also modified by a change in sodium balance. To assess the importance of the ANG II level, captopril, an oral converting enzyme inhibitor, was used to lower the plasma ANG II level to the sodium-loaded range while maintaining subjects in low sodium balance. 2. Normal volunteer subjects received an infusion of ANG II in increasing doses in three states: high sodium intake, low sodium intake and low sodium intake after pretreatment with captopril. 3. Basal levels of ANG II on high-sodium diet and low-sodium diet plus captopril were similar. In the ANG II infusion studies the slope of the aldosterone--ANG II regression line on low sodium intake was significantly steeper than that on high sodium intake. After the addition of captopril the slope was not decreased, indicating that the endogenous ANG II concentration is not necessary to maintain adrenal sensitivity during sodium restriction. 4. In the ANG II infusion studies the slope of the mean blood pressure--ANG II regression line on high sodium intake was significantly steeper than that on low sodium intake. The addition of captopril to sodium-restricted subjects caused the slope of the regression relationship to increase significantly, consistent with an enhanced vascular responsiveness when endogenous ANG II levels were lowered. However, the slope on low sodium plus captopril did not increase to the level of subjects on a high-sodium diet, suggesting that factors in addition to the circulating ANG II level are also important in regulating the vascular responsiveness to ANG II.", 
    "22": "The effect of captopril treatment (100 mg/kg by mouth daily for up to 6 months) on pressor responses to norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AII) was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Also, helical strips of rat aorta were removed from rats that had been similarly dosed. The aortic strips were suspended for isometric recording in modified Krebs' solution kept at 37 degrees C and bubbled with 95% O2-5% CO2. Pressor responses of both NE and AII in vivo were inhibited by captopril in SHR treated for all treatment periods. Responses to NE were more significantly and consistently inhibited than those for AII. Aortic strips from SHR previously dosed with captopril showed equivalent or greater contractile responses to potassium chloride (KCl) and NE, when compared with strips from untreated age-matched controls. In aortic strips from untreated Sprague-Dawley rats incubated with captopril, 30 micron g/ml for 1 hour ( a concentration 6000 times higher than that needed to inhibit angiotensin-covering enzyme by 50% in vitro), captopril had no effect on nitroglycerin-induced relaxation or NE-induced contractions, whereas ethacrynic acid (25 micron g/ml) reduced both the NE contractile response as well as the nitroglycerin-induced relaxation. These results suggest that captopril has no direct effect on the ability of isolated vascular smooth muscle to contract or relax despite causing a significant inhibition of pressor responses in vivo. It is suggested that this effect is related to an interaction of captopril with blood-borne elements necessary for the full expression of vasoconstriction, but unrelated to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "23": "Captopril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been administered to 81 patients with different types of clinical hypertension. Most of the patients had previously uncontrollable high blood pressure. In order to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure control during long-term captopril therapy, a concomitant decrease in total body sodium was required in more than half of the patients. During our first two years of clinical experience with this new antihypertensive agent, side effects developed in 46.9 per cent of the patients and necessitated the withdrawal of the drug in 23.4 per cent of all patients. Only a few side effects such as hypotensive or syncopal episodes and cold extremities appeared to be due to the chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The most frequent and the most serious adverse reactions such as skin rash, altered taste, pancytopenia, and pemphigus foliaceus seemed to be specifically drug related. The incidence of cutaneous and taste problems was markedly higher in patients with impaired renal function in whom retention of captopril has been previously demonstrated. This suggests that the occurrence of adverse reactions to captopril could be lowered in the future by using smaller daily doses and by titrating them according to the renal function.", 
    "24": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of the Okamoto-Aoki strain (n = 40) were treated with captopril (SQ 14,225; D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) orally, dose 0.2 mg/ml in drinking water. The treatment was initiated early and later during the course of developing hypertension. Continuously treated rats did not develop hypertension. Rats receiving captopril for 12 weeks remained normotensive, whereas withdrawal of the drug resulted in hypertension. Captopril treatment was effective in the rats with established hypertension and decreased the blood pressures to nearly normal values. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity rose 3-fold in captopril treated rats. ACE in lung plasma membranes increased during captopril treatment, indicating that captopril induced biosynthesis of pulmonary ACE. No qualitative differences were found in the ACE from treated and not treated animals. The dissociation of the antihypertensive effect of captopril and of increased ACE activity in serum and lungs reduce the value of relating blood pressure effects of the drug to measured enzyme activity in the SHR.", 
    "25": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on the renal kallikrein-kinin system and renal hemodynamics was studied in anesthetised dogs for 45 min after captopril administration. ACE inhibition was confirmed by increases in blood angiotensin I (AI) and plasma renin activity and a 20-fold decrease in sensitivity of the blood pressure and renal blood flow dose-response curves to AI. Captopril (1.5 mg . kg-1, i.v.) led to an increase in renal blood flow of 56 +/- 13 ml/min-1 (P less than .01) despite a fall in mean arterial pressure of 17 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.005). Glomerular filtration rate did not change whereas the filtration fraction decreased (p less than 0.005). The hypotension and renal vasodilation were accompanied by an increase in urinary kinin excretion (P less than .025) but no acute change in circulating kinins or urinary kallikrein excretion. Urine volume and urinary sodium and potassium excretion increased. To determine the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to these hemodynamic changes, were gave captopril to a further group of dogs during a continuous infusion of the competitive angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist sar1ile8-AII (2.5 micrograms/kg/min). Subsequent ACE inhibition was still associated with an increase in renal blood flow of 35 +/- 17 ml/min-1 (P less than 0.05), decrease with a mean arterial pressure by 11 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.025). These results suggest that ACE inhibition increases levels of intra-renal kinins and that decreased degradation of these tissue vasodilator peptides may contribute significantly to the acute renal vasodilation and hypotensive effect of captopril.", 
    "26": "Angiotensin converting enzyme [EC 3.4.15.1] was solubilized from the membrane fraction of human kidney cortex using trypsin and purified to homogeneity by DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatographies, preparative isoelectric focusing, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. The final recovery of the enzyme was 13.9%. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 199,000 by a sedimentation equilibrium method. A value of 170,000 was obtained for the reduced and denatured enzyme by dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was a glycoprotein consisting of a single polypeptide chain with an isoelectric point of 5.10. Neutral sugar accounted for 13% per weight of the enzyme. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 96.9 mumol/min/mg protein for hippurylhistidylleucine. The Km value, Kcat value and hydrolytic coefficient (Kcat/Km) of the enzyme for hippurylhistidylleucine were 2.0 mM, 545 s-1 and 273 mM-1 . s-1, respectively. Rabbit antibody against the human kidney converting enzyme inhibited the activities of the enzymes from human lung and serum as equally as that from human kidney, but not those from sheep, dog, or rat sera. The human kidney and lung converting enzymes were immunologically identical on double immunodiffusion analysis.", 
    "27": "Orthostatic hypotension is uncommon during oral converting enzyme inhibition, even when combined with salt depletion. To assess the mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular homeostasis in this condition, we studied the blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), total plasma catecholamines (CA), and plasma renin activity (PRA) responses after 20 minutes of 60 degrees head-up tilt in four groups of hypertensive patients. Group 1 included seven untreated patients; Group 2, eight patients on converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) therapy; Group 3, six patients on diuretic therapy and Group 4, 15 patients on combined captopril and diuretic therapy. Long-term converting enzyme inhibition alone or in combination with diuretics resulted in reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) associated with a marked increase in PRA and fall in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). Pronounced increases in HR and plasma CA on tilt were observed in all groups. In Groups 1, 2, and 3, BP was maintained during tilt; in Group 4, three patients fainted between 5 and 15 minutes while the other 12 had a normal response to tilt. Plasma catecholamines increased more significantly after 15 and 20 minutes of tilt, more in Groups 3 and 4 than in Group 1, while no differences in HR response were observed among groups. Results suggest that sympathetic compensatory mechanisms are adequate in the majority of patients to maintain BP during converting enzyme inhibition even when combined with salt depletion. In a few who exhibited orthostatic hypotension, a vasovagal attack seemed to be responsible for bradycardia and fall in BP.", 
    "28": "Captopril (SQ 14225) is an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Mice with schistosomiasis form granulomas in the liver and intestines that have high ACE activity. We determined whether chronic oral captopril administration would alter the granulomatous response. Infected mice treated with captopril had a dose-dependent decrease in liver granuloma size. Chronic peroral administration of drug induced a sustained decrease in granuloma ACE activity and size which was reversible upon drug withdrawal. The drug was most effective during the acute phase of infection. Granuloma size in the colon, ileum, and ileal Peyer's patches was also decreased by treatment. Ileal granulomas were affected the least. Liver, colon, ileum, and ileal Peyer's patches demonstrated natural differences in size of response to schistosome eggs. Synchronous hypersensitivity granulomas, containing no ACE activity, were generated by the pulmonary embolization of methylated bovine serum albumin-coated, Sepharose beads into sensitized mice. Captopril treatment did not affect the size of these lesions. Sustained improvements in portal pressure, body and liver weight, and water consumption were seen in treated mice. We conclude that captopril induces sustained suppression of the granulomatous response in schistosome-infected mice, which results in decreased morbidity. Circumstantial evidence suggests that captopril influences inflammation through the competitive inhibition of ACE.", 
    "29": "Plasma histamine and the release of histamine from blood in vitro has been determined in patients being treated for hypertension or heart failure with captopril. This drug does not alter plasma histamine levels in either group of patients or release histamine from human basophils, rat peritoneal mast cells or guinea pig lung slices upon challenge in vitro. We conclude that histamine release does not contribute to the cardiovascular or side effects of captopril.", 
    "30": "Eleven patients with severe, treatment-resistant essential or renovascular hypertension were treated with captopril after withdrawal of various multiple drug regimes. If supine diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg on a maximum daily dose of 450 mg captopril, a diuretic and then a beta-adrenoceptor blocker were added. Patient-volunteered complaints were carefully noted. Mean (+/- SE) systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell from 225 +/- 6.8/131 +/- 4.4 mm Hg on various multiple drug regimes to 182 +/- 9.0/105 +/- 5.0 mm Hg on a regime including captopril. The reported and observed incidence of adverse effects were as follows: maculopapular rash (one patient); urticaria and pruritus (three patients); loss of taste (one patient); tachycardia (four patients); increased frequency of trivial infections (three patients); severe myalgia (one patient); and deterioration in renal function (one patient). However, these patients were able to continue captopril after either temporary withdrawal or dose reduction. Captopril was discontinued permanently in five patients, in two because of poor blood pressure control, in one who developed persistent severe urticaria, and in one because of marked proteinuria. In the fifth patient intractable diarrhoea occurred. Captopril lowers blood pressure very effectively in patients with severe hypertension refractory to other agents. Adverse effects are common but acceptable in this situation where prognosis is poor if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.", 
    "31": "The role of bradykinin potentiation in the antihypertensive effect of captopril was assessed in conscious rabbits with two-kidney, one-clip hypertension. On the 35th day after clipping the renal artery, a bolus injection of bradykinin 0.2 microgram/kg was repeated at 15-min intervals three times before and for 180 min after the administration of captopril 0.5 mg/kg. The magnitude and duration of captopril-induced hypotension were more marked in hypertensive rabbits than in controls. The bradykinin-induced hypotension was markedly enhanced by captopril. However, the bradykinin potentiation by captopril was not correlated with its vasodepressive effect. On the other hand, a close relationship (r = 0.825, p less than 0.001) was observed between plasma renin activity and the maximum reduction in blood pressure induced by captopril. The experiment performed after sodium depletion for 7 days revealed that the bradykinin potentiating effect of captopril was not affected by sodium depletion. Therefore, it is concluded that the vasodepression by captopril does not necessarily depend on its bradykinin potentiating action and the latter is not influenced by the renin-angiotensin system or fluid volume depletion.", 
    "32": "In a double-blind randomized study, the dose response to captopril was studied in 12 severely hypertensive patients whose blood pressure had been previously controlled by this converting enzyme inhibitor, either in association with a diuretic (seven patients), or with a diuretic and a beta-blocker (five patients). All patients received in random sequence 32.5, 75, and 150 mg/day of captopril in three divided doses. Significant correlations were revealed between the dose administered and the levels of arterial blood pressure, plasma renin, plasma aldosterone and plasma potassium. Under the conditions of this study, dose-response curves were obtained for concentrations of captopril between 0.5 and 4 mg/day/kg body weight.", 
    "33": "Plasma angiotensin concentrations were measured in a longitudinal study of the vascular, renal, and adrenal responses to infusions of angiotensin II (AII) in the maturing newborn lamb. Basal plasma concentrations of angiotensin increased with age and correlated with the rising arterial pressure that occurred with maturation. However, age was a stronger determinant of arterial pressure than was plasma angiotensin concentration. For any given dose of AII per kilogram of body weight, the actual plasma angiotensin concentration achieved increased as the lambs matured and gained weight. Therefore, a comparative study of biologic responses to AII in maturing animals must be based on actual plasma angiotensin concentrations achieved rather than on dose of AII infused per kilogram of body weight. When analyzed on the basis of actual plasma angiotensin concentration, the increase in arterial pressure and the suppression of plasma renin activity in response to increasing plasma angiotensin concentrations did not differ significantly as the lambs matured. However, the increment in plasma aldosterone concentrations in response to increasing plasma angiotensin concentrations was diminished in immature lambs (less than 18 days) when compared to the aldosterone responses in the same lambs at older ages.", 
    "34": "The present experiments investigate whether the absence of tachycardia during lowering of blood pressure (BP) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) in salt-depleted dogs is due to an alteration in the activity of the baroreflex. Baroreflex activity was measured after pharmacological manipulation of BP using intravenous nitroglycerin or phenylephrine, and the heart period (R-R interval) relative to the arterial pressure pulse was recorded. The slope of the relationship between BP and R-R interval is a measure of the sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex and displacement of the line indicates a change in the setpoint of BP. On normal sodium diet, the sensitivity and setpoint of the baroreflex were unaltered by the nonapeptide CEI given both intravenously and into a lateral cerebral ventricle. During salt depletion. however, intravenously but not centrally administered CEI altered the setpoint of the baroreflex without modifying the sensitivity. The alteration in the setpoint that occurred following intravenous CEI in the salt-depleted dog could well account for the fact that the fall in BP induced by CEI does not cause reflex tachycardia. These results indicate that circulating but not brain angiotensin II is essential for the maintenance of baroreflex function during sodium depletion and provide further evidence for the important interactions between angiotensin and the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "35": "1. Successive infusions of SQ 20 881 given intra-arterially (i.a.) to the kidney at 0.4 and 0.8 microgram min-1 kg-1 for 50 min each did not alter renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance in spite of 40--47% blockade of the angiotensin I (ANG I i.a.)-induced vasoconstrictor response. 2. SQ 20 881 administered intravenously (i.v., 0.5 mg/kg) after the higher intra-arterial dose did not further decrease the renal response to ANG I (i.a.), but caused an increase in renal blood flow and a decrease in renal vascular resistance. 3. These results indicate that SQ 20 881 has limited efficacy in blocking the renal response to ANG I (i.a.). Under the conditions of these experiments, the renal vasodilator response to SQ 20 881 appears to be due to inhibition of extrarenal rather than intrarenal converting enzyme.", 
    "36": "The role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the pathogenesis of hypertension induced by methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg/week subcutaneously) was studied in rats before and during chronic renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with captopril (20 mg/kg/every 8 hrs by mouth). Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) blockade was accomplished by the intravenous (i.v.) administration of propranolol (0.20 mg/100g) plus phentolamine (1.25 mg/100g/i.v.) and ganglionic (G) blockade by the use of pentolinium tartarate (0.5 mg/100g/i.v.). After 4 weeks, methylprednisolone-treated animals showed significant decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) with both SNS (-34 +/- 2 mm Hg) and G (-56 +/- 3 mm Hg) blockades; during chronic RAS blockade, even greater falls in MAP were observed (SNS = -43 +/- 2 mm Hg and G = -75 +/- 3 mm Hg). Nevertheless, for both groups the levels of MAP obtained during SNS and G blockades were higher than those observed in their control groups. At the end of second week, however, in captopril-treated hypertensive rats the values of MAP obtained during ANS blockade were lower than those observed in the control group. An increased responsiveness to exogenous administration of norepinephrine (NE) was observed in animals receiving methylprednisolone and captopril. It is concluded that methylprednisolone hypertension in the rat may be initially explained by activation of RAS and ANS. At later phases, a third mechanism has to be postulated to explain the hypertensive state.", 
    "37": "To determine whether temporary cessation of captopril therapy compromises cardiac performance, haemodynamic, hormonal, and electrolyte indices were measured for 2 days before, and 4 days after discontinuation of long-term captopril treatment in 5 patients with heart failure. Captopril withdrawal resulted in a four-fold rise in plasma angiotensin II, higher levels of noradrenaline, and a 13.5mmHg increase in mean arterial pressure. Despite there changes, cardiac output at rest and during exercise was well maintained, and right-heart pressures were unaltered. Although plasma aldosterone levels increased three-fold, neither sodium retention nor potassium depletion occurred. Cortisol levels rose in parallel with angiotensin II levels. These results indicate that in the short term cardiac performance is not impaired and electrolyte balance is not adversely affected by the abrupt withdrawal of captopril.", 
    "38": "Intraventricular administration of supraphysiological amounts of renin, nerve growth factor preparation, or angiotensin II greatly increased the consumption of water and hypertonic sodium bicarbonate solution by sheep. These effects were antagonized by intraventricular administration of drugs that prevent the formation of angiotensin II or block its receptors. The fact that these angiotensin-blocking drugs did not change the sodium intake of sodium-deficient sheep challenges the idea that central angiotensin action is involved in sodium appetite due to a deficiency.", 
    "39": "The effect of captopril, furosemide, indomethacin and intake of sodium on the production of PGI2-like material was studied in the rat aorta. Release of PGI2-like material from these vessels was estimated by its ability to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Pretreatment with indomethacin (15 mg/kg/day) reduced the capacity of the aorta to release PGI2-like material. Pretreatment with captopril (10 mg/kg/day) had no effect. Intravenous furosemide (60 microgram/ml plasma volume) increased the capacity of the aorta to inhibit by 28% (p less than 0.25). The inhibitory capacity of aorta removed from rats on a low sodium diet did not differ from those on a high sodium diet. We conclude that the action of furosemide in reducing vascular tone may be related to stimulation of PGI2 synthesis in blood vessels whereas the effect of captopril and sodium in reducing vascular tone may involve a mechanism unrelated to PGI2 synthesis or may involve the synthesis of a prostaglandin other than PGI2.", 
    "40": "[14C]Captopril was given as a priming dose, followed by constant intravenous infusion for 4 or 6 hr, to three anesthetized dogs and three anesthetized monkeys. Blood, urine, and bile samples were collected during and after drug infusion. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were carried out exclusively on data obtained for unchanged captopril. The average total body clearance (ClT) and the renal clearance (ClR) of captopril, in milliliters per kilogram per hour, were 605 and 341 in the dog and 1135 and 944 in the monkey. The biliary clearance of captopril was negligible in both species. The greater difference between the ClR and ClT values in the dog compared to that in the monkey was the result of more extensive metabolism of captopril by the dog. Since almost all of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine in both species, captopril and its metabolites were almost exclusively eliminated by the kidneys. One primary reason that body and renal clearance values of captopril were much greater in the monkey than in the dog was that the net tubular secretion fo captopril was about three times greater in the monkey (82%) than in the dog (28%). The volume of distribution of captopril was higher in the monkey (3.6 liters/kg) than in the dog (2.6 liters/kg); the volume of the central compartment was about the same (0.5 liter/kg) for both species. The terminal half-life value was slightly higher in the dog (2.8 hr) than in the monkey (2.2 hr).", 
    "41": "The effects of Captopril on blood pressure and renal function were evaluated in ten patients with different degrees of hypertension. In seven, blood pressure was reduced after 7 weeks of therapy; in three it remained practically unchanged. No correlation was found between the standing plasma renin activity before treatment and the hypotensive response. Plasma renin activity increased significantly from the median value of 5.4 (range 1-16.7) to 9.5 (range 2.6-19.8) ng ml-1 h-1 (P less than 0.05) and urine aldosterone significantly fell from 13 (range 2.3-52.5) to 7.4 (range 1.6-14) microgram 24 h-1 (P less than 0.01) during therapy. Renal plasma flow decreased from 534 (range 300-616) to 471 (range 333-606) ml min-1, but the difference was not significant, and glomerular filtration rate fell significantly form 122 (range 64-143) to 88 (range 71-116) ml min-1 (P less than 0.05). No urinary excretion of alpha 2-macroglobulin was observed during Captopril. 24 h proteinuria, albumin and transferrin clearance, alanine-amino transferase, gammaglutamyl transferase and alpha glucosidase excretion rate and malate-dehydrogenase clearance remained unaltered throughout the treatment. This indicates that neither glomerular permeability nor renal tubular function were affected by the drug.", 
    "42": "The studies were designed to explore the effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on the activity of the sympathetic nervous system during basal conditions and following graded physical exercise in patients with essential hypertension. Seven males and two females, aged 36-59 years, were hospitalized under metabolic ward conditions and treated for 7 days with captopril given orally in increasing dosages, the final dose being 600 mg daily. The patients were subjected to an individual, graded submaximal work test (bicycling) for 20 min before medication and then again in an identical manner during medication with 600 mg captopril. Blood samples were drawn before exercise and then after 10 and 20 min of work for the determination of plasma angiotensin II (PA II), plasma aldosterone (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma noradrenaline (PNA) and plasma adrenaline (PA). Before medication blood pressure (mmHg) was 195/133 immediately before exercise, 230/129 after 10 min of moderate exercise and 263/105 following 20 mon of nearly maximal work. During treatment with captopril the respective blood pressure values were 154/110, 200/100 and 245/98. Captopril had no significant effect on the changes in heart rate following physical exercise. PA II and PAC were substantially reduced and PRA considerably increased by captopril. PA II, PAC and PRA increased in response to exercise both before and following captopril. The exercise stimulated increase in PNA and PA was almost identical before and during captopril. Thus, captopril had no major effect on the activity of the sympathetic nervous system in patients with essential hypertension, neither during basic conditions nor during heavy physical exercise in spite of a profound decrease in PA II.", 
    "43": "In eight patients with acute left ventricular failure secondary to myocardial infarction the haemodynamic effects of captopril (25 mg), an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, were measured. Haemodynamic modifications were maximal at 60 min and lasted for 2-3 h. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell from 23.5 +/- 4.9 (mean +/- SD) to 16.8 +/- 4.7 mmHg (P less than 0.01), cardiac output rose from 3.24 +/- 1 to 4.05 +/- 0.91 1/min (P less than 0.01). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 27.34 +/- 3.81 to 17.52 +/- 1.65 mmHg min l-1 (P less than 0.01). Mean arterial pressure fell from 89.6 +/- 13.9 to 75.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) while heart rate was not significantly modified. Six patients who had high pretreatment plasma renin activity values responded by a decrease in ventricular filling pressure and/or an increase in cardiac output. One patient with normal initial plasma renin activity value showed similar haemodynamic effects. THese data suggest that in the short term captopril is a vasodilator with both arterial and venous effects and improves cardiac function in acute left ventricular failure secondary to myocardial infarction.", 
    "44": "We studied the effect of a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), Captopril SQ 14,225 50 mg p.o. in eight supine normal subjects under a high sodium (150 mEq/d) and low sodium (25 mEq/d) diet. On high sodium, plasma renin (PRA) and aldosterone were basal and Saralasin did not lower mean blood pressure. However, CEI induced an 11.4 +/- 3.2 mm fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.02) and either indomethacin 50 mg or ibuprofen 800 mg (PI), when given simultaneously on another day abolished the blood pressure response (2.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p greater than 0.5). In contrast, on a low salt diet where renin was increased, CEI induced a drop in blood pressure which was not significantly altered by PI (12.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 10.0 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, p greater than 0.5). CEI increased plasma renin on both diets (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 3.5 +/- 0.8 and 2.8 +/- 0.6 to 12.5 +/- 3.1 ng/ml/hr respectively both p less than 0.05). Aldosterone did not change (high Na+) or fell (low Na+). Inhibition of Prostaglandin synthesis did not significantly block the renin rise from CEI suggesting that the direct angiotensin II negative feedback is relatively independent of acute prostaglandin release. Our studies suggest that CEI has a dual hypotensive action. In a low renin state, the hypotensive action appears to be mediated through vascular prostaglandins.", 
    "45": "The patients with severe and 10 with accelerated or malignant hypertension were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril acutely reduced blood pressure in all patients except two who had suppressed plasma renin activity. Four patients with encephalopathy showed immediate improvement after the first dose. Two patients could be withdrawn from nitroprusside infusion upon administration of captopril. Nineteen of 20 patients have remained on captopril for 12-32 months. Blood pressure is controlled in 18 and improved in two. Eleven required addition of diuretic and one addition of clonidine. The maximal antihypertensive effect of captopril with or without diuretics was evident after 3 months of continuous therapy and was associated with elevated plasma renin levels, normal aldosterone excretion and preservation of renal function. Captopril was well-tolerated, but produced occasional rash, loss of taste and proteinuria. We conclude that captopril, alone or in combination with other drugs, is effective in both the acute and long-term management of severe and malignant hypertension.", 
    "46": "An epithelial cell line established from a Chinese hamster kidney, CHK-ACE, was separated into two sublines, CHK-ACE-100 and CHK-ACE-400, by 18 successive passages in medium containing 100 and 400 mg/dl glucose, respectively. Binding of CHK-ACE-100 and CHK-ACE-400 cell to 125I-labeled insulin showed similar pH and time dependency; 125I-labeled insulin, concentration differed in the two sublines, however. Degradation of 125I-labeled insulin, as determined by its ability to bind insulin antibody and cells, was more extensive when preincubated with CHK-ACE-400 cell than with CHK-ACE-100 cells. When CHK-ACE-100 cells were grown in 400 mg/dl glucose for six passages, these cells showed more insulin binding sites than cells grown parallel in 100 mg/dl glucose; whereas CHK-ACE-400 cells grown in 100 mg/dl glucose for six passages showed fewer insulin binding sites than those grown parallel in 400 mg/dl glucose. A slight increase in Kf/Ke ratio was observed in both sublines when grown in 400 mg/dl glucose as compared to 100 mg/dl glucose, indicating attenuated negative cooperativity of the binding sites in cells grown in 400 mg/dl glucose. Tunicamycin, at concentrations from 0.016 to 0.125 micrograms/ml, showed no direct effect on the assay of 125I-labeled insulin binding to CHK-ACE-100 cells; exposure of CHK-ACE-100 cells to tunicamycin, at concentrations from 0.01 to 0.2 micrograms/ml, for 24 h caused a dose-dependent decrease in insulin binding capacity and an increase in Kf/Ke ratio. These data indicate that the number of insulin binding sites in the cultured Chinese hamster kidney epithelial cells increased with high glucose concentrations in the culture medium, whereas tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation, lowered the number of insulin binding sites.", 
    "47": "The effects of the new oral converting enzyme inhibitor \"MK-421\" on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone, and angiotensin converting enzyme were assessed in 16 hypertensive patients. Maximum (maintenance) doses ranged from 2.5 mg-40 mg daily. Blood pressure decreased from 177 +/- 7/111 +/- 4 mm Hg to 145 +/- 6/94 +/- 3 mm Hg supine and from 174 +/- 7/177 +/- 4 mm Hg to 142 +/- 6/101 +/- 3 mm Hg upright (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001 for both). Heart rate did not change significantly. Plasma renin activity rose during treatment, whereas plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone, and angiotensin converting enzyme remained suppressed at 24h after the maximum dose. Magnitude of blood pressure reduction after the maximum dose did not correlate with baseline plasma renin activity levels. No side-effects were noted during the 2-10 week observation period. MK-421 is similar to its predecessors in efficacy and clinical and biochemical correlates, the main difference being its higher potency and longer duration of action.", 
    "48": "The metabolic pathway of SQ 14225 (Captopril) and the mechanism of the mixed disulfide formation with endogenous sulfhydryl compounds were studied in in vitro cell free systems. In the rat liver 9000 x g supernatants, SQ 14225-14C was metabolized to one major metabolite, glutathione-SQ 14225 mixed disulfide (GSSQ), and two minor metabolites including SQ 14551, a symmetrical disulfide of SQ 14225. The formation of GSSQ was markedly accelerated by the addition of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), but not affected by the addition of reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating that GSSQ was formed by the thiol-disulfide interchange between SQ 14225 and GSSG. Although the thiol-disulfide interchange was also observed between SQ 14225 and L-cystine, L-homocystine and SQ 14551 as well as GSSG, only the formation of GSSQ was a rapid reaction and markedly decreased by heat treatment of the liver 9000 x g supernatants. These findings demonstrate that the formation of GSSQ is catalyzed by a GSSG specific enzyme which is supposed to be thioltransferase (Glutathione: Disulfide Oxidoreductase). Although GSSQ was stable in the rat liver 9000 x g supernatants, it was rapidly hydrolyzed to cysteine-SQ 14225 mixed disulfide (CySSQ) in the rat kidney 9000 x g supernatants. A specific inhibitor of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, anthglutin, inhibited the hydrolysis. GSSQ-14C administered to a beagle dog was excreted into the urine in the form of CySSQ. Thus, it was speculated that CySSQ excreted into the urine as a major metabolite of SQ 14225 was derived from GSSQ formed in the liver followed by hydrolysis in the kidney.", 
    "49": "1. Regional haemodynamic responses to mild haemorrhage were studied in three groups each of seven conscious rabbits, in the presence of either buffer, the prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate, or the kininase II inhibitor captopril. 2. Renal and splenic vasoconstriction occurred with meclofenamate in haemorrhaged animals, and were accentuated by the subsequent administration of captopril. 3. Captopril alone caused mild renal vasodilatation, but subsequent administration of meclofenamate again caused vasoconstriction. 4. Flow to the adrenal coronary, cerebral and hepatic artery circulations was unaffected by meclofenamate or captopril after haemorrhage. 5. The results indicated that the enhanced vasopressor activity occurring during haemorrhage greatly increased the dependence on vasodilator prostaglandins of flow to the renal and splenic vascular beds. 6. The vasoconstrictor effect of meclofenamate does not appear to be due to unopposed action of angiotensin II when prostaglandin synthesis is suppressed.", 
    "50": "1. Captopril markedly potentiated the vasodepressor responses to bradykinin. Neither the magnitude nor duration of the blood pressure fall were altered by bilateral nephrectomy or treatment with indomethacin which suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-Keto- PGF1 alpha. 2. It is concluded that in the anaesthetized rat augmentation of the bradykinin depressor responses by captopril occurs independently of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "51": "The time courses of mean blood pressure (MBP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA), serum prostaglandin E (PGE), serum angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), and blood levels of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14,225) (captopril) were studied in 6 patients with essential hypertension (5 men and 1 woman, aged 44 +/- 5.6 (mean +/- S.E.) years) before and 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after administration of 25 mg captopril. MBP and ACE began to fall within 30 min and reached a significant minimum between 60 and 180 min after captopril administration. PRA was significantly increased 60 min after captopril administration and continued for 180 min. On the other hand, PA had begun to fall significantly 180 min after captopril administration. The blood levels of captopril were significantly increased 30 min after captopril administration, with a peak at 120 min. The levels at 180 min were half the peak. The levels of PGE were not significantly changed within 180 min after captopril administration. These results suggest a discrepancy between the changes in MBP and the blood levels of captopril. The blood pressure lowering effect may be due to inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang. II) during the short-acting effect, and due to decrease of PA, metabolites of captopril, increase of kinin in the blood, inhibition of the slow pressor effect of Ang. II, increases of other depressor hormones such as prostacyclin and other depressor mechanisms during the long-acting effect.", 
    "52": "The acute effects of 50 mg of SQ 14225 (Captopril) on arterial pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance (TPR) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in 14 chronic hemodialysis patients, six of whom were hypertensive. Before treatment, TPR index (TPRI) correlated significantly with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = 0.806, P less than 0.01). After Captopril, the reduction of MAP was 10% or more in hypertensive and normotensive subjects at 30 and 120 min. The percentage change in MAP correlated significantly with that in TPRI in all the patients at 30 (r = 0.872, P less than 0.01) and 120 min (r = 0.866, P less than 0.01). There was no correlation between either the changes in cardiac index or the basal values of PRA and the decrease in MAP. The result suggests that vasodilatation was primarily responsible for the fall in blood pressure in chronic hemodialysis patients.", 
    "53": "Previous studies from our laboratory have provided evidence that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in controlling glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through an efferent arteriolar vasoconstrictor mechanism; however, the relative importance of circulating versus intrarenally formed angiotensin II (ANG II) in this control has not been determined. In the present study, the role of circulating ANG II in regulating GFR during reduced renal artery pressure (RAP) was examined in sodium-depleted dogs. After 90 min of infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225, which presumably inhibited formation of both circulating and intrarenal ANG II, reduction of RAP to 81 +/- 2 mmHg resulted in marked decreases in GFR, filtration fraction (FF), and calculated efferent arteriolar resistance (RE), whereas renal blood flow (RBF) was maintained approximately 40% above initial control levels determined before SQ 14225 infusion. Replacement of circulating ANG II during SQ 14225 infusion, by intravenous infusion of ANG II at rates that decreased RBF to control levels, increased GFR, FF, and RE to levels not significantly different from control while RAP was maintained constant by aortic constriction. These observations suggest that circulating ANG II plays an important role in regulating RE and GFR during reductions in RAP. The importance of intrarenally formed ANG II in controlling GFR remains to be determined.", 
    "54": "The reflex hemodynamic and humoral response to postural change during long-term renin-angiotensin blockade (captopril) was assessed in sodium-depleted hypertensive patients. Orthostatic hypotension was not observed with head-up tilt or repeated pressure recordings. During tilt, a reflex increase of heart rate occurred (76 +/- 2 to 98 +/- 4 bpm, p less than 0.001). Home recordings demonstrated only minor changes in blood pressure with standing. To evaluate these observations, hemodynamic studies were performed during tilt at three stages of therapy: control, administration of captopril, and administration of captopril plus diuretic. With tilt, no orthostatic hypotension was noted at all three stages of therapy, despite similar peripheral pooling (-22 percent cardiac index). Maintenance of blood pressure was due to reflex increase of heart rate (44, 45 and 38 percent) and systemic resistance (34, 38 and 37 percent). The response to tilt of plasma renin activity was modified by drug therapy, but not completely blocked. This study indicated that long-term converting enzyme inhibition and sodium depletion were safe and did not appreciably blunt the cardiovascular reflexes responsible for prevention of orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "55": "To evaluate the role of angiotensin II (A II) in mediating the steroidogenic response to angiotensin I (A I) and tetradecapeptide, rat glomerulosa cells were incubated with each peptide in the presence or absence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril or the nonapeptide bradykinin-potentiating factor). Both A I and tetradecapeptide increased aldosterone secretion in a dose-dependent fashion, but were considerably less effective (P less than 0.001) than the same dose (2.4 X 10(-9) M) of A II. In addition, both A I and tetradecapeptide caused a dose-dependent increase in A II accumulation in the incubation media, indicating that part of their steroidogenic effect is indirect via conversion to the octapeptide. While captopril (1.0 X 10(-4) M) almost completely blocked A I (2.4 X 10(-8) M)-induced A II accumulation, it caused only a 50% reduction (P less than 0.01) in aldosterone output. The nonapeptide-converting enzyme inhibitor (2.3 X 10(-6) M) produced a similar blockade. This lack of complete inhibition of A I-induced steroidogenesis suggests that A I also has a direct effect on the glomerulosa cells, i.e. 50% of the activity of A I is due to intrinsic activity. On the other hand, converting enzyme inhibitors did not affect tetradecapeptide-induced aldosterone output or A II accumulation, making it impossible to determine if it has a direct steroidogenic effect. The failure of converting enzyme inhibitors to modify tetradecapeptide-induced accumulation of A II suggests that an enzyme other than converting enzyme is responsible for its generation.", 
    "56": "1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can attenuate reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction in vivo. We have investigated the effects of captopril (SQ 14 225) on adrenergic vasoconstrictor mechanisms in isolated, Krebs-Ringer solution perfused, rat mesenteric arteries. 2. Low concentrations of captopril (2 X 10(-6) mol/l) did not alter the vasoconstrictor response evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation. 3. Exogenous angiotensin I and II did not have a direct vasoconstrictor effect, but caused dose-related increases in the amplitude of responses induced by nerve stimulation. 4. The potentiating effect of angiotensin I was antagonized by captopril (6.7 X 10(8)-2 X 10(-6) mol/l) and by saralasin (10(-8) mol/l). The potentiating effect of angiotensin II was antagonized by saralasin only. 5. In the absence of exogenous peptides high concentrations of captopril (1 X 10(-4)-3 X 10(-4) mol/l) antagonized vasoconstrictor responses evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline, but not those evoked by potassium chloride. 6. These results indicate that captopril can have two types of inhibitory effect at the adrenergic neuro-effector junction. High concentrations antagonize responses to noradrenaline and nerve stimulation. This effect is independent of peptide hormones and is unlikely to occur in vivo. Lower concentrations block the local vascular conversion of angiotensin I into II. As angiotensin II is an important peripheral amplifier of adrenergic vasoconstriction, this effect will also reduce sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. This latter interaction could explain the inhibitory effect of converting enzyme inhibitors on sympathetic reflexes.", 
    "57": "In vitro PG synthesis by glomeruli isolated from rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF) was measured by radiometric high performance liquid chromatography after incubation with [14C]arachidonic acid and radioimmunoassay (RIA). The four PGs, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TXB2, PGF2 alpha, and PGE2 were each synthesized by glomeruli from both control and treated rats but the synthesis rates were greater after glycerol. This increase was not apparent 1 hour after injection but, at 24 hours, all PGs were produced in greater amounts by glomeruli of treated rats. Thus, we studied PGE2, PGE2 alpha, and TXB2 synthesis by glomeruli at various time intervals after induction of ARF using direct RIA, PGF 2 alpha and TXB2 synthesis were greater only at 24 hours and only in the presence of arachidonic acid, whereas PGE2 synthesis was greater at 24 hours, irrespective of arachidonic acid, but at 48 hours only with arachidonic acid. The stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid was always greater in glycerol-treated than in control rats for these three PGs in the later period, whereas a significant decrease for PGE2 was observed at 1 hour. The late increase in PG synthesis may be due to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system since it was abolished in rats pretreated for 48 hours with captopril. A late increase in PG synthesis by the papilla of the treated rats also was observed. We concluded that any increase in the glomerular production of vasoconstrictor PGs could contribute to the maintenance of acute renal failure, whereas the early fall in the stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on PGE2 synthesis could play a role in its initiation.", 
    "58": "Quantitative relationships between angiotensin converting enzyme activity in human serum and concentration of an enzyme inhibitor, the active diacid metabolite of MK-421 [N-(S-1-carbethoxy-3-phenylpropyl)-S-alanyl-S-proline maleate], were defined. Dose-response curves were generated in vitro by adding the diacid metabolite (DM) to serum (ID50 = to 6x10-9 M); l0-15% of initial activity was nonsuppressible. DM an converting enzyme activity were also measured in serum from hypertensive subjects receiving oral MK-421. The dose-response curve for serum samples following single doses of MK-421 (ID50 = 6x10-9M), was similar to curves generated in vitro while the curve for sample following chronic therapy suggested a small decrease in inhibitory potency.", 
    "59": "1. Bradykinin infusion (0.1 microgram/min i.v.) decreased the number of uterine bradykinin receptors by 20% at Day 2. Bradykinin receptors returned to control levels at Day 7. 2. Captopril infusion (1.7 micrograms/min i.v.) induced prolonged decreases in the number of uterine bradykinin receptors of 15% at Day 2 and of 13% at Day 7, respectively. 3. The number of uterine bradykinin receptors was increased in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats by 19%. 4. These results suggest that endogenous bradykinin participates in the regulation of uterine bradykinin receptors. 5. Decreased uterine bradykinin receptors induced by captopril might reflect increased endogenous bradykinin.", 
    "60": "1. Administration of captopril (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) to anaesthetized dogs was associated with an increase in renal blood flow of 56 ml min-1 (s.e.m. = 13, n = 9) despite a significant fall of 17 mmHg (s.e.m. = 5, n = 9) in mean arterial pressure. 2. Treatment of dogs with the angiotensin receptor antagonist, Sar1 Ile8-angiotensin II (2.5 micrograms/kg per min i.v.), or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg i.v.) did not prevent the renal vasodilation and hypotension following angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. This suggests that these effects are neither solely due to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system nor mediated by prostaglandins. 3. Increased urinary kinin excretion, possibly reflecting increased renal concentrations of kinins, accompanied the renal vasodilation after both captopril and renal artery occlusion. 4. The kallikrein-kinin system may play a role in the regulation of the renal vasculature in anaesthetized dogs.", 
    "61": "1. The effect of captopril on in vitro production of angiotensin I (ANG I), [Val5]-angiotensin II ([Val5]-ANG II) and [Val4]-angiotensin III ([Val5]-ANG-(2-8)) in central venous blood taken from sodium-deficient sheep was studied. 2. Captopril enhances in vitro production of ANG I but blocks the in vitro production of [Val5]-ANG II and [Val5]-ANG-(2-8). 3. The production of ANG I in blood is faster than that of [Val5]-ANG II and [Val5]-ANG-(2-8). 4. The half-life of [Val5]-ANG II and [Val5]-ANG-(2-8) in vitro in blood in the presence of captopril was 10 and 14 min, respectively. 5. This in vitro study suggests that the production of [Val5]-ANG II and [Val5]-ANG-(2-8) in blood forms a small part of the total body production of each peptide.", 
    "62": "We examined the effects of an orally active inhibitor of converting enzyme, captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of captopril (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor responses to angiotensin I (1.0 micrograms/kg, i.v.); at 1.0 mg/kg, captopril markedly potentiated the magnitude and duration of vasodepressor responses elicited by bradykinin (0.3 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Captopril effected a marked elevation of plasma renin activity by its blocking action on the angiotensin II-mediated negative feedback of renin release without markedly altering systemic blood pressure and heart rate. Propranolol (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.), at a dose which almost completely inhibited isoproterenol (0.15 micrograms/kg/min, i.a.)-induced renin release, tended to suppress the captopril-induced renin release. However, indomethacin (5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) failed to change the captopril-induced renin release. These findings suggest that captopril specifically inhibits converting enzyme and kininase II, and that captopril-induced renin release is partially associated with the beta-adrenergic system without dedication by prostaglandins.", 
    "63": "Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels were obtained in 24 control patients who were critically ill, in 11 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, in 8 patients with status postcardiopulmonary bypass, and in 12 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mean values in cardiogenic pulmonary edema (24.3 +/- 3.9 SD) in cardiopulmonary bypass (19.5 +/- 3.1) and in patients with ARDS and no sepsis (n = 7, 19.0 +/- 5.5) were not significantly different from controls (20.7 +/- 2.8). In contrast, patients with ARDS and sepsis had markedly decreased serum ACE levels which fell outside of control range (n = 5, 8.6 +/- 2.3). The authors speculate that decreased ACE levels in the combination of sepsis and ARDS are due to the presence of circulating inhibitors of ACE. The finding of decreased serum ACE can be of potential clinical usefulness by raising the possibility of sepsis as the etiology of ARDS before results of blood cultures are available.", 
    "64": "Captopril was given alone and in combination with diuretics to 49 patients with hypertension for 1 to 12 mol Within 2 mo blood pressure reduction correlated with pretreatment plasma renin activity and response to the infusion of angiotensin II antagonist, but these effects were not present at 4 mo. Plasma and urinary aldosterone were suppressed but serum converting enzyme activity, plasma bradykinin, kallikren, and prostaglandins (E and F) were in the normal range effect of captopril. Despite sustained reduction of blood pressure, plasma catecholamines were not elevated and urinary catecholamines were suppressed in patients on captopril alone. It is concluded that another mechanism, such as enhancement of renal or local kinin-prostaglandin system, as well as suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be involved in the long-term efficacy of captopril. Sympathetic activity may also be depressed and contribute to the hypotensive effect.", 
    "65": "The acute effects of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril on regional blood flow, renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion were studied in 12 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Converting-enzyme inhibition decreased systemic vascular resistance by 27% and increased cardiac index by 16%. Estimated hepatic blood flow decreased 17%, but renal blood flow increased 60%. The ratio of renal-systemic blood flow increased from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.14 +/- 0.02 (p = 0.031). Although renal plasma flow increased from 202.8 +/- 28.8 to 323.7 +/- 42.7 ml/min (p less than 0.008), the glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly from the mean pretreatment value of 82.1 +/- 12.3 ml/min. The filtration fraction decreased from 41.3 +/- 3.8% to 33.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.050), while urinary sodium excretion doubled, from 34.5 +/- 9.6 to 68.2 +/- 19.6 muEq/min. The plasma renin activity increased from 12.6 +/- 5.0 to 29.9 +/- 8.4 ng/ml/hr (p = 0.030) as plasma aldosterone concentration decreased from 30.5 +/- 6.5 to 11.3 4/- 1.2 ng/dl (p = 0.010) and norepinephrine concentrations decreased from 774 +/- 105 to 618 +/- 85 pg/ml (p = 0.020). We conclude that converting-enzyme inhibition reverses renal vasoconstriction in congestive heart failure and redistributes regional blood flow. The natriuresis may be mediated by one or more of the following: improved renal plasma flow, reduction in filtration fraction, suppression of hyperaldosteronism, and lowering of circulatory catecholamine concentrations.", 
    "66": "The effects of captopril on blood pressure and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme were studied in cats with two-kidney, one-clip experimental hypertension. The time period for the return of blood pressure to predrug values was observed to be many days longer than the recovery time of enzyme activity. The possibility that the discrepancy might be due to a differential effect of captopril on the pulmonary and vessel wall plasma membrane enzymes as opposed to the circulating plasma enzyme, all of which act on blood-borne angiotensin I, was studied in an anesthetized bioassay cat preparation employing two routes of drug administration. No large disparity between captopril inhibition of the different enzyme systems was noted. It is concluded that the discrepancy between the inhibition of the plasma enzyme and the antihypertensive effect of the drug might result from: (a) a nonspecific return of the disease process that might be predicted to occur with other antihypertensive agents: the \"slow pressor\" actions of angiotensin are discussed in relationship to this hypothesis; (b) an inhibition of converting enzyme at a localized site, such as the media of the vessel wall or certain brain areas, where the enzyme might not act on blood-borne angiotensin I; and (c) a direct vasodilatory action unrelated to the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "67": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic responses, mainly cardiac output and regional blood flow, to converting enzyme inhibition by captopril in the intact and nephrectomized rabbit. Twenty-one New Zealand white rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital has systemic arterial blood pressures measured and cardiac output and regional blood flow determined by the microsphere method. Captopril (1--3 mg/kg) significantly reduced cardiac output in the intact but not in nephrectomized rabbits. In both the intact and nephrectomized animals, captopril was associated with small but not significant decreases in blood pressure and no significant change in total peripheral vascular resistance or heart rate. Regional blood flow was reduced, but the fractional distribution of cardiac output to the myocardial, lung (bronchial), hepatic, and splanchnic (small intestine) circulations was unchanged after captopril. These data suggest that the reduction in cardiac output induced by converting enzyme inhibition may be attributed to a fall in venous return that in turn may be dependent on renal factors.", 
    "68": "Inactive renin (prorenin) was measured in plasma from untreated hypertensive patients after acute (60 min) administration of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after 4 weeks of treatment with captopril, and after an acute infusion of the protease inhibitor aprotinin. Inactive renin was unchanged during acute captopril therapy despite a 4-fold increase in active renin. In contrast, after 4 weeks of treatment with captopril, inactive renin had increased 2-fold and active renin was also elevated, but to a greater degree (6-fold). Active renin was significantly suppressed by the aprotinin infusion, to about 25%, but the inactive plasma renin level was apparently unchanged. These studies demonstrate that the time course of the responses of active and inactive plasma renins are different; the inactive renin level seems to change more slowly than does active renin in response to the same stimulus. The results also show that a neutral serine protease inhibitor can rapidly reduce the circulating level of active renin. This observation is consistent with the possibility, but does not prove it, that a kallikrein-like enzyme normally activating prorenin was inhibited by aprotinin.", 
    "69": "The response of plasma aldosterone to exogenous angiotensin II was evaluated in five normal volunteers on three occasions, once without endogenous ACTH or angiotensin II suppression (control), once with ACTH suppression (dexamethasone) and once with ACTH and angiotensin II suppression (dexamethasone and captopril). Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) fell from a control of 6.8 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- SEM) to 4.4 +/- 0.4 ng/dl with dexamethasone (p less than 0.05) and to 1.8 +/- 0.2 ng/dl with dexamethasone and captopril (p less than 0.001). PAC increased dose-dependently upon infusion rates of angiotensin II (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 2.5 and 5.0 ng/kg/min) on each occasion, but aldosterone responsiveness to infused angiotensin II (change and percentage from base line levels) was not altered by the suppression of endogenous ACTH secretion with dexamethasone with each incremental infusion of the octapeptide. However, change in PAC caused by angiotensin II in the suppression of ACTH and angiotensin II was greater than that in the control at an infusion rate of 0.2 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05), 1.2 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05) and 2.5 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.01), and it was also greater than that in the suppression of ACTH at an infusion rate of 0.2 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05) and 2.5 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that in normal men, base line aldosterone levels are controlled not only by the renin-angiotensin system, but also, in part, by ACTH. The aldosterone response to angiotensin II, however, does not depend upon endogenous ACTH secretion, an action of angiotensin II on the pituitary to release ACTH. Simultaneous administration of dexamethasone and captopril may be a useful tool to assess the sensitivity of aldosterone production in the adrenal glomerulosa with exogenous angiotensin II since endogenous ACTH and angiotensin II can be suppressed by these medications.", 
    "70": "Two studies were designed to examine the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the sympathetic nervous system. In the first study, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the heart were measured in rats which had been given the agent orally in tap water (0.5 mg/ml) for 2, 9, 19, 29, and 58 days. BP and HR were measured using a tail-microphone to which a tachometer to record HR was connected in the unanesthetized and unrestricted condition. Heart NE was extracted with perchrolic acid and measured with the THI method on a high pressure liquid chromatography. The same study was also done in the control rats. The BP of the rats which had been given captopril for 9 days or more was significantly lower than in the control rats, while HR was not different between the two groups of rats. The ratio of heart weight/body weight was significantly lower in the captopril rats than in the control rats 58 days after the captopril administration. The ratio was significantly correlated with BP in these captopril and control rats (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01). In contrast to the control rats, the NE concentrations in the heart gradually increased in the captopril rats, thus being significantly higher in the latter than in the former after 29 and 58 days of captopril administration (p less than 0.01 for both observations). In addition, the lower the BP was, the higher the NE concentrations in the heart was in all the rats (r = 0.52, p less than 0.001). In the second study, BP, HR, and NE concentrations in plasma, heart, brain and the left kidney were measured in rats which had been on captopril for 2 and 29 days. Renal renin content (RRC) was also measured in the right kidney. In this study, BP and HR were recorded through a carotid catheter which had been inserted 4 hrs previously under light ether anesthesia. BP was significantly lower and NE concentrations in the heart was higher in the captopril rats than in the control rats after 29 days of captopril administration. There was a significant negative correlation between BP and NE concentrations in the heart in the captopril and the control rats (r = -0.88, p less than 0.001). No difference in HR was found between the 2 groups. NE concentrations in plasma, brain and kidney showed no significant differences between the captopril and the control rats in either of the stages of sacrifice. RRC was markedly reduced in the rats with 2 days of captopril, while it increased in the rats with 29 days of captopril. However, the RRC had no definite relationship with the NE concentrations in plasma or that in the kidney. The results show that chronic administration of captopril reduces the heart weight in normotensive rats. This effect points on the one hand to a decrease in \"cardiac after-load\" and on the other to changes of humoral factors such as plasma angiotensin II induced by captopril...", 
    "71": "A non-sulfhydryl-containing inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (MK421) was given as a single dose in a randomised double-blind cross-over trial using 20 mg and 5 mg of MK-421 or matched placebo to nine normotensive volunteers receiving a sodium intake of 150 mmol (mEq) daily. The two dosages of MK-421 caused similar, significant falls in supine and standing blood pressure, which were maximum four to six hours after dosing (9.5-11.0% fall). With this fall in blood pressure there was a significant fall in activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and in concentrations of plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone and a rise in plasma renin activity. Placebo caused no significant change in blood pressure or blood measurements. The study showed that MK-421 inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and lowers blood pressure in normotensive subjects. It strongly suggested that the renin system plays an important part in maintaining blood pressure in normotensive subjects receiving normal sodium intake. The results also suggest that this non-sulfhydryl-containing converting-enzyme inhibitor will be an effective blood-pressure-lowering drug in patients with blood pressure. A single dose of 5 mg was as effective at lowering blood pressure as a single dose of 20 mg.", 
    "72": "The absorption of captopril (I), a new antihypertensive agent, was studied in mice and rats at doses (50 and 1350 mg/kg) administered in the diet in chronic toxicological studies. 3H- or 35S-Labeled I was administered by gavage and in the diet to male and female animals in a two-way crossover study. Animals received daily doses of nonradiolabeled I in the diet for 25 days, except on Days 15 and 22 when radiolabeled I was administered either by gavage or in the diet. Absorption of the total radioactivity in 2-month-old mice averaged 49 and 48%, respectively, of the 50- and 1350-mg/kg doses given in the diet and 57 and 65%, respectively, of the doses given by gavage. The bioavailability of I in 2-month-old mice averaged 48 and 39% (diet) and 44 and 59% (gavage) of the 50- and 1350-mg/kg doses, respectively. In 2-month-old rats, absorption of the total radioactivity averaged 41% of the 50-mg/kg dose given in the diet. In 2- and 15-month-old rats, minimum absorption of the 1350-mg/kg dose averaged 36 and 45% (diet) and 51 and 71% (gavage), respectively; the minimum bioavailability averaged 20 and 29% (diet) and 39 and 44% (gavage), respectively. These studies demonstrate adequate absorption and bioavailability of I over a wide range of doses from the drug-diet mixtures and by young and old animals and also illustrate a useful experimental design for the estimation of relative oral absorption of a drug administered continuously in the diet over several days.", 
    "73": "Captopril, a newly developed, orally active inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, and hydrochlorothiazide were given alone or in combination to 39 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo period the patients were randomly allocated in the proportion 3:2 to treatment with captopril (n = 23) or hydrochlorothiazide (n = 16) for dose titration over 4 weeks. The alternative test drug was added thereafter during an 8-week maintenance period if the supine diastolic blood pressure was more than 90 mmHg. The average supine BP reduction in the captopril group was 29/21 mmHg and in the hydrochlorothiazide group 18/15 mmHg. Only one patient who started on captopril had to have hydrochlorothiazide added. Four of those who started on hydrochlorothiazide had to have captopril added. The antihypertensive effects of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide appear to be additive. Among the side effects due to captopril, there were two patients with taste disturbances and another two with rashes.", 
    "74": "1. The effects of a single 25 mg oral dose of captopril on blood pressure, heart rate and circulating renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, bradykinin and catecholamine levels were examined in untreated patients with essential (n = 10, Group I), accelerated (n = 6, Group II) and renal hypertension (n = 8, Group III) studied on a normal sodium diet. 2. Mean blood pressure fell only slightly in Group I patients, (113 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 3 mmHg at 60 minutes) but a greater fall was observed in Group II (153 +/- 8 to 135 +/- 11 mmHg) and a marked fall in Group III, (136 +/- 3 to 114 +/- 5 mmHg). There were no significant changes in heart rate in any group. 3. Plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly reduced 30 minutes after captopril in all three groups and returned toward resting values after four hours. The falls in plasma angiotensin II levels were accompanied by reciprocal increases in blood angiotensin I and plasma renin, but blood bradykinin and plasma catecholamine concentrations remained unchanged. 4. Resting plasma renin levels showed considerable overlap in the three groups and the mean renin values were not significantly different in the three groups. After captopril a marked rise in plasma renin concentration (greater than 2.5 ng/ml/hr) was observed in seven patients in Group III, including all six patients with renovascular disease. In contrast, none of the patients with essential hypertension and only one patient with accelerated hypertension had such an increase. Determination of the acute renin and blood pressure responses to converting enzyme inhibition with a single oral dose of captopril appears to be useful in identifying patients with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "75": "1. To examine the possible participation of the brain iso-renin-angiotensin system in the control of blood pressure, as well as in the regulation of plasma renin activity, saralasin and captopril were injected into the cerebral ventricles of three types of experimental hypertensive rats with different plasma renin profiles. 2. Injection of saralasin and captopril into the cerebral ventricles resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats (11 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 3 mmHg respectively) and that of spontaneously hypertensive rats (13 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 2 mmHg respectively), but in deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-salt hypertensive rats injection of these two agents showed a significant increase in blood pressure (13 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 3 mmHg respectively). 3. The plasma renin activity was markedly decreased after injection of saralasin and captopril into the cerebral ventricles of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. Conversely, in DOC-salt hypertensive rats, the plasma renin activity was markedly increased after injection of these two agents. In spontaneously hypertensive rats these agents caused no significant change in plasma renin activity. 4. These findings suggest that the brain iso-renin-angiotensin system participates in the central regulation of blood pressure and may be responsible for modulation of the peripheral renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "76": "Saralasin (Sar1, Ala8 angiotensin II), a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II, or captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were infused for 12 hr into conscious rats with Goldblatt two-kidney one-clip hypertension at an early stage (mean interval from clipping 36 days) and a chronic stage (151 days). In the early phase infusions of either saralasin or captopril produced a significant fall in blood pressure, which was maximal at 30 min, although the majority of animals remained hypertensive. In the chronic phase, saralasin produced a small and nonsignificant fall in blood pressure, whereas captopril produced a fall similar to that observed in the early group. No further fall in blood pressure was seen over the 12 hr period. PRC was markedly elevated in the early phase but did not differ significantly from normal in the chronic phase. The blood pressure fall produced by saralasin was significantly correlated with preinfusion PRC (r = 0.72 for the early group and 0.81 for the chronic group; p less than 0.01), whereas the fall in blood pressure produced by captopril was poorly correlated with PRC (r = 0.04 and 0.14, respectively). Captopril produced a minor fall and saralasin a minor elevation of blood 3 pressure in normal animals. Infusions of dextrose without inhibitor caused no change in blood pressure. Removal of the renal artery clip normalized blood pressure in the majority (88%) of animals in either the early or chronic phases. It is concluded that 12 hr infusions of these inhibitors are no more effective than 30 min infusions and do not fully correct hypertension in this model. Furthermore, the greater vasodepressor effect of captopril compared to saralasin in chronic hypertensive animals and the lack of correlation between PRC and change in blood pressure with captopril suggest that this agent has an action independent from blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Removal of the renal artery clip is more effective than renin-angiotensin blockade in correcting Goldblatt two-kidney one-clip hypertension.", 
    "77": "Although a variety of vasodilator drugs produce acute hemodynamic improvement in patients with severe chronic heart failure, long-term treatment with these agents may be associated with the development of drug tolerance and loss of initial beneficial effects. Five serial right heart catheterizations in a 78 year old man with severe chronic heart failure due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy documented the development of hemodynamic and clinical tolerance to oral hydralazine and oral captopril after initial responses were observed to both agents. However, sustained hemodynamic and clinical improvement by invasive testing was noted with minoxidil (20 mg orally twice daily) after 4 and 9 weeks of continuous therapy. These observations indicate that pharmacologic tolerance may occur with a variety of vasodilator drugs and may account for the failure of some patients to improve clinically with long-term therapy despite initial favorable hemodynamic effects. However, such tolerance seems to be drug-specific and, hence, its recognition in an individual patient does not prelude responsiveness to other vasodilator agents.", 
    "78": "It has been suggested that an inappropriate relationship between renin and exchangeable sodium is responsible for the hypertension of patients with chronic renal failure. Long-term blockade of the renin system by captopril made it possible to test this hypothesis in 8 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Captopril was administered orally in 2 daily doses of 25 to 200 mg. Previously, blood pressure averaged 179/105 +/- 6/3 (mean +/- SEM) pre- and 182/103 +/- 7/3 mm HG post-dialysis, despite intensive ultrafiltration and conventional antihypertensive therapy. The 4 patients with the highest plasma renin activity normalized their blood pressure with captopril alone, whereas in the 4 remaining patients, captopril therapy was complemented by salt subtraction which consisted in replacement of 1-2 liters of ultrafiltrate by an equal volume of 5% dextrose until blood pressure was controlled. After an average treatment period of 5 months, blood pressure of all 8 patients was reduced to 134/76 +/- 7/5 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) pre- and 144/81 +/- 9/5 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) post-dialysis without a significant change in body weight. The present data suggest that captopril alone or combined with salt subtraction normalizes blood pressure of patients on chronic hemodialysis with so called uncontrollable hypertension.", 
    "79": "A new approach was developed for the synthesis of (S)-1-[5-(benzoylamino)-1,4-dioxo-6-phenylhexyl]-L-proline (1) and 23 analogues. The delta-(acylamino)-gamma-keto acid intermediates were obtained by a modified Dakin--West reaction using 3-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride. Acylation of L-proline and recrystallization of the mixture of diastereomers gave the optically pure title compound in three reaction steps. The in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of 1 was confirmed. Some of the novel analogues (6, 11, 13, and 17) were also found to be potent inhibitors of ACE in vitro with an IC50 of 1.4-8.8 x 10(-9) M (IC50 for captopril = 0.9 x 10(-8) M). In vivo these compounds (6, 11, 17, and 18) were much less active than captopril, especially by the oral route. Against angiotensin I (AI) challenge in normotensive conscious rats, 1 and 6 produced less than 50% inhibition at 30 mg/kg po but 57 to 82% inhibition at 3 mg/kg iv. Inhibition by both routes lasted less than 1 h. In renal hypertensive rats, 1 and 15 of its analogues failed to produce significant blood pressure lowering effects, in contrast to the marked effects of captopril. Near maximum inhibition of AI was achieved by continuous intravenous infusions of 1 and 20, suggesting that limited oral activity may by due to degradation and/or clearance.", 
    "80": "Tonin is an enzyme found in the rat submaxillary glands which liberates angiotensin II from angiotensinogen, the Skeggs tetradecapeptide renin substrate, and angiotensin I. Tonin hydrolyzes benzoyl-arginine ethyl ester, benzoyl-arginine methyl ester, tosyl-arginine methyl ester, benzoyl-arginine p-nitroanilide and other small synthetic substrates at an optimum ph of 9.0. Tonin shows, however, a great specificity with respect to angiotensin I. Tonin is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at high concentrations (greater than 10(-2) M) and by soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin. Tonin is thus an esteroprotease of the class of the serine protease with trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activity. Tonin belongs to the same family of enzyme as glandular kallikrein and the gamma subunit of the nerve growth factor.", 
    "81": "Spontaneous blood pressure recovery following hemorrhage in anesthetized rats is almost completely blocked by administration of captopril. This occurs despite comparable or enhanced increases in plasma levels of catecholamines and vasopressin. These findings suggest that angiotensin II, the formation of which is blocked by captopril, is essential to acute blood pressure recovery following hemorrhage and that changes in catecholamines or vasopressin are insufficient to sustain pressure recovery. The data also indicate that angiotensin II formation is not essential in the hemorrhagic stimulation of vasopressin or catecholamines.", 
    "82": "Power spectrum analysis of heart rate fluctuations provides a quantitative noninvasive means of assessing the functioning of the short-term cardiovascular control systems. We show that sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity make frequency-specific contributions to the heart rate power spectrum, and that renin-angiotensin system activity strongly modulates the amplitude of the spectral peak located at 0.04 hertz. Our data therefore provide evidence that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in short-term cardiovascular control in the time scale of seconds to minutes.", 
    "83": "1. We investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in isoprenaline-induced drinking in the rat. Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was used to block the synthesis of angiotensin II either in the circulation alone or in the brain as well.2. Subcutaneous injections of isoprenaline (0.1 mg/kg) alone caused nine rats to drink 8.4 +/- 0.9 ml water in 3 h.3. Pre-treatment with doses of captopril (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.), which inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to II in the circulation but not in the brain, dose-dependently enhanced the drinking response to isoprenaline. Captopril alone did not cause drinking.4. Higher doses of captopril (5.0-100 mg/kg, s.c.), which inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to II in the brain as well as in the blood, caused dose-dependent inhibition of drinking elicited by isoprenaline.5. The highest dose of captopril tested (100 mg/kg, s.c.) completely blocked the drinking response to isoprenaline (0.1 or 0.33 mg/kg, s.c.) for at least 45 min. This inhibition was not caused by general debility of the rats; animals deprived of water (12 h) and treated with both captopril and isoprenaline drank as much as water-deprived controls.6. We found no evidence that blocking the renin-angiotensin system inhibits drinking because it exacerbates isoprenaline-induced hypotension. After injection of isoprenaline the mean arterial pressure of nephrectomized rats or rats pre-treated with the high dose (100 mg/kg, s.c.) of captopril (which blocked drinking) was only slightly lower (5-10 mmHg) than that of rats pre-treated with the low dose (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) of captopril (which enhanced drinking).7. Water deprivation, which caused rats treated with isoprenaline and captopril to drink, did not increase arterial pressure. Pitressin increased the arterial pressure of rats treated with isoprenaline and captopril but did not cause drinking. We conclude that the renin-angiotensin system has a direct and essential role in the drinking response to isoprenaline.", 
    "84": "A 5-year-old boy is presented suffering from malignant hypertension due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Captopril, an oral angiotensin-1-converting enzyme inhibitor, was able to curb the natural course of the malignant hypertension. Haemodialysis could be discontinued after 2 months. The glomerular filtration rate recovered to 63 ml/min/1.73 m2 11 months after the acute phase.", 
    "85": "Blood concentration and urinary excretion of captopril following 50 mg oral administration were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in normal subjects and patients with chronic renal failure. In normal subjects, the maximum blood concentration of the free form of captopril was obtained within 1 hour and was not detectable after 6 hours; 41% of administered captopril was excreted into the urine as free form and metabolites within 2 hours, and 58% within 6 hours. In chronic renal failure patients with an average serum creatinine of 5.1 mg/dl, the absorption constant (Ka), maximum concentration (Cmax), and area under the blood concentration curve (AUC) were not significantly different from those in the normal subjects, but the elimination constant (Ke) and biological half-life (T1/2) showed a significant delay in the disappearance of captopril from the blood (p less than 0.01 respectively). The cumulative amount of urinary excretion of either free-form captopril or its' metabolites was significantly decreased at 2, 4, and 6 hours in chronic renal failure patients (p less than 0.01 or less, respectively). Impairment of kidney function is suggested to be an important factor in the promotion of blood retention of captopril.", 
    "86": "1. Oral administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (30 mg/kg per day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto strain progressively reduced arterial blood pressure by 60 mmHg over 4-5 days. 2. Oral treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with aspirin (200 mg/kg per day) for one week did not alter blood pressure, but it greatly reduced the vasodepressor effects of intravenous injections of arachidonic acid (3 mg/kg). 3. The fall in blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated concurrently with both aspirin (200 mg/kg per day) and captopril (30 mg/kg per day) was not different to the fall observed in rats treated with captopril alone. 4. The hypotensive action of captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats does not appear to be due to stimulation of vasodilator prostanoid biosynthesis.", 
    "87": "Orthostatic hypotension occurs relatively frequently in antihypertensive therapy. Although vasodilators are usually not associated with this response, hydralazine and to some extent minoxidil produced marked orthostasis in conscious dogs in a prior series of experiments. Captopril also reduces blood pressure by a peripheral mechanism. Therefore, its influence on responses to upright tilt were evaluated. Oral administration of captopril reduced blood pressure of conscious normotensive dogs. Even greater falls occurred after pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide. However, the increases in blood pressure and heart rate observed during upright tilting were not altered by captopril.", 
    "88": "Clinical blood pressures measured at clinic by physician were higher than home blood pressures measured at home by patients in the majority of untreated patients with essential hypertension, but equivalent or lower in some patients. Clinic minus home blood pressure (delta P) were correlated with the levels of clinic blood pressure (r = 0.51, p less than 0.005 for systolic; r = 0.35, p less than 0.02 for diastolic blood pressure, respectively). The systolic delta P might be greater in the middle-aged women, especially in the fifties of females than the age-matched males (p less than 0.05). The delta P could not be altered by any antihypertensive drugs with the exception of systolic delta P with diuretic alone. The blood pressure tended to remain more stable throughout the 24-hour period in proportion as the severity of hypertension increased. The observation of circadian variation in blood pressure disclosed that the blood pressure was lower in the morning, but increased gradually, resulting in the relatively high blood pressure between the afternoon and evening in the low renin and volume expanded type of hypertension. On the contrary, the blood pressure was already high in the early morning in hypertensive patients characterized by the accelerated renin-angiotensin system and contracted volume factor.", 
    "89": "1. Systemic and regional vascular changes were measured in conscious rabbits after intravenous sodium meclofenamate, captopril and phentolamine. These drugs were used respectively to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and to block alpha-adrenoceptors. 2. Meclofenamate reduced renal and adrenal blood flow by 11 and 28% respectively, and doubled hepatic artery flow. The effect on renal and adrenal flow persisted in the presence of phentolamine. 3. Captopril decreased estimated peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output without changing arterial pressure. Kidney and adrenal flow increased by 70 and 21% respectively. 4. Phentolamine reduced arterial pressure and doubled flow to skeletal muscle and increased hepatic artery flow to the liver. 5. Splenic blood flow was unaffected by meclofenamate, captopril or phentolamine alone. Meclofenamate given after captopril caused a halving of splenic flow and a rise in arterial pressure; these effects were prevented by phentolamine. 6. The results point to a continuing effect of prostaglandin synthesis in maintaining blood flow to the kidney and adrenal gland independent of alpha-adrenoceptor activation in resting conscious rabbits. An important modulating effect of prostaglandins on sympathetic vascular tone in the spleen is suggested.", 
    "90": "1. The acute effects of a single oral dose of captopril on blood pressure, pulse rate and circulating levels of angiotensin I (ANG I), angiotensin II (ANG II), renin, bradykinin and catecholamines were studied in three groups: eight normal subjects, six salt-depleted normal subjects and 16 patients with essential hypertension. 2. Captopril treatment did not cause any significant fall in supine blood pressure in salt-replete normal subjects or patients with untreated essential hypertension but was associated with a fall in mean blood pressure from 85 +/- 2 to 75 +/- 2 mmHg in salt-depleted normal subjects and from 131 +/- 7 to 117 +/- 5 mmHg in patients with essential hypertension treated with diuretics. There was no change in pulse rate in any group. 3. Hormonal responses to captopril were qualitatively similar in the three groups and consisted of significant falls in ANG II with corresponding increases in ANG I and plasma renin concentration. The changes in plasma renin concentration and ANG I were greater in salt-depleted normal subjects (mean values at 90 min were 1140% and 990% of basal levels respectively) than in salt-replete normal subjects (410%, 190%) and were blunted in patients with essential hypertension (140%, 120%). Blood bradykinin, noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations did not change after captopril in any group. 4. The parallel fall in blood pressure and ANG II levels in salt-depleted normal subjects is consistent with maintenance of blood pressure by increased levels of ANG II in sodium depletion. 5. The failure of captopril to reduce acutely blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension despite suppression of plasma ANG II and without change in circulating bradykinin confirms that the renin-angiotensin system does not play a primary role in essential hypertension.", 
    "91": "We have previously reported that mannitol strikingly increases blood flow to rat kidneys hypoperfused at 35-40mm Hg. This vasodilator effect is not due to volume expansion or alterations in plasma osmolality. We have tested the hypothesis that the vasodilatory effect of mannitol in the ischemic rat kidney is mediated by one of the vasoactive renal hormone systems: renin-angiotension, kallikrein-kinin, or prostaglandins. Rats were infused with 5% mannitol in 0.9% saline to 3-5% of body weight. In agreement with our previous studies, RBF increased 1.3 +/- 0.1 ml/min despite maintenance of perfusion pressure at 35-40 mm Hg. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, meclofenamate and indomethacin had no effect on renal blood flow (RBF) in hypoperfused kidneys. However, in rats pretreated with these inhibitors, expansion with mannitol increased RBF by only 0.37 +/- 0.02 ml/min, 28% of the response in the untreated group (p less than 0.001). Infusion of prostacyclin (PGI2) into the renal artery during reduced perfusion resulted in an increase in RBF of 1.0 +/- 0.1 ml/min. Subsequent expansion with mannitol increased RBF by only 0.5 +/- 0.1 ml/min more, less than one-half of the effect of mannitol in a concurrent group of rats not treated with PGI2. Unlike PGI2 prostaglandin E2 had only a minimal vasodilator effect during hyperperfusion. Imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis, did not alter RBF or renal vascular resistance during hypoperfusion. Treatment of rats during hypoperfusion. with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitor teprotide increased RBF by 1.1 +/- 0.3 ml/min. However, teprotide did not alter the vascular response to mannitol: RBF increased 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml/min more when mannitol was infused into teprotide-treated rats. The renal vascular response to mannitol was not altered by treatment with aprotinin, an inhibitor of the kallikrein-kinin system. Aprotinin was ineffective whether given before or after the vascular response to mannitol was established. We conclude that the vasodilator response to mannitol in the ischemic rat kidney is mediated in large part by increased prostaglandin (PGI2) activity. The failure of converting enzyme inhibition and aprotinin to block the vasodilator response to mannitol is evidence against a role for the renin-angiotension or kallikreinkinin systems in mediating the vasodilator response.", 
    "92": "We studied the effect of angiotensin II analogue (AII-A) and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14,225) on blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in a patient with pseudo-Bartter's syndrome, who was a 26-year-old unmarried Japanese woman taking furosemide surreptitiously. The intravenous infusion of AII-A decreased blood pressure from 85/35 to 68/28 mmHg. This decrease in blood pressure was associated with an increment of plasma renin activity (PRA) and a decrement of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). Similarly, SQ 14,225 given orally decreased blood pressure to the same extent. An increment of PRA and a decrement of PAC were also observed. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a considerable role in maintaining blood pressure in pseudo-Bartter's syndrome. Again, attention has to be paid to the possibility of surreptitious use of diuretics in an adult patient with persistent hypokalemic alkalosis, hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and angiotensin II insensitivity simulating \"true\" Bartter's syndrome.", 
    "93": "In the perfused rat mesenteric vascular bed, the effects of captopril and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) on the vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine or potassium chloride were studied. Captopril or PGI2 in the perfusate attenuated the vascular responses to norepinephrine in a dose-related manner, while these substances had no effect on the vascular contractions induced by potassium chloride. In preparations treated with indomethacin, the inhibitory effect of captopril on the vascular response to norepinephrine was similar to that found in the untreated preparations. These results suggest that, although the effects of captopril on the vascular reactivity is similar to that of PGI2, the direct vascular action of captopril is not mediated by the synthesis of prostaglandins in the vascular bed.", 
    "94": "Angiotensins I, II, and III are potent cardiac inotropic agents, but vasoconstrictor and steroidogenic activities compromise their use in conditions of cardiac dysfunction. This study examines the inotropic and vascular actions of [alanyl7]-substituted angiotensin analogs in field-stimulated rabbit left atria and isometrically contracting aortic strips. Angiotensin II increased cardiac contractility in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 30 nM. Sarcosine substitution at the amino terminus of angiotensin II increased its potency 10-fold. Inhibition of converting enzyme with teprotide (10 microgram/ml) had no effect on contractile responses to angiotensin II or [Sar1]angiotensin II. [Ala7]Angiotensin II was a weaker cardiac stimulant than angiotensin II, but addition of teprotide enhanced its potency to that of angiotensin II. [Sar1, Ala7]Angiotensin II also was equipotent to [Sar1]angiotensin II in the presence of teprotide. The potency of angiotensin I as an inotropic agent (ED50 = 100 nM) was significantly less than that of angiotensin II, and the angiotensin I response was attenuated by teprotide. [Sar1, Ala7]Angiotensin I was a more effective inotropic agent following teprotide administration. These findings indicate that atrial converting enzyme metabolizes angiotensin I and the [Ala7] analogs of angiotensin I and II. Angiotensin II and [Sar1]angiotensin II had activities in aorta similar to those in atria. As previously reported for uterus, [Ala7]Angiotensin II was inactive in aorta whether teprotide was present or not. The decapeptides were equally potent in the aorta and atria. Sarcosine substitution at the NH2 terminus also was observed to attenuate cardiac selectivity. These data indicate that [Ala7]angiotensin analogs are cardioselective inotropic agents.", 
    "95": "Vasodilators play an important role in the treatment of the patient with severe heart failure and increased systemic vascular resistance. However, there are both clinical data and theoretic reasons to anticipate that some degree of tolerance may develop during the long-term use of most agents. The cause of the increased vascular resistance of heart failure is not completely understood, but it appears to be related to a number of neuroendocrine, molecular and physical mechanisms including increased activity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, and increased vascular stiffness due to intra- and extracellular sodium and fluid accumulation. Not surprisingly, a lowering of systemic vascular resistance either by direct smooth muscle relaxers or by blockade of specific neuroendocrine systems may result in a number of compensatory responses at the neuroendocrine and/or molecular level. The over-all effectiveness of a particular vasodilator is the net sum of its direct pharmacologic action, and the neuroendocrine and molecular responses to the drug. The specific compensatory mechanisms activated depend on several factors including the type of vasodilator used, the dose employed, the baseline neuroendocrine status of the patient, the severity of heart failure and the functional integrity of various reflex systems. Although not directly applicable to patients with heart failure, much information derived from the use of these agents to treat patients with hypertension and angina pectoris suggests several potential mechanisms by which tolerance may develop to virtually all classes of vasodilators. The major types of vasodilators are discussed with regard to their potential mechanisms of tolerance. Finally, the evidence currently available from long-term studies is reviewed in order to assess the potential relevance of vasodilator tolerance to the clinical management of the patient with heart failure.", 
    "96": "Intravenous Captopril (20 microgram) in rats produced similar inhibition of the pressor responses to intravenous ANG I (70%) and of plasma-converting enzyme activity (CEA) measured fluorometrically (72%). One week oral treatment with Captopril (50 mg/kg per day) inhibited ANG I pressor responses more (84%) than plasma CEA (23%). Four-month oral treatment of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats with Captopril (50 mg/kg per day) led to a 68% and 71% inhibition of the ANG I pressor responses, but to a 123% and 94% increase of plasma CEA, respectively. Thus, plasma CEA measurements can be dissociated from the in vivo inhibition of converting enzyme (CE). Chronic oral Captopril treatment induces CE biosynthesis.", 
    "97": "Methionine enkephalin release was evoked by depolarization of slices from rat striatum with potassium. In the presence of 0.1 microM thiorphan [(N(R,S)-3-mercapto-2-benzylpropionyl)glycine], a potent inhibitor of enkephalin dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (enkephalinase), the recovery of the pentapeptide in the incubation medium was increased by about 100 percent. A similar effect was observed with the dipeptide phenylalanylalanine, a selective although less potent enkephalinase inhibitor. Inhibition of other known enkephalin-hydrolyzing enzymes--aminopeptidase by 0.1 mM puromycin or angiotensin-converting enzyme by 1 microM captopril--did not significantly enhance the recovery of released methionine enkephalin. These data indicate that enkephalinase is critically involved in the inactivation of the endogenous opioid peptide released from striatal neurons.", 
    "98": "1. The reflex effects of intravenous phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside or acute haemorrhage in rabbits were examined as indices of baroreceptors reflex function. 2. The slope of the linear regression of heart period: mean arterial pressure relationship was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) when buffering the pressor stimulus than either depressor stress. 3. Captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the slope of the relationship to either pressor or depressor stimuli. 4. The clinical and experimental observation of hypotension without bradycardia after captopril could not be confirmed in the present study to be a result of changes in baroreflex sensitivity.", 
    "99": "A sensitive assay is described for quantitating plasma captopril levels. Captopril is an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Blood from patients taking this drug was collected into tubes containing edetate and ascorbic acid, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation. After addition of an internal standard, the plasma was deproteinized and the supernate was adjusted to pH 6.5 N-(1-Pyrene)-maleimide was added to derivatize captopril and an internal standard to fluorescent adducts. These derivatives then were extracted into ethyl acetate-benzene (1:1) and separated from other derivatized thiols by high-performance liquid chromatography. The sensitivity of the assay was 150 pmoles/ml. Preliminary pharmacokinetics were obtained in patients taking captopril chronically for essential hypertension. After administration of 100 mg of captopril for patients who had fasted overnight, the plasma levels rose rapidly; peak levels were obtained at approximately 37 min. Thereafter, the plasma levels declined rapidly, and the terminal half-life was approximately 40 min. In these patients, the time course of the plasma levels did not reflect changes in blood pressure, so there appeared to be no direct relationship between plasma levels of the parent compound and blood pressure changes.", 
    "100": "The mechanism of enhanced renal prostaglandin (PG) release in the in situ pump-perfused kidney was studied in anesthetized dogs. Pump perfusion caused a gradual decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) from 163 to 128 mmHg over an 80-min period. The renal arteriovenous level of PGE and plasma renin activity (PRA) were increased by a mean of 1.36 ng/ml and 22 ng AI.ml-1.h-1, respectively. In a second group of dogs treated with captopril, pump perfusion did not alter PGE or BP, but increased PRA. When the animals were treated with indomethacin, the renal arteriovenous levels of PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were not changed but PRA increased during the 80 min of pump perfusion. In a fourth group of dogs that had undergone renal denervation and phentolamine treatment, changes in PGE and BP occurred during pump perfusion similar to the changes in the control group, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha release by the kidney also increased. The results indicate that renal PG release during group perfusion is mainly due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and that the hypotension due to pump perfusion is PG mediated.", 
    "101": "Potassium and angiotensin II are major regulators of aldosterone secretion. To assess which of these stimuli is the more potent, we measured aldosterone, potassium, and angiotensin II responses to the oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in five patients with resistant congestive heart failure during digoxin and furosemide maintenance therapy. In spite of a positive cumulative potassium balance and a clear-cut rise in plasma potassium, aldosterone levels in plasma and urine declined in parallel with levels of angiotensin II. When captopril treatment was later withdrawn in three patients, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels increased in parallel, while plasma potassium remained steady. The results show that under these study conditions, angiotensin II is more potent than potassium in regulating aldosterone in patients with heart failure.", 
    "102": "Short-term hypertensive and hormonal effects of captopril were studied in 26 hypertensive patients. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded in subjects in the supine position 1 hr before and 3 hr after an oral dose of 1 mg/kg. Urinary, plasma electrolytes, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were determined before and after the test. It was verified, in a preliminary investigation involving 5 patients, that a placebo did not alter the measured parameters. Captopril decreased mean arterial pressure (mean ABP +/- SD) from 128 +/- 2.5 to 108.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); the maximum decrease was between 30 and 180 min. No changes in heart rate or plasma electrolytes were noted. PRA increased after captopril from 2.29 +/- 0.96 to 3.13 +/- 1.25 and to 4.11 +/- 1.87 at 1 hr and 3 hr (p less than 0.05). There was a correlation between PRA in standing subjects before captopril and decrease in mean ABP (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01). The best correlation was between the decrease in mean ABP and the maximum increase in PRA after captopril (r = 0.69). A good correlation was found between mean ABP and PRA 3 hr after captopril (r = 0.62). Correlation coefficients between decrease in mean ABP and either precaptopril PA or decrease in PA were not significant. In 14 patients, captopril (5.1 +/- 0.61 mg/kg/day) for 4 mo induced the same decrease in mean ABP that was observed during the test. After short- and long-term captopril, mean ABP correlated (r = 0.76, p less than 0.01).", 
    "103": "The response to acute oral administration of 50 mg of Captopril was assessed in 17 normal volunteers and 47 patients with hypertension; 17 had renovascular (RVH) abnormalities and 30 patients had essential hypertension (EH). All patients were maintained on ad libitum sodium intake. The effect of Captopril on mean arterial pressure (MAP) was rapid a maximal within 60 minutes. The converting enzyme inhibitor induced a similar decrease in MAP in normal subjects (-5.1 +/- I mm Hg) and patients with EH (-7.2 +/- I mm Hg). Control plasma renin activity (PRA) was similar in both groups; however, the increase in PRA following Captopril was more marked in normals (8.1 +/- 1.7 ng/ml/h) than in EH (1.7 +/- 0.7 ng/ml/h). In patients with RVH a marked fall in MAP occurred (-25.4 +/- 4 mm Hg). A fall in MAP higher than 20 mm Hg was observed in 65% of patients with RVH and none of the EH group. A negative correlation between log PRA and the change in MAP induced by Captopril was obtained (r = 0.65). Assessment of the response to acute administration of Captopril may be useful for screening patients with RVH.", 
    "104": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat, either pithed or anesthetized with urethane, responds to intravenous injections of angiotensin I (A1) and angiotensin II (AII) with pressor responses. These responses vary with time, but the ratio of the responses to AI and AII is constant throughout 4.5 hr. This criterion was used to determine the degree and the duration of effect of captopril. At low (30 micro g/kg iv) and high (3mg/kg iv) doses, it selectively reduces the pressor response to AI, so reducing the AI/AII ratio. The rate of recovery is initially rapid followed by a prolonged slower phase. The degree (maximum 65%) and the duration of inhibition are directly related to the dose of the inhibitor.", 
    "105": "The hypotensive effect of YS-980, (4R)-3-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methyl propanoyl]-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid, was investigated in normotensive and different models of hypertensive rats. Experiments were carried out in both anesthetized rats (1 mg/kg i.v.), and conscious unrestrained rats (10 mg/kg p.o.) YS-980 markedly lowered blood pressure in acute renal hypertensive and two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats and moderately lowered the pressure in SHR. Contrary to these hypotensive effects, this agent did not reduce the blood pressure in DOCA hypertensive rats. In normotensive rats, YS-980 had a slight hypotensive action in anesthetized rats but not in the conscious animals. The hypotensive effect of YS-980 is attributed mainly to suppression of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "106": "Plasma aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone were determined in 15 healthy male volunteers (34 +/- 2 years) following the inhibition of converting enzyme with captopril (SQ 14.225), either with or without indomethacin pretreatment. These studies were performed with the aid of a radioimmunological method for the simultaneous determination of the steroids from 1.0 ml of plasma. The procedure involves one extraction and one chromatographic step. Highly sensitive and specific rabbit antisera were raised for all steroids. Precision and accuracy are shown to be equivalent to those of single steroid radioimmunoassays. Without indomethacin pretreatment a constant and significant fall in aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone plasma levels was obtained after captopril. 18-Hydroxydeoxycorticosterone and corticosterone did not change after inhibition of converting enzyme. Under indomethacin pretreatment all basal steroid levels were significantly reduced. After captopril, aldosterone did not change and 18-hydroxycorticosterone showed a smaller decrease than without indomethacin. 18-Hydroxydeoxycorticosterone and corticosterone increased significantly 1 1/2 hour after captopril. We conclude that indomethacin significantly reduces basal mineralocorticoid production of adrenal zona glomerulosa and fasciculata. Furthermore, the effect of captopril on aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone is abolished or diminished by inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, but indomethacin does not prevent an augmented secretion of 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone and corticosterone.", 
    "107": "Like angiotensin II (AII) itself, [SAR1] AII induced a biphasic blood pressure response in the conscious chicken--an initial depressor response followed by a pressor response. Angiotensin III, however, induced only a depressor response in the dose range tested. The response to angiotensin I was similar to that to AII, and appeared to be due to its conversion to AII as it was inhibited by prior infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20,881. Two angiotensin analog antagonists [SAR1ALA8] AII and [SAR1ILE8] AII inhibited both components of the response to AII, but the pressor response was inhibited at lower concentrations of antagonist than was the depressor response. These findings give further support to the suggestion that the pressor and depressor component of the response to AII in the conscious chicken are mediated via different AII receptors, and indicate the possibility of selective blockade of these two components.", 
    "108": "There are several approaches for interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. Antibodies against renin angiotensins I and II (AI and AII) have not been consistently successful in the past, probably because of nonspecific effects; however, recent purification of renin now makes this approach more promising. Renin inhibitors include pepstatin and analogs, lipids and phospholipids, and renin-substrate analogs. Pepstatin and analogs are the most potent and specific but they are not orally active. The phospholipids are the most effective in vivo but their specificity is yet to be established. No renin-substrate analogs have been developed that have biologically significant effects. Some of the most potent and specific agents available for interfering with the renin-angiotensin system are the AII-receptor antagonists. While these compounds effectively prevent the actions of AII, they suffer from several severe deficiencies: partial agonist activity, short duration of action, and lack of oral activity. The recent development of angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE) inhibitors that are orally active has provided the greatest degree of clinical success for inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and, consequently, the impetus to develop still better compounds. Captopril (SQ 14,225) is the prototype ACE inhibitor, being highly potent and specific with no other demonstrated pharmacological activity. Captopril is effective in all forms of human and animal models of hypertension except mineralocorticoid hypertension, which requires concomitant diuretic therapy. Because ACE is the same enzyme as kininase II, the enzyme that degrades kinins, the possibility exists that kinins are involved in the cardiovascular action of captopril, although this prospect is unlikely.", 
    "109": "The kidney exerts both prohypertensive and antihypertensive functions. Part of the anti-hypertensive function of the kidney is mediated by the renomedullary interstitial cells (RIC), as an endocrine-type function. Six experimental models of hypertension and their relation to the antihypertensive function of the RIC are discussed. It is proposed that the anti-hypertensive function of the RIC may be deficient by the three mechanisms: 1) absence of the cells (as in the renoprival state); 2) severe damage to the cells (as in partial nephrectomy-salt hypertension of the rat and late malignant hypertension of the rabbit); and 3) constraint of the function of these cells (as in angiotensin-salt hypertension due to a lower salt intake). The constraint may result from excessive angiotensin, either by a direct effect or via a hemodynamic mechanism. The converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) fail to exert their antihypertensive function when the RIC are absent or damaged. Conversely, the CEI are effective in those models associated with intact RIC. CEI appear to exert their antihypertensive action partly through an effect on RIC.", 
    "110": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril was assessed during short- and long-term periods in ten patients with elevated blood pressure readings that were uncontrollable by standard therapy (supine diastolic blood pressure of greater than 100 mm Hg with a regimen of propranolol hydrochloride, hydralazine hydrochloride, and hydrochlorothiazide). When given alone, captopril therapy was unable to normalize the blood pressure in any patient. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the captopril therapy normalized the blood pressure in one patient and sharply improved the blood pressure in four others. The blood pressure in the remaining patients responded inadequately to this combination. The addition of propranolol to captopril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced the blood pressure further in most cases (seven on the ten patients had normal blood pressure readings while they received these three drugs). In four patients, the blood pressure response to the added propranolol was unrelated to changes in plasma angiotensin II concentration. Captopril was helpful in the management of refractory hypertension in most cases.", 
    "111": "The metabolic degradation of substance P(SP), some of its C-terminal fragments, and some analogues by rat plasma has been evaluated from the disappearance of the biological activities of these peptides on the guinea pig isolated ileum. The experiments were performed by dissolving each peptide in saline and by adding 20% (v/v) of rat plasma for incubation at 37 degrees C for various periods of time. It was found that SP and octapeptide 4-11 are inactivated quite rapidly and at approximately the same rate whereas SP-free acid, heptapeptide 5-11, hexapeptide 6-11, and [D-Trp8]-SP are inactivated more slowly. The replacement of Phe7 by D-Trp does not protect the undecapeptide SP from inactivation. The degradation of SP and of all the C-terminal fragments was completely blocked by Captopril at a concentration of 10 micrograms/mL of plasma. Under these conditions, Captopril also slightly reduced the rate of inactivation of bradykinin and of SP-free acid. These results were interpreted as indicative of the presence in rat plasma of an endopeptidase that hydrolyses a peptide bond in the C-terminal pentapeptide sequence of SP. This endopeptidase is completely inactivated by Captopril, which thus appears to be not as specific for the angiotensin-converting enzyme as it was thought to be.", 
    "112": "Acute effects of captopril (SQ 14 225) on blood pressure were investigated in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Intravenous captopril (0.1-3 mg/kg) caused reduction of blood pressure dose-independently, while dose-dependent attenuation of exogenous angiotensin I-induced pressor response and potentiation of bradykinin-induced reduction of blood pressure were observed wih the same doses of this agent. This acute decrease in blood pressure was partially inhibited by a pretreatment with any one of aprotinin, Sar1-Ile-8-angiotensin II and indomethacin. More significant inhibition of the blood pressure decrease was observed after the combined pretreatment with Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II and indomethacin or that with all the three drugs, though no complete abolition of the blood pressure decrease was achieved. These results suggest that captopril may decrease blood pressure in anesthetized dogs through other mechanism(s) in addition to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, including the prostaglandin release probably from the kidney.", 
    "113": "This study investigates the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system's role as a modulator of vasopressin action in the toad urinary bladder. Kalli-krein inhibition by aprotinin, which results in decreased kinin production, significantly increased both vasopressin and 8-Br-cyclic (c) AMP-stimulated water flow. Kinin potentiation by the kininase II inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225) significantly decreased vasopressin and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated water flow. In contrast to water flow, vasopressin-stimulated urea permeability was decreased by aprotinin and increased by captopril. We conclude that the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system represents a significant modulator of vasopressin action and it permits separate control of vasopressin-stimulated water flow and solute transport.", 
    "114": "The preventative effects of betablockers and captopril on the development of genetic hypertension in genetically hypertensive rats, were studied after long-term daily dosage by forced feeding, from the 5th to the 20th week of age of the animals. Of the drugs studied, captopril, atenolol and propranolol limited the development significantly, but pindolol only had a modest effect and acebutolol was ineffective. No correlation was found between the degree of prevention of genetic hypertension and the intensity of betablockade. Atenolol and propranolol prevent genetic hypertension by I) reducing cardiac output, a reduction which is not neutralised by the simultaneous change in peripheral resistance, 2) decreasing plasma renin concentrations, and 3) limiting the development of myocardial hypertrophy. Captopril is very effective in preventing the development of genetic hypertension and acts: 1) by causing an early and lasting fall in peripheral resistance related to the suppression of Angiotensin II, and possibly by potentialising the vasodilatation of bradykinins and, 2) by limiting myocardial hypertrophy.", 
    "115": "Microinjections of putative enkephalin releasors, veratridine (0.2 micrograms), L-Tyr-D-Arg (1 microgram) and physostigmine (1 microgram) into the nucleus ambiguus (NA) induced naloxone-reversible bradycardia in chloralosed dogs. In addition, microinjections of compounds known to inhibit enkephalin degradation: D-phenylalanine (10 micrograms), puromycin (20 ng), Gly-Gly-Phe-Met (0.5 micrograms), and captopril (20 ng) induced a naloxone-reversible bradycardia. These results are compatible with the view that an enkephalinergic mechanism is involved in the central vagal control of the heart. These experiments provide evidence that enkephalins are tonically released from nerve terminals located in the NA and that enkephalinase, amino-peptidase and possibly angiotensin I-converting enzyme, could be involved in their catabolism in vivo.", 
    "116": "1 Captopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension. 2 Twenty outpatients received no antihypertensive therapy for 2 weeks, after which they were given placebo for 8 weeks. Since their diastolic blood pressure remained above 100 mm Hg, they were then randomized to receive either captopril (twelve patients) or HCT (eight patients) for a 4-week titration period. If the supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was normalized, (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) by the end of titration period, the established regimen was continued for an 8-week maintenance period; if not, the alternate drug was added in increasing doses for up to 4 weeks and the combined therapy was maintained for the remaining 4 weeks. 3 After the first 4 weeks of therapy, both groups showed a statistically significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Normalization of SDBP occurred in 75% of patients treated with captopril alone, and the addition of HCT produced normalization in the remainder. HCT alone resulted in normalization of SDBP in 50% of patients and the blood pressure of the remaining patients was normalized after the addition of captopril. 4 Captopril given orally, either alone or in conjunction with HCT, is an effective agent for the control of mild and moderate essential hypertension. 5 In our series the main side effects encountered were vertigo and dizziness, transient eosinophilia, a rise of BUN and or/a rise of SGPT or SGOT.", 
    "117": "1. We have measured plasma concentrations of renin, renin substrate and angiotensins I and II as well as plasma renin activity in nine patients with severe or malignant hypertension during treatment with captopril, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol. 2. On captopril and hydrochlorothiazide the plasma concentrations of renin substrate and angiotensin II decreased markedly, while renin and angiotensin I levels were increased. 3. The changes in renin substrate concentration suggest a consumption of substrate induced by an increased renin release. Further, the positive feedback of angiotensin II on hepatic renin substrate synthesis may be inhibited. 4. The sequential changes in renin release during captopril treatment should be monitored by measuring plasma renin concentration since plasma renin activity measurements will be profoundly influenced by the marked changes in plasma renin substrate concentration.", 
    "118": "The converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was given to ten patients with refractory severe hypertension of renal origin: 6 patients had chronic renal failure, 3 patients had hypertension following renal transplantation, and one patient had hypertension and congestive cardiac failure. Control of blood pressure was achieved with doses from 78 to 400 mg/day. Severe hyperkalaemia occurred in one patients, ageusia (dose dependent) in another, and one patients withdrew from treatment because of nausea.", 
    "119": "The systemic, pulmonary, and limb circulatory responses to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were determined in 10 patients with severe, chronic heart failure. Immediate effects include sustained reductions in arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in cardiac output, as reported with other vasodilator drugs. Calf vascular resistance did not change despite substantial lowering of total systemic vascular resistance, indicating that arteriolar dilatation occurred on a selective basis. Transient reduction in mean right atrial pressure paralleled slight calf venodilatation, but effects upon the resistance vasculature predominated. Plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentrations increased after therapy in the acute phase as plasma aldosterone levels consistently fell. During maintenance oral treatment over 7 to 15 months (median, 11.5 months), patients displayed symptomatic benefit, improved functional capacity, and greater exercise tolerance. No major adverse reactions developed. These findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril in congestive heart failure patients improved cardiocirculatory function through selective arteriolar dilatation. The reordering of regional blood flow which appears to result from release of angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction, as well as the suppression of aldosterone, may underlie the prolonged benefit observed in these patients. This oral vasodilator appears to represent an effective adjunct for the treatment of advanced, chronic heart failure refractory to conventional measures.", 
    "120": "Treatment with SQ 14.225, an inhibitor of the enzyme converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II and lowering of plasma renin activity by dietary salt overload, significantly decreased hypertrophy of the right ventricle in chronically hypoxic rats. The smaller degree of right ventricular hypertrophy registered in hypoxic rats with suppressed activity of the renin-angiotensin system was proportional to the decrease in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension noted in these animals. Lowering of pulmonary hypertension in chronically hypoxic rats by suppression of the renin-angiotensin system is consistent with the idea that angiotensin II may be involved in eliciting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Inhibition of converting enzyme also lowered the systemic arterial pressure in hypoxic rats, but this finding could not be taken as evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin system in homeostatic control of blood pressure in normal animals, since the plasma-renin activity in hypoxic rats is increased and the blood pressure higher than in rats kept under normoxic conditions.", 
    "121": "1 MK 421 and its lysine analogue are two new inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. Ten mg of both compounds were each given p.o. to 12 normotensive volunteers to determine their effect on the various components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. 2 Plasma converting enzyme activity decreased to very low levels within 3 to 4 h to recover only slowly over the next 72 h. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone also fell but returned to baseline within 24 h, whereas plasma renin activity rose reflecting the low angiotensin II levels. 3 There was a close correlation between both angiotensin II and aldosterone levels and the logarithm of plasma converting enzyme activity demonstrating that angiotensin II and aldosterone fell only when converting enzyme activity was reduced to very low levels. 4 Mean hourly urinary sodium excretion increased markedly 6 to 10 h post-drug, while blood pressure decreased slightly. Both drugs were well tolerated. 5 Thus 10 mg of MK 421 or its lysine analogue given orally are effective and long acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "122": "We have studied inhibition of homogeneous human converting enzyme by a new inhibitor, a ketomethylene derivative of the blocked tripeptide substrate, Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro (ketoACE). KetoACE inhibited the hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu and Hip-Phe-Arg at different concentrations (I50 values were 4 X 10(-8) M and 2 X 10(-7) M, respectively). Kinetic studies indicated that ketoACE inhibits the hydrolysis of both substrates by a similar, non-competitive mechanism. At the lowest enzyme concentration tested, using 3H-Hip-Gly-Gly as substrate, the I50 of ketoACE was 6 X 10(-9) M. KetoACE protected a functional tyrosine residue in the active site of human converting enzyme from modification with N-acetylimidazole. It is proposed that there are alternate (hydrophobic) binding sites for both inhibitors and substrates in the active site of human converting enzyme. It should be possible to develop other high-affinity inhibitors of this class that bind to hydrophobic sites and do not require metal binding via a sulfhydryl group.", 
    "123": "Many avian species demonstrate atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP) that are influenced by age, sex, diet, and environment, but show no arteriosclerosis in small vessels. Thus, we aimed to define neural and humoral control of BP in conscious, 32-wk-old female chickens, Gallus gallus. Mean aortic pressure (determined by chronically implanted catheter) was 137.6 +/- 2.0 mm Hg; heart rate was 295 +/- 4 beats/min. Plasma renin activity (PRA), measured by radioimmunoassay of fowl angiotensin I ([Asp1, Val5, Ser9]AI), and plasma angiotensinogen levels were 3.55 +/- 0.31 ng/ml/hr and 1229 +/- 66 ng/ml respectively. Repeated injection of propranolol (4 to 8 mg/kg/day, i.m.) decreased (p less than 0.01) the BP 19.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and heart rate 76 +/- 6 beats/min. Acute infusion of propranolol also markedly reduced BP and heart rate, and increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. SQ 14,225 (20 mg/kg/day) reduced BP (p less than 0.01), but BP returned towards original levels unless a higher dose was given. PRA increased 2- to 6-fold. BP also decreased 31.0 +/- 2.1 mm Hg after reserpine treatment, but not after [Sar1, Ile8]AII. These results suggest that in maintaining BP in fowl the beta-adrenergic function is important, whereas the renin-angiotensin system may not have a primary role.", 
    "124": "The effects of simultaneous angiotensin blockade and sodium depletion on the development of one-kidney renovascular hypertension were studied in rats. In sodium-replete rats, systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased from 102 +/- 2 to 153 +/- 11 mmHg by the 12th day after unilateral nephrectomy and subsequent partial occlusion of the renal artery with a 0.22-mm silver clip. When changes in body fluid volume were minimized by sodium restriction in a second group of rats, the increase in SBP from 98 +/- 4 to 149 +/- 7 mmHg after clipping was not different from that in sodium-replete animals. Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme with SQ 14,225 during sodium restriction prevented the SBP from increasing above 101 +/- 3 mmHg by the 12th day after nephrectomy and clipping. Once SQ 14,225 administration was discontinued, SBP rose significantly to 148 +/- 5 mmHg within 5 days. Because previous studies have shown that neither sodium depletion nor angiotensin blockade alone prevented the development of one-kidney renovascular hypertension, it is concluded that the increase in blood pressure resulting from renal artery constriction and contralateral nephrectomy was prevented only by suppression of both the renin-angiotensin system and body fluid volume.", 
    "125": "Three new angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were given orally to 20 men in single doses ranging from 1.25 to 40 mg. Two of them induced comparable marked inhibition of both the blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I and plasma converting-enzyme activity. Onset of action was relatively slow, but 21 to 24 hr after drug plasma converting-enzyme activity was still clearly reduced. The third was less active. There was a close correlation between blood pressure response on administration of angiotensin I and plasma converting-enzyme activity. There were no adverse effects. These new drugs are interesting because of their long duration of action. The measurement of plasma converting-enzyme activity seems useful for monitoring efficacy of converting-enzyme blockade and compliance to therapy.", 
    "126": "To study the influence of acute and chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade on the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II, vasopressin and norepinephrine, we gave normal female Wistar rats 100 mg of captopril or 1 ml of 5% glucose twice daily by gavage for 2 weeks. On the 15th day, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and dose-response curves to angiotensin II, lysine-vasopressin, and norepinephrine were obtained before and after intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of captopril or 1 ml of 5% glucose. Acute as well as chronic converting enzyme blockade enhanced the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II. Similarly, sensitivity to exogenous vasopressin was increased by both acute and chronic converting enzyme inhibition. In contrast, chronic converting enzyme blockade significantly blunted the response to exogenous norepinephrine, whereas acute blockade tended to accentuate its pressor effect. These results suggest that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade may partly inhibit sympathetic activity which, in turn, might contribute to the antihypertensive efficacy of this therapeutic approach. These results also point to an important physiological interaction between the two pressor hormones, angiotensin II and vasopressin.", 
    "127": "Changes induced by i.v. and subcutaneous teprotide in plasma renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, aldosterone and bradykinin were studied in a renal transplant patient with severe high renin hypertension, before and after trinephrectomy. The immediate reduction in BP produced by teprotide was not solely attributable to the inhibition of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, because there was also a transient increase in serum bradykinin; however, the prolonged antihypertensive effect of teprotide appeared independent of bradykinin. After trinephrectomy, teprotide lowered systolic BP but had no significant effect on diastolic BP or plasma bradykinin. beta-Blockade prevented the secondary increase in plasma renin which followed teprotide, thereby potentiating its anti-hypertensive effect.", 
    "128": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of treatment of SHR with captopril, teprotide, and saralasin on vascular and cardiac responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and angiotensin I and II (AI, AII) and norepinephrine (NE). A single dose of captopril (10 mg/kg i.v. as well as 10 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) caused significant and marked inhibition of pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in pithed SHR but cardiac responses were unaffected. Pressor responses to AI were abolished but those to AII and NE were not significantly altered. Neither teprotide nor saralasin caused consistent inhibition of sympathetic responses despite total blockade of AI and AII response respectively. Selective inhibition of pressor but not cardiac responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation was obtained after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months of daily oral doses of captopril. In addition, postjunctional pressor responses to AI, AII, and NE were also significantly inhibited by chronic captopril treatment. Infusion of AII, bilateral nephrectomy, or pretreatment with indomethacin alone in pithed SHR receiving captopril had no effect on the inhibition of pressor responses to sympathetic stimulation. However, the combination of pretreatment of indomethacin and infusion of AII completely restored sympathetic function in SHR receiving captopril. These studies suggest that captopril has a selective inhibitory effect on vascular responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation but not on cardiac responses. Moreover, this effect may have a prejunctional component since, after acute treatment, there is no inhibitory effect on responses to AII or NE. Since, under appropriate conditions, the inhibition can be reversed by AII infusion but not nephrectomy, it is suggested that this inhibition occurs at the vascular level by inhibition of local AII formation by captopril, a site not accessible to teprotide or saralasin.", 
    "129": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225, 50 mg tid) was used for treating a patient with idiopathic edema. A marked improvement of clinical condition was achieved as confirmed by the significant decrease in the morning-evening weight difference during treatment. No disturbance of arterial pressure regulation as well as side effects were observed after a 22 month-period of treatment. This observation which needs further studies brings a new approach of the treatment of patients with idiopathic edema.", 
    "130": "Nine patients with primary, non-obstructive myocardiopathy were treated during 6 months with captopril in daily doses of 75 to 225 mg. Early signs of haemodynamic improvement included significant increase in cardiac output (p Less Than 0.01) and stroke volume (p Less Than 0.01) and significant decrease in peripheral resistance (p Less Than 0.001) and pulmonary wedge pressure (p Less Than 0.001). These effects were sustained throughout treatment and were accompanied with noticeable improvement in the patients' functional status. Echocardiographic studies showed a reduction in the telesystolic (p Less Than 0.01) and telediastolic (p Less Than 0.05) diameters of the left ventricle after 6 months's treatment. The preejection period, calculated from phonomecanograms, was also significantly reduced. Plasma renin activity initially rose (p Less Than 0.01), then fell below pre-treatment values (p Less Than 0.02). Plasma aldosterone levels decreased (p Less Than 0.05), together with angiotensin-converting enzyme levels (p Less Than 0.05). Basal plasma renin activity correlated with both basal peripheral resistance (r = 0.72; p Less Than 0.02) and fall in peripheral resistance (r = 0.89; p Less Than 0.01). There was no tachyphylaxis nor evidence of blood, kidney or liver toxicity.", 
    "131": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14225) was proposed as first treatment in 12 cases of uncomplicated essential hypertension maintained on unrestricted sodium intake (group I). Arterial pressure was normalized in 7 patients (subgroup Ia) whilst hydrochlorothiazide was added to captopril in 5 patients (subgroup Ib). A significant dose-response curve between the dose of captopril (range 75 to 450 mg/day) and the antihypertensive effect was obtained with a maximum at 300 mg/day. In 8 patients (group II) hydrochlorothiazide was proposed first and the addition of captopril was necessary in 4 cases. No relationship between pretreatment PRA and the maximum effect of captopril was observed (r = -0.34, NS). No disturbance of upright blood pressure regulation was noted. Adverse reaction consisted of 4 cases of benign and spontaneously regressive skin rash or pruritus.", 
    "132": "Five patients with malignant arterial hypertension and terminal (3) or advanced (2) renal failure were treated with the alpha-beta blocker labetalol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Labetalol alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents had been ineffective in two cases and captopril alone in one; yet hypertension was rapidly controlled when the two drugs were given together. The return of blood pressure to normal levels brought about regression of digitalis-resistant cardiac failure in 2 patients and slight improvement of renal function in 2 other patients. The captopril-labetalol combination probably has a synergistic effect, and although its mechanism remains obscure this effect may be used to treat patients with severe or malignant arterial hypertension.", 
    "133": "Of 58 patients treated with captopril, 3 have now received the drug for more than 2 years and 22 for more than one year. This study concerns 38 patients treated for 6 months, captopril having been given alone during the first 2 months. They all had severe hypertension (diastolic BP Greater Than 110 mmHg) which had resisted previous treatments in normally effective doses, including at least one beta-blocker, dihydralazine and a diuretic. After 6 months blood pressure levels were normal in 53% of the patients, reduced in 31% and unchanged in 16%. Clinical improvement was habitual with, in particular, disappearance or decrease of tiredness and dyspnoea. Since some side-effects of the drug, such as granulopenia, proteinuria and ageusia, are mainly observed with high dosage, captopril is usually administered in doses lower or equal to 400 mg/day. In resistant or malignant hypertension it must be used in combination with salt-free diet, a beta-blocker and/or prazosin. Clinical, haematological and renal surveillance is necessary during treatment. When these precautions are observed, captopril constitutes a very useful drug for the treatment of patients with severe resistant hypertension.", 
    "134": "The orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 (captopril) was administered to 14 hypertensive patients resistant to conventional therapy. A marked antihypertensive effect was observed; all the patients were responders and blood pressure decreased by more than 20% in 13 out of them. Subjective tolerance was very good. Untoward effects of an immuno-allergic type have been noticed in 30% of these cases but disappeared in all instances when daily doses of the drug had been reduced, allowing maintenance of the treatment. Plasma renin activity increased during captopril administration but no relationship appeared between pretreatment plasma renin activity and the extent of blood pressure response to the drug. The use of captopril must be considered in severe and resistant hypertension but careful monitoring of this treatment is needed.", 
    "135": "Fifteen patients with severe essential or renal hypertension were treated with captopril. In thirteen, a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg produced a mean fall of 20.7 +/- 16.42 mmHg (18%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) without concomitant increase in heart rate. The fall was significant at 20 minutes and maximum at 90 minutes on average. It correlated closely with the initial plasma renin activity (PRA) (r = 0.96) and with the increase in PRA under treatment (r = 0.75). After an 8-day treatment with captopril alone in increasing dosage (mean: 453 +/- 140 mg/day), the fall in MAP still was 20.3% and correlated with that observed with a single dose. Blood pressure returned to normal levels (MAP Less Than 110 mmHg) in seven of these patients. Twelve patients were treated for a mean period of 36 days and all had normal blood pressure at the end of that period. However, seven had required addition of frusemide to the treatment. A moderate increase in serum creatinine was observed in 7 cases, but there were no other adverse reactions. Captopril alone or combined with diuretics proved to be a very effective drug for the treatment of hypertension, particularly in patients with high initial PRA.", 
    "136": "Twenty patients with chronic congestive heart failure resistant to conventional treatment with digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators received captopril, an oral inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, in daily doses of 200 mg and were followed up for 2 months or more. At 2 months, there was a significant reduction in functional symptoms (NYHA classification), bodyweight and left ventricular filling pressure, with an equally significant rise in cardiac output and sodium urinary excretion. There was no fall in systemic blood pressure, nor tachycardia. These effects were sustained in 8 patients followed up for 6 months. They seem to indicate that captopril is both effective and well tolerated in chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "137": "Captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, was administered for 9 to 13 months to 11 patients with severe arterial hypertension and/or hypertension resistant to conventional treatments. The drug had to be discontinued in 2 patients on account of skin rash or peripheral neuropathy. In the remaining 9 patients, return of blood pressure to normal levels was obtained with combined captopril and diuretic treatment, except in one case where captopril alone proved sufficient. The anti-hypertensive effect developed over several weeks. No rebound phenomenon was observed after temporary arrest of captopril. Positive correlation was noted between the fall in blood pressure induced by the first dose of captopril and the patients' initial plasma renin activity. Captopril appears to be of considerable interest for the treatment of severe hypertension, even when it is associated with renal insufficiency.", 
    "138": "Captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, is very effective in preventing the development of genetic hypertension in SHR rats. This effect results from early, overall lowering of local vascular resistances and, consequently, suppression of the age-related increase in total peripheral resistance. Contrary to that of dihydralazine and atenolol, it persists for up to 12 weeks after the drug is discontinued. Captopril may act by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme present in the vascular wall, with subsequent temporary arrest of the vascular lesions associated with progressive genetic hypertension.", 
    "139": "The recent development of several inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system has perfected our knowledge of the part played by this system in the control of physiological and pathological arterial pressure. Peptides inhibiting angiotensin II, such as Sar1, Ala8 angiotensin II, block the peripheral effects of angiotensin on vascular renal and adrenal receptors. Inhibition of the conversion enzyme, notably with captopril, prevents the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I and also results in accumulation of a vasodilator and natriuretic peptide: bradykinin. Finally, it is now possible to inhibit more specifically the reaction of renin with its substrate, angiotensinogen, by using pepstatin or its derivatives, or peptide analogues of the substrate. The use of these inhibitors, especially captopril (so far the most studied), has made it clear that renin plays a part in experimental and human essential hypertension and participates in the control of arterial blood pressure in subjects with normal sodium intake.", 
    "140": "In a patient with periarteritis nodosa failure of antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics encouraged the authors to use captopril in doses of 150 mg per day. Blood pressure rapidly returned to normal levels. The hypotensive effect of captopril is ascribable to its action on the renin-angiotensin system, since plasma renin activity was particularly high in this patients.", 
    "141": "The effects of various doses of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril injected into the lateral brain ventricle (i.c.v.) and intravenously (i.v.) on blood pressure (BP) and on converting enzyme activity were tested in stroke prone conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-sp) and in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Injection of 500 micrograms captopril i.c.v. produced a marked biphasic BP effect in SHR-sp, an initial increase followed by a long-lasting decrease. Only the initial BP increase was observed in WKY. The pressor responses to i.c.v. angiotensin I (ANG I) were completely blocked after i.c.v. captopril injection and this effect lasted for 24 h. The pressor responses to i.v. ANG I were also inhibited immediately after 500 micrograms captopril i.c.v. and gradually returned to control values within 5 h. Intravenous injections of 500 micrograms captopril almost completely inhibited the pressor responses to i.v. ANG I; they caused a moderate BP decrease in SHR-sp and had no significant BP effects in WKY. In SHR-sp, 5 micrograms captopril i.c.v. caused a reduction of BP with a concomitant inhibition of the pressor effects of i.c.v. ANG I. Both effects lasted about 30 min. The pressor responses to i.v. ANG I were not inhibited. In WKY, 5 micrograms captopril i.c.v. had no effect on BP. It is concluded that captopril can reduce BP by action on the brain without peripheral inhibition of converting enzymes. Following high doses injected i.c.v., the inhibitor leaks into the periphery but this cannot explain the marked hypotensive effect in SHR-sp.", 
    "142": "1. Arterial plasma renin activity was significantly elevated in rats with one-kidney, one-clip hypertension of less than 3 weeks duration. 2. Intraperitoneal injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14 225 (captopril) caused a dose-related decrease in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The lowest dose of captopril used (3.5 mg/kg) inhibited conversion of exogenous angiotensin I and maximally potentiated the depressor response to bradykinin, but failed to restore blood pressure to that of the normotensive controls. 3. Removal of the solitary clipped kidney also did not restore blood pressure to normal. Injection of captopril (3.5 mg/kg) 24 h after nephrectomy, when no circulating renin activity was detectable, lowered blood pressure further in hypertensive but not in similarly nephrectomized controls. 4. These results indicate that raised blood pressure in early one-kidney, one-clip hypertension in the rat cannot be entirely attributed to the renin-angiotensin system, even when plasma renin activity is significantly increased. 5. This study has also confirmed a hypotensive action of captopril in anephric rats when plasma renin activity is undetectable.", 
    "143": "The myotropic effects of bradykinin (BK) and other kinins in two isolated veins, the rabbit jugular and the guinea pig anterior mesenteric, have been studied. The effects of degradation on the biological activities of these compounds and the receptor types mediating their myotropic effects have been determined. It has been found that contractions elicited by kinins in these veins result from direct actions on specific receptors. Both veins contain active kininase II (but not active carboxypeptidases A or B) which interferes with the measurement of the myotropic effects and can be blocked by 1-(D-3-mercapto-2-methyl-3-oxopropyl)-L-proline (SQ 14225). The slopes but not the maxima of the concentration-response curves of BK and other kinins measured in the presence of SQ 14225 are different from those recorded in its absence whereas no significant changes are observed in concentration-response curves obtained with the analogue [D-Phe8]-BK, which resists degradation by kininase II. BK is more potent than its fragment sequence des-Arg9-BK and the effects of kinins are antagonized by dihydrochlorprothixene and beta-phenylalanine hexyl ester. These findings suggest that the rabbit jugular and the guinea pig anterior mesenteric veins contain receptors of the B2 type. The findings presented in this paper indicate that the rabbit jugular vein and the guinea pig anterior mesenteric vein are sensitive preparations for kinins and they can be useful for structure-activity studies of these peptides. A correct evaluation of the relative affinities of various kinins is, however, only possible by eliminating the interference of kininase II.", 
    "144": "Intraperitoneal injection of purified hog renal renin produced a marked and sustained elevation of arterial pressure and lesions of the \"fibrinoid necrosis\" type in the small arteries and arterioles of the pancreas, heart and mesentery, but not of the brain, in bilaterally nephrectomized rats. Both the elevation of arterial pressure and the production of arterial lesions were completely prevented by pretreatment with oral SQ14225. Plasma renin clearance in bilaterally nephrectomized rats was markedly slower than that in sham-nephrectomized rats. Pre-treatment with oral SQ14225 did not affect renin clearance. It is suggested that sustained high blood pressure due to the sustained high plasma renin concentration in bilaterally nephrectomized rat was responsible for the production by renin of lesions of the fibrinoid necrosis type in the arteries.", 
    "145": "1. The central action of captopril (D-3-mercapto-methylpropanoyl-L-proline, SQ 14225) in the rat was evaluated by measuring the effect of the orally administered drug on responses to angiotensin I given intracerebroventricularly. 2. The pressor and dipsogenic effects of angiotensin I (20 ng) injected into the third ventricle were reduced by about 50% for 4 h following the oral administration of captopril, 20mg/kg. Both responses returned to pretreatment control values 8 h after captopril administration. 3. Orally administered captopril affects the action of angiotensin I on the central nervous system thus providing an alternative explanation for the hypotensive effect of captopril. This effect if probably due to the direct passage of captopril through the blood brain barrier.", 
    "146": "1. At a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously, captopril lowered blood pressure in conscious rabbits, that had undergone denervation of sinoaortic baroreceptors, but had no effect on heart rate. In sham-operated controls, this dose caused only an increase in heart rate. 2. In the same experiments, captopril caused a substantial inhibition of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (CE) activity of rapid onset and gradual decline over 2 to 3 h. The time course of recovery of blood pressure and plasma CE activity were similar. 3. Saralasin, by intravenous infusion, lowered blood pressure in sinoaortic rabbits but to a smaller extent than captopril. 4. The fall in blood pressure observed after captopril is not dependent on the integrity of baroreceptor afferents.", 
    "147": "A plasma inhibitor of tonin activity in the rat, was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange of chromatography, and gel filtration. Its purity was investigated by analytical electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and by ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity. The molecular weight (360 000) of the purified inhibitor was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and its isoelectric point (4.5) by gel isoelectrofocusing. The Stokes radius (640 nm) was evaluated by gel filtration studies and a frictional ratio (f/fo) of 1.95 was calculated from the molecular weight and Stokes radius. Kinetic studies using angiotensin I as substrate showed that the inhibition of tonin by the purified inhibitor was noncompetitive and does not exceed 70%. Electrophoresis showed the same mobility for [125I]tonin bound to plasma proteins and for [125I]tonin bound to the purified inhibitor. The inhibitor may be a protein resembling half of the dimeric protease inhibitor rat alpha 1-macroglobulin or human alpha 2-macroglobulin.", 
    "148": "Murine schistosomiasis is a granulomatous disease associated with high serum and granuloma angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. SQ 14225, a specific competitive inhibitor of ACE, was administered to normal mice and mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni to determine whether this compound could inhibit granuloma ACE activity and modify the size of the granulomatous response to schistosome eggs. Peroral administration of SQ 14225 for 5 wk to infected mice with peak granulomatous responses decreased ACE activity in isolated liver granulomas. Treated mice demonstrated a decrease in granuloma size in the liver, colon, and ileum, and hydroxyproline concentration of isolated liver granulomas was increased. Mean diameters of synchronous pulmonary granulomas, induced by the pulmonary embolization of schistosome eggs into normal and sensitized mice, were decreased by a similar dose of SQ 14225. Withdrawal of SQ 14225 from unsensitized mice with 2-wk-old synchronous pulmonary granulomas induced an increase in inflammation. Infected, but not normal mice receiving SQ 14225 demonstrated reduced portal pressure, liver weight, and body weight. Both normal and infected mice experienced dipsogenesis, expanded intravascular volume, and increased serum ACE. These observations suggest that SQ 14225 can partially inhibit the granulomatous response to schistosome eggs and the pathological manifestations of schistosomiasis. It is possible that ACE has an inflammatory role in granulomatous inflammation.", 
    "149": "To enable its immunohistologic localization, angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) from human lung was solubilized by trypsinization and purified approximately 2,660-fold to apparent homogeneity from a washed lung particulate fraction. The specific activity of pure enzyme was estimated to be 117 mumol/min per mg protein with the substrate hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine. Consistent with previously described lung enzyme studies, catalytic activity was strongly inhibited by EDTA, O-phenanthroline, SQ 20,881, and SQ 14,225 and increased by CoCl(2). SQ 20,881 was a somewhat more potent inhibitor than SQ 14,225, unlike rabbit lung enzyme. The Michaelis constant (K(m)) with hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine was 1.6 mM. The molecular weight was estimated at 150,000 from sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single polypeptide chain estimated at 130,000 daltons. Rabbit antibody to human lung enzyme was prepared by parenteral administration of pure angiotensin-converting enzyme in Freund's adjuvant. Rabbit antibody to human lung angiotensin-converting enzyme appeared to crossreact weakly with the rabbit enzyme and strongly inhibited the catalytic activity of the enzymes from human serum, lung, and lymph node. The specificity of the rabbit antibody and purity of the final human lung enzyme preparation was suggested by the single precipitin lines obtained by radial double immunodiffusion, and by the coincidence of enzyme catalytic activity and immunoreactivity on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with both relatively pure and highly impure enzymes. Generally applicable sensitive analysis of acrylamide gels for immunoreactivity (and subsequently for any other activity) by use of intact gel slices in radial double immunodiffusion was devised. Human lung enzyme was very tightly bound to and catalytically active on anti-human enzyme antibody covalently bound to Sepharose 4B, and could not be readily dissociated without inactivation. Antibody to human lung angiotensin converting enzyme has permitted tissue localization of the enzyme, which appears to be clinically useful in diseases associated with abnormal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme in tissues, such as sarcoidosis.", 
    "150": "The effects of angiotensin I (AT I), angiotensin II (AT II) and the activity of AT I converting enzyme (ACE) were investigated in isolated portal veins of normotensive rats (WKR and NCR) and of rats with primary (SHR) and secondary (one clip 2 kidney renal; RHR) hypertension. Based on ED50 values, the tissue sensitivity to AT II was slightly less in the portal veins of RHR than SHR, while the sensitivity of smooth muscle in NCR and WKR was similar to that of SHR. Angiotensin I induced contractions were inhibited by saralasin and by captopril, indicating presence of functionally active converting enzyme in the this vascular tissue. The local concentration of AT II formed from AT I, was evaluated based on AT II dose response curves and AT I response magnitude. The AT II formation was essentially similar in SHR, WKR and NCR and slightly enhanced in RHR. Inhibition of AT II formation with captopril and/or blockade of AT II receptors with saralasin failed to alter the spontaneous myogenic activity of the portal vein. Captopril reduced smooth muscle activity only in concentration several orders of magnitude greater than that needed to inhibit ACE. The concentration of captopril needed to inhibit AT I responses was similar in all strains of rats. It is concluded that AT II is rapidly formed in the portal vein due to local conversion of AT I. In the RHR portal vein the extent of AT I conversion is increased and the tissue sensitivity to AT II is decreased possibly due to mechanisms involved in the development of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "151": "In this review the physiologic role of the renin-angiotensin system in blood pressure regulation is discussed, and the alterations of the renin secretion in various forms of hypertension are examined. Furthermore a critical appraisal is made of the diagnostic and prognostic value of the plasma renin activity assay in hypertensive diseases.", 
    "152": "The effects of morphine and captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on respiratory frequency have been investigated in non-anesthetized mice. Morphine (10.0 mg/kg) reduced the respiratory frequency which gradually returned to the control level 2 h after the injection. The same dose of morphine when given together with captopril (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg), caused a similar reduction in respiratory rate. This respiratory depression however, persisted until the end of the observation period. Similar results were obtained with the same dose of morphine in mice pretreated with captopril. The minimal dose of morphine reducing respiratory frequency (3.0 mg/kg), when given to the mice pretreated with captopril (0.1 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in respiratory frequency and this effect was equal to that obtained with 10.0 mg/kg morphine alone. The results are discussed from the point of the possible inhibitory effect of captopril on the enkephalin degrading enzyme(s).", 
    "153": "Evidence is reported for the presence of dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) and of inhibitor(s) of this enzyme in synovial fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and gout.", 
    "154": "The relationship between angiotensin conversion and release of prostaglandins (PGs) were studied in isolated, perfused, mesenteric vasculature of rats. PGs in the mesenteric effluent were detected by bovine coronary artery and rat stomach strip, and by radioimmunoassay of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha and PGE2. Angiotensin II (AII) was assayed simultaneously using rabbit aorta. Both angiotensin I (AI) and AII released a prostacyclin (PGI2)-like substance, but little PGE2 from the mesentery, AII being 5 times more potent. Indomethacin (2.8 micrometers) abolished angiotensin-induced release of PGI2. Of the AI (0.2--1.5 nmol) injected into the perfusion medium, 3--8% was converted to AII in passage through the mesentery. Captopril (4 micrometers), infused through the mesentery, inhibited AI-induced PGI2 release, but did not affect release induced by AII. Release of the PGI2-like substance by higher doses of AI (2--20 nmol) in the presence of captopril was always accompanied by concomitant contraction of rabbit aorta, indicating residual conversion of AI. Infusion of (Sar1, Ala8)AII (3--30 nM) through the mesentery abolished PGI2 release by both peptides. By choosing doses of AI and AII which produce equivalent amounts of AII in the mesenteric effluent, it appeared that AII generated locally in the mesenteric vasculature was a more effective stimulus for PGI2 generation than AII in the perfusion fluid. There is no evidence for intrinsic activity of AI, and release of the PGI2-like substance appears to be mediated through an AII receptor.", 
    "155": "1. In adult conscious sheep the pressor actions of infused angiotensin II were prevented by the concomitant intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside. The effect of such intravenous infusions of angiotensin II on the cardiac baroreflex response to transient rises in arterial pressure caused by intravenous phenylephrine was studied. 2. Intravenous infusion of angiotensin II caused a reduction in pulse interval in the absence of any change in arterial pressure. It also caused a reduction in baroreflex sensitivity measured by determining the relation between pulse interval and systolic pressure during the rise in pressure caused by injection of phenylephrine. 3. After administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) the mean baroreflex sensitivity of 3 of 4 pregnant ewes increased. 4. It is concluded that high levels of angiotensin II can modify the cardiac baroreceptor reflex response so that the heart rate is inappropriately high for a given systolic pressure and that it reduces the sensitivity of the cardiac baroreflex response to transient changes in arterial pressure.", 
    "156": "Administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (25 mg/kg body weight, SC) to female rats resulted in copious drinking. The dipsogenic response to administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was blocked by propranolol (6 mg/kg body weight, IP), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and captopril (35 mg/kg body weight, IP), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. In addition, clonidine (12.5 and 25 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a central alpha-adrenergic agonist known to inhibit renin release, attenuated drinking during 1, 2 and 3 hours after 5-HTP was administered. These results suggest that 5-HTP-induced drinking is mediated by way of the renin-angiotensin system. Haloperidol (150 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a dopaminergic antagonist, also attenuated the dipsogenic response to administration of 5-HTP. In addition, incremental reductions in 5-HTP-induced drinking with increasing doses of spiperone (37.5 to 150 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a more potent dopaminergic antagonist, were demonstrated. Thus, the dipsogenic response to administration of 5-HTP to rats is dependent on both the renin-angiotensin system and an intact dopaminergic pathway.", 
    "157": "The chronic antihypertensive effect of converting enzyme inhibtor (CEI) may be due to a decrease in aldosterone secretion secondary to blockade of angiotensin II formation. To study this hypothesis, changes in blood pressure (BP), in response to chronic administration of the CEI, captopril, were measured in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and in chronic two-kidney, one clip hypertensive (2K-1C) rats. To avoid a decrease in mineralocorticoid activity, half of the rats in these two models of hypertension were adrenalectomized and maintained with daily administrations of deoxycorticosterone acetate and hydrocortisone (steroid replacement) while the other half had the adrenal gland left in situ and no exogenous steroids administered. The doses of steroids used were devoid of hypertensive effect in Wistar Kyoto (WKY), SHR, 2K-1C, and sham-clipped rats. Chronic administration of the CEI decreased the BP to normotensive levels in the SHR with intact adrenals and no steroid replacement. However, the antihypertensive effect of the CEI was almost completely blocked in those SHR with steroid replacement. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of the CEI in 2K-1C was similar in the rats with steroid replacement and in the rats with intact adrenals (no steroid replacement). These results suggest that the chronic antihypertensive effect of CEI in SHR is due partially to a decrease in aldosterone activity secondary to the blockade of angiotensin II formation, whereas in 2K-1C it is due to mechanisms other than lower mineralocorticoid activity.", 
    "158": "The current study investigates the possibility that the cerebellum may be involved in the regulation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) during endotoxin shock in the anesthetized dog. The effect of intravenously injected Escherichia coli endotoxin on MAP in the cerebellectomized dog was compared to that observed in the intact animal. Even though removal of the cerebellum did not significantly affect MAP in a control group, the cerebellectomized animal (unlike the intact animal) was unable to recover from the initial hypotension typically seen immediately following an intravenous endotoxin injection. Previous investigators have demonstrated that stimulation of fastigial nuclei in the cerebellum increases MAP via beta-adrenergic activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Captopril (SQ 14,225, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor) was used to determine whether this system could be responsible for the maintenance of MAP during endotoxin shock. When continuously infused into the intact dog given endotoxin, captopril suppressed MAP to a level similar to that of the cerebellectomized group. A similar response pattern to endotoxin was also observed in animals with a spinal transection at C2.", 
    "159": "A case of severe hypertension resistant to multiple drug therapy was controlled with minoxidil, captopril, and propranolol hydrochloride after treatment with these drugs alone or in other combinations had failed. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism with hyperkalemia and acidosis developed after captopril administration was started.", 
    "160": "Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients. The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR. Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR. Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR. Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR.", 
    "161": "Interpretation of results obtained with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in hypertensive patients has been obscured by the possibility of nonangiotensin-mediated mechanisms, particularly rats, we have compared the effects of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) by oral captopril administration to those of dextrose. In this setting of constant angiotensin II levels, any apparent effects of CEI must be mediated by a nonangiotensin-related mechanism. Angiotensin II infusion at 30 ng/min increased mean blood pressure by an average of 22 mm Hg. Following 7 days of CEI, effective blockade of converting enzyme was established both by a 10-fold elevation of vasodepressor sensitivity to exogenous bradykinin and a markedly decreased plasma converting enzyme activity. On the ninth day of angiotensin II infusion, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma renin activity were not different between CEI and dextrose-treated groups. Similarly, blockade of angiotensin II by saralasin induced a comparable fall in blood pressure in both groups. Metabolic studies also revealed no long-term differences in water and food intake, weight change, or sodium and potassium metabolisms. These findings suggest that, in the continued presence of angiotensin II, there is no detectable hemodynamic or metabolic effect of chronic converting enzyme inhibition, and therefore that bradykinin plays little or no role in its long-term antihypertensive action.", 
    "162": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was studied in preparations of microvessels isolated from rabbit cerebral cortex. Activity was determined by measuring the degradation of hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (Hip-His-Leu) by the intact microvessels in a physiological salt solution at pH 7.4. ACE activity was dependent on both substrate and chloride ion concentration and was inhibited by captopril in a manner similar to that observed previously with tissue homogenates. Angiotensin I was rapidly degraded by the intact microvessels, even in the presence of 10(-6)M captopril. An advantage of the methodology employed was the ability to pretreat the microvessels and then assess the effect of pretreatment by transfer to a postincubation assay system. Pretreatment with a hyperosmolar urea solution did not change ACE activity or cause release of ACE from the microvessels, although lactic dehydrogenase and lysosomal enzymes were released. Pretreatment with captopril caused a lag in the subsequent degradation of Hip-His-Leu, presumably reflecting dissociation of inhibitor from the cell-associated enzyme. ACE activity was unaffected by hypoxic or anoxic incubation conditions. The ability to measure ACE activity of the microvessels in vitro provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of the enzyme in intact cerebrovascular endothelial cells.", 
    "163": "To determine whether prostaglandins contribute to the depressor response to the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, we measured the plasma prostaglandin levels by radioimmunoassy before and after captopril administration, and then examined the effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibition on captopril's antihypertensive effect. When a single oral captopril dose (25-100 mg) was given to 31 sodium-restricted patients with essential hypertension, the levels of the stable transformation product of prostacyclin remained unmeasurable and that of thromboxane A2 did not change, while the metabolite of PGE2 (PGE-M) increased by 53% (34 +/- 4pg/ml pre-captopril, 52 +/- 5 pg/ml after; p less than 0.001). As expected, blood pressure (BP) and angiotension II (AII levels fell, and kinin levels rose (all changes p less than 0.001). We then blocked prostaglandin synthesis in 18 of these subjects for 24 hours with either indomethacin (n = 10) or aspirin (n = 8) before repeating the captopril dose, to assess the importance of these PGE-M increments. The PGE-M responses to captopril were effectively blocked in nine of 10 subjects receiving indomethacin and four of eight receiving aspirin. In these 13 patients, the depressor response to captopril was significantly blunted (-20 +/- 3mm Hg pre-synthetase inhibition vs - 13 +/- 2 mm Hg post; p less than 0.05). When these agents did not block the PGE-M response to captopril, the BP response was also unchanged (-15 +/- 4mm Hg pre, -18 +/- 5mm Hg post). Neither indomethacin nor aspirin changed the AII or kinin responses to captopril. We conclude that the prostaglandins may be important mediators of captopril's antihypertensive effect in the sodium-restricted state.", 
    "164": "The parent diacid (N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro of MK-421 inhibited hog plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by 50% (I50) at a concentration of 1.2 nM and was 17 times more potent than captopril. In vitro the I50 for MK-421, an ethyl ester, was 1200 nM because de-esterification did not occur. Similarly in the guinea-pig ileum, the diacid inhibitor and MK-421 potentiated the contractile effects of bradykinin at an AC50 of 77 pM and 18 nM, respectively. Inhibition of the pressor effects of angiotensin I by the diacid ACE inhibitor occurred at an ID50 of 8.2 micrograms/kg i.v. in rats and 6.4 micrograms/kg i.v. in dogs. Thus, the diacid was approximately 12 times more potent than captopril. The ID50 for MK-421 was 14 and 278 micrograms/kg i.v. in rats and dogs, respectively, because of differences in the rates of de-esterification. Oral ACE inhibitory activity was determined by blockade of the pressor effects of angiotensin I in conscious rats and dogs. In rats, but not in dogs, the diacid inhibitor was poorly absorbed, whereas MK-421 was well absorbed in both species. MK-421 inhibited the pressor effects of angiotensin I at 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg p.o. for at least 6 hr in rats and dogs, and compared to captopril was 8.6 times more potent in rats and 4.6 times more potent in dogs. These data demonstrate that MK-421 and its parent diacid are potent, long-lasting orally active inhibitors of ACE. In addition, the low activity of MK-421 in vitro contrasts with its substantial in vivo activity, and supports the hypothesis that MK-421 is a prodrug that first must be de-esterified to permit full expression of its significant in vivo pharmacological activity.", 
    "165": "Oral converting enzyme inhibitor SQ14225 was administered in 11 patients with essential hypertension, in order to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of blood pressure in essential hypertension. In the sodium-repleted state (150 mEq sodium intake for 6 days) in 11 patients, converting enzyme inhibitor decreased the average mean blood pressure from 113 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Plasma renin activity increased with sodium depletion (30 mEq sodium intake for 3 days after furosemide treatment) from 1.26 +/- 0.07 to 3.26 +/- 0.48 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.001). In the sodium-depleted state the hypotensive effect of SQ 14225 was more pronounced (mean blood pressure 108 +/- 2 to 93 +/- 3 mm Hg). The decrease in mean blood pressure caused by the inhibitor correlated to the basal plasma renin activity (r = -0.53, p less than 0.02, n = 22 measurements). The results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system participates in the regulation of blood pressure in essential hypertension, even in the sodium-repleted state. This role of the renin-angiotensin system in blood pressure regulation becomes more crucial during sodium depletion.", 
    "166": "Because of evidence that angiotensin II may be necessary for pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, we investigated the response to 3% oxygen breathing before and after the blockade of angiotensin I-converting enzyme with captopril. The left lungs of 6 cats were pump-perfused through the left pulmonary artery with blood withdrawn from the inferior vena cava. The animals were ventilated mechanically, and blood gases and pH were measured and maintained within normal limits. The pulmonary vascular resistance was calculated from measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, and blood flow. Changes in pulmonary vascular resistance caused by 3% oxygen breathing, prostaglandin F2 alpha, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II were measured before and after captopril (20 mg/kg, i.v.). The pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia was not altered by the blockade of angiotensin II production. The responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha, and angiotensin II were unchanged as well, indicating that the vasoactivity of the pulmonary vessels was not altered. The response to angiotensin I was eliminated completely. These results indicate that angiotensin II is not necessary for, and does not alter, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the cat.", 
    "167": "Cardiac hypertrophy consequent to renovascular hypertension was investigated in two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt rats. Ventricular weight in renal hypertensive rats correlated closely with level of arterial pressure (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001). DNA, RNA and hydroxyproline contents of the hypertrophied hearts were higher than sham control, but there was no significant change in myocardial concentration of any of them. Surgical treatment (removal of clipped kidney) as well as medical therapy (inhibition of converting enzyme with orally administered captopril, 150 mg/l drinking water) led to reduction of ventricular weight (2.70 +/- 0.01 and 2.78 +/- 0.06, respectively, vs. 3.4 +/- 0.05 mg/g in controls, P less than 0.01 for both). Reduction of cardiac weight was associated with increase in both myocardial concentration and content of hydroxyproline in surgically treated rats and in medically treated animals. Ventricular catecholamine concentration was increased after nephrectomy but was unchanged by captopril treatment.", 
    "168": "High-performance liquid chromatographic systems have been developed to separate and quantitate captopril. The presence of interfering excipients in various formulations necessitated the development of three assays, each with distinctly different columns and mobile phases. All work well for bulk material, providing short analysis time, high precision, and rapid sample preparation, demonstrating that there is not necessarily one, best, high-performance liquid chromatographic system. The advantages and shortcomings of the ion-exchange, amino and octadecylsilane systems are evaluated and one of them is selected as optimum for bulk and tablet analysis.", 
    "169": "The time courses for the inhibition of the pressor response to AI and for the blood concentration of captopril and its metabolites were determined following a single oral administration of captopril at a dose of 0.8 or 2.5 mg/kg to normal dogs. Captopril was rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract attaining a maximum blood concentration 1-1.5h after its administration. The inhibition of the pressor response to AI was closely related with the blood concentration of unchanged captopril but not of total captopril. The blood concentrations of captopril which produced 50 and 100% inhibition were estimated to be 0.1 and 0.4 millimicron/ml respectively. At 2.5 mh/kg the maximum blood concentration attained was 4 times higher than the concentration required to completely inhibit the pressor response to AI, suggesting that a fraction of the absorbed captopril was in excess of the therapeutic requirement.", 
    "170": "The Authors examined the behaviour of the humeral arterial pressure, of the heart frequency and of the muscular blood flow in inferior limbs. This study was performed before and after treatment with Captopril (SQ 14225), 100 mg per os, a selective inhibitor of the converting enzyme. Both resting blood flow (RBF) and maximal blood flow (NBF) were studied by Xenon 133 clearance. The A.A. observed that the drug induced a significant (P less than 0.01) increase of both RBF and MBF. Therefore, the Authors hypothesize that the Captopril is able to produce peripheral vasodilatation, without any significant variation of the cardiac index and frequency. Such an effect is considered to depend not only upon the inhibited angiotensin II production, but also upon stimulation of bradikinins and prostaglandins.", 
    "171": "The antihypertensive effects of the oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and of propranolol were evaluated in a single-blind trial of 12 weeks in 19 ambulatory men with moderated essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure [DPB], 100 to 120 mm Hg after receiving placebo for two weeks) whose sodium intake was unrestricted. The captopril group included 12 patients and the propranolol group seven. After the initial dose-finding period of four weeks, supine DBP was significantly reduced in eight patients receiving captopril and in four of the patients receiving propranolol. In these patients DBP decreased throughout the following eight weeks. In the remaining patients from each group, DBP was not reduced by either drug given alone at maximum allowable dosages during dose-finding periods, nor by combined administration in following weeks. No adverse side effects attributable to captopril were noted, except in one patient in whom proteinuria developed after seven weeks. Captopril has potential value in the treatment of moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "172": "Captopril, an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered in a dose of 50 mg to 88 untreated hypertensives (70 essential hypertensives, 8 patients with renal arterial disease, 10 patients with renal parenchymal disease). Captopril caused a decrease in heart rate in 18 patients but an increase in 2 patients. In the remaining 68, heart rate did not change. As a whole captopril caused a significant decrease in blood pressure without compensatory increase in heart rate. The change in heart rate caused by captopril in patients with renal arterial disease was significantly higher than that in essential hypertensives. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change in heart rate and plasma renin activity obtained immediately before captopril administration (n=79, r=0.425, p less than 0.001).", 
    "173": "In a 33-year-old patient with severe primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute administration of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14,225) induced a rise in cardiac output, and a fall in both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. Subsequent chronic oral administration of captopril induced only transient clinical improvement, and the patient died. Captopril may nevertheless be useful in the treatment of less advanced cases of this disease.", 
    "174": "To evaluate the relative influences of gentamicin and tobramycin on glomerular function, we studied three groups of normal hydropenic rats. Group 1 had 8 rats that served as control. Group 2 had 9 rats that were given gentamicin (40 mg/kg of body wt per day for 10 days). Group 3 had 10 rats that received tobramycin instead of gentamicin. In addition, we attempted to suppress angiotensin II (AII) generation in two additional groups of rats and then study the glomerular response to gentamicin: in 6 rats, isotonic sodium chloride was substituted for tap water for drinking throughout the period of study (group 4), and in 7 other gentamicin-treated rats, captopril was given orally (group 5). A sixth group received captopril alone (group 6). Following gentamicin treatment in group 2, values for single nephron GFR (SNGFR) were markedly lower (21.7 +/- 2.1 nl/min) than they were in groups 1(35.7 +/- 1.4) or 3(34.1 +/- 2.9). Declines in whole kidney GFR in group 2 paralleled the fall in SNGFR. Reduction in SNGFR with gentamicin was due both to a marked decline in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, and in the initial glomerular plasma flow rate, QA. With saline administration (group 4), the decline in SNGFR was partially blunted, whereas with captopril (group 5) the effects of gentamicin on SNGFR, QA, and Kf were largely abolished. Morphologic studies revealed no discernible glomerular defects in any groups, whereas proximal tubule damage was evident with both aminoglycosides, irrespective of the state of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, in the dosage used, gentamicin elicits greater impairment in glomerular function than does tobramycin, and by mechanism(s) that are at least partially responsive to suppression of AII generation.", 
    "175": "Blood and milk concentrations of captopril, a new antihypertensive agent, were studied in 12 lactating normotensive subjects after the administration of 100 mg captopril tablets on a three times daily regimen for a total of seven doses. Peak blood concentrations (+/- S.E.M.) of captopril after the administration of the seventh 100-mg tablet averaged 713.1 +/- 140.6 ng/ml, as compared to average peak milk concentrations of 4.7 +/- 0.7 ng/ml. Time to peak blood concentrations averaged 1.1 +/- 0.2 hour, while time to peak milk concentrations averaged 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours. The data suggest that the human breast selectively restricts the passage of captopril from blood into milk.", 
    "176": "One hundred milligrams of oral captopril (SQ 14225) caused a significant increase in PRA and a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone (PA) in five normal men and five hypertensive patients. Blood pressure (BP) showed no change in the normal men, but it fell significantly in the patients. An iv infusion of 200 ng/kg.min des-Asp1-,Ileu8-angiotensin II (AIIIA) for 2 h caused a significant decrease in PRA and a slight but significant increase in PA, but caused no change in BP in the normal men. When 100 mg captopril were given orally immediately before the start of the AIIIA infusion, BP showed no change in the normal men, but fell in the patients. However, PRA showed a significant decrease and PA showed a slight but significant increase in both the normal men and the patients, except for one patient with renovascular hypertension who showed a decrease in PA. Thus, this suppression of captopril-induced PRA increase by AIIIA, a derivative of angiotensin II, is not related to BP change, and it suggests that the principal cause of the PRA increase after captopril is a disappearance of endogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "177": "Hemodynamic responses and behaviors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to a single administration of captopril (50 mg) were studied in 16 hypertensive patients (essential hypertension, n = 10; renovascular hypertension, n = 3; primary aldosteronism, n = 2; Cushing's syndrome, n = 1). In 10 essential hypertensive patients, the immediate blood pressure reduction caused by decreased total peripheral resistance after the administration of captopril was observed without changes of cardiac output and heart rate. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and plasma aldosterone concentration significantly decreased, whereas plasma renin activity significantly elevated 2 hours after the administration of captopril. The close relationship between the pretreatment value of plasma renin activity and the maximum decrease in mean blood pressure in 16 hypertensive patients suggests that the depressor response to a single administration of captopril could evaluate the degree of angiotensin II dependency in the maintenance of high blood pressure in various types of hypertension.", 
    "178": "Conscious dogs made hypertensive by wrapping both kidneys with cellophane were treated daily with a single dose of captopril (31 mg/kg p.o.), an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme, or with placebo (lactose, 31 mg/kg p.o.) for a period of 13 weeks. Blood pressures were recorded indirectly from a forepaw by using a Roche ultrasonic pressure transducer (Arteriosonde). Treatment with captopril resulted in decreases in blood pressure (25-30 mm Hg) that were maximal at 3 to 6 hr with no associated changes in heart rate. The captopril-induced hypotensive effect was maintained throughout the 13-week treatment period, and after the termination of captopril dosing, pressure rose slowly over the next 72 hr to a level not significantly different from placebo-treated dogs. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in the hypertensive dogs at the time treatment was initiated was not different from the same animals when they were normotensive. In captopril-treated animals, PRA increased 3- to 4-fold after each dose of the drug was given, reaching a maximum at 3 to 6 hr, a time corresponding to the maximal blood pressure decrease. PRA gradually declined but did not reach control levels before the next dose of captopril was administered. In animals treated with placebo, PRA remained at levels not significantly different from normotensive dogs during the entire treatment period. After termination of captopril administration, PRA slowly returned to pretreatment levels; the return of PRA paralleled the recovery of blood pressure. The results indicate that captopril is effective in reducing blood pressure for an extended period of time in a hypertensive model in which the level of activity of the renin angiotensin system is not elevated.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin II is a biological active octapeptide that is formed by the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the inactive precursor, angiotensin I. ACE activity was found in tears and aqueous humor from both rabbit and human eyes. The activity was higher in tears than aqueous humor. Enzyme activity was determined fluorimetrically from the rate of breakdown of the substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine. The enzyme activity was further characterized by determining the effects of inhibitors. There was a significant difference in ACE levels in human tears when eye color was considered. People with either green or brown eyes had a higher ACE level than did blue-eyed individuals. The presence of this enzyme activity in ocular fluids suggests that angiotensin II may play a role in normal ocular physiology.", 
    "180": "The purpose of these experiments ws to determine the dose of captopril which resulted in essentially complete blockade of tissue and plasma converting enzyme activity (CEA) and to correlate the effect of this dose of inhibitor on blood pressure and CEA in a number of normotensive and hypertensive rat models. Oral administration of captopril (0.3-10 mg/kg) induced a dose-related attenuation of CEA in plasma freshly drawn from normotensive conscious rats. After storage at -20 or 4 C before assay, both captopril-treated and untreated plasmas displayed markedly greater CEA. The converting enzyme inhibitor induced a parallel shift to the right of angiotensin I-induced blood pressure responses, reaching a 100-fold displacement of dose-dependent responses in the presence of 10 mg/kg captopril. Sixty minutes after oral administration of 10 mg/kg captopril, plasma CEA was blocked completely in all normo- and hypertensive models studied. This dose of the inhibitor reduced blood pressure in the sodium-deplete normotensive rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, and the initial phase two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt rat but not in the sodium-replete normotensive rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, the mineralocorticoid hypertensive rat, or the chronic phase of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt rat. It is concluded that acute administration of captopril at a dose which results in complete blockade of plasma converting enzyme and severe attenuation of tissue converting enzyme reduces blood pressure in animals with high PRA but not in animals in which the PRA is low. (Endocrinology 108: 536, 1981)", 
    "181": "The observation that angiotensin III is present in the circulation of the rat in amounts similar to those of angiotensin II has led to the notion that it may, in part, be formed by the action of converting enzyme on des-Asp-angiotensin I without the prior formation of angiotensin II. This possibility was studied in conscious rats using a combination of RIA and chromatographic techniques which allowed the separate measurement of angiotensin I, des-Asp-angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III in rat blood. Infusion of des-Asp1-[Ile5]angiotensin I at 50, 150, and 450 ng/kg . min resulted in a progressive increase in the plasma concentration of angiotensin III up to 279 +/- 50 (SD) pg/ml compared to 9 +/- 9 (SD) pg/ml after dextrose infusion. Regardless of the infusion of des Asp-[Ile5]angiotensin I, plasma angiotensin III made up a constant 46 +/- 8% (+/- SD) of the total immunoactive material, the remainder being composed of smaller metabolic fragments, indicating a rapid rate of clearance of angiotensin III. Captopril completely inhibited the rise in angiotensin III after des-Asp1-[Ile5]angiotensin I infusion. A substance which chromatographed as des-Asp-[Ile5]angiotensin I was detected in rat blood and made up 19% of the angiotensin I immunoactive material, while angiotensin III made up 44% of the angiotensin II immunoactive material. These results confirm that des-Asp1-[Ile5]angiotensin I is a substrate for converting enzyme in the rat, and the presence of a chromatographically similar substance in the circulation suggests that at least part of the angiotensin III in rat blood may be formed by the action of converting enzyme on endogenous des-Asp-angiotensin I. (Endocrinology 108: 406, 1981)", 
    "182": "We have previously reported that cultured cells from swine aorta possess angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) and release it into serum-free culture medium. The present work compares enzyme from these two sources, and from swine kidney and serum, with respect to antibody and lectin binding. Purified enzyme from swine kidney, and the activity in swine serum, cultured endothelial cells and culture medium bind similarly to rabbit antibodies prepared against the kidney converting enzyme. Enzyme from each of these sources was allowed to bind to an immobilized lectin (Ricinus communis), which binds to terminal galactose residues of glycoproteins. Increasing concentrations of galactose were used to remove enzyme from the lectin column and the distribution of enzyme activity in the galactose eluates was determined. The elution pattern was similar for kidney and endothelial cell enzyme, and different from the pattern found for both serum and medium enzymes. Neuraminidase treatment of either serum or medium enzyme altered the distribution of activity eluted to that found for endothelial cell or kidney enzymes. The effects of neuraminidase suggest that the difference in lectin binding between cell and medium enzyme reflects differences in the number of terminal sialic acid residues that cover galactose residues.", 
    "183": "In low- and normal- renin hypertensive patients, but not in high-renin patients, the acute antihypertensive response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was completely blocked by aprotinin-induced kallikrein inhibition. Blood pressure reduction with long-term ACE inhibition could be overcome only in part by aprotinin. It is proposed that in low- and normal-renin hypertension the vasodepressor effect of acute ACE inhibition is mainly due to kinin accumulation. Conversely, in high-renin patients a fall in angiotensin II concentration accounts for the hypotensive response to captopril. From the pressor effect of aprotinin in chronically captopril treated patients it appears that kinins are also involved in the blood pressure reduction with long-term ACE inhibition. The finding that ACE inhibition and kallikrein blockade produced predictable and opposite effects on blood pressure suggests broad participation of changes in depressor kinin production in the control of vascular tone in essential hypertension.", 
    "184": "In five patients with resistant heart failure treated with the oral converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, standardised and intensive haemodynamic, hormone, and electrolyte monitoring showed significantly raised cardiac output and reduced arterial, pulmonary-wedge, and pulmonary-artery pressures which correlated closely with concomitant alterations in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. These changes occurred in the absence of a natriuresis or diuresis. Clinical improvement was dramatic and paralleled the objective haemodynamic changes. Hyponatraemia and a rise in plasma-potassium were noted. Captopril is a major advance in the treatment of resistant heart failure, and its beneficial haemodynamic effects relate primarily to a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, the activity of which is increased by conventional drug therapy.", 
    "185": "Captopril was administered in the drinking fluid to normotensive rats and rats of the New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) strain. It lowered BP in both strains of rat, particularly in rats deprived of sodium; in these rats BP rose again when the drug was stopped even though there was no access to sodium. Thus captopril appeared to lower blood pressure not by reduction in total exchangeable sodium but by some other mechanism, presumably inhibition of vasoconstriction. Total exchangeable sodium did not change significantly in rats treated with captopril and having access to salt in the drinking fluid, though it fell in rats deprived of sodium. Captopril caused an increase in fluid intake, particularly intake of 0.5% NaCl solution and this may have compensated for any loss of body sodium. It was not clear whether the thirst for water and the desire for salt were due to effects of captopril in the CNS or were secondary to increased excretion of salt and water.", 
    "186": "Systemic, humoral and renal responses to isotonic volume expansion (VE, 1800ml in 3 hours) were assessed in normal subjects before and during captopril administration (CEI). Captopril, which otherwise induced a decrease in pre-saline mean arterial pressure (MAP) unmasked the volume-dependence of MAP since during captopril administration MAP increased linearly during volume expansion (+18.7 +/- 3.8% at the end of VE). In addition, captopril prevented the fall in plasma aldosterone produced by VE but did not modify the natriuretic response to saline. These results demonstrate that circulating angiotensin II is not an important determinant of the natriuretic response to volume expansion in normal man. However, a role for intrarenal renin cannot be excluded.", 
    "187": "Vasodilators like nitrates, hydralazine, captopril and prazosin all improve left ventricular function of patients with chronic ischemic heart failure. The influence of these vasodilator agents on coronary hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen consumption, however may not be similar. With nitrates and captopril, improved left ventricular function is associated and with decreased myocardial oxygen consumption; in contrast, with prazosin or hydralazine no consistent or significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption is observed. Thus, the metabolic cost for the improved left ventricular function with these vasodilator agents is not similar.", 
    "188": "The acute hypotensive effect of captopril 25 mg was investigated in 26 hypertensive patients (11 with essential and 15 with renal arterial disease). Intra-arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously and arterial blood was sampled for renin, angiotensin I and II, aldosterone, kininase II, catecholamines and prostaglandins. Captopril led to an increase in plasma renin activity, active and total plasma renin concentration and angiotensin I, a decrease in plasma kininase II activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and no change in plasma (nor) adrenaline, dopamine and inactive renin concentration. The hypotensive effect of captopril was related to the changes in plasma angiotensin II level and inversely to the changes in prostaglandin E2; the correlation coefficients were low, respectively 0.61 and -0.44. It is likely that the acute hypotensive effect of captopril to some extent is related to changes in plasma angiotensin II and in prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. There is no evidence for a role of the adrenergic systems in the hypotensive response.", 
    "189": "Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and during treadmill and isometric handgrip exercise were determined in 16 patients with essential hypertension (mean age 47.4 years) before and after therapy. The untreated hypertensive patient showed a linear correlation between mean blood pressure and LVEF (r = 0.62, p less than 0.01). The relation of sitting, resting LVEF with systolic blood pressure was highly significant (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Prior to therapy no significant change in LVEF in response to exercise was noted. After therapy with captopril, a normal isotonic exercise response occurred consisting of a highly significant increase in ejection fraction (p less than 0.0025). Subjects receiving propranolol had a fall in LVEF with isometric stress (p less than 0.0025). These data suggest an increased ejection fraction in patients with essential hypertension when all other parameters of the heart are normal and an abnormal response to isotonic exercise which may be reversed with therapy.", 
    "190": "The effects of captopril 450 mg/day for 4 weeks on blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and extracellular fluid volume were compared in severe, often drug-resistant hypertension (n = 23), mild to moderate hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis (n = 10) and mild to moderate essential hypertension (n = 20). Plasma renin in the three groups was 52 +/- 19, 58 +/- 17 and 20 +/- 4 microU/ml (mean +/- SEM), respectively. Blood pressure fell by 18 +/- 4%, 21 +/- 2% and 18 +/- 1%. The pressure drop was mainly due to a fall in peripheral vascular resistance. Addition of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (25-100 mg/day) caused a further fall in resistance. Despite the vasodilator effect of captopril, reflex cardiostimulation and reactive fluid retention were not observed. In severe hypertension, captopril alone was more effective in lowering blood pressure than combined diuretic-betablocker-vasodilator therapy. Moreover, cardiac output in these patients was higher and resistance was lower after captopril than during combined treatment. Thus, captopril was capable of normalising the abnormal haemodynamic state in patients with essential hypertension, and in hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis. Despite marked differences in pre-treatment plasma renin, the effects of captopril on systemic haemodynamics were similar in all the patients.", 
    "191": "In a single-dose crossover study Captopril (SQ 14225), 1 mg/kg body weight, and Nifedipine (Bay a 1040) 20 mg were administered orally to 12 hospitalized patients with essential hypertension (Stage 1 or 2, W.H.O.). Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, but each dose acted differently: the mean maximum arterial pressure reduction was faster and greater with Nifedipine than with Captopril: -23 +/- 2% at 37 +/- 15 min and -17 +/- 1% at 86 +/- 25 min, respectively. Captopril inhibited angiotensin II and aldosterone production, but did not accelerate heart rate or stimulate vasopressin release. Nifedipine stimulated vasopressin release and increased heart rate, but the renin angiotensin aldosterone system was not significantly affected. The blood pressure reduction was related to the initial level of activation of the renin angiotensin system only for Captopril. The blood pressure reduction induced by one drug was not related to that produced by the other in the same patient.", 
    "192": "To evaluate the role of prostaglandin systems in mediating the response of blood pressure (BP) to the converting enzyme inhibitor, single dose of captopril, 100 mg, was administered orally in thirteen patients with essential hypertension, during three experimental periods: on a normal-sodium diet (150 mEq per day), on a low-sodium diet (30 mEq per day), and on a low-sodium diet following with indomethacin 150 mg daily for three days. During the normal-sodium and low-sodium periods, BP was significantly decreased after the administration of captopril, accompanied by a significant increase in urinary PGE2 excretion. With the indomethacin treatment, captopril-induced fall in BP was markedly inhibited, not associated with the apparent increase in urinary PGE2 excretion. The evidence presented suggests that antihypertensive effect of captopril may be due to overproduction of prostaglandin, in addition to a reduction in circulating angiotensin II. Moreover, the indomethacin-inhibiting effect of the fall in BP caused by captopril was more markedly exhibited in the renin-nonresponder subjects than the renin-responder subjects. These results suggest that the prostaglandin systems may play an important role in vasodepressor action of captopril in patients with essential hypertension, especially in a low-renin group.", 
    "193": "Sudden symptomatic increases in blood pressure may result from withdrawal of antihypertensive drug therapy. Captopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was abruptly withdrawn from the antihypertensive regimen of 6 patients (5 males; aged 31 to 58) with moderate to severe hypertension. The patients had received captopril (50-450 mg/day), diuretics, and in 2 cases, propranolol for 3-13 months; all drugs other than captopril were continued during the study. Blood pressure increased gradually in all patients from a mean (+/- SEM) of 135/92 +/- 5/2 mm Hg to 164/111 +/- 8/3 mm Hg in the 14 to 156 hours following captopril withdrawal, without the occurrence of symptoms. No \"rebound\" increase in blood pressure was noted. Plasma renin activity decreased, plasma aldosterone and serum angiotensin II concentrations increased and plasma catecholamine concentrations did not change during this time. These changes are consistent with the cessation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Reinstitution of captopril reduced blood pressure to the previous nadir suggesting a lack of tolerance to its effects after chronic therapy.", 
    "194": "Captopril [1-(D-3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl)-L-proline (S,S)] is now known to be an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. In male mice, the juxtaglomerular cells were examined by electron microscopy 42 h after administration of captopril. Numerous dense granules appeared in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells.", 
    "195": "Since it has been suggested that the renin-angiotensin axis may play an important role in the severe hypertension and in the acute renal deterioration in scleroderma, we sought to determine the effectiveness of angiotensin blockade in the treatment of this disorder. Captopril controlled blood pressure successfully and easily in 4 consecutive patients with scleroderma renal crisis. Mean serum creatinine was 3.5 mg/dl after scleroderma renal crisis immediately prior to captopril. The first patient required maintenance hemodialysis because of progression to advanced renal failure before captopril was available. However, in this patient oliguric renal failure was changed to nonoliguric renal failure immediately after beginning therapy. Serum creatine stabilized in the other 3 patients. Serum creatinine peaked at 4.7 mg/dl, but then progressively improved to 3.5 mg/dl 12 weeks after captopril was begun. None of the other 3 patients required any form of dialysis during the scleroderma renal crises. Mean survival of these 4 patients was significantly greater than that of the 9 previous patients with scleroderma crisis. These observations confirm that angiotensin blockade with captopril is effective therapy to prevent renal deterioration, to control blood pressure and prolong survival in scleroderma patients with renal crisis.", 
    "196": "The mechanism of the hypotensive response to captopril was investigated in pithed and urethane anesthetized rats. Cumulative intravenous doses of captopril produced dose-dependent hypotensive responses which were correlated with blockade of the pressor response to angiotensin I. Angiotensin II responses were unaffected. Infusions of saralasin, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, inhibited the hypotensive action of captopril, the degree of antagonism being correlated with inhibition of angiotensin II pressor responses. Bilateral nephrectomy lowered blood pressure to approximately the same level as captopril and completely abolished the hypotensive effect of captopril. No evidence was obtained for the involvement of endogenous bradykinin or prostaglandins in the hypotensive action of captopril. It is concluded that in pithed and urethane anesthetized rats, captopril mediates its hypotensive response by removing the renal renin-angiotensin system, most probably via inhibition of angiotensin I - converting enzyme. The results contrast with similar studies conducted in anesthetized dogs. In this species, the mechanism of action of captopril remains for further resolution.", 
    "197": "Captopril was administered to 12 essential hypertensive patients with low or normal plasma renin activity in order to evaluate its effectiveness in decreasing blood pressure and to determine whether the inhibition of converting enzyme could interfere with sympathetic neural activity. Captopril, at the doses of 150-450 mg/die, normalized blood pressure in 5 patients (responders) and had no effect on 7 patients (non responders). A significant decrease in heart rate was observed in all patients. Captopril failed to significantly increase plasma renin activity in all patients. Supine plasma levels of catecholamines were significantly higher in responders compared with non responders and decreased significantly after treatment with captopril. The physiological study we performed on all patients suggests an overall integrity of the baroreceptor reflex arc and vascular reactivity to stress before as well as after treatment with captopril. On the contrary, the bradycardia induced by diving test was significantly greater after treatment than before therapy. These findings suggest that the antihypertensive effect of converting enzyme inhibition may be partly due to interference with sympathetic neural activity. Moreover captopril seems to exert an important effect on parasympathetic activity irrespective of blood pressure changes.", 
    "198": "The effects of captopril (SQ 14.225), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, were investigated in a dose titration study of primary hypertension. In 32 patients 4 weeks titration with captopril gave a mean blood pressure (BP) reduction of 26/16 mmHg supine and 30/16 mmHg standing. No serious side effects were observed. The BP lowering effect was related to pretreatment plasma renin activity and was less in low renin hypertension (p less than 0.05). Captopril reduced angiotensin II (p less than 0.05), plasma (p less than 0.005) and urinary aldosterone (p less than 0.001) as well as urinary kallikrein excretion (p less than 0.005). Captopril (SQ 14.225) is a competitive inhibitor of peptidyl dipeptide hydrolase, also known as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or kininase II, which converts angiotensin I (A I) into angiotensin II (A II), hydrolyzes des-Asp-angiotensin I to angiotensin III (A III) and inactivates bradykinin (BK) (19). Captopril has potent antihypertensive effects when used in human hypertension (review, 3) especially when the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. To further investigate the mode of action and the hypotensive effect of captopril, we measured plasma renin activity (PRA), A II, plasma (PA) and urinary aldosterone excretion (UA) and urinary kallikrein excretion (UK) in 32 patients with established primary (essential) hypertension.", 
    "199": "Captopril (SQ 14 225), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was evaluated in the treatment of primary (essential) hypertension in a placebo-controlled long-term study. In 24 patients allocated to captopril treatment, mean supine BP fell from 174 +/- 18/110 +/- 7 to 151 +/- 22/96 +/- 12 mmHg. Ten patients achieved a supine diastolic BP of less than or equally 90 mmHg with a mean BP fall of 28/22 mmHg after 4 weeks' captopril dose titration (75-450 mg daily). In 14 patients, BP fell 19/9 mmHg. When hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) was subsequently added, a total supine BP reduction of 51/20 mmHg was noted. In the placebo control group (n = 16), BP changed +1/-2 mmHg from 171/110 mmHg while addition of hydrochlorothiazide caused a mean supine BP fall of 19/10 mmHg. During long-term follow-up (mean 11.8 months), no resistance to therapy developed. A weak correlation, (p less than 0.05) was seen between pretreatment plasma renin activity and initial captopril-induced BP reduction. However, in patients with clearly defined low renin hypertension, the hypotensive effect of captopril was much less than in patients with higher renin values. Captopril induced a significant decrease in urinary aldosterone excretion, which was partially reversed by addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Observed side-effects were proteinuria (1 case), rash (2 cases) and taste disturbances (3 cases). During long-term follow-up, seven patients have dropped out, four due to side-effects and three because of non-compliance.", 
    "200": "Spironolactone alone in full dosage failed to correct hypertension in a patient with Conn's syndrome and renal impairment, although the previously increased total exchangeable sodium fell to normal and the previously suppressed plasma angiotensin II did not rise above the normal range. Addition of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reduced plasma angiotensin II to very low levels, with a slight further fall in exchangeable sodium. Blood pressure was well controlled. Because hypertension in Conn's syndrome resistant to spironolactone usually also responds poorly to removal of the adenoma, and is difficult to treat with conventional hypotensive agents, the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor with a potassium conserving diuretic is worthy of trial in such cases.", 
    "201": "The case is reported of a young woman with severe hypertension, unilateral renal artery stenosis, variously normal or marginally high plasma concentrations of active renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, sodium, and potassium; and normal total exchangeable and total body sodium and potassium. Arteriograms and ureter catheterization showed the stenosis to be severe, but the unstimulated renal vein renin and angiotensin II differential to be modest. Captopril caused an initial fall in angiotensin II and arterial pressure. During prolonged captopril treatment, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone remained depressed; exchangeable and total body sodium and potassium were unaltered. Blood pressure fell further to normal levels during prolonged captopril treatment, while subsequent surgical correction of the renal artery stenosis was curative; absolute values of blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II were similar in both situations. The findings support, without proving, the concept that chronic modest elevation of angiotensin II may be responsible for sustained hypertension in unilateral renal artery stenosis. Patients of this type contrast sharply with those, also with severe renal artery stenosis or occlusion, who have gross elevation of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, with sodium and potassium deficiency. Captopril or surgery are effective in both syndromes, but the manner of response to treatment differs markedly.", 
    "202": "1. The effects of Captopril (SQ14,225), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, given intravenously in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg ws studied in intact anaesthetized dogs. 2. The drug caused a decrease in systemic and pulmonary arterial mean pressures, an increase in cardiac output, and hence a decrease in calculated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. A sustained tachycardia also occurred. 3. A minor, transient increase in coronary sinus flow was recorded, with a sustained decrease in calculated coronary vascular resistance. 4. No change was found in cardiac oxygen metabolism nor in calculated cardiac efficiency. 5. The plasma renin values increased in the control animals and those given the drug.", 
    "203": "Drinking during the simultaneous intravenous infusion of angiotensin I (AI) or II (AII) and hypertonic NaCl or mannitol was studied in the goat, and was compared to the dipsogenic responses to the separate infusion of each of these four factors. Approximately the same amount of water was drunk during the infusion of AI/NaCl, AI/mannitol and AII/NaCl. The amount was roughly equal to the sum of the amounts taken when each of two paired stimuli was infused separately. Significantly less water was drunk in response to AII/mannitol. Somewhat more water was drunk during the separate AI than during the separate AII infusion. Administration of an AI converting enzyme inhibitor completely abolished the AI contribution to drinking during the AI/NaCl infusion but did not reduce AII/NaCl drinking, indicating that the response to AI was entirely due to its conversion into AII. The possibility is discussed that the considerable difference between AI/mannitol and AII/mannitol drinking might have been the result of choroidal and/or ependymal AI converting enzyme activity.", 
    "204": "The blood pressure response to different doses of methylprednisolone was examined in the rat. It is concluded that doses varying from 2.5 mg/kg/week to 20 mg/kg/week of this agent caused clear-cut elevations in arterial pressure. The methylprednisolone-induced arterial hypertension was accompanied by elevation in Plasma Renin Activity and administration of captopril or saralasin caused significant drops in systemic arterial pressure. Concomitant long term administration of captopril and methylprednisolone caused a delay in appearance and smaller elevations in arterial pressure. It is concluded the methylprednisolone in the rat causes arterial hypertension which is at least partially dependent upon renin angiotensin system activation. However elevated blood pressure levels were noticeable even during chronic captopril administration leading to the conclusion that other mechanism (s) may participate in the pathogenesis of this experimental model of hypertension in rats.", 
    "205": "Observations with both captopril and teprotide suggest interplay of the renin angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems during sodium depletion. We therefore examined adrenergic responses in normal or sodium restricted (8 days low sodium chow; trichlormethiazide 3 mg/kg, p.o., days 5-7) normotensive rats orally pretreated with placebo and captopril (3 or 10 mg/kg; twice on day 7, once on day 8) and pithed 2 hrs after the last dose. Consistent hypotension in conscious intact animals was observed only in sodium-depleted groups receiving captopril. Pressor responses to low frequency (2.5 Hz--5 sec) sympathetic stimulation and phenylephrine were reduced in normal sodium, pithed normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats receiving 10, but not 3 mg/kg captopril and low sodium animals receiving both doses. Suppression of phenylephrine by captopril was accentuated in sodium-depleted groups. Pressor responses to angiotensin II were less in all salt-depleted animals receiving either placebo or captopril. Captopril failed to reduce tachycardia to either sympathetic nerve stimulation or isoproterenol. These effects of captopril suggest that angiotensin plays a role in maintenance of vascular, but not cardiac adrenergic function. This role is manifested at a post-junctional site and becomes critical in the sodium deficient state.", 
    "206": "Angiotensin converting enzyme plays a key role in the hormonal regulation of blood pressure. It is responsible for the production of the vasoconstrictor hormonal peptide angiotensin II as well as the destruction of the vasodilator peptide bradykinin. Recently, orally active specific inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme have become available. Captopril (SQ14225) blocks angiotensin I and potentiates bradykinin effects in vitro and in vivo. In man it leads to a fall in endogenous plasma angiotensin II, a rise in blood angiotensin I and renin, but no change in blood bradykinin can be detected. In sodium deplete normal subjects it lowers the blood pressure, but in sodium replete subjects it is without effect. Similarly, it will acutely lower blood pressure in renovascular and accelerated hypertension but not in essential hypertension. The acute hypotensive effect of captopril may therefore be due to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. However, in the long term, it is effective in lowering the blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, especially when combined with a diuretic. This suggests that the long-term hypotensive effect differs from the short term effect, and involves mechanisms other than inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. This may include local effects on blood vessels and the kidney and the kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "207": "The interaction of the prostaglandin and renin-angiotensin systems on blood pressure and renal function was studied in conscious rabbits following mild (6 ml/kg) or moderate (15 ml/kg) hemorrhage. One hour following the injection of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin (Indo) plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly lower than the values in control animals. Two hours following hemorrhage, the increase in PRA was very similar in the Indo and control animals. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was not affected by Indo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly lower in the Indo group following moderate hemorrhage. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), captopril, resulted in similar hypotensive responses in the Indo and non-Indo groups. The marked PRA increase induced by this agent also was not influenced by Indo. The CEI increased RPF and decreased renal vascular resistance (RVR) in the mild hemorrhage animals. However, in the moderate hemorrhage group the RPF changes were variable and RVR tended to increase, especially in the Indo group. GFR fell significantly following captopril in both Indo and non-Indo animals after moderate hemorrhage. The results indicate that prostaglandin inhibition lowers basal PRA levels but that the renin response to hemorrhage and captopril are not prevented. Indo also did not alter the hypotensive response to CEI, suggesting that prostaglandins do not play a major role in this effect. The magnitude of the hemorrhagic stress influences the renal responses to inhibition of the prostaglandin or renin-angiotensin systems in the conscious rabbit.", 
    "208": "1. A thiol proteinase from human pituitaries was purified approximately 400 fold and shown to have different chromatographic properties from that of calf brain. Among substrates cleaved were myelin basic protein, histones, beta-lipotropin, neurophysin, and Substance P. 2. The enzyme showed properties associated with a cathepsin-B like enzyme: dependence on -SH groups, pH optimum of 6.5, inhibition by leupeptin and a synthetic analog, Boc-D-Phe-Pro-arginal, and cleavage of dipeptidyl arylamides with basic residues adjacent to or penultimate to the chromatographic grouping. 3. Membranes present in the P2 fraction of rat brain contained three or more enkephalinases when submitted to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Further purification on an IgG-Sepharose affinity column prepared with antibody to lung angiotensin converting enzyme indicated the presence of dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase(s) with properties distinct from those of ACE. In addition, the DEAE-cellulose fractions contained various aminopeptidase activities when tested with Leu-Gly-Gly, Leu-Nap, and Ala-Ala-Nap as substrates.", 
    "209": "A number of gamma- and delta-lactam derivatives were synthesized and their in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities were compared. The structures of these compounds were designed to include many of the important features of captopril. The synthesis involved the preparation of a variety of novel 3-methylene-2-pyrrolidinones (3-5 and 16) and 3-methylene-2-piperidinones (3a-5a, 10-12, and 17). The key intermediate 3-methylenelactams 3 and 3a were obtained from 3-(hydroxymethyl)lactams 2 and 2a by a direct dehydration with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide using cuprous iodide as a catalyst. Introduction of the sulfhydryl group was accomplished by a Michael addition of these alpha, beta-unsaturated lactams. The compound with the highest in vitro activity was 3-(mercaptomethyl)-2-oxo-1-piperidineacetic acid (7a). The activity of the 7a both in vitro and in vivo (dog) was shown to be less than that of captopril by a factor of about 100.", 
    "210": "The role of kinins in the acute antihypertensive effect of a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) was studied in sodium-depleted normotensive and in two-kidney, one clip chronically hypertensive rats (2K-1C). The 2K-1C were on a normal sodium diet. The acute vasodepressor effect of the CEI was determined in these two groups either after administration of normal rabbit globulins or antikinin globulins. The amount of kinin antibodies administered completely blocked the hypotensive effects of bradykinin, 400 ng/kg, and urinary kallikrein, 4 microgram/kg. After administration of CEI in the sodium-depleted rats there was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in the acute changes in mean blood pressure (BP) between the group pretreated with normal rabbit globulins (delta BP -32.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg) and the group pretreated with antikinin globulins (delta BP -25 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). In the 2K-1C pretreated with normal rabbit globulins, the CEI produced a decrease in BP of -21 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. This decrease was almost completely blocked in the group pretreated with the antikinin globulins (delta BP -4 +/- 4.1 mm Hg). These differences in the changes in BP were significant (p less than 0.02). These results suggest that the acute antihypertensive effect of the CEI in the sodium-depleted rats is probably due to inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to II while in the 2K-1C it is due, in part, to an increase in kinin concentrations secondary to the inhibition of kininase II.", 
    "211": "The effect of intravenous injection of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14 225 on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin concentration (PRC) was investigated in 15 intact conscious ewes as follows: sodium replete during angiotensin I infusion (n = 4); sodium replete (n = 6); sodium deplete (n = 5); chronic water deprivation (n = 5); AcTH treated sodium replete (n = 6). Following SQ 14 225 mean arterial pressure fell 5 +/- 1 mmHg in sodium replete, 20 +/- 4 mmHg in acutely sodium deplete, 7 +/- 2 mmHg in chronic water deprivation and 6 +/- 2 mmHg in ACTH treated sodium replete sheep. This suggests that the renin-angiotensin system plays no significant role in maintaining the elevated blood pressure of sheep with ACTH induced hypertension. Heart rate rose in all groups except the water deprived animals following SQ 14 225. PRC rose from 5.1 +/- 2.1 pmo1AI/ml plasma/h. to 12.4 +/- 2.0 in sodium replete sheep, from 11.9 +/- 1.0 to 68 +/- 13 in acutely sodium deficient animals, and from 13.3 +/- 4.3 to 32.9 +/- 0.6 in chronically water deprived animals, but showed little change in ACTH treated sheep, falling from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 pmo1AI/ml plasma/h.", 
    "212": "1. One component of baroreflex responsiveness was quantitated in conscious rats using the heart rate response to a pressor injection of phenylephrine. 2. Endogenous angiotensin and its effectiveness were manipulated by sodium deprivation, converting enzyme inhibition and infusion of an angiotensin analogue. None of these manoeuvres changed the observed reflex responsiveness. 3. We conclude that endogenous angiotensin has no influence on the component of baroreceptor function that is described by the slope of the arterial pressure-heart rate relationship.", 
    "213": "To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral angiotensin-converting inhibition (ACE) with captopril in chronic normotensive congestive heart failure (CHF), acute and cardiocirculatory actions were determined by cardiac catheterization and forearm plethysmography, and ambulatory effects were assessed by echocardiography, nuclear angiography, treadmill exercise, and clinical symptomatology in 10 severe CHF patients. Captopril (90 mg) produced marked (peak 1 hour) and sustained (5 hours) left ventricular filling pressure (23 to 15 mm Hg), systemic vascular resistance decreases, and cardiac index increase (1.99 to 2.41 L/min/m2), while mean blood pressure declined mildly (87 to 80 mm Hg) without heart rate change. Both forearm venous tone and vascular resistance decreased considerably. After 1 week of ambulatory therapy (90 mg three times daily), nuclear angiographic ejection and echocardiogram shortening fractions increased, and exercise duration (341 to 453 sec) and New York Heart Association functional class (3.6 to 2.2) improved. Thus ACE-induced vasodilation by oral captopril improved cardiac performance and clinical status in refractory CHF.", 
    "214": "Prompt and exaggerated natriuresis and diuresis were seen one to two hours after the starting of an infusion of 300 ml of 3% saline for one hour in patients with essential hypertension on a high sodium chloride intake. There were no significant differences in urinary volume and sodium excretion after the saline load in patients with normal and low plasma renin activity. The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with SQ 14225 in patients with normal plasma renin activity did not produce additional natriuresis and diuresis after the saline load. Mean arterial blood pressure and/or changes in mean arterial blood pressure after the saline load showed a positive correlation with urinary volume and sodium excretion in each collection period in hypertensive subjects. Free water reabsorption in hypertensives was lower at high levels of osmolar clearance than that in control subjects. These results suggest that \"exaggerated natriuresis\" in essential hypertension is due to a decrease in tubular sodium reabsorption, which may be the result of intrarenal hemodynamic changes related to high blood pressure per se. The decreased medullary osmolar gradient is a possible contributing factor in the enhanced sodium and water excretion, while the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system does not seem to play an important role.", 
    "215": "Renin production and release induced by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), SQ 14225, were studied in male Wistar rats. Acute studies on the effects of CEI (4.6 mumol/kg, i.m. every 6 h for 48 H) in rats revealed a significant reduction in angiotensin II levels and a marked increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). There were no appreciable changes in renal content (RRC) and the juxtaglomerular cell granulation index (JGI). In rats which had received CEI in their drinking water (0.92 mumol/ml) for 12 days, angiotensin II levels were decreased markedly and urinary excretion of sodium was increased, but the reduction in blood pressure was slight. PRA, JGI and RRC were markedly increased in these animals. The kidneys of CEI-treated rats exhibited conspicuous vascular dilatation. CEI treatment of sodium-depleted rats resulted in a reduction of the increased JGI and RRC and in a further increase in PRA. Our findings suggest that CEI administration may initially effect stimulation of renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus and that prolonged CEI administration results in a gradual stimulation of renin production.", 
    "216": "1. The pigeon drank as vigorously in response to intracranial injection of synthetic renin substrate and angiotensin I as to angiotensin II. 2. Mammalian renin injected into the brain caused the water-replete pigeon to drink but it was a less effective dipsogen than in the mammal. As in the mammal, renin-induced drinking was slower in onset and continued for longer than angiotensin-induced drinking. 3. The converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 attenuated drinking in response to intracranial renin, synthetic renin substrate and angiotensin I but enhanced intracranial angiotensin II-induced drinking. Therefore drinking induced by the intracranial injection of precursors of angiotensin II is mediated through local generation of angiotensin II. 4. I.V. injection of angiotensin I was as effective as angiotensin II in causing the pigeon to drink, but synthetic renin substrate was less effective. I.V. doses of angiotensin I and II had to be about 100 times greater than the intracranial doses in order to produce similar intakes. 5. Angiotensin I and II were equally effective pressor agents by I.V. injection in the pigeon but synthetic renin substrate was much less effective. I.V. SQ 20881 inhibited the pressor response to I.V. synthetic renin substrate or angiotensin I but enhanced the angiotensin II-induced response. 6. Aliphatic position 8-substituted analogues of angiotensin II which are competitive antagonists of angiotensin II-induced drinking and pressor responses in the mammal in antagonist:agonist mole ratios as low as 10:1, failed to reduce drinking in response to intracranial synthetic renin substrate or angiotensin II, although not themselves agonists, nor did they prevent the pressor to infusion of angiotensin II even with antagonist:agonist mole ratios as high as 10,000:1. 7. Shortening the angiotensin octapeptide from the N-terminus caused a progressive reduction in intracranial dipsogenic activity. Activity was completely abolished by removing the C-terminal phenylalanine. 8. These results demonstrate that in pigeons, as in mammals, it is angiotensin II which is the biologically active peptide in the control of drinking behaviour and blood pressure by the renin-angiotensin system. Precursors of angiotensin II can be converted to the octapeptide in the avian brain as well as in the circulation. The angiotensin receptors for drinking and blood pressure responses are similar to each other in the pigeon and they are very similar but not identical with the angiotensin receptors for the dipsogenic, pressor and myotropic actions of angiotensin II in mammals.", 
    "217": "This study was designed to determine whether angiotensin II of renal origin physiologically mediates free water production by the kidney. The effect of renal arterial infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, on renal function was studied under conditions of hydropenia and hydration in uninephrectomized conscious dogs after 5 days of equilibration on a normal or low sodium diet. In low sodium animals, intrarenal infusion of teprotide (0.25 microgram/kg.min) after 12 h of water restriction elicited marked increases in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and free water formation. After 24 h of water restriction, vasopressin (10 microU/min) was infused iv to achieve an effective maximal urine concentration. Under these conditions, the inhibitor again increased the GFR and free water formation. After the production of a state of stable hydration, intrarenal infusion of teprotide also increased the GFR and free water formation. In the normal sodium animals, intrarenal infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor (2.5 microgram/kg.min) in 12-h hydropenic dogs failed to change the GFR but increased free water formation, while the inhibitor decreased effective renal plasma flow and free water formation in normal sodium, hydrated animals. These data suggest that angiotensin II of renal origin plays an important role in the control of free water production by the kidney.", 
    "218": "Intravenous infusions of angiotensins I and II into anesthetized dogs caused release of a prostacyclin-like substance into arterial blood: prostacyclin (PGI2) was detected by direct bioassay on bovine coronary artery, rat stomach strip, and rat colon, all of which were treated with phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, and Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II. This effect of angiotensin I, but not of angiotensin II, was abolished by captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.), and the effect of angiotensin II was abolished by Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (0.5 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.). The PGI2-like substance disappeared during incubation of arterial blood for 6 min, and much less appeared in mixed venous blood withdrawn from the right atrium of pulmonary artery, indicating that it originates from the lungs. Neither arterial nor mixed venous blood contained measurable amounts of prostaglandin E2; infusions of noradrenaline did not release the PGI2-like substance. Release of the PGI2-like substance by angiotensin II was reduced after intravenous administration of indomethacin (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg), aspirin (100 mg/kg), aspirin (100 mg/kg), and meclofenamic acid (2 mg/kg), but was not completely eliminated by any of the above inhibitors. In indomethacin-treated dogs the residual relaxation of the bovine coronary artery induced by intravenous angiotensin II was not further reduced by treating the tissues with hyoscine, mepyramine, cimetidine, and methysergide. Either the pulmonary site of PGI2 biosynthesis, which is stimulated by angiotensin, is partly resistant to inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or the PGI2-like substance is an unknown substance with similar biological properties.", 
    "219": "The thirst mechanism by carbamylcholine and the possible interactions with the renin-angiotensin system have been investigated. Rats placed in metabolic cages in order to measure the drunk water and the emitted urine were used. Carbamylcholine has been injected together with captopril, an inhibitor of the enzyme converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, and with propranolol, which blocks the renin beta-receptors respectively. When given in combination with these substances, the thirst by carbamylcholine was not reduced; this result does not favour the hypothesis of a role of the renin-angiotensin system. On the contrary, the thirst by carbamylcholine seems to be due to a vasomotor action. These results confirm the hypothesis that an unbalance between the blood circulating mass and the venous vessels underlies the regulation of the thirst.", 
    "220": "26 patients with severe hypertension (10 essential, 9 renal parenchymatous, 7 renovascular) and a mean age of 42 years were treated with the new oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225). During the initial phase with a standardized triple therapy (STT) consisting of propranolol (maximum 320 mg/day), hydralazine (maximum 200 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (maximum 100 mg/day) or furosemide (maximum 250 mg/day) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values remained almost unchanged (184 +/- 32/111 +/- 17 mm Hg to 179 +/- 34/112 +/- 19 mm Hg), indicating true therapy resistance to conventional antihypertensive therapy. After discontinuing each antihypertensive agent captopril was then titrated from 3 X 25 mg/day to a maximum of 4 X 150 mg/day. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after starting captopril were 154/95, 155/97, 149/93 and 143/91 mm Hg. The corresponding mean captopril doses were 242, 280, 325 and 299 mg daily. During captopril medication mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly lower (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.005) than during STT. Throughout the observation period of 16 weeks only 15% of the cases were on monotherapy with captopril whereas 62% needed the addition of a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide). In 23% of the cases even the combination of captopril and diuretic was insufficient and thus propranolol was added as a third drug. The side effects observed were 1 case with renal water and fluid retention and with reversible skin rash and 1 with pruritus. The results demonstrate that captopril has good blood pressure lowering activity in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. However, in the majority of our cases the addition of a diuretic was necessary. Finally, some patients required a beta-blocker as a third drug.", 
    "221": "In rats with permanent brain cannulas intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 2 microgram captopril nearly abolished drinking responses elicited by i.c.v. injections of 1 mUnit hog renin, 10 pmol synthetic renin substrate or 10 pmol angiotensin I but did not reduce drinking elicited by 10 pmol angiotensin II. Inhibition of the response to precursors of angiotensin II was long-lasting (at least 2 h) and dose-dependent (20 ng-2 microgram captopril). Captopril was 3-5 times more potent than SQ 20,881 i.c.v. Subcutaneous injections of captopril in doses 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg reduced pressor responses to intravenous injections of angiotensin I without attenuating drinking elicited by i.c.v. injections of angiotensin precursors. Higher doses of captopril, however, given subcutaneously (5-50 mg/kg) or by gavage (10 mg/kg) did not reduce drinking to i.c.v. injections of renin or angiotensin I (but not angiotensin II). We conclude that captopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the brain even when given subcutaneously or by gavage in doses commonly used in the rat.", 
    "222": "Eight hypertensive patients with normal renal function and receiving diuretic therapy for at least 28 days received captopril in small increasing doses (6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg). Supine and standing blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured before and after captopril administration. The mean (+/- SEM) maximal decline in BP was 38/18 +/- 3/2, 34/18 +/- 4/2, and 25/17 +/- 3/2 mm Hg and occurred within 70 minutes of each of the three doses. In contrast, the duration of a 10 mm Hg or greater decrease in BP was prolonged markedly (103 +/- 5, 175 +/- 15, and 287 +/- 10 minutes) after each dose increment. After captopril, mean PRA levels increased while PAC levels fell. Transient dizziness on standing occurred in two patients, but captopril was otherwise well tolerated. Evaluation of the response to initial doses of captopril appears to be helpful in predicting maintenance requirements.", 
    "223": "Antihypertensive effects of captopril, an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor were examined in the young and adult stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) rats. The treatment was initiated at 6-7 and 14-18 weeks of age, and was continued for 12 and 17 weeks, respectively. The dosage of captopril was changed stepwise 3-30 and 3-100 mg/kg, orally per day in the young and adult rats, respectively. The effects of hydralazine were also determined for comparison. Captopril had a chronic antihypertensive effect when given in doses of 30 mg/kg in the young and 100 mg/kg in the adult rats. Captopril had no significant effect on heart rate throughout the experiments, while hydralazine increased the heart rate. Treatment with captopril decreased the incidence of vascular disease in the young and the severity in the adult rats, respectively. A decrease in incidence of cerebral stroke in the adult SHRSP was also apparent. More than a ten fold increase in plasma renin activity and about a two fold increase in kidney renin activity were observed in both the young and adult SHRSP at the end of the treatments. The results demonstrate the efficacy of long-term treatment with captopril in the management of hypertensive disease in SHRSP rats.", 
    "224": "The effects of acute saralasin (SAR) and captopril (SQ) administration on arterial pressure (AP), plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary excretion of water and electrolytes, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), and glomerular blood flow (GBF) distribution (microsphere technique) were assessed in rats with activation of the renal renin and kallikrein systems (that is, chronic sodium depletion). In both groups AP decreased, and PRA and RBF increased markedly. Blood flow to outermost (C1) glomeruli was (in nl/min/g of kidney wt) 270 +/- 35 in SAR and 219 +/- 20 in the SQ group (NS when compared to 208 +/- 9 in control chronically sodium-depleted rats). Blood flow to innermost glomeruli (C4) strikingly increased from 95 +/- 10 (control) to 216 +/- 21 (SAR) and 180 +/- 13 (SQ group). Hence, preferential vasodilatation of innermost glomeruli occurred (C1/C4 ratio of 2.18 +/- 0.27 in control, 1.26 +/- 0.11 in SAR, and 1.25 +/- 0.07 in SQ rats). Chronic (6 days) administration of SQ was associated with a rapid and marked increase in water and sodium excretion. At the end of the study, RBF was higher than control, and GBF distribution was similar to that observed in acutely treated rats (C1/C4 ratio of 1.16 +/- 0.10). These results suggest that angiotensin plays a significant role in the systemic and renal hemodynamic changes associated with chronic sodium depletion. The similarity of the changes induced by SAR and SQ provides an indirect evidence against an effective role of the renal kallikrein system in the effect of captopril.", 
    "225": "Captopril is the first orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme to become available. It has been studied primarily in hypertension. In mild to moderate essential hypertension captopril is about as effective as usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol, about one-half of such patients needing the addition of a diuretic to achieve satisfactory control of blood pressure. In severe hypertension captopril plus a diuretic (and in some patients a beta-blocker) usually reduced blood pressure significantly more than could be achieved with 'standard triple therapy' in patients not responding adequately to such a regimen, and often resulted in an improved feeling of well-being in severely hypertensive patients previously receiving intensive multiple drug therapy. Indeed, at the present stage of the drug's development, patients not responding to or not tolerating 'traditional' antihypertensive therapy represent the most suitable candidates for captopril treatment. While captopril has been well tolerated in most patients, some troublesome or potentially serious side effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, dysgeusia and reduced renal function; although a clear causal relationship with captopril was not always established, it would appear that the final place of captopril in the treatment of hypertension may ultimately depend on further clarification of its adverse effects profile. In addition to studies in hypertension, captopril has produced encouraging improvement in a small number of patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant to conventional therapy. Captopril must be considered an exciting addition to the therapeutic armamentarium; it, and pharmacologically related compounds of the future, will continue to generate much interest as their final place in therapy becomes better defined through additional well designed studies and wider clinical experience.", 
    "226": "Captopril, an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting-enzyme, offers a new approach in the treatment of renin-induced hypertension, which is refractory to conventional drugs. A 4 months old infant developed after nephrectomy again hypertension which was probably renin-induced. BP did not respond to high doses of methyl-dopa, clonidine, hydralazine, and furosemide. An acute BP response to captopril was seen at a daily dose of 150 mg. During long-term treatment 75 mg captopril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in normalization of BP. In a second child with renin-induced hypertension since the firth month of life, treatment wiht hydralazine, clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide was in part effective, but failure to thrive was progressive. Captopril treatment was started at the age of 20 months. BP was lowered at a daily dose of 75 mg and normalized during long-term therapy with 50 mg. Side effects were not seen.", 
    "227": "1. Captopril given for 5 days caused a fall in blood pressure in normotensive subjects. The percentage fall in mean supine pressure was greatest on a low sodium diet (10 mmol/day), 19.6%, least on a high sodium diet (350 mmol/day), 11%, and in between on a normal sodium diet (120 mmol/day), 16.5%. 2. Captopril caused a marked fall in plasma aldosterone in normal subjects on all three sodium intakes. 3. Captopril caused an increase in sodium excretion on the normal (120 mmol/day) and low (10 mmol/day) sodium diet but not the high sodium diet. 4. These results suggest that the renin--angiotensin--aldosterone system is a normal mechanism for maintaining blood pressure and aldosterone secretion in normotensive man. The system may also be involved in the maintenance of sodium balance. 5. These results may lead to a better understanding of the role of the renin--angiotensin--aldosterone system in the maintenance or causation of high blood pressure in essential hypertension.", 
    "228": "1. This study was designed to quantify the role of angiotensin II in determining the chronic relationships between arterial pressure, renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion. 2. In six control dogs sodium balance was achieved during chronic increases in sodium intake from 5 to 495 mmol/day with small increases in arterial pressure (7mmHg), moderate increases in glomerular filtration rate (19%) and decreases in filtration fraction. Similar increases in sodium intake in dogs whose circulating levels of angiotensin II were fixed, due to a constant intravenous infusion of 4.85 pmol of angiotensin II min-1 kg-1, caused large increases in arterial pressure (42%), glomerular filtration rate (31%), filtration fraction and calculated renal sodium reabsorption above control. In six dogs whose angiotensin II formation was blocked by SQ 14 225, sodium balance at intakes of 5-80 mmol/day occurred at reduced arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction and sodium reabsorption although plasma aldosterone concentration was not substantially different from that in control dogs. At sodium intakes above 240 mmoL/day arterial pressure was not altered by SQ 14 225. 3. These data indicate that during chronic variations in sodium intake angiotensin II plays a major role, independently of changes in plasma aldosterone concentration, in allowing sodium balance without large fluctuations in glomerular filtration rate or arterial pressure. The mechanism whereby angiotensin II conserves sodium chronically is through increased sodium reabsorption, since steady-state sodium reabsorption was increased by angiotensin II and decreased by SQ 14 225.", 
    "229": "1. The haemodynamic effects of 100 mg of captopril in renovascular hypertension (n = 11), essential hypertension (n = 12) and the anephric state (n = 7) were compared. Brachial artery pressure was measured in all patients, and changes in right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output were followed in renovascular and essential hypertension. Nephrectomized patients were studied before and after fluid withdrawal by ultrafiltration. 2. The pretreatment concentration of active renin in plasma was 100 +/- 24 mu-units/ml (mean +/- SEM) in renovascular hypertension, and 24 +/- 4 mu-units/ml in essential hypertension. In nephrectomized patients pretreatment renin was 1.7 +/- 0.3 mu-units/ml, and renin was unresponsive to withdrawal of 1.8 +/- 0.21 of body fluid. 3. The effects of captopril were maximal after 60-90 min. Mean arterial pressure after 90 min was lowered by 19 +/- 4% in renovascular hypertension, by 17 +/- 4% in essential hypertension and by 16 +/- 3% in fluid-depleted nephrectomized patients. These changes were not significantly different despite the marked differences in renin. Captopril had no effect on arterial pressure in the fluid-replete anephric state. 4. The effects of captopril on cardiac filling pressures and cardiac output in renovascular and essential hypertension were also not different. 5. It is concluded that the antihypertensive action of captopril may be largely independent of circulating renin.", 
    "230": "1. Neurosecretion of peptides from superfused neurohypophyses in vitro was inhibited by dopamine. 2. This inhibition was dose-dependent. 3. Intravenous injection of the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, lowered blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats within 15 min. 4. Saralasin or captopril also lowered blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, but progressively over a period of 3 h. 5. The results suggest that dopamine and angiotensin have opposite effects on the neurosecretion of vasopressin. 6. Vasopressin appears to be involved in maintenance of blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat but is apparently not the only factor.", 
    "231": "1. To study which factors determine the balance between the antagonistic and agonistic effects of the angiotensin II analogue [Sar1,Ala8]-angiotensin II (saralasin) in man, saralasin was infused in subjects on a 'normal' sodium intake (group 1) during sodium restriction with appropriately elevated plasma angiotensin II levels (group 2) and in sodium-restricted subjects in whom plasma angiotensin II was suppressed by converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (group 3). 2. The action of saralasin was agonistic in group 3, antagonistic in group 2 and variable in group 1. 3. For groups 1 and 2 together the saralasin-induced changes of arterial pressure, of plasma aldosterone and of plasma renin were significantly related to control plasma angiotensin II but also the the 24 h urinary sodium excretion. When group 3 was included the changes remained significantly related to plasma angiotensin II but not to the urinary sodium excretion. 4. The results indicate that angiotensin II and not sodium status determines the agonistic/antagonistic balance of saralasin's actions.", 
    "232": "1. The role of endogenous prostaglandins in the antihypertensive mechanism of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was investigated. 2. An unequivocal reduction in blood pressure and significant increase in plasma renin activity and urinary prostaglandin E excretion were found after the captopril administration. 3. The changes in blood pressure, plasma renin activity and urinary prostaglandin E excretion induced by captopril were reversed after the inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin. However, the responses in low renin hypertension were different from those in normal renin hypertension. 4. In low renin hypertensive patients who responded to captopril, the hypotensive effect was abolished after th addition of indomethacin, whereas no marked change in blood pressure was induced by indomethacin in normal renin hypertensive patients. In contrast, plasma renin activity was markedly increased after captopril administration in normal renin hypertension, and no significant change was found in low renin hypertension. 5. Potentiation of the prostaglandin system seems to be a principal factor in the antihypertensive mechanism of captopril in low renin hypertension, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is important in normal renin hypertensives. 6. The increase in renin release after the administration of captopril was inhibited by indomethacin, suggesting that an endogenous prostaglandin system may contribute to the short feedback mechanism of renin release.", 
    "233": "1. In rats, intra-arterial metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, resulted in an elevation of plasma aldosterone at 5 min and plasma renin activity at 10 min and peak aldosterone and renin responses at 10 and 30 min respectively. 2. Pre-administration of L-dopa blunted and delayed aldosterone and renin responses to metoclopramide, indicating that metoclopramide-induced plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity increments are mediated by a direct effect of blockade of dopamine receptors rather than other effects of this drug. 3. Pre-administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14 225) and the angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, as well as bilateral nephrectomy did not significantly affect the aldosterone response to metoclopramide, Thus dopaminergic modulation of aldosterone secretion occurs independently of alterations in the renin-angiotensin system. 4. Modulating effects of dopamine on plasma aldosterone are probably mediated by direct effects as well as by interaction with other factors influencing aldosterone secretion at the adrenal zona glomerulosa.", 
    "234": "Changes in the rates of degradation of Met- and Leu-enkephalin by brain aminopeptidase were measured by UV absorption after high-pressure liquid chromatography. The cleavage of enkephalin paralleled the generation of tyrosine. Captopril (SQ 14,225) stimulated enzyme activity, to a greater extent with Met- than with Leu-enkephalin. Pro-His-Pro-NH2, histidine, and histamine stimulated enkephalin aminopeptidase approximately twice as much as captopril. The sulfhydryl group of captopril was not the only factor in its effect. The addition of captopril did not change the pH optimum, and it stimulated enkephalin degradation between 25 and 50 degrees C.", 
    "235": "1. Captopril infused into sodium-loaded dogs produced a fall in both blood pressure [117 +/- 9.7 to 96.6 +/- 11.4 (SD) mmHg] and plasma angiotensin II [11.0 +/- 3.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.3 (SD) pmol/l]. Plasma aldosterone fell while both blood angiotensin I and renin concentration rose. 2. Angiotensin II was infused at 2, 6, 18 and 54 ng min-1 kg-1 into sodium-depleted dogs. Plasma angiotensin II and arterial pressure both rose and were related in a dose-response curve. 3. On a separate occasion the same dogs were given an intravenous infusion of captopril (6 mg h-1 kg-1) and the angiotensin II infusion was repeated. Again plasma angiotensin II and arterial pressure rose but the dose-response curve was displaced downwards; a higher concentration of angiotensin II being required to produce the same blood pressure as in the dogs not given captopril. 4. These finding suggest that the acute hypotensive effect of captopril is not wholly explained by a decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration and the consequent reduction of its acute vasoconstrictor effect.", 
    "236": "Captopril (SQ 14225), a converting enzyme inhibitor, significantly lowered the arterial pressure (AP) of rats with angiotensin-salt hypertension, a hypertensive state associated with sodium retention, volume expansion, and suppression of both renin and aldosterone secretion. While captopril was acting, there was no increase in sodium, potassium, or water excretion. Thus, the antihypertensive effect was not due to natriuresis or diuresis. Moreover, as the AP was lowered, there was no change in plasma renin concentrtion, the pulse rate was lowered, and the lack of potassium retention suggested minimal or no effect on aldosterone secretion. The mechanism of action of captopril in a sodium-volume-expanded, renin-aldosterone-suppressed state is unknown.", 
    "237": "An analogue of a tripeptide inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro, has been synthesized in which the amide bond connecting phenylalanine and glycine has been replaced by a ketomethylene group. This nonpeptide analogue, 20, shows more potent converting enzyme inhibiting activity, I50 = 0.07 microM, than Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro, I50 = 9.4 microM, or than the orally active D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline (captopril, 1), I50 = 0.30 microM. Compound 20 has a Ki of 1.06 X 10(-7) and either competitive or noncompetitive enzyme kinetics depending on what substrate is used in the converting enzyme assay. In tests for inhibition of angiotensin I induced contractions in the guinea pig ileum, 20 has one-tenth the activity of 1.", 
    "238": "1. To investigate the non-angiotensin effects of converting enzyme inhibition, angiotensin II was infused intravenously at 30 ng/min for 9 days in conscious rats to produce moderate blood pressure elevation. One group was given captopril (SQ 14 225) by gavage (100 mg/kg twice daily) and the other glucose. 2. After 7 days of captopril administration, enzyme blockade was confirmed by a tenfold greater depressor sensitivity to exogenous bradykinin and a markedly decreased plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. 3. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity were not different between captopril and glucose-treated groups in the presence of angiotensin II. Metabolic studies also revealed no long-term differences in water and food intake, weight change or sodium and potassium metabolism. 4. These findings suggest that, in the presence of angiotensin II, there is no detectable haemodynamic or metabolic effect of converting enzyme inhibition in rats and, therefore, that bradykinin plays little or no role in its long-term antihypertensive action.", 
    "239": "1. The effect of continuous infusion of captopril (80 microgram/h) for up to 5 days on blood pressure, adrenal angiotensin II receptors and vascular reactivity exogenous angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin and noradrenaline was studied in the rat. 2. In treated rats, blood pressure decreased transiently to a minimum after 2 days (-18 mmHg). Vascular reactivity to angiotensin II, but not to arginine vasopressin, was also increased significantly after 2 days, but vascular reactivity to noradrenaline decreased. After 5 days, vascular reactivity to angiotensin II had returned to normal and was similar to that of sham-treated controls. Adrenal angiotensin II receptor concentrations decreased significantly after 1 and 2 days, but at 5 days were again similar to controls There was no change in receptor affinity. 3. Converting enzyme inhibition with captopril causes transient specific changes in adrenal angiotensin II receptors and vascular reactivity. The receptor and vascular effects may facilitate and oppose, respectively, the early changes in blood pressure with captopril, but a long-term contribution from either is unlikely.", 
    "240": "1. Unilateral renal artery constriction in rats maintained on a sodium-deplete, but not sodium-replete, diet induced an augmented acute vasodepressor response to kininase II inhibition produced by an intravenous injection of the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor captopril (250 microgram) during continuous saralasin-induced angiotensin II blockade (10 microgram/min). Dietary sodium restriction alone in sham-operated rats had no effect. 2. Acute bilateral adrenalectomy (18-24 h) did not preclude the demonstration of an augmented response to kininase II inhibition in sodium-depleted rats with benign two-kidney, one-clip hypertension. Neither did chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate in intact rats elicit an augmented response. 3. The augmented acute vasodepressor response to kininase II inhibition in sodium-depleted rats with benign two-kidney, one-clip hypertension is probably due to bradykinin potentiation and secondary to an increased activity of the kallikrein-kinin system. The mechanism responsible for this apparent increase is not known, but neither hyperangiotensinemia nor hyperaldosteronism seems to play a role.", 
    "241": "1. Because changes in the plasma concentration of angiotensin II and bradykinin appear inadequate to account completely for the hypotensive response to captopril, we measured changes in plasma prostaglandins in response to increasing doses of captopril in nine supine normal male subjects studied on both a high (200 mol/l) and low (10 mol/l) sodium intake. 2. On both the high and low sodium diets, captopril induced significant (P < 0.01) increments in the 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite of the vasodilatory prostaglandin E2, which correlated significantly with the fall in blood pressure (P < 0.0001). 3. No significant changes were noted in the plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandins F1 alpha or thromboxane B2, the stable products of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 respectively.", 
    "242": "1. Lower-body subatmospheric pressure has been used to stimulate sympathetic reflexes in anaesthetized cats and the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and [Sar1, Ala8]angiotensin II have been investigated on this reflex. 2. At the prevailing level of renin activity (2.9-3.2 ng of angiotensin I h-1 ml-1) the converting enzyme inhibitor had no effect on blood pressure yet it potentiated the initial fall in blood pressure caused by the reduced pressure and it impaired its recovery. After 10 min, therefore, blood pressure was still reduced after converting enzyme inhibitor treatment whereas in control experiments full recovery occurred within 30 s. 3. When converting enzyme inhibitor was given 75 s after the start of a 10 min period of reduced pressure, at a time when plasma renin activity had not been increased, it caused a greater and more sustained fall in pressure than it caused when administered alone. The angiotensin II antagonist, [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II, produced similar effects. 4. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system interacts with the sympathetic nervous system to maintain systemic arterial pressure.", 
    "243": "1. The effect of aprotinin-induced blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system on haemodynamic and biochemical responses to converting enzyme inhibition by SQ 14 225 was evaluated in 26 patients with essential hypertension. 2. SQ 14 225 lowered blood pressure in high, normal and low renin hypertension. In low and normal renin patients, but not in high renin patients, the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of SQ 14225 could be overcome by aprotinin. Aprotinin infusion produced small vasopressor effects in all groups of patients. 3. Aprotinin lowered the level of circulating active renin but not that of inactive renin. 4. It is concluded that in low and normal, but not in high, renin hypertensive patients activation of the kallikrein-kinin system is responsible for the acute blood pressure reduction observed with converting enzyme inhibitions. 3. Aprotinin lowered the level of circulating active renin but not that of inactive renin. 4. It is concluded that in low and normal, but not in high, renin hypertensive patients activation of the kallikrein-kinin system is responsible for the acute blood pressure reduction observed with converting enzyme inhibition. 5. With long-term converting enzyme inhibition kallikrein-kinin system activation seems to play only a minor role. 6. The kallikrein-kinin system may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure. 7. There is no direct evidence of a participation of kallikrein in the activation of prorenin in vivo.",

There were significant differences in response patterns from region to region, possibly on account of an interaction of anatomical, biochemical, or physiological variables. Although the compound SQ 14225 appeared to be the most potent of the inhibitors examined, it had no apparent effect on CNS substance P-like immunoreactivity when administered peripherally.", 
    "245": "The acute hypotensive effect of 25 mg captopril was investigated in 26 hypertensive patients (11 essential and 15 with renal arterial disease). Intra-arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously and arterial blood was sampled for renin, angiotensin I and II, aldosterone, kininase II, catecholamines and prostaglandins. Captopril provoked increases in plasma renin activity, active and total plasma renin concentration and angiotensin I; decreases in plasma kininase II activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and no changes in plasma (nor)adrenaline, dopamine and inactive renin concentration.", 
    "246": "The acute haemodynamic effects of low doses of the oral converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were studied in 18 patients with severe chronic heart failure. The effects of long-term therapy were also evaluated. Increasing doses (1 mg, 2.5 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 25 mg) of captopril were given at 2 h intervals with haemodynamic monitoring. Graded haemodynamic improvement (increased stroke-volume index and reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) was noted from 1 hand was closely associated with reduction of blood pressure. Maximal haemodynamic improvement for the group was seen at 6 h and 7 h after the 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg doses, when stroke-volume index had risen 35% and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure had fallen 40% from control. Captopril 12.5-50 mg every 8 h was continued long term but was withdrawn in 2 patients with symptomatic hypotension and 1 patient with altered taste. 4 patients died and 1 was noncompliant with therapy. At 3 months, 10 patients showed significant improvement in symptoms, treadmill-exercise duration, and echocardiographic indices of left-ventricular size and function. Repeat haemodynamic measurements were similar to optimum measurements obtained during the initial study.", 
    "247": "Pretreatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 or 100 mg/kg p.o.) had no effect on pressor responses to angiotensin II or norepinephrine whereas the response to angiotensin I was markedly inhibited. In contrast, pressor responses to sympathetic stimulation in pithed SHR were inhibited by captopril whereas the positive chronotropic responses to stimulation were unaltered. These results suggest that captopril causes a prejunctional inhibition of norepinephrine release to sympathetic nerve stimulation which is selective for the vasculature. This is probably due to inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the vasculature.", 
    "248": "Captopril (SQ 14225) had a clear antihypertensive effect in rat Heymann nephritis-DOCA-NaCl hypertension, a low renin model introduced recently, but was ineffective in 1-kidney-DOCA-NaCl hypertension although plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed similarly in both. Thus, the antihypertensive effect of captopril was independent of circulating renin. This result also suggests different pathogenetic mechanisms of hypertension in these two DOCA-NaCl models.", 
    "249": "There is both theoretical and therapeutic interest in establishing whether the signals conveyed by the enkephalins are turned off under the action of a specific peptidase which might, in this case, represent a target for a new class of psychoactive agents. Enkephalinase, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase cleaving the Gly3-Phe4 bond of enkephalins and distinct fropm angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE), might be selectively involved in enkephalinergic transmission. It is a membrane-bound enzyme whose localization in the vicinity of opiate receptors in the central nervous system is suggested by parallel regional and subcellular distributions as well as by the effects of lesions. Such a role is further supported by the ontogenetic development of enkephalinase, its substrate specificity accounting for the increased biological activity of several enkephalin analogues and its adaptive increase following chronic treatment with morphine. To investigate the functional role of this enzyme further, we have designed a potent and specific enkephalinase inhibitor. We report here that this compound, thiorphan [(DL-3-mercapto-2-benzylpropanoyl)-glycine; patent no. 8008601] protects the enkephalins from the action of enkephalinase in vitro in nanomolar concentration and in vivo after either intracerebroventricular or systemic administration. In addition, thiorphan itself displays antinociceptive activity which is blocked by naloxone, an antagonist of opiate receptors.", 
    "250": "Much current attention focuses on the renin-angiotensin system in relation to mechanisms controlling blood pressure and renal function. Recent demonstrations (ref. 1, ref. 2 and refs therein) that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors show promising clinical antihypertensive properties have been of particular interest. We now report on the design of a novel series of substituted N-carboxymethyl-dipeptides which are active in inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme at nanomolar levels. We suggest that these compounds are transition-state inhibitors and that extensions of this design to other metalloendopeptidases merit further study.", 
    "251": "Intracerebroventricular administration of tonin, an enzyme which releases angiotensin II directly from various substrates, stimulated water intake and increased blood pressure in the rat. These responses were abolished by the simultaneous administration of an angiotensin II antagonist and were unaffected by the nonapeptide inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that tonin may participate in the physiological regulation of water balance and blood pressure through local and direct generation of angiotensin II in the central nervous system.", 
    "252": "The changes of active and inactive renin in plasma after the oral administration of 25 mg or 50 mg of SQ 14225 (Captopril) were studied in 29 hypertensive patients. Inactive renin was calculated as plasma renin activity (PRA) after cold storage minus PRA before cold storage. The patients were divided into 2 groups, responders and non-responders, according to the response of active renin to Captopril. In 9 responders, the active renin increased markedly while the inactive renin decreased. On the other hand, in 20 non-responders, both renin activities increased only slightly. These results suggest that inactive renin may be converted in vivo to active renin by Captopril.", 
    "253": "Captopril (SQ 14225), an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered in a dose of 50 mg to 12 normotensive subjects (Group I), 26 essential hypertensive patients (Group II), and 8 renovascular hypertensive patients (Group III). In Group III, 5 of the 8 patients had control plasma renal activity (PRA) similar to those in Groups I and II patients, but the PRA response to the administration of captopril was greater in 7 of the 8 patients than those in Groups I and II. These 7 patients had either bilateral or unilateral main renal artery stenosis. Captopril caused no increase in PRA in the remaining 1 who had unilateral renal artery stenosis with contralateral renin aplasia. It is concluded that this provocation test is useful as a screening procedure for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "254": "The relative roles of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system in the development of two-kidney renal hypertension were studied using four groups of rats: Group I = vehicle control; Group II = 6-OH-dopamine (2 weeks prior to renal clipping then weekly throughout the study); Group III = adrenal medullectomy plus vehicle; Group IV = 6-OH-dopamine plus adrenal medullectomy. Six weeks after clipping of a single renal artery, plasma renin activity (PRA) was comparably elevated in all groups. However, mean blood pressure (MBP) of Group II was lower than that of Group I controls (154.7 +/- 6.8 vs 197.3 +/- 6.6 mm Hg respectively). The MBP of Group III (207.0 +/- 5.2 mm Hg) was not different from that of Group I whereas in Group IV (134.2 +/- 18.0 mm Hg) it was markedly lower. All groups of rats were given a single dose of captopril (30 mg/kg p.o.) to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Despite differences in starting MBP, captopril caused similar reductions (38-50%) of MBP and increases in PRA in all groups. Similar results were obtained in two-kidney renal hypertensive rats with hypertension of 12 weeks' duration. It is concluded that the sympathetic nervous system does not contribute to the elevated PRA in two-kidney renal hypertensive rats but does contribute significantly to the development of hypertension in this model.", 
    "255": "Dietary administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (0.70 g/kg of food), to female rats for 1 week was accompanied by a spontaneous appetite for 0.25, 0.30 or 0.35 M NaCl solution when choice was offered between any one of them and distilled water to drink. An additional experiment was performed to determine the NaCl preference threshold concentration for each group. Control and treated rats were offered choice between two drinking bottles containing distilled water and a NaCl solution, respectively. The concentration of the latter varied from 0.0006 to 0.350 M/l. Control rats could detect the difference between water and NaCl solution at a concentration of 0.030 M/l, whereas captopril-treated rats detected the difference at the lowest concentration offered, i.e., 0.0006 M/l. Captopril-treated rats also preferred 5% glucose solution to distilled water, as did untreated controls. Similar results were observed for 0.25% saccharin. No difference between groups was observed when choice was offered between distilled water and dilute solutions of HCl. Thus, a NaCl appetite developed within 1 week of treatment with captopril. The appetite was accompanied by an ability to detect NaCl at a 50-fold lower concentration than that of the control group. Administration of captopril was also accompanied by an appetite for glucose and saccharin but not for HCl.", 
    "256": "A case report of 32-year-old male with renovascular hypertension, suspected to be pheochromocytoma as a result of a tentative diagnosis, is given. The suspicion was based on the observation of high levels of urinary noradrenaline on several occasions with the sign of hyperreninemia. Reduction of the urinary noradrenaline levels by the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ-14225) suggested that the high urinary noradrenaline probably resulted from hyperreninemia which reflected high plasma levels of angiotensin II. Radioisotope renography and intravenous urography strongly suggested a reduction of the right renal blood flow, and the final diagnosis of renovascular hypertension was obtained on the basis of renal arteriography. On the other hand, the possibility of a catecholamine releasing tumor was carefully excluded by angiography before undertaking surgical treatment. The affected kidney was transplanted autogenously into the abdominal cavity. The successful operation led to a decrease in plasma renin activity, blood pressure and urinary noradrenaline excretion. In the present case, we were thus unable to define at first whether the primary genesis of hypertension was related to the hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin system caused by renovascular stenosis or a noradrenaline releasing tumor.", 
    "257": "The importance of potassium as a regulator of angiotensin II receptors of two target tissues has been investigated by combining high-K+ diet in rats with a converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril; SQ 14,225) or angiotensin II. K+ loading alone produced the characteristic increase in Ka and decrease in number of smooth muscle receptors and decrease in Ka and increase in number of adrenal receptors. The combination of Captopril and high-K+ diet blocked the development of most of these effects. In smooth muscle, the number of angiotensin II receptors was 40% higher (n = 5) and Ka was 94% lower (n = 5); in the adrenal the Ka was 29% higher (n = 4) than with K+ loading alone. However, development of the increment in number of adrenal receptors occurred in spite of Captopril treatment. In addition, angiotensin II infusion concomitantly with high-K+ diet resulted in a further increment in the number of adrenal receptors. These studies represent the first example of an ion as a regulator of a peptide hormone receptor and emphasize that different mechanisms of regulation are involved in adrenal and smooth muscle.", 
    "258": "Numerous studies have been carried out to assess the role of the renin system in sustaining abnormally high blood pressure and in contributing to various other cardiovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure, ascites, and shock. The clinical use of potent and specific inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system has produced important application in the treatment of high blood pressure, severe congestive cardiac failure and experimental hemorrhagic shock. Only in the state of considerable sodium depletion does blockade of the renin system produce any untoward effect, i.e. hypotension. These results are very similar to those obtained previously in patients with bilateral nephrectomy. They raise the question whether under conditions of our present salt-eating habits the renin system is really necessary.", 
    "259": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in enhancing aldosterone responsiveness to ACTH during acute sodium depletion was studied in 14 healthy medical students. Acute sodium depletion was achieved by oral treatment with 80 mg furosemide and 200 mg SQ 14,225 for 1 day. The im administration of 250 micrograms alpha ACTH-(1-24) or vehicle was performed at 0800-0900 h both on the day after ad libitum diet (control) and 1 h after the oral administration of 50 mg SQ 14,225 on the day after acute sodium depletion. Treatments with furosemide and SQ 14,225 before both ACTH and vehicle administration induced a reproducible sodium depletion, accompanied by a marked increase in PRA and no significant increase in plasma aldosterone. The administration of ACTH, but not of vehicle, produced significant increases in plasma aldosterone in both control and acute sodium-depleted subjects. However, the ACTH-induced increases in plasma aldosterone and their maximal net and percent increments during acute sodium depletion were significantly greater than control values. It is concluded that angiotensin II does not play an important role in enhancing the aldosterone-stimulating activity of ACTH during acute sodium depletion and that sodium depletion per se may be responsible for this enhancement.", 
    "260": "The acute effect of the orally-active converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was compared to that of saralasin in 13 patients with various forms of hypertension on ad libitum sodium intake. A significant difference between the effects of the two drugs on mean arterial pressure (MAP) was found (-11 +/- 3 mm Hg with saralasin, -24 +/- 4.5 mm Hg after captopril). This difference was not correlated with control plasma renin activity (PRA). To determine the influence of the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system in the antihypertensive action of captopril, the effect of aprotinin (Apro), an inhibitor of kinin generation, on the MAP level achieved by captopril was assessed in five normal subjects and 15 patients with hypertension on ad libitum sodium intake. In normal subjects, captopril did not alter MAP, nor did Apro have any effect. In six patients with essential hypertension and normal PRA, MAP decreased by 5.5 +/- 2 mm Hg following captopril, and Apro did not modify this level. In nine patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH), MAP fell by 22 +/ 3 mm Hg after captopril administration, and Apro infusion induced a rise in MAP of 13 +/- 1.7 mm Hg. A positive correlation between log control PRA and the effect of aprotinin was obtained ( r = 0.63, p less than 0.005). Apro had no effect in two patients with RVH who experiences a large drop in MAP during salasin. These results suggest that endogenous kinins as well as other substances, the generation of which is inhibited by aprotinin, may participate to the antihypertensive effect of captopril in patients with angiotensin-dependent hypertension. The lack of an aprotinin effect on the MAP level achieved during saralasin infusion suggests that the influence of the kallikrein-kinin system is related to the effect of captopril rather than the fall in arterial pressure resulting from angiotensin blockade.", 
    "261": "The hemodynamic effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (SQ 20881) were investigated in five patients with normal plasma renin activity who were normotensive during the study (group I), in five patients with hypertension and normal plasma renin activity (group II), and in five patients with hypertension and high plasma renin activity (group III). No significant hemodynamic changes were observed during teprotide administration in group I. In group II there was a decrease in mean arterial pressure by 10 +/- 2% (p < 0.005) that was associated with a decrease by 16 +/- 7% (p < 0.05) in stroke volume and cardiac output, possibly due to venodilatation and without a concurrent change in total peripheral resistance. In group III the larger decrease of 19 +/- 4% (p < 0.005) in mean arterial pressure was due to a decrease by 30 +/- 3% (p < 0.005) in peripheral resistance. In this group stroke volume and cardiac output increased by 13 +/- 2% (p < 0.025). There were no compensatory changes in heart rate despite the decrease in mean arterial pressure and vasodilatation. These results indicate that teprotide decreases arterial pressure by a dual hemodynamic mechanism. Cardiac output is increased by teprotide in patients with high-renin hypertension who exhibit the greatest decrements in peripheral resistance.", 
    "262": "A girl aged 2 1/2 year on chronic hemodialysis, treated with converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril because of severe uncontrollable renal hypertension, returned for the first time to a satisfactory stable blood pressure. After three months of this therapy the bilateral nephrectomy was performed. Two weeks later the patient showed a stable blood pressure, normal for age. None of the known side effects was seen. Whether the oxalat deposits found with nephrectomy were due to the treatment with Captopril, cannot yet be answered.", 
    "263": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 2.4.15.1.) was measured in serum and in pulmonary plasma membranes of 40 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, Okamoto Aoki strain), divided into 4 groups, and treated with SQ 14225 (Captopril), 0.2 mg . ml-1 in drinking water, for 0-24 weeks. Serum ACE activity increased 2.5-3 fold after 12-24 weeks of SQ 14225 treatment, paralleled by an increase of ACE concentration in purified pulmonary plasma membranes (25-52%), and in ACE concentration upon solubilization with Triton X-100 from such plasma membranes (96-120%). We conclude that the ACE inhibitor, SQ 14225, causes marked induction of pulmonary ACE biosynthesis. High serum ACE activity probably reflects increased total biosynthesis of the enzyme.", 
    "264": "Intra-arterial injection of captopril (1 mg/kg) effectively lowered arterial blood pressure in aorta-coarcted hypertensive rats along with an associated reduction of serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. ACE activity in serum samples from captopril-treated animals that were assayed within 60 min after collection was inhibited 93%. However, this inhibition progressively decreased as the interval between time of assay and blood collection increased. This information would appear to be of considerable value in planning experiments for the determination of serum ACE activity from captopril-treated animals.", 
    "265": "The diuretic response to stimulation of left atrial receptors, by distending balloons located either at the pulmonary vein-left atrial junctions or in the body of the left atrium, was studied during blockade of the generation of angiotensin II using a continuous infusion of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14,225, in anaesthetized dogs. Despite blockade of angiotensin conversion, known also to potentiate the activity of bradykinin, a diuretic response was obtained in each dog; the response was similar to that observed in dogs without blockade of angiotensin conversion. Angiotensin II and bradykinin did not significantly influence the rate of secretion of Malpighian tubules of Rhodnius prolixus, which have been shown capable of detecting the blood-borne agent known to mediate the diuretic response. It is concluded that neither angiotensin II nor bradykinin is likely to be the blood-borne agent released by stimulation of atrial receptors.", 
    "266": "The roles of renin-angiotensin system and renal prostaglandins (PGs) in mediating the renal vasodilator response of captopril were studied in anesthetized nonhypotensive hemorrhaged dogs. Captopril administered i.v. at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg consistently increased renal blood flow (RBF) and decreased renal vascular resistance. Renal venous PGE concentration and PGE secretion rate were not changed significantly by captopril. In eight dogs, saralasin was infused continuously i.a. to the kidney for the entire experiment. Hemorrhage increased RBF and decreased blood pressure significantly in these animals. Captopril did not further increase RBF in the saralasin-treated kidney and still decreased blood pressure significantly. In hemorrhaged dogs given indomethacin, captopril increased RBF and decreased blood pressure to a similar degree as obtained in the untreated hemorrhaged dogs. These results suggest that under the conditions of these experiments the renal vasodilator effect of captopril is due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and is not associated with either renal PGE release or PG-induced vasodilatation.", 
    "267": "The number of studies in the literature on diagnostic and therapeutic uses of angiotensin antagonists has been increasing geometrically. Nearly 1,000 publishsd items deal with saralasin alone, although neither saralasin nor captopril is yet approved for general use or widely available. Reports to date represent only a fraction of the eventual situations in which these agents are likely to help the researcher and clinician. Food and Drug Administration approval of both agents is pending, and both are expected to be available soon. Consequently, the practitioner will want to become familiar with their usefulness, especially to screen for secondary forms of hypertension and to treat moderate to severe primary or secondary hypertension.", 
    "268": "The effects of indomethacin treatment on the vascular response to 5-valine-angiotensin II amide, [sarcosine, isoleucine] angiotensin II, and D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline were examined in a patient with Bartter's syndrome. Indomethacin (150 mg/day) was administered for 5 days. PRA decreased from 74.1 to 3.2 ng/ml.h during this period. With this treatment, the normal pressor response to the synthetic angiotensin II was restored, and the hypotensive response to the angiotensin II antagonist and the converting enzyme inhibitor was markedly diminished. These results suggest that altered vascular responsiveness in Bartter's syndrome would be secondary to hormonal derangements.", 
    "269": "Intraventricular administration of tonin, an enzyme which forms angiotensin II directly from a natural protein substrate (angiotensinogen), stimulated water drinking and increased systemic blood pressure in rats. These responses were abolished by the simultaneous administration of an angiotensin II analogue, but unaffected by an angiotensin I- converting enzyme inhibitor. We confirmed, in vitro, that angiotensin II was generated when the brain homogenate was incubated with tonin in the presence of DFP and EDTA. These results indicate that the central effects of tonin on water drinking and systemic blood pressure are mediated via the direct formation of angiotensin II in the brain, and suggest the possibility that the tonin-angiotensin II system in the central nervous system might be important in controlling water balance and blood pressure.", 
    "270": "The effect of SQ-20881, an inhibitor of the peptidyl dipeptidase that degrades kinins and converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, on the urinary excretion of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (iPGE2) was studied in rats receiving either deoxycorticosterone (DOCA, 5 mg/day s.c.) or sesame oil vehicle for 10 days before and then during the study, DOCA-treated animals had higher urinary excretion of iPHE2 and kallikrein, and lower plasma renin, than did animals injected with oil only. In rats pretreated with DOCA, infusion of SQ-20881 (1.2 mg/day s.c.) for 6 days increased iPGE2 excretion from 87.3 +/- 1.9 to 150.9 +/- 14.5 ng/day (P < .05). In contrast, in rats pretreated with vehicle, SQ-20881 had no significant effect on urine iPGE2. The enzyme inhibitor did not affect the intake of fluid, the volume of urine or the urinary excretion of kallikrein and electrolytes in either DOCA- or vehicle-treated animals. The blood pressure reduction elicited by a bolus injection of bradykinin (1.0 microgram i.v.) was greater in rats receiving SQ-20881 than in vehicle-infused controls, both in the DOCA- and in the sesame oil-treated groups, suggesting inhibition of kinin degradation by the converting enzyme inhibitor. These results indicate that DOCA or the consequences of its administration are required for SQ-20881 to increase iPHE2 excretion in the rat. Such an effect of the inhibitor probably relates to stimulation of renal prostaglandin synthesis consequent to elevation of kinin levels.", 
    "271": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril was tested on 19 patients with essential hypertension, WHO grade I or II. In 11 patients blood pressure levels returned to normal over an observation period of 12 weeks at a dose of 3 C 50-150 mg daily (group A). In eight patients with grade II hypertension the absolute blood-pressure reduction was the same, but did not reach normal levels (group B). Although additional intake of propranolol, at a dose of 3 X 40 mg daily, achieved further reduction, normal pressures were still not attained. Initial blood pressure levels were higher and plasma-renin activity lower in patients of group B than of group A. There was a definite rise in plasma-renin activity with captopril, but corresponding to the suppression of plasma-renin in severe hypertension it was less. There was a fall in plasma-aldosterone levels, corresponding to a reduced angiotensin II level as a result of inhibition of the converting enzyme. The fall in plasma-aldosterone activity was less in severe hypertension, although there was the same inhibition of converting enzyme activity in both groups. Normochromic anaemia was noted in three patients, requiring further observation and explanation. No patient developed orthostatic hypotension or reflex tachycardia.", 
    "272": "The sensitivity of blood vessels to the vasoconstrictor effects of the hormone angiotensin II appears to be modulated by the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Elevation of circulating angiotensin II levels by sodium depletion or renal artery stenosis is associated with a diminished pressor response to infused angiotensin II (refs 1-3). Conversely, the vasocontrictor response to the hormone is enhanced when endogenous angiotensin II levels are reduced by sodium loading or nephrectomy. The mechanisms of these varying effects are not known, but physiological and pharmacological experiments suggest involvement of the vascular smooth receptor for angiotensin II (refs 5-8). Modification of the interaction between angiotensin II and its vascular receptor, resulting in altered responsiveness to the hormone, could occur either via 'prior occupancy' of receptors by elevated levels of endogenous angiotensin II resulting in fewer free receptors available to respond to circulating angiotensin II (ref. 5), or, elevated levels of angiotensin II could result in a decrease in receptor affinity for the hormone or a decrease in total receptor number in the vascular smooth muscle cell. We now report the first direct evidence, by radioligand binding assay, that angiotensin II regulates the number of its own receptors in resistance vasculature.", 
    "273": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by captopril on the release of a prostacyclin-like substance by bradykinin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II was studied by means of the blood-bathed bioassay technique of Vane. Administration of captopril abolished the release of prostacyclin-like substance induced by angiotensin I, potentiated the release provoked by bradykinin and did not alter that due to angiotensin II. Potentiation of the bradykinin-induced renal vasodilatation with captopril could be completely reversed by indomethacin, which also abolished the kinin-induced release of prostacyclin-like substance. Potentiation of the bradykinin-induced hypotension was markedly attenuated but not completely reversed by cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. It is suggested that following converting inhibition increased production of prostacyclin by elevated kinin levels may contribute to the antihypertensive action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "274": "The antihypertensive mechanism of orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225 (SQ), in low renin hypertension was investigated. In the SQ-responder with low renin hypertension, the hypotensive effect of SQ was abolished after the inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin (PG) synthesis with indomethacin, while no significant change in blood pressure was found in the SQ-responder with normal renin hypertension. These results suggest that SQ may potentiate the vasodilating PG system, contributing to the antihypertensive mechanism in SQ responders with low renin hypertension.", 
    "275": "1. The hypotensive response to captopril in anaesthetized spontanously hypertensive rats (SHR) is not modified by bilateral nephrectomy performed 1 or 24 h previously. 2. Intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of captopril (2 mg kg-1) significantly lowered blood pressure of conscious SHR over a 7-h period of observation but there was no significant blood pressure response to i.c.v. vehicle, or to intravenous captopril (2 mg kg-1) in SHR. 3. There was no significant blood pressure response to captopril (2 mg kg-1) i.c.v. in the normotensive Wistar Kyoto controls (NT-WK). 4. These results indicate that captopril can lower the blood pressure of SHR by mechanisms independent of the kidneys or the circulating renin-angiotensin system. 5. The hypotensive effect of central captopril in SHR but not in the NT-WK suggests biochemical differences between the brains of the two rat strains.", 
    "276": "1. The acute effects of captopril on blood pressure, renin, angiotensin, bradykinin and catecholamines were examined in patients with essential (n = 10, Group 1), accelerated (n = 6, Group 2) and renal hypertension (n = 14, Group 3). 2. Blood pressure showed little change in Group 1, fell significantly in Group 2, with a marked fall in Group 3. Heart rate did not change. 3. The fall in blood pressure was positively correlated with pretreatment renin and angiotensin II. 4. Angiotension II fell, with reciprocal increases in renin and angiotensin I. No changes occurred in bradykinin or catecholamines. 5. The rise in renin after captopril was greatest in renovascular hypertension which may prove useful as a screening test for such patients.", 
    "277": "1. Ten patients with mild essential hypertension and nine with severe treatment-resistant hypertension were treated with captopril. 2. Supine blood lpressure was controlled in 9/10 patients with mild hypertension (four with addition of propranolol). 3. There was no correlation between blood pressure fall and initial plasma renin concentration in patients with mild hypertension. 4. Captopril (plus diuretic and/or propranolol) controlled only 4/9 patients with severe hypertension. 5. Four patients developed reversible dysgeusia and one a skin rash.", 
    "278": "In a 25-year-old woman with malignant hypertension based on primary nephrosclerosis, captopril, an oral inhibitor of angiotension I-converting enzyme, lowered blood pressure effectively, which had been resistant previously to other oral antihypertensive drugs. Concomitantly with the decrease of the high blood pressure, an increase of creatinine from 2.1 mg% to 8.5 mg% occurred. There is evidence that this increase of renal failure is a consequence of blood pressure reduction and is not caused by a toxic effect of captopril.", 
    "279": "A patient with end-stage renal disease due to malignant hypertension is described. Hypertension was resistant to hemodialysis. The orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme captopril (SQ 14.255; 2-D-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-protein) dramatically lowered the elevated blood pressure both under ambulatory and dialysis conditions. No side effects were observed after 6 months' treatment. The effect of captopril could be described as a \"biochemical nephrectomy\".", 
    "280": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on arterial pressure, the components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and body sodium and potassium content was studied in eight hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis and, in conjunction with diuretics, in seven patients with hypertension unresponsive to previous treatment. Two hours after the first dose, captopril caused significant falls in systolic and diastolic pressures, plasma angiotensin II, and aldosterone, with converse increases in angiotensin I and both active and total renin; the initial fall in diastolic pressure was significantly related to the drop in plasma angiotensin II. The biochemical changes were sustained during prolonged treatment, even when diuretics were added. One untreated patient with renal artery occlusion had severe secondary aldosterone excess, was sodium and potassium depleted, and severely hyponatraemic and hypokalaemic; captopril restored blood pressure, plasma electrolyte concentrations, and exchangeable sodium and total body potassium to normal. In one man with renal artery stenosis and overall renal impairment captopril led to sodium retention, and blood pressure did not fall until a diuretic was added. In the remaining patients with renal artery stenosis, pretreatment renin, angio tensin II, and aldosterone concentrations were either normal or only modestly raised, and plasma electrolyte concentrations and body content of sodium and potassium were normal. Captopril alone controlled arterial pressure in all, three cases showing a gradual fall of pressure over the first six weeks of treatment; no significant changes in exchangeable sodium or total body potassium were seen. The group of patients with previously intractable hypertension were all controlled with a combination of captopril and diuretic.", 
    "281": "Captopril was given for treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with diuretics to 32 patients for 1- to 4-mo periods. The decrement of mean blood pressure after 1 and 2 mo correlated with pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and the response of blood pressure to infusion of an angiotensin II antagonist. These correlations were no longer apparent after 4 mo of treatment. When subjects with a decrement of mean blood pressure that exceeded 13 mm Hg were compared with nonresponders, responders not only had higher control PRA and higher PRA at 1 mo of treatment, but also had decreased plasma aldosterone levels, decreased urinary aldosterone excretion, and increased serum postassium levels that persisted over the 4 mo of observation. The reduction of plasma aldosterone correlated with the fall of mean blood pressure. Urinary kallikrein, catecholamines, electrolytes, and endogenous creatinine clearance did not change in response to treatment. These findings indicate that the antihypertenisve activity of captopril on long-term administration probably depends in part on the blockade of angiotensin II, but other mechanisms cannot be excluded.", 
    "282": "Evidence is presented implicating the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of plasma erythropoietin concentration. Male and female rats were exposed to hypoxia at 0.43 atm for 8 hr. In male rats, individual erythropoietin values showed a positive correlation with renin, renin substrate, and angiotensin I after 8 hr of hypoxia. In female rats, renin was not elevated during hypoxia. However, after renin was injected subcutaneously, plasma renin values became similar to those in male rats and erythropoietin doubled. Individual erythropoietin values of the combined groups showed a positive correlation with plasma renin. A single oral dose of SQ 14225, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduced erythropoietin to undetectable levels in renin-injected female rats. Angiotensin II, in subpressor amounts, prevented the suppression of erythropoietin by SQ 14225. SQ 14225 also reduced renin substrate concentration at ambient pressure and during hypoxic exposure. The correlation coefficient between renin substrate and erythropoietin in rats given SQ 14225 to lower substrate or angiotensin II to increase substrate was 0.85; p < 0.0005. The increase in renin substrate that occurred during hypoxia in female rats given angiotensin II correlated positively with erythropoietin, r = 0.86; p < 0.0005.", 
    "283": "A simple assay for the measurement of renin concentration and renin substrate concentration in microliter quantities of rat plasma is described. In the plasma renin concentration assay 5 microliter of rat plasma was incubated for 2 hr at 37 degrees C in the presence of 20 microliter renin substrate (plasma from nephrectomized rats) and 5 microliter inhibitor-buffer solution pH 7.4. At the end of the enzymic incubation the generated angiotensin I was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Angiotensin I antisera and iodinated angiotensin I were added to the same tube and left to equilibrate at 45 degrees C for 15 hr. EDTA, dimercaprol, and 8-hydroxyquinoline were used to inhibit converting enzymes and angiotensinases. Reproducibility of the assay was good, and recovery of added angiotensin I complete. The normal range of plasma renin in rats was between 7 and 15 pmol angiotensin l/ml/hr.", 
    "284": "1. In rats treated continuously with captopril (80 microgram/h, i.p.), for 2 days, blood pressure decreased and adrenal angiotensin II receptor concentration was decreased from 160 fmol/mg protein (s.e.m. = 9) in controls to 131 fmol/mg protein (s.e.m. 7, P < 0.01, n = 10). However, after 5 days of continuous treatment, blood pressure had returned to normal and adrenal receptor concentrations in treated rats were not significantly different from controls (180 fnol/mg, s.e.m. = 11 and 203 fmol/mg protein s.e.m. = 14 respectively, 0.1 > P > 0.05). 2. Vascular reactivity, defined as the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II, increased concurrently by 166 and 33% respectively. 3. In anaesthetized dogs (n = 8), captopril (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a fall in blood pressure, and uring bradykinin excretion increased from 1-08 (s.e.m. = 0.14) to 1.64 microgram/h (s.e.m. = 0.33, P < 0.025) at 15 min. Renal blood flow increased significantly (P < 0.01) with no change in glomerular filtration rate, and there was no change in either renal venous or arterial blood bradykinin levels. 4. Thus, converting enzyme inhibition produces transient secondary changes in angiotensin receptors and vascular reactivity. Increased urine bradykinin probably reflects decreased catabolism of intrarenal bradykinin. The hypotensive effect of captopril may be due in part to raised levels of bradykinin in the kidney.", 
    "285": "Dose-response curves of blood pressure and of the biochemical components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were determined during long-term treatment with captopril in 21 hypertensive patients. Captopril was given in biweekly, doubling doses starting with 25 mg 3 times a day until control of blood pressure was achieved or a total daily dosage of 600 mg was reached. Recumbent and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell on 75 mg captopril daily. Increasing the captopril dose did not induce further significant hypotensive effects. The pretreatment level of plasma renin activity (PRA) was a poor predictor of the hypotensive effect of captopril. The rises in PRA and plasma angiotensin I level (PA I) and the decrease in plasma angiotensin II level (PA II) and plasma aldosterone level (PAC) provide biochemical evidence for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in vivo. These effects were present on daily doses of 75 to 150 mg captopril.", 
    "286": "The angiotensin substrate analog Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Phe-Phe-Val-Tyr-Lys has no significant effect on blood pressure in sodium-replete monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) but blocks the pressor response to infused human renin. Pressor responses to angiotensin I and angiotensin II are not attenuated. In five studies in sodium-depleted monkeys, an infusion of 2 mg of the peptide per kg of body weight resulted in a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 105 +/- 4 to 79 +/- 3 mm Hg, which is not significantly different from the response to 1 mg of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide per kg. In uninephrectomized monkeys, inflation of a suprarenal aortic cuff caused an increase in MAP from 107 +/- 3 to 131 +/- 3 mm Hg. Infusion of 0.6 mg of the renin-inhibitory peptide per kg was followed by a return of blood pressure to 107 +/- 4 mm Hg--a depressor response similar to that observed with teprotide. This specific in vivo inhibitor of renin can now be applied to a wide variety of physiologic studies.", 
    "287": "We compared vascular and hormonal responses to teprotide (SQ 20,881) and captopril (SQ 14,225) in patients with normal renin essential hypertension given a 10 mEq sodium diet. In 10 patients receiving SQ 20,881, significant changes occurred in diastolic blood pressure (DBP, -13 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), angiotensin II (-7.1 +/- 2.1 pg/ml), and plasma renin activity (PRA, +6.6 +/- 1.9 ng/ml/hr) (p < 0.01 in all cases). Twenty-one patients receiving SQ 14,225 had significant changes in mean DBP (-18 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), angiotensin II (-6.6 +/- 1.5 pg/ml), and PRA (+7.8 +/- 2.4 ng/ml/hr) (all p values < 0.01). In spite of a significantly greater hypotensive response (p < 0.02), patients receiving SQ 14,225 showed increments in PRA and decrements in angiotensin II that did not differ significantly from those seen after SQ 20,881. Moreover, there was a significant change in plasma kinins in patients receiving SQ 20,881 (+2.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml, p < 0.01) but no change in kinins in patients receiving SQ 14,225 (0.0 +/- 0.1, ns). We conclude that there are important differences in the mechanism mediating the hypotensive response to SQ 20,881 and SQ 14,225 in normal renin essential hypertension.", 
    "288": "The effects of acute renovascular hypertension on the sympathetic nervous system, regional blood flow and cardiac function were studied in conscious dogs submitted to renal artery occlusion by inflation of a cuff implanted previously around one renal artery. We then compared the alterations in plasma renin and catecholamine levels and in the various hemodynamic parameters induced by those maneuvers in intact dogs, to those in dogs pretreated with alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Subsequently, the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide was administered to inhibit angiotensin formation in both experiments. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system contribute to the rise in blood pressure. The hemodynamic changes and alterations in regional blood flows accompanying this acute hypertension appear to be due mostly to the increase in plasma angiotensin, since prior adrenoceptor blockade only attenuated their magnitude but did not alter their direction. However, angiotensin-induced coronary vasoconstriction was observed only in adrenergically blocked but not intact animals, probably because of the protective effect of baroreceptor-mediated reflex sympathetic coronary vasodilation.", 
    "289": "The present survey paper, concerning newer drugs used in the treatment of arterial hypertension, deals with the following types of agents: centrally acting drugs, such as clonidine nd alpha-methyl-DOPA; vasodilator drugs with a direct action on smooth muscle, such as minoxidil; diuretic agents, with special reference to the choice of a drug from the vast number of compounds; beta-sympatholytic drugs (beta blockers) and which drug to choose; prazosin, with special reference to its considerable theoretical interest; drugs that influence the renin-angiotensin system, such as saralasin (P 113), an angiotensin II-antagonist; and inhibitors of the converting enzyme, such as teprotide (SQ 20,881) and captopril (SQ 14,225). Finally, a general schedule for the treatment of hypertension, issued as a guideline by the Dutch Institution of General Practitioners, is presented.", 
    "290": "Treatment of pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats with captopril (SQ 14225) caused a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), which lasted for over 1 h when a dose of 5 mg/kg i.p was used. Pretreatment with the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors indometacin (IND, 5 mg/kg i.p.) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 100 mg/kg i.p.) did not prevent the initial decrease in MAP after captopril. However, the recovery of the MAP was much faster than after captopril alone. In rats pretreated with IND, the MAP after captopril was significantly higher than after captopril alone from 30 min onwards. With ASA pretreatment the same was observed after 45 min. These data indicate that the subacute blood pressure lowering effect of captopril in pentobarbital-anaesthetized normotensive rats may be at least partly dependent on the presence on an intact prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway. This may be due to activation of prostaglandin synthesis by the accumulation of bradykinin and angiotensin I after captopril.", 
    "291": "A convincing response to the orally administered angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225) in a severe hyper-reninaemic hypertensive patient resistant to other forms of treatment is described. The use of this drug in accelerated severe hypertension with impending organ damage is suggested during the early phase of treatment.", 
    "292": "The effects of captopril administered intravenously in a dose of 1 mg/kg on systemic blood pressure (SBP), renal blood flow (RBF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were examined in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Untreated dogs were used in experiments in which the renal artery remained intact and others in which the renal artery was partially occluded (RAO). Captopril significantly decreased SBP, increased RBF and decreased RVR in untreated dogs. RAO induced an increase in arterial plasma renin activity and this increase was accompanied by an increase in RVR in the contralateral kidney and rise in SBP. During RAO, captopril induced qualitatively similar, but greater decreases in SBP and RVR of the contralateral kidney compared with those in the untreated dogs. These results suggest the vasodilator effect of captopril depends on the background level of angiotensin II and the enhanced effect would be expected under conditions such as RAO where circulating angiotensin II contributes to vascular tone.", 
    "293": "Angiotensin II exerts an inhibitory influence on active renin release from the kidney. To assess a possible role for angiotensin II in the release of inactive renin, levels in the circulation were measured before and at regular intervals after the administration of captopril, an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin I-coverting enzyme, to 12 salt-replete and six salt-deplete normal subjects. Concurrent measurements of active renin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II were also performed. Basal inactive renin in the salt-deplete group was increased compared with the salt-replete subjects, but inactive renin remained constant in both groups after treatment with captopril. There were significant increases in concentrations of both active renin and angiotensin I after treatment with captopril in all subject and corresponding decreases in angiotensin II. These results suggested that angiotensin II does not influence the release of inactive renin, in contrast with its role in the release of active renin.", 
    "294": "Captopril, an orally active dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase inhibitor, is a promising new antihypertensive agent. Cutaneous reactions are the most common side effects of this therapy. The data from 15 previous cases and seven new ones are reviewed. The cutaneous eruptions appear to be pharmacologic. In nature, occurring mostly at higher dosage schedules and resolving at lower dosage levels. Historical data, the results of skin tests, and the known pharmacology of captpril suggest that these captopril-induced eruptions may be the result of potentiation of kinin-mediated cutaneous reactions.", 
    "295": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is being evaluated as an antihypertensive agent. We report on a patient who developed the nephrotic syndrome while on captopril 450 mg/d. Her urinary protein excretion was 5-7 g/24 h, plasma albumin concentration was 25 g/l, plasma cholesterol was 16,2 mmol/l, and she had oedema. Renal biopsy showed subepithelial deposits on the basement membrane.", 
    "296": "Proteinuria developed in six of 81 hypertensive patients given captopril for at least four months (protein excretion, greater than 200 mg/24 hr). Two had previously elevated protein excretion. In all patients the increased protein excretion occurred by the fourth month of treatment. It subsided in four after two to nine months, despite continued therapy. In two of the four, proteinuria cleared completely within seven months after onset, while in the other two it subsided to the range of 600 mg/24 hr. However, in the remaining two patients proteinuria persisted during captopril therapy and was associated with hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia. Renal biopsy specimens showed mild membranous nephropathy in two patients, one of whom had a remittance of proteinuria during continued captopril treatment.", 
    "297": "10 patients with severe refractory hypertension were treated with captopril and frusemide. All patients had uncontrolled blood pressure (mean arterial pressure > 140 mm Hg), and 7 had developed accelerated hypertension despite maximum conventional treatment. Captopril and frusemide controlled blood pressure in all 10 patients, without side effects in 9. There was a significant rise in plasma-potassium in 9 patients (1 mmol/l), and hyperkalaemia (plasma-potassium > 6 mmol/l) developed in 3 patients despite coincident treatment with frusemide.", 
    "298": "The converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in a dose of 450 mg daily, was given together with a diuretic to eleven patients with severe hypertension unresponsive to previous therapy. Sustained control of blood pressure was achieved. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone fell significantly, whereas plasma active and total renin, and blood-angiotensin-I concentrations increased. Adverse effects included temporary taste disturbance, tachycardia, nephrotic syndrome, and possible drug-induced Guillain-Barr\u00e9 neuropathy. The combination of captopril and diuretic is thus very effective in controlling refractory hypertension. However, because of the frequency and severity of side-effects it should probably be used only in patients whose blood pressure has previously been uncontrolled by other means.", 
    "299": "Orally active converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril, SQ 14225) was administered in a dose of 50 mg to 12 normotensive subjects (Group I), 26 essential hypertensive patients (Group II) and 8 renovascular hypertensive patients (Group III). In Group III, 5 of 8 patients had control plasma renin activity (PRA) similar to those in Group I and II patients, but the PRA response to the administration of Captopril was greater in 7 of 8 patients than that in Groups I and II. These 7 patients had either bilateral or unilateral main renal artery stenosis. Captopril caused no increase in PRA in the remaining 1 who had unilateral renal artery stenosis with contralateral renal aplasia. It is concluded that this provocation test is useful as a screening procedure for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "300": "In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, intraxerebroventricular injection of captopril (2 mg/kg) resulted in a rapid hypotensive response that lasted several hours. The same dose given by intracerebroventricular injection had no significant effect on blood pressure (BP) of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WK) rats over 7 hours. There was no significant change in BP of conscious spontaneously hpertensive rats (SHR) in response to intracerebroventricular injection of vehicle and only a transitory fall in BP in response to intravenous injection of captopril (2 mg/kg). There was no significant differences between plasma renin activity (PRA) of conscious normotensive WKY rats and the PRA of SHR. These results suggest biochemical differences between the brains of SHR and normotensive WKY control rats. These differences could involve the brain renin-angiotensin system or other neuropeptides.", 
    "301": "We studied the control of renin release and renal hemodynamic function by administering prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors to conscious sodium-depleted dogs with blockade of the adrenergic nervous system induced by bilateral renal denervation and propranolol administration. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg) reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) by 59% from a high sodium-depleted value, but PRA was still 3 times the normal sodium-repleted level. Arterial pressure, CCr, CPAH, urine flow, and potassium excretion fell strikingly. Similar results were obtained with meclofenamate. When SQ 14,225 was given to another group of conscious, sodium-depleted dogs with adrenergic nervous system blockade, PRA increased from the high sodium-depleted level of 5.7 to 29.3 ng of Angiotensin I (AI)/ml per hour; indomethacin (10 mg/kg) appeared to reduce PRA (0.05 less than P less than 0.1) but to only 12.1 ng of AI/ ml per hour, which is 17 times the normal level. This high level of PRA after blockade of the adrenergic nervous system and injection of indomethacin suggests that important mechanisms other than norepinephrine and renal prostaglandins control renin release; it is proposed that both the renal vascular receptor and the macula densa are involved. The marked decreases in CCr and CPAH in response to indomethacin emphasize the important role of renal prostaglandins in the control of renal hemodynamic function during sodium depletion.", 
    "302": "There is increased activity of the renin, angiotensin, aldosterone (RAA) system in infancy and childhood. An inverse relationship between plasma renin, aldosterone and age has been demonstrated. In childhood hypertension due to renovascular disease or pyelonephritic scarring peripheral plasma renin is increased. Renal vein renin measurements in children with renal hypertension have proved valuable in predicting surgical curability of the underlying lesion. The upper limit of normal for the renal venous renin ratio in normotensive children without renal disease is 1.5. Pharmacological blockade of the RAA system has a place in diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive children. The plasma renin aldosterone profile is diagnostically useful in the investigation of salt-wasting disease and can easily distinguish between aldosterone biosynthetic defects and pseudohypoaldosteronism.", 
    "303": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the secretion of aldosterone during restriction of dietary sodium intake. Rats were kept on control or low-sodium diet for one week. On the 7th morning of diet osmotic minipumps filled with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) SQ 20,881, or empty pumps, were implanted subcutaneously (sc). The rats were sacrificed 23 h later. Peripheral blood was analyzed for hormones and electrolytes. Adrenal capsular tissue (z. glomerulosa) was incubated for the determination of the conversion of [3H]corticosterone to [3H]aldosterone. Sodium depletion had no effect on plasma sodium, but it increased potassium concentration. Infusion of CEI had no significant effect on plasma electrolytes. Plasma renin activity was increased both by sodium depletion and CEI. The mean serum aldosterone level was twelve times higher in sodium depleted animals than in controls. Aldosterone level was reduced by about 60 per cent in CEI-infused animals both on control and low-sodium diet. The conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone was significantly stimulated by sodium deprivation. This effect was also inhibited by the CEI SQ 20,881.", 
    "304": "We review information on the renal response to converting enzyme inhibition, and attempt to evaluate the evidence that a reduction in angiotensin II formation is responsible for the renal response. There is little response to converting enzyme inhibitors in animals or man when the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed by a literal sodium intake. With restriction of sodium intake, an increase in renal blood flow occurs; because a quantitatively similar response occurs to the angiotensin II analogs it is likely that the response reflects reversal of the local action of angiotensin II. In other settings it is not yet clear whether the renal response to converting enzyme inhibitor reflects only a reduction in angiotensin II formation or an additional action such as potentiation of the local actions of bradykinin or enhanced prostaglandin formation. Because these agents induce a potentiated increase in renal blood flow in the patient with essential hypertension, and with it an increase in glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion in some patients, despite a fall in arterial pressure these questions have considerable importance."
