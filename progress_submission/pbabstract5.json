Rats were fed a high fat diet and treated with a low dose of streptozotocin to create models of diet induced obesity or type 2 diabetes, respectively. Afterwards, rats were transferred to a normal diet or treated with enalapril or dietary enrichment with menhaden oil for 12 weeks. Obesity and to a greater extent type 2 diabetes were associated with impaired glucose utilization and peripheral neuropathy. Placing obese rats on a normal diet improved glucose utilization. Steatosis but not peripheral neuropathy was improved after placing obese or diabetic rats on a normal diet. Treating obese and diabetic rats with enalapril or a menhaden oil enriched diet generally improved peripheral neuropathy endpoints. In summary, dietary improvement with weight loss in obese or type 2 diabetic rats was not sufficient to correct peripheral neuropathy. These results further stress the need for discovery of a comprehensive treatment for peripheral neuropathy.", 
    "1": "The aim of the study was to develop a new chewable benazepril hydrochloride(BH) tablet, investigate its physical properties, and evaluate its bioequivalence with the branded formulation (Fortekor). A corrective agent was included in the formula to improve its palatability and convenience for administration to dogs. The tablet remained stable in light, heat, and humidity tests, and its physical properties such as hardness, uniformity of content, and dissolution rate were highly consistent with the technical standards. After single and repeated administrations to eight beagles and single dose to 14 mongrel dogs (0.5 mg/kg p.o.), plasma BH and its active metabolite, benazeprilat (BZ), were detected. There was no significant difference in the major pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax , Tmax, and AUC\u2080\u208b\u2082\u2084) between the two formulations. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for the ratios of area under the time-concentration curve (AUC\u2080\u208b\u2082\u2084) were 92.4-116.3% for BH and 89.9-102.3% for BZ, within the accepted range for bioequivalence of 80-125%.

At first manganese titanate nanoceramics were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The structural evaluations of the pure nanopowders were investigated by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then it was used to prepare a new nanostructured manganese titanate carbon paste electrode (MnTiO3/CPE).

A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 76 017 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged 40 to 80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2005. Cases were the 622 patients who experienced hospitalization for HF from initial prescription until 2012. Up to 5 controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the HF risk associated with adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which was measured by the proportion of days covered by treatment (PDC). Data were adjusted for several covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for possible sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with very low adherence (PDC, \u226425%), low, intermediate, and high adherences were associated with progressively lower risk of HF, reduction in the high-adherence group (>75%) being 34% (95% confidence interval, 17%-48%). Similar effects were observed in younger (40-70 years) and older (71-80 years) patients and between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. There was no evidence that adherence with calcium-channel blockers reduced the HF risk.

We report here that LPS downregulates Thy-1 gene expression by activating histone deacetylases (HDACs) via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Treatment of primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with LPS resulted in significant upregulation of TLR4 and enhanced cell proliferation that was abolished by silencing TLR4 with lentivirus-delivered TLR4 shRNA. Interestingly, LPS increased the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC-4, -5, and -7, an effect that was abrogated by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or TLR4-shRNA-lentivirus. Consistent with these findings, Ace-H3 and Ace-H4 were decreased by LPS that was prevented by TSA. Most importantly, chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that LPS decreased the association of Ace-H4 at the Thy-1 promoter region that was efficiently restored by pretreatment with TSA. Accordingly, LPS decreased the mRNA and protein levels of Thy-1 that was inhibited by TSA. Furthermore, silencing the Thy-1 gene by lentivirus-delivered Thy-1 shRNA could promote lung fibroblast proliferation, even in the absence of LPS. Conversely, overexpressing Thy-1 gene could inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and reduce LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation. Our data suggest that LPS upregulates and activates HDACs through TLR4, resulting in deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the Thy-1 gene promoter that may contribute to Thy-1 gene silencing and lung fibroblast proliferation.",

By employing the efficient separation of intact proteins, affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) can measure the interaction of components of heterogeneous proteins with a target protein. In this work, the hyphenation of ACE with mass spectrometry (MS) is presented as a novel, highly selective tool for the assessment of protein-protein interactions. The binding of the protease inhibitor aprotinin to trypsinogen was used as protein-protein affinity model. A trypsinogen sample comprising several modifications was analyzed using a background electrolyte of 25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) containing increasing concentrations of aprotinin (0-300 \u03bcM). A capillary coating of polybrene-dextran sulfate-polybrene (PB-DS-PB) was employed to prevent adsorption of the proteins to the capillary wall. The trypsinogen variants were separated and could be assigned based on detected molecular masses and relative migration. In presence of aprotinin, both free and aprotinin-bound trypsinogen were detected revealing a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. For most trypsinogen variants, shifts in electrophoretic mobility were observed upon raising the aprotinin concentration, allowing determination of their dissociation constants (Kd's). The interacting trypsinogen variants showed similar affinity toward aprotinin (Kd's of 3-9 \u03bcM), which were not significantly different from the values obtained with ACE-UV and were in agreement with an earlier reported value. The use of the ratio of obtained MS signal intensities of free and protein-protein complex for the determination of Kd's was also explored. Derived Kd values (20-104 \u03bcM) for the binding variants were similar to those obtained with direct-infusion MS, but higher and less precise as compared with values based on mobility shifts. The suitability of the ACE-MS methodology for the affinity profiling of heterogeneous protein samples was evaluated, and components with high, medium, or low affinity toward aprotinin could be successfully discriminated.",

When unsalted Jameed was prepared by solar or freeze drying, additional major peptide bands were detected by SDS-PAGE treatments as compared to the solar or freeze drying of the salted Jameed. Use of salt in the preparation of solar dried Jameed also led to the highest ACE inhibitory activities whereas antioxidant activity was lowest in unsalted solar dried Jameed.

With the advent of high-throughput omics technologies, researchers set out to systematically study the disease on a molecular level. Results of the first omics studies were mainly focused on reporting the highest deregulated molecules between diseased and healthy subjects with recent attempts to integrate findings of multiple studies on the level of molecular pathways and processes.

However, recent data from a large randomized controlled trial compared the novel agent LCZ696, a dual-acting angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), with the well established angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and found significant reduction in mortality among the chronic reduced ejection fraction HF population. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that neprilysin inhibition provides beneficial outcomes in HF patients by preventing the degradation of natriuretic peptides and thereby promoting natriuresis and vasodilatation and counteracting the negative cardiorenal effects of the up-regulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Agents such as omapatrilat combined neprilysin and ACE inhibition but had increased rates of angioedema. Goals of an improved safety profile provided the rationale for the development of the ARNi LCZ696. Along with significant reductions in mortality and hospitalizations, clinical trials suggest that LCZ696 may improve surrogate markers of HF severity.

A chronic state of inflammation appears to be a central mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and MetS. In this review, we summarize recent research which has provided insight into the mechanisms by which inflammation underlies the pathophysiology of the individual components of MetS including visceral adiposity, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. On the basis of these mechanisms, we summarize therapeutic modalities to target inflammation in the MetS and its individual components. Current therapeutic modalities can modulate the individual components of MetS and have a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Lifestyle modifications including exercise, weight loss, and diets high in fruits, vegetables, fiber, whole grains, and low-fat dairy and low in saturated fat and glucose are recommended as a first line therapy. The Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension diets are especially beneficial and have been shown to prevent development of MetS. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with reductions in total and cardiovascular mortality. Omega-3 fatty acids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 agonists lower high levels of triglyceride; their role in targeting inflammation is reviewed.

    "55": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy plays a major role in morbidity and mortality among cardiovascular disorder-related complications. This study was designed to explore long-term benefits of Levosimendan (LEVO) along with Ramipril and Insulin. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) at the dose of 25\u2009mg/kg/body weight/day for three consecutive days in Wistar rats. Rats were randomly divided into 10 groups and treatments were started after 2 weeks of STZ administration. A gradual but severe hyperglycemia ((\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7)p\u2009<\u20090.001) was observed in all STZ-treated groups except those received insulin (2\u2009\u2009U/day). LEVO alone and in combination with Ramipril and Insulin normalized (**p\u2009<\u20090.01) mean arterial pressure and heart rate, restored catalase, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione level and also attenuated (***p\u2009<\u20090.001) the raised serum levels of creatine kinase-heart type, lactate dehydrogenase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and caspase-3 level in heart tissue altered after STZ treatment. Myofibril degeneration, mitochondrial fibrosis and vacuolization occurred after STZ treatment, were also reversed by LEVO in combination with Ramipril and Insulin. The combination of LEVO with Ramipril and Insulin improved hemodynamic functions, maintained cardiac enzymes and ameliorated myofibril damage in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "56": "Our recent publication showed that a small bioactive pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) peptide (P78-PEDF) prevents the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, its effects on the progression of established DN were not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of P78-PEDF in the progression of DN and to compare the effects of P78-PEDF and an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), a standard of care in DN. Experiments were conducted in Ins2(Akita) mice treated with P78-PEDF or captopril starting at 6 wks of age for 12 wks (early treatment) or starting at 12 wks of age for 6 wks (late treatment). We first established the optimal dose of the P78-PEDF peptide to ameliorate DN in Ins2(Akita) mouse for a 6 wk study period and found that the peptide was effective at 0.1- 0.5 \u00b5g/g/day. We next showed that early or late treatment with P78-PEDF resulted in protection from DN as indicated by reduced albuminuria, kidney macrophage recruitment, histological changes, inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic markers (kidney TNF-\u03b1, fibronectin, VEGFA and EGFR), and restored nephrin expression compared with vehicle-treated Ins2(Akita) mice. Interestingly, only early but not late treatment with captopril was as effective as P78-PEDF in reducing most DN complications, despite its lack of effect on nephrin, VEGFA and EGFR expression. These findings highlight the importance of P78-PEDF peptide as a potential therapeutic modality in both the development and progression of diabetic renal injury.", 
    "57": "The authors investigated the differences in office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) among major antihypertensive drug classes and among frequently used drugs in each class in 22,617 patients treated with monotherapy from the Spanish ABPM Registry. Using thiazides as the reference group, patients treated with calcium channel blockers have significantly (P<.01) elevated ambulatory BP and less ambulatory control after adjusting for confounders. Inside each class, no significant differences were observed among thiazides or angiotensin receptor blockers. Atenolol and bisoprolol among \u03b2-blockers, amlodipine among calcium channel blockers, and lisinopril and enalapril among angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exhibited lower ambulatory BP and better control than other agents. Differences exist among antihypertensive drug classes and among different compounds in each class with respect to ambulatory BP control. This can help physicians choose among drug classes and among compounds in each class if BP reduction is the main objective of treatment.",

Metoprolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol and atenolol are selective beta-blockers frequently used in the management of arterial hypertension, alone or in fixed combination with other substances. This study presents the most used analytical methods for simultaneous determination in biological fluids of fixed combinations containing selective beta-blockers. Articles in Pub-Med, Science Direct and Wiley Journals databases published between years 2004-2014 were reviewed. Methods such as liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry--mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or high performance liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) were used for determination of fixed combination with beta-blockers in human plasma, rat plasma and human breast milk. LC-MS/MS method was used for simultaneous determination of fixed combinations of metoprolol with simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide or ramipril, combinations of nebivolol and valsartan, or atenolol and amlodipine. Biological samples were processed by protein precipitation techniques or by liquid-liquid extraction. For the determination of fixed dose combinations of felodipine and metoprolol in rat plasma liquid chromatography--electrospray ionization--mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was applied, using phenacetin as internal standard. HPLC-MS method was applied for the determination of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma. For the determination of atenolol and chlorthalidone from human breast milk and human plasma the HPLC method was used. The analytical methods were validated according to the specialized guidelines, and were applied to biological samples, thing that confirms the permanent concern of researchers in this field.",

Third generation beta-blockers improved FMD in a statistically significant manner compared with second generation beta-blockers (MD 1.65; 95% CI 0.17-3.11; p = 0.03). Beta-blockers gave an FMD change similar to that obtained with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB) or hydrochlorothiazide. The FMD value in the beta-blocker group was significantly lower compared with the group treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (MD -0.79; 95% CI -1.37-(-0.21); p = 0.008) and higher than in the ivabradine group (1.6 \u00b1 3.61 vs -0.3 \u00b1 1.66; p = 0.02).",

    "63": "Although renin is a critical regulatory enzyme of the cardiovascular system, its roles in organogenesis and the establishment of cardiovascular homeostasis remain unclear. Mammalian renin-expressing cells are widespread in embryonic kidneys but are highly restricted, specialized endocrine cells in adults. With a functional pronephros, embryonic zebrafish are ideal for delineating the developmental functions of renin-expressing cells and the mechanisms governing renin transcription. Larval zebrafish renin expression originates in the mural cells of the juxtaglomerular anterior mesenteric artery and subsequently at extrarenal sites. The role of renin was determined by assessing responses to renin-angiotensin system blockade, salinity variation, and renal perfusion ablation. Renin expression did not respond to renal flow ablation but was modulated by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and altered salinity. Our data in larval fish are consistent with conservation of renin's physiological functions. Using transgenic renin reporter fish, with mindbomb and cloche mutants, we show that Notch signaling and the endothelium are essential for developmental renin expression. After inhibition of angiogenesis, renin-expressing cells precede angiogenic sprouts. Arising from separate lineages, but relying on mutual interplay with endothelial cells, renin-expressing cells are among the earliest mural cells observed in larval fish, performing both endocrine and paracrine functions.",

    "69": "Hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium concentrations elevated above the upper limit of normal (> 5.0 mEq/L). It has become more common in cardiovascular practice due to the growing population of patients with chronic kidney disease and the broad application of drugs that modulate renal elimination of potassium by reducing production of angiotensin II (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists), blocking angiotensin II receptors (angiotensin receptor blockers), or antagonizing the action of aldosterone on mineralocorticoid receptors (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). The risk of hyperkalemia is a major limiting factor for the use of these disease-modifying drugs in both acute and chronic cardiorenal syndromes. Thus, agents to control the plasma concentration of potassium are needed in the multidrug treatment of cardiorenal disease, including chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and acute kidney injury. Novel oral therapies in development for both acute and extended use in the management of hyperkalemia include patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Important biochemical differences between these compounds result in unique product profiles and electrolyte outcomes in patients treated for hyperkalemia. This review highlights the major mechanisms of hyperkalemia and key results from randomized trials in a range of clinical scenarios in patients with, and at risk for, hyperkalemia.",

However, the negative functions of ovomucoid can be eliminated if the protein is cut into small peptides. The objectives of this study were to hydrolyze ovomucoid using various enzyme combinations, and compare the functional properties of the hydrolysates. Purified ovomucoid was dissolved in distilled water (20 mg/mL) and treated with 1% of pepsin, \u03b1-chymotrypsin, papain, and alcalase, singly or in combinations. Sodium sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) results of the hydrolysates indicated that pepsin (OMP), alcalase (OMAl), alcalase+trypsin (OMAlTr), and alcalase+papain (OMAlPa) treatments best hydrolyzed the ovomucoid, and the 4 treatments were selected to determine their functional characteristics. Among the 4 enzyme treatments, hydrolysate from OMAlTr showed the highest iron-chelating and antioxidant activities, while OMP showed higher ACE-inhibitory activity, but lower Fe-chelating activity than the other treatments. However, no difference in the copper-chelating activity among the treatments was found. MS/MS analysis identified numerous peptides from the hydrolysates of OMAlPa and OMAlTr, and majority of the peptides produced were <2 kDa. Pepsin treatment (OMP), however, hydrolyzed ovomucoid almost completely and produced only amino acid monomers, di- and tri-peptides. The ACE-inhibitory, antioxidant and iron-chelating activities of the enzyme hydrolysates were not consistent with the number and size of peptides in the hydrolysates, but we do not have information about the quantity of each peptide present in the hydrolysates at this point.",

L-Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was previously shown to be a potent inhibitor of the DapE from Haemophilus influenzae (HiDapE) with an IC50 of 3.3 \u03bcM and a measured Ki of 1.8 \u03bcM and displayed a dose-responsive antibiotic activity toward Escherichia coli. L-Captopril is also a competitive inhibitor of NmDapE with a Ki of 2.8 \u03bcM. To examine the nature of the interaction of L-captopril with the dinuclear active site of DapE, we have obtained electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) data for the enzymatically hyperactive Co(II)-substituted forms of both HiDapE and NmDapE. EPR and MCD data indicate that the two Co(II) ions in DapE are antiferromagnetically coupled, yielding an S = 0 ground state, and suggest a thiolate bridge between the two metal ions. Verification of a thiolate-bridged dinuclear complex was obtained by determining the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of NmDapE in complex with L-captopril at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. Combination of these data provides new insights into binding of L-captopril to the active site of DapE enzymes as well as important inhibitor-active site residue interaction's. Such information is critical for the design of new, potent inhibitors of DapE enzymes.",

Twenty-one SHRs aged 60.5\u00b10.25 weeks were investigated over 22 weeks. They were divided into the following three groups (7 per group): untreated controls (CTRL), treatment with captopril (CAP, 60\u2009mg kg(-1) daily) and treatment with captopril plus nifedipine (CAP+NIF, 60+10\u2009mg kg(-1) daily). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was regularly measured using the tail cuff method, and an echocardiogram was repeatedly obtained to examine the LV systolic and diastolic area, LV systolic fractional area change, cardiac output and LV myocardial wall thickness. Finally, heart catheterization was performed. While SBP remained stable in the CTRL animals over the experimental period, both of the antihypertensive treatments significantly reduced SBP by 20% in the treated animals (P<0.001). Echocardiography demonstrated that both the systolic and the diastolic LV function of the untreated SHRs deteriorated over time, whereas both types of antihypertensive treatments attenuated and delayed but did not completely prevent the decline in LV systolic function. Cardiac output, as determined by pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography, remained significantly higher in the treated animals than in CTRLs until week 20, but it then decreased. Heart catheterization showed a significant decrease in LV function, as reflected by the LV systolic pressure and contractility, in the CTRLs but not in treated animals. These findings clearly indicate that late-onset antihypertensive treatment with CAP or CAP+NIF is beneficial with respect to blood pressure reduction, LV hypertrophy attenuation and LV systolic function preservation.",

Blood glucose levels increased from normoglycemic to hyperglycemic levels after treatment of STZ in Dahl S rats. Chronic treatment of Dahl-STZ rats with luseogliflozin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) increased the fractional excretion of glucose and normalized blood glucose and HbA1c levels.

Combination therapy reduced blood pressure more than that seen in the rats treated with luseogliflozin or lisinopril alone. Dahl-STZ rats exhibited hyperfiltration, mesangial matrix expansion, severe progressive proteinuria, focal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Control of hyperglycemia with luseogliflozin reduced the degree of hyperfiltration and renal injury but had no effect on blood pressure or the development of proteinuria. Treatment with lisinopril reduced hyperfiltration, proteinuria and renal injury in Dahl-STZ rats. Combination therapy afforded greater renoprotection than administration of either drug alone.

Activation of AT2 and ACE2 reportedly counteracts proinflammatory effects of ANG II. However, the possible interaction between AT2 and ACE2 has never been established. We hypothesized that activation of AT2 increases ACE2 activity, thereby preventing TNF-\u03b1-stimulated ICAM-1 expression via inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. Human coronary artery endothelial cells were pretreated with AT2 antagonist PD123319 (PD) or ACE2 inhibitor DX600 and then stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 in the presence or absence of AT2 agonist CGP42112 (CGP). We found that AT2 agonist CGP increased both ACE2 protein expression and activity. This effect was blunted by AT2 antagonist PD. ICAM-1 expression was very low in untreated cells but greatly increased by TNF-\u03b1. Activation of AT2 with agonist CGP or with ANG II under concomitant AT1 antagonist reduced TNF-\u03b1-induced ICAM-1 expression, which was reversed by AT2 antagonist PD or ACE2 inhibitor DX600 or knockdown of ACE2 with small interfering RNA. AT2 activation also suppressed TNF-\u03b1-stimulated phosphorylation of inhibitory \u03baB (p-I\u03baB) and NF-\u03baB activity. Inhibition of ACE2 reversed the inhibitory effect of AT2 on TNF-\u03b1-stimulated p-I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB activity. Our findings suggest that stimulation of AT2 reduces TNF-\u03b1-stimulated ICAM-1 expression, which is partly through ACE2-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling.",

It is classified as mild (SBP 140-149 and DBP 90-99 mmHg), moderate (SBP 150-159 and DBP 100-109 mmHg) and severe (SBP \u2265 160 and DBP \u2265 110 mmHg). PIH refers to one of four conditions: a) pre-existing hypertension, b) gestational hypertension and preeclampsia (PE), c) pre-existing hypertension plus superimposed gestational hypertension with proteinuria and d) unclassifiable hypertension. PIH is a major cause of maternal, fetal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Women with PIH are at a greater risk of abruptio placentae, cerebrovascular events, organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Fetuses of these mothers are at greater risk of intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity and intrauterine death. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a period of 24 h seems to have a role in predicting deterioration from gestational hypertension to PE. Antiplatelet drugs have moderate benefits when used for prevention of PE. Treatment of PIH depends on blood pressure levels, gestational age, presence of symptoms and associated risk factors. Non-drug management is recommended when SBP ranges between 140-149 mmHg or DBP between 90-99 mmHg. Blood pressure thresholds for drug management in pregnancy vary between different health organizations. According to 2013 ESH/ESC guidelines, antihypertensive treatment is recommended in pregnancy when blood pressure levels are \u2265 150/95 mmHg. Initiation of antihypertensive treatment at values \u2265 140/90 mmHg is recommended in women with a) gestational hypertension, with or without proteinuria, b) pre-existing hypertension with the superimposition of gestational hypertension or c) hypertension with asymptomatic organ damage or symptoms at any time during pregnancy. Methyldopa is the drug of choice in pregnancy. Atenolol and metoprolol appear to be safe and effective in late pregnancy, while labetalol has an efficacy comparable to methyldopa. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists are contraindicated in pregnancy due to their association with increased risk of fetopathy.",

Therefore, to assess the effects of Japanese practical guidelines for DMD, we distributed a survey questionnaire to certified neurologists and child neurologists in Japan. The survey revealed the actual state of medical care for patients with DMD in Japan prior to publication of guidelines. Many pediatric patients visited academic medical centers (AMCs) and general hospitals (GHs). In contrast, adult patients visited mainly National Hospital Organization (NHO) hospitals and other hospitals that can manage cardiopulmonary care and inpatient therapy. Medical insurance approval for steroid therapy was well known by subjects surveyed. Beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were widely used as cardioprotective agents. However, the rates of obtaining written informed consent before genetic testing, regular radiological testing for scoliosis, usage of mechanical-assisted cough, disaster response plan instruction for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and management of patients with female dystrophinopathy were below satisfactory. More than 20% of doctors surveyed practiced or recommended muscle strengthening training. Although the details of the training were not specified, this may indicate overuse of resistance training exercises. Our goal is to promote an educational campaign to better disseminate best practice care and clinical guidelines. We plan to conduct another round of surveys in several years to assess the effects of the clinical guidelines.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of captopril on dRib\u2011induced damage in pancreatic \u03b2\u2011cells, as well as to determine the mechanisms underlying these effects. Treatment with dRib increased the levels of cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species in Syrian hamster insulinoma HIT\u2011T15 cells; however, pretreatment with captopril significantly inhibited the effects of dRib. The intracellular levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were depleted following treatment with dRib; however, these levels were restored following HIT\u2011T15 cell treatment with captopril. In rat islets, dRib stimulation suppressed the mRNA expression levels of insulin, and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1, as well as insulin content; however, these effects were dose\u2011dependently reversed by treatment with captopril. Treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of intracellular glutathione biosynthesis, inhibited the protective effects of captopril on dRib\u2011mediated glutathione depletion and cytotoxicity in HIT\u2011T15 cells. Following incubation with albumin, dRib increased the formation of dicarbonyl and advanced glycation end products. Treatment with captopril did not inhibit the dRib\u2011induced increase in production of dicarbonyl and advanced glycation end products. In conclusion, treatment with captopril reversed dRib\u2011induced oxidative damage and suppression of insulin expression in \u03b2\u2011cells. The mechanism underlying the protective effects of captopril may involve increased intracellular glutathione production, rather than protein glycation.",

Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to have cardiotoxic effects. However, erlotinib does not have a statistically proven effect of increasing acute cardiovascular event (ACE) risk. Preclinical studies showed that beta agonist stimulation among rats that were administered erlotinib led to cardiovascular damage.

We evaluated the extent of switching among equivalents in chronic cardiovascular therapies, the influence of the 2012 regulatory intervention and of patient-related or drug-related factors. Prescriptions of off-patent anti-arrhythmics, oral antidiabetics and ACE inhibitors dispensed from August 2011 to August 2013 within the Bologna Local Health Authority (870,000 inhabitants) was collected. The rate of actual switching among equivalents was evaluated monthly. The effect of the regulatory intervention was estimated by interrupted-time-series analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of switching were calculated for the following: age, gender, number of different equivalents available for each drug and change in dispensing pharmacy between subsequent refills. The average monthly rates of switches were 9.6%, 16.3% and 16.3% for anti-arrhythmics, antidiabetics and ACE inhibitors, respectively. Values significantly increased soon after the regulatory intervention for ACE inhibitors (+1.81%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), anti-arrhythmics (+1.46%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and antidiabetics (+1.09%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and no significant decreasing trends were observed in the following 12\u00a0months. For all drug classes, odd of switching was higher in case of change in dispensing pharmacy (up to aOR\u00a0=\u00a04.31, 95 CI\u00a0=\u00a04.26-4.35 for ACE inhibitors) and availability of \u22655 different equivalents (up to aOR\u00a0=\u00a07.82, 95 CI\u00a0=\u00a07.39-8.28 for antidiabetics).

For the first time, this study describes the simultaneous delivery of a combination of three drugs using a dissolving polymeric MN system. In the present study, aspirin, lisinopril dihydrate, and atorvastatin calcium trihydrate were used as exemplar cardiovascular drugs and formulated into MN arrays using two biocompatible polymers, poly(vinylpyrrollidone) and poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). Following fabrication, dissolution, mechanical testing, and determination of drug recovery from the MN arrays, in vitro drug delivery studies were undertaken, followed by HPLC analysis. All three drugs were successfully delivered in vitro across neonatal porcine skin, with similar permeation profiles achieved from both polymer formulations. An average of 126.3 \u00b1 18.1 \u03bcg of atorvastatin calcium trihydrate was delivered, notably lower than the 687.9 \u00b1 101.3 \u03bcg of lisinopril and 3924 \u00b1 1011 \u03bcg of aspirin, because of the hydrophobic nature of the atorvastatin molecule and hence poor dissolution from the array. Polymer deposition into the skin may be an issue with repeat application of such a MN array, hence future work will consider more appropriate MN systems for continuous use, alongside tailoring delivery to less hydrophilic compounds.",

Perindopril erbumine was found to react with 7-hydroxycoumarin in acetonitrile resulting in a new fluorescent product with about 58 nm blue shifted emission. The fluorescence of the complex was measured at 440 nm after excitation at 350 nm in acetonitrile. Under the optimum conditions, the fluorescence intensity was linear over a concentration range of 2.0-16.0 \u03bcg/mL (R(2)\u2009=\u20091) with a detection limit of 0.054 \u03bcg/mL. The proposed method was fully validated and successfully applied to the analysis of perindopril erbumine in pure form and tablets. Statistical comparison of the results obtained by the proposed and reference method revealed no significant differences in the performance of the two methods regarding the accuracy and precision respectively. The method was shown to be highly specific in the presence of indapamide, a diuretic that is commonly combined with perindopril erbumine.

    "174": "Vascular remodelling is a critical vasculopathy found in atheromatous diseases and allograft failures. The local renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in vascular remodelling. However, the mechanisms by which the augmented local RAS is associated with the initial event of endothelial cell apoptosis in injured vasculature remain undefined. We induced the apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through serum starvation (SS). After the cells were subjected to SS, we found that the mRNA expression of angiotensinogen (AGT) was increased by >3-fold in HUVECs and by approximately 2.5-fold in VSMCs. In addition, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA was increased in VSMCs but decreased to 50% in HUVECs during the same apoptotic process. Increases in the expression of AGT protein and angiotensin II (Ang II) were found in a serum-free medium conditioned by HUVECs (SSC). The increased Ang II was suppressed using lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) treatment. Moreover, the activation of ERK1/2 induced by the SSC in VSMCs was also suppressed by losartan. In conclusion, we first demonstrated that the augmented AGT released from apoptotic endothelial cells acts as a vital progenitor of Ang II to accelerate vascular remodelling, and we suggest that blocking local augmented Ang II might be an effective strategy for restraining intimal hyperplasia.",

While, at low concentrations, ROS modulate important physiological functions through changes in cellular signalling and gene expression, overproduction of ROS may adversely alter cardiac mechanics, leading to further worsening of systolic and diastolic function. In addition, vascular endothelial dysfunction due to uncoupling of the nitric oxide synthase, activation of vascular and phagocytic membrane oxidases or mitochondrial oxidative stress may lead to increased vascular stiffness, further compromising cardiac performance in afterload-dependent hearts. In the present review, we address the potential role of ROS in the pathophysiology of myocardial and vascular dysfunction in heart failure (HF) and their therapeutic targeting. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying the failure of antioxidant vitamins in improving patients' prognosis, the impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 receptor blockers on oxidative stress, and the mechanism of the benefit of combination of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate. Further, we provide evidence supporting the existence of differences in the pathophysiology of HF with preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction and whether targeting mitochondrial ROS might be a particularly interesting therapeutic option for patients with preserved ejection fraction.",

It is important to acknowledge, however, that the severity of symptoms does not systematically correlate with the level of ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients with no or only mild symptoms are still at high risk of HF-related morbidity and mortality. The objective of this review was to summarize the prevalence, characteristics, and treatment of patients with chronic HF and mild or no symptoms and to review epidemiological data from three recent registries conducted in Europe. From a clinical practice perspective, patients with a reduced ejection fraction who have only mild symptoms appear to represent a group of patients for whom the provision of adequate medical care is yet to be optimized. While prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers appears to be consistently high, the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists is more variable and does not appear to be in accordance with the latest clinical guidelines. As approximately half of patients with HF and a reduced LVEF have NYHA class II symptoms, significant reductions in morbidity and mortality could be achieved by more comprehensive treatment of this population.",

    "205": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic condition which manifests as altered hemoglobin (Hb) protein that can aggregate under hypoxic conditions. The resultant sickled erythrocytes experience premature hemolysis, releasing an estimated 10g of free Hb (fHb) into the intravascular space. FHb participates in redox reactions creating various reactive oxygen species which rapidly and irreversibly scavenge nitric oxide, thereby attenuating its vasodilatory, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. FHb also induces endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, triggering leukocyte margination at the vessel wall. These mechanisms participate in diverse SCD-associated clinical events including nephropathy, pulmonary hypertension, chronic leg ulceration, and ischemic events. FHb also exerts a direct reno-toxic effect contributing to albuminuria which is an early, frequent manifestation of glomerular injury. Under normal conditions, fHb is effectively scavenged by the Hb-scavenging mechanism (HSM); this involves binding to haptoglobin (Hp), uptake via the Hb-scavenging receptor (CD163) on monocytes and metabolism by heme-oxygenase-1. This culminates in increased CD163 expression and release of anti-inflammatory by-products e.g. interleukin-10 (IL-10). In SCD, the Hb-binding capacity is overwhelmed by chronic hemolysis; our previous research shows serum Hp as the depleted component. This deficiency could result in the harmful consequences of circulating fHb going unbridled. The hypothesis we explore here is that Hp infusions, in excess of fHb concentration, will allow the HSM to remain functional, and thereby achieve improved clinical outcomes, tracking albuminuria as a sentinel. Albuminuria was selected because of its high prevalence in SCD and its relative ease of diagnosis and monitoring. The hypothesis may be evaluated in four phases: Phase 1 will determine the concentration of Hp needed to trigger the HSM as measured by induction of CD163 and IL-10 and the recovery of hemopexin. Phase 2 will investigate the half-life of HSM induction by analyzing the time-course of CD163 expression and IL-10 and hemopexin serum concentration. Phase 3 will determine patient eligibility for therapy, whether as treatment or prevention. Phase 4 will test the efficacy of Hp transfusions in a randomized control trial as measured by correction of albuminuria. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are currently the first-line treatment for SCD nephropathy, however hyperkalemia limits its use. Hydroxyurea, which has therapeutic value in many SCD adverse events, has yielded inconsistent effects on albuminuria. We are proposing the addition of an intervention more proximal in the hemolytic cascade. Boosting the exhausted Hb-scavenging capacity via Hp replacement therapy has the potential to modify multiple downstream clinical events.",

    "210": "Anthracyclines are one of the most commonly used antineoplastic agent classes, and a core part of the treatment in breast cancers, hematological malignancies, and sarcomas. Their benefit is decreased by their well-recognized cardiotoxicity. The purpose of this review is to outline the presentation, mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity. Symptomatic heart failure occurs in 2% to 5% of patients treated with anthrayclines and may be higher in older patients or patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The mechanisms involved in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity involve myocyte loss by apoptosis in the presence of a limited regenerative capacity. Once symptomatic, anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with markedly decreased survival. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), mostly determined using echocardiography, is used to monitor patients treated with anthracyclines. As more than 1/3 of patients treated with anthracyclines do not recover their baseline LVEF once it is decreased, more sensitive echocardiographic indices of LV function such as myocardial deformation or biomarkers have been studied in patients monitoring. Cardioprotective treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, iron chelators, statins, and metformin are also the topic of research efforts.",

Due to novel regulations permitting the installation of new catheterization laboratories in Belgium, the Flemish government initiated a project to measure quality of care in patients with an ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) by measuring four quality indicators: prescription of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker or aspirin on discharge and unadjusted mortality. However, we are not convinced that these four indicators will provide sufficient information on the quality of care in our hospitals. Hence, we performed a retrospective analysis on a larger set of parameters and evaluated their applicability as indicators of quality of care.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this reaction has been exploited for the determination of captopril in pharmaceutical products, offering a clean analytical procedure with minimal reagent usage. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure was confirmed by analyzing a set of pharmaceutical formulations. Application of the paired t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the data sets at a 95% confidence level.

As both patients with peak aortic transvalvular flow velocity \u22652 m/s and <2 m/s were enrolled, subgroup analysis was also conducted. Most patients were under treatment for their comorbidities. The use of warfarin, but none of the traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, was related to greater reduction in aortic valve area indexed to body surface area (iAVA). In patients with peak aortic transvalvular flow velocity <2 m/s, the use of an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) was associated with less decrease in iAVA. In patients with peak velocity \u22652 m/s, changes in iAVA were not related to any baseline characteristics, but peak velocity was less increased under treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).",

Neurohormonal activity is initially stimulated in an attempt to maintain compensation; however, when it remains increased, it contributes to the intensification of clinical manifestations and myocardial damage. Cardiac remodeling comprises changes in ventricular volume as well as the thickness and shape of the myocardial wall. With optimized treatment, such remodeling can be reversed, causing gradual improvement in cardiac function and consequently improved prognosis.",

Over the last few decades scientific interest in food-derived antihypertensive peptides has grown as an alternative to drugs in the control of systemic blood pressure. Most of these peptides target the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) but emerging evidence points to other antihypertensive mechanisms beyond ACE inhibition. The milk protein lactoferrin (LF) is a good source of orally active antihypertensive peptides the characterization of which, including ex vivo functional assays and in vivo approaches, shows that they might act on several molecular targets. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action underlying the blood pressure-lowering effects of LF-derived peptides, focusing on their interaction with different components of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and endothelin (ET) systems. The ability of LF-derived peptides to modify the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway and prostaglandin synthesis is also described.",

The theoretical considerations showed that the geometric molecular descriptor-volume value (Vol) should be considered as an independent variable simultaneously with calculated hydrophobicity parameters in multiple linear regression analysis to obtain reliable correlation between ACE inhibitor's absorption and lipophilicity (calculated KOWWINlog P) and that captopril should be excluded from further correlations. The results of MTLC confirmed that between the two hydrophobicity parameters km and Pm/w, for absorption prediction of 11 ACE inhibitors, the micelle-water partition coefficient Pm/w provided higher correlation (R(2) = 0.756), while for the km parameter R(2) = 0.612 was obtained. The micelle-water partition coefficient Pm/w could be considered as analogous to hydrophobicity parameter C0 from reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography. Dissimilar retention behavior of lisinopril indicated its lowest non-polar interaction with micelle, because of its di-acid form. The proposed model which included ACE inhibitors on the opposite site of lipophilicity-lisinopril and fosinopril (KOWWINlog P = -0.96 and KOWWINlog P = 6.61, respectively), both with similar absorption values (25 and 36%, respectively), could indicate that absorption of investigated compounds occurs via two different mechanisms: active and passive transport.",

Echocardiography is the mainstay for evaluating whether left-sided heart disease is the cause of dyspnea. If left-sided heart failure is diagnosed, this symptom complex must then be subjected to further etiological evaluation. Hypertensive, ischemic and valvular heart diseases are common, as well as atrial fibrillation. If the patient does not have angina pectoris, testing for ischemic heart disease should be done non-invasively by coronary computed tomography or testing for regional myocardial ischemia. Coronary revascularization is indicated only when a prognostically relevant ischemia of more than 10\u2009% of the left ventricle is diagnosed. Diuretics are important for the relief of dyspnea but do not improve the prognosis of patients. In patients with reduced left ventricular function, combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists improve the symptoms and prognosis. For treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction evidence-based measures are still lacking. In this case the recommended therapy consists of optimal treatment of comorbidities, regulation of heart rate and blood pressure and participation in structured exercise programs.

    "244": "Atherosclerosis is considered a generalized disease. Similar or identical etiopathogenetic mechanisms and risk factors are involved in various atherosclerotic diseases, and the positive effects of preventive measures on atherogenesis in different parts of the arterial system were shown. However, until know, great emphasis has been placed on the aggressive pharmacological management of coronary artery disease (CHD), while less attention has been devoted to the management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), despite its significant morbidity and mortality. Data on the efficacy of preventive measures in PAD patients have mostly been gained from subgroup analyses from studies devoted primarily to the management of coronary patients. These data have shown that treatment of risk factors for atherosclerosis with drugs can reduce cardiovascular events also in patients with PAD. The effects of some preventive procedures in PAD patients differ from coronary patients. Aspirin as a basic antiplatelet drug has been shown to be less effective in PAD patients than in coronary patients. The latest Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATC) meta-analysis demonstrates no benefit of aspirin in reducing cardiovascular events in PAD. Statins reduce cardiovascular events in all three of the most frequently presented cardiovascular diseases, including PAD to a comparable extent. Recent studies indicate that in PAD patients, in addition to a reduction in cardiovascular events, statins may have some hemodynamic effects. They prolong walking distance and improve quality of life. Similarly, angiotensin enzyme inhibitors are also effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events in coronary, cerebrovascular, as well as PAD patients and show positive effects on the walking capacity of patients with intermittent claudication. In PAD patients, the treatment of hypertension and diabetes also effectively prevents cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As PAD patients are at a highest risk of cardiovascular complications, the risk factors of atherosclerosis should be treated intensively in this group of patients. Most of the preventive measures, including the drugs used for prevention of CHD, are also effective in PAD patients.",

Rats with nephrotic syndrome had greater ad libitum water intakes beginning 3 weeks after treatment, but daily sodium (0.3M NaCl) intakes were not affected. Nephrotic rats showed attenuated water and sodium intakes after combined treatment with furosemide (10mg/kg) and captopril (2mg/kg), reduced water intakes after 20h of water deprivation, and diminished water intakes, plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion after subcutaneous isoproterenol (30 \u03bcg/kg). However, the adriamycin-treated animals had normal water intakes in response to subcutaneous hypertonic saline (4% at 0.75 ml/100g) and central injections of angiotensin II (10, 20, and 50 ng). The results suggest that water and sodium ingestion in response to hypovolemic/hypotensive stimuli are disturbed in nephrotic rats, and provide evidence that the disordered behaviors reflect disturbances of the peripheral renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "246": "Although randomized studies have shown optimal medical therapy (OMT) to be as efficacious as revascularization in stable coronary heart disease (CHD), the application of OMT in routine practice is suboptimal. We sought to understand the predictors of receiving OMT in stable CHD and its impact on clinical outcomes. All patients with stable CHD based on coronary angiography from October 2008 to September 2011 were identified in Ontario, Canada. OMT was defined as concurrent use of \u03b2 blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statin. Aspirin use was not part of the OMT definition because of database limitations. Multivariable hierarchical logistic models identified predictors of OMT in the 12\u00a0months after angiography. Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates for OMT and revascularization status examined differences in death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). In these models, patients transitioned among 4 mutually exclusive treatment groups: no OMT and no revascularization, no OMT and revascularization, OMT and no revascularization, OMT and revascularization. Our cohort had 20,663 patients. Over a mean period of 2.5\u00a0years, 8.7% had died. Only 61% received OMT within 12\u00a0months. The strongest predictor of receiving OMT at 12\u00a0months was OMT before the angiogram (odds ratio 14.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.17 to 15.75, p <0.001). Relative to no OMT and nonrevascularized patients, patients on OMT and revascularized had the greatest reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.60, p <0.001) and nonfatal MI (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84, p\u00a0<0.001). In conclusion, our study highlights the low rate of OMT in stable CHD. Patients who received both OMT and revascularization achieved the greatest reduction in mortality and nonfatal MI.", 
    "247": "During the last years, two new cardiovascular drug classes, namely inhibitors of DPP IV or neprilysin, have been developed. In both cases, there is clinical evidence for their potential to induce angioedema as known already from blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The majority of angioedema induced by DPP IV inhibitors occurs during concomitant treatment with ACEi and is therefore likely mediated by overactivation of bradykinin type 2 receptors (B2). In striking contrast, the molecular pathways causing angioedema induced by neprilysin inhibitors, that is, sacubitril, are unclear, although a contribution of bradykinin appears likely. Nevertheless, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that inhibition of B2 might relieve the symptoms and/or prevent invasive treatment including coniotomy or tracheotomy in angioedema caused by these drugs. Therefore, the risk of angioedema should always be considered, especially in ambulatory care situations where patients have no rapid access to intensive care.", 
    "248": "This study aimed to validate the antihypertensive activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) obtained through the action of proteolytic enzymes from Cynara Cardunculus. The antihypertensive activity of WPH fractions containing peptides with molecular weight below 3kDa (Whey<3kDa) and 1kDa (Whey<1kDa) along with the antihypertensive activity of three potent ACE-inhibitory peptide sequences (DKVGINYW, DAQSAPLRVY and KGYGGVSLPEW), previously identified in WPH, were also investigated. In parallel, the influence of KGYGGVSLPEW (the most potent ACE-inhibitory peptide sequence) on AT1 receptors (a common pharmacological target of antihypertensive therapies beyond ACE), was evaluated. The effect of WPH and fractions (300mg/kg) and peptide sequences (5mg/kg) on systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure was evaluated by telemetry on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), after single oral administration. Despite their ACE-inhibitory effect in vitro, neither WPH, Whey <3kDa, Whey <1kDa or peptide sequences exhibited antihypertensive activity. In addition, KGYGGVSLPEW was not only devoid of AT1 receptor antagonism but, on the contrary, had a similar effect to that of Ang II by facilitating the noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve terminals. In vitro ACE blockade does not always correlate with antihypertensive activity and food-derived peptides cannot be classified as antihypertensive agents based exclusively on in vitro assays. The absence of an antihypertensive effect may also be a result of the interaction of these compounds with other components of the systems involved in the blood pressure control.", 
    "249": "Chronic renal insufficiency inexorably progresses in patients, such as it does after partial renal ablation in rats. However, the progression of renal diseases can be delayed by angiotensin II blockers that stabilize renal function or increase GFR, even in advanced phases of the disease. Regression of glomerulosclerosis can be induced by angiotensin II antagonism, but the effect of these treatments on the entire vascular tree is unclear. Here, using microcomputed tomography and scanning electron microscopy, we compared the size and extension of kidney blood vessels in untreated Wistar rats with those in untreated and angiotensin II antagonist-treated Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rats that spontaneously develop kidney disease with age. The kidney vasculature underwent progressive rarefaction in untreated MWF rats, substantially affecting intermediate and small vessels. Microarray analysis showed increased Tgf-\u03b2 and endothelin-1 gene expression with age. Notably, 10-week inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system regenerated kidney vasculature and normalized Tgf-\u03b2 and endothelin-1 gene expression in aged MWF rats. These changes were associated with reduced apoptosis, increased endothelial cell proliferation, and restoration of Nrf2 expression, suggesting mechanisms by which angiotensin II antagonism mediates regeneration of capillary segments. These results have important implications in the clinical setting of chronic renal insufficiency.", 
    "250": "Persons aged over 65 years account for over 75% of healthcare expenditures and deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accordingly, reducing CVD risk among older adults is an important public health priority. Functional status, determined by measures of physical performance, is an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in older adults and declines more rapidly in seniors with hypertension. To date, physical exercise is the primary strategy for attenuating declines in functional status. Yet despite the general benefits of training, exercise alone appears to be insufficient for preventing this decline. Thus, alternative or adjuvant strategies are needed to preserve functional status among seniors with hypertension. Prior data suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may be efficacious in enhancing exercise-derived improvements in functional status yet this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized controlled trial. The objective of this randomized, double-masked pilot trial is to gather preliminary efficacy and safety data necessary for conducting a full-scale trial to test this hypothesis. Sedentary men and women \u2265 65 years of age with functional limitations and hypertension are being recruited into this 24 week intervention study. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) ACEi plus exercise training, (2) thiazide diuretic plus exercise training, or (3) AT1 receptor antagonist plus exercise training. The primary outcome is change in walking speed and secondary outcomes consist of other indices of CV risk including exercise capacity, body composition, as well as circulating indices of metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress.",

    "255": "The bioactivity assessment of foodborne peptides is currently a research area of great relevance, and, in particular, several studies are devoted to the antihypertensive effects through the inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). In the present work, a straightforward workflow to identify inhibitory peptides from food matrices is proposed, which involves a hybrid in vitro/in silico tandem approach. Parma dry-cured ham was chosen as case study. In particular, the advantage of using the hybrid approach to identify active sequences (in comparison to the experimental trials alone) has been pointed out. Specifically, fractions obtained by in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of ham samples of 18 and 24 months of aging have been assessed for ACE inhibition. At the same time, the released peptidomic profiles, which cannot be entirely evaluated by using in vitro assays, have been screened for the inhibition by using an in silico model. Then, to identify novel inhibitory sequences, a series of strong candidates have been synthesized and assessed for their inhibitory activity through in vitro assay. On the one hand, the use of computational simulations appeared to be an effective strategy to find active sequences, as confirmed by in vitro analysis. On the other hand, strong inhibitory sequences were identified for the first time in Parma dry-cured ham (e.g., LGL and SFVTT with IC50 values of 145 and 395 \u03bcM, respectively), which is a product of international dietary and economic relevance. Therefore, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of in silico methodologies coupled to in vitro tests for the identification of potentially bioactive peptides, and they give an important contribution to the study of the overall nutritional value of Parma ham.",

However, the guidelines from France, the UK, Europe and the USA differ. Some recommendations are graded, whereas others are not. All recommendations emphasize the role of alternative methods for clinical measurement of blood pressure, such as ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) or self-measurement. The UK guideline recommends that the diagnosis of hypertension should be established by ABPM. The USA guideline recommends a target of \u2264 150/90 mmHg for patients aged >60 years. The French guideline recommends that the target blood pressure remains at <140/90 mmHg, with <150 mmHg for patients aged >80 years. Systolic blood pressure between 130 and 139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg are recommended for diabetic patients and those with chronic kidney disease. The French Society of Hypertension (SFHTA) guideline is unique in recommending a dedicated consultation to announce the diagnosis to the patient. In the French and European guidelines, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) remain indicated as first-line therapy for hypertension; if the target blood pressure is not achieved, they recommend combining two active substances. The UK guideline recommends ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line therapy for patients aged <55 years; calcium antagonists are advised for patients aged >55 years and for black patients. The USA guideline advises treating non-black patients, including those with diabetes, with thiazides, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors or ARBs; for black patients, including those with diabetes, it recommends thiazide and calcium antagonists.", 
    "261": "By affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE), the thermodynamic binding constants of a sulfonamide (SA) inhibitor to bovine carbonic anhydrase II (CA) and metal mutated variants (M-CAs) were evaluated. 1-(4-Aminosulfonylphenylazo)-2-naphthol-6,8-disulfonate was used as the SA in the electrophoretic buffer for ACE. The Scatchard analysis of the dependence of the electrophoretic mobility of native CA on the SA concentration provided the binding constant to be Kb=(2.29\u00b10.05)\u00d710(6) M(-1) (at pH8.4, 25\u00b0C). On the other hand, apoCA showed far smaller value [Kb=(3.76\u00b10.14)\u00d710(2) M(-1)], suggesting that the coordination of SA to the Zn(II) center controlled the binding thermodynamics. The ACE of M-CAs showed the same behaviors as native CA but with different Kb values. For example, Co-CA adopting the same tetrahedral coordination geometry as native CA exhibited the largest Kb value [(2.55\u00b10.05)\u00d710(6) M(-1)] among the M-CAs. In contrast, Mn- and Ni-CA, which adopted the octahedral coordination geometry, had Kb values that were about two orders of magnitude lower. Because the hydrophobic cavity of CA around the active center pre-organized the orientation of SA, thereby fixing the ligating NH(-) moiety to the apex of the tetrahedron supported by three basal His3 of CA, metals such as Zn and Co at the center of M-CA gave the most stable CA-SA complex. However, pre-organization was not favored for octahedral geometry. Thus, pre-organization of SA was the key to facilitating the tetrahedral coordination geometry of the Zn(II) active center of CA.",

Based on the FRAX studies suggesting that the questions without bone mineral density can be used to screen for osteoporosis, there is now a valid simple questionnaire to screen for sarcopenia, i.e., the SARC-F. Numerous factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia.

In addition, part of this article is dedicated to the risk assessment of the parent compounds atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and verapamil, which are of great environmental concern in terms of contamination levels and for which there are sufficient ecotoxicological data available. 79 articles were retrieved presenting quantization data for 34 different antihypertensives and/or their metabolites. Only 43 articles were found regarding acute and chronic ecotoxicological effects of antihypertensive drugs. The results indicated that the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol are the antihypertensives most frequently detected in the aquatic environment. They are also the drugs which reached the highest maximum concentrations in surface waters in the data reported in the literature. The highest percentages of ecotoxicity data regarding antihypertensives were also related to these beta-blockers. On the other hand, there is clearly a lack of ecotoxicity data, especially the chronic ones, regarding other antihypertensives. The environmental risk assessment (ERA) showed that all three of the evaluated beta-blockers can pose a potential long-term risk for non-target organisms of both fresh and marine water species. However, more meaningful ecotoxicity data for antihypertensives, including saltwater species, are required to refine and enlarge these results. Additional studies focusing on potential interactions between pharmaceutical mixtures, including antihypertensives, are also an urgent need.",

This study was the first investigation of the insecticide resistance mechanisms, involving metabolic detoxification and target site insensitivity in C. quinquefasciatus from Thailand. Adult females reared from field-caught larvae from six provinces of northern Thailand were determined for resistant status by exposing to 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin and 5% malathion papers using the standard WHO susceptibility test. The overall mortality rates were 45.8%, 11.4% and 80.2%, respectively. A fragment of voltage-gated sodium channel gene was amplified and sequenced to identify the knock down resistance (kdr) mutation. The ace-1 gene mutation was determined by using PCR-RFLP. The L1014F kdr mutation was observed in all populations, but the homozygous mutant F/F1014 genotype was found only in two of the six provinces where the kdr mutation was significantly correlated with deltamethrin resistance. However, none of mosquitoes had the G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene. A laboratory deltamethrin resistant strain, Cq_CM_R, has been established showing a highly resistant level after selection for a few generations. The mutant F1014 allele frequency was significantly increased after one generation of selection. A synergist assay was performed to assess the metabolic detoxifying enzymes. Addition of bis(4-nitrophenyl)-phosphate (BNPP) and diethyl maleate (DEM), inhibitors of esterases and glutathione S-transferases (GST), respectively, into the larval bioassay of the Cq_CM strain with deltamethrin showed no significant reduction. By contrast, addition of piperonyl butoxide (PBO), an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, showed a 9-fold reduction of resistance. Resistance to pyrethroids in C. quinquefasciatus is widely distributed in northern Thailand. This study reports for the first time for the detection of the L1014F kdr mutation in wild populations of C. quinquefasciatus in Thailand. At least two major mechanisms, kdr and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, confer resistance to deltamethrin in Thai C. quinquefasciatus populations.",

A retrospective chart review was performed on adult patients at an academic county hospital with an ejection fraction \u226440% and a diagnosis of HF, seen by a single provider type (HF team, cardiologist, or PCP) at least twice within a 12-month period. Utilization rates of any ACEI/ARB and any beta blocker were robust across provider types, though evidence-based ACEI/ARB and beta blocker were greatest from the HF team. Doses of evidence-based therapies dropped markedly in the non-HF team groups.

Cardiovascular therapies with proven benefit are often withheld from patients with renal disease for fear of adverse events. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated as an important maladaptive neurohormonal pathway in heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to suppress it ineffectively. Current guidelines support the use of spironolactone for more comprehensive suppression of the RAAS in heart failure patients. Most supporting trials have however excluded patients with renal dysfunction resulting in a dearth of data to support use of spironolactone in CKD patients with CHF. Several small studies that prospectively interrogated the benefits of augmented RAAS blockade with spironolactone in CKD patients have shown improvement in predictors of cardiovascular mortality. More recently, improved mortality outcomes were demonstrated with the use of spironolactone in hemodialysis patients. Although reduction in glomerular filtration rate and hyperkalemia are potential adverse effects with its use, the available evidence suggests that it is uncommon and serious consequences can be avoided with close monitoring. Studies investigating the optimal spironolactone dosage in such a setting recommend starting with a low dose and careful uptitration.

Thus, we tried to explore the effects of pentoxifylline and its interaction with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on the development of endstage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. This nationwide cohort study retrospectively included patients who had a serum creatinine level of >6 mg/dL and received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) between 2000 and 2010. We analyzed 7,366 pentoxifylline users and 7,366 propensity score-matched nonusers. Using Cox proportional hazard models, pentoxifylline reduced the risks of ESRD and the composite renal outcome but not that of mortality. In terms of the risks of developing ESRD, pentoxifylline alone exerted a comparable beneficial effect to combined therapy with an RAAS inhibitor and greater renoprotection than RAAS inhibitor monotherapy. This study suggests pentoxifylline is efficacious in slowing progression to ESRD in patients with predialysis stage 5 CKD.",

We compared long-term all-cause mortality between patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >40% discharged on ACEi/ARB with patients who were discharged on neither of these agents. Patients discharged after percutaneous intervention for STEMI from our catheterization laboratories from January 2002 to December 2011 were considered for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had LVEF <40% or chronic kidney disease or hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg any time after the procedure). Long-term mortality and discharge medications were determined using the Social Security Death Index and electronic medical record review, respectively. A total of 988 patients were included. The median follow-up duration was 4.6\u00a0years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in long-term all-cause mortality in patients discharged on ACEi/ARB compared with those who were not discharged on these medications.

The present study therefore aimed to investigate the hypothesis that diabetic nephropathy may be ameliorated by mycophenolate mofetil and benazepril treatment alone or in combination, and identify the potential underlying mechanisms in a rat model. Diabetes was induced in rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Rats were subsequently treated with benazepril, MMF or a combination of the two drugs, and blood glucose, normalized kidney weight, urine protein and serum creatinine were determined. The pathological changes in renal tissue were also observed. In addition, indices of epithelial mesenchymal transition, including \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2011SMA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2011\u03b21 expression, were examined. Normalized kidney weight, urine protein and serum creatinine levels were significantly improved in the diabetic rats treated with benazepril or mycophenolate mofetil, compared with those of rats in the untreated diabetic group. Pathological changes in the kidney were detected concurrently with increasing kidney weight and urinary albumin excretion, with a similar trend in variation among groups. In addition, the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition indices, including \u03b1\u2011SMA and TGF\u2011\u03b21, in the renal tubule interstitium were significantly decreased in the benazepril\u2011 and MMF\u2011treated groups compared with those of the diabetic group. As expected, the aforementioned indices were markedly lower in the benazepril and MMF combined treatment group than those in the single medication groups. These data suggested that MMF may have a protective role in diabetic nephropathy, and that the underlying mechanism may be partially dependent upon the suppression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, the combination of benazepril and MMF conferred enhanced efficacy over monotherapies in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.",

In vitro incubation study of human liver, intestine and kidney s9 fractions demonstrated that the ACEI prodrugs enalapril, ramipril, perindopril, moexipril and fosinopril are selectively activated by CES1 in the liver. The impact of CES1/CES1VAR and CES1P1/CES1P1VAR genotypes and diplotypes on CES1 expression and activity on enalapril activation was investigated in 102 normal human liver samples. Neither the genotypes nor the diplotypes affected hepatic CES1 expression and activity. Moreover, among several CES1 nonsynonymous variants studied in transfected cell lines, the G143E (rs71647871) was a loss-of-function variant for the activation of all ACEIs tested. The CES1 activity on enalapril activation in human livers with the 143G/E genotype was approximately one-third of that carrying the 143G/G. Thus, some functional CES1 genetic variants (for example, G143E) may impair ACEI activation, and consequently affect therapeutic outcomes of ACEI prodrugs.",

In 2014 a fixed-dose combination of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an diuretic (indapamide) appeared on the Czech market. Within the PIANIST study including 4\u202f731 insufficiently controlled hypertensives, a fixed-dose triple combination of perindopril, amlodipine and indapamide led to a decrease in blood pressure by 28.3/13.8 mm Hg and to a sufficient control of hypertension in 92 % of patients. The advantage of fixed combinations primarily consists in greater compliance of patients and thereby in a better control of hypertension.

Our aim was to assess the association between those indicators and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. We hypothesized that an association exists between quality-of-care indicators and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. Based on the data of 2128 AMI patients at 20 tertiary hospitals in Heilongjiang Province from January 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010, we estimated the compliance rates of indicators. Association between indicators and in-hospital mortality was assessed using hierarchical generalized linear models. Among 2128 patients, 163 (7.66%) died during their hospital stay. The compliance rates were 71.6%, 41.3%, 82.5%, 63.5%, 80.4%, 5.1%, 28.9%, and 41.2% for the use of aspirin, \u03b2-blocker, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, thrombolytic, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary angiography, respectively. Aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and percutaneous coronary intervention were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors. We found some disparities between guidelines and clinical practice for AMI patients in China and a significant association between indicators and in-hospital mortality. Our findings are potentially helpful for assessing and improving the quality of care for AMI patients in China.",

AS in rats was induced by feeding them with atherogenic diets, and it was evaluated by the levels of plasma lipids and aortic cholesterol. DCs' activity was appraised by endocytic activity, mixed lymphocyte reactions and cytokine secretion. The markers of DCs (CD103, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II) and Treg (CD4(+), CD25(+) and Foxp3(+)) were assayed by western blotting analysis and flow cytometry. Cytokine level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Captopril significantly reduced CD103, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II protein expression while increasing that of Foxp3 in aortic tissue. Further study indicated oral administration of captopril up-regulated endocytic activity and reduced the immunostimulatory function of splenic DCs. Captopril treatment also promoted IL-10 & TGF-\u03b2 production while decreasing that of IL-6 & IL-12 in splenic DCs.

To determine whether vitamin D levels influence proteinuria and CKD progression in children, we performed a post hoc analysis of the Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on Progression of CKD in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE) cohort. In 167 children (median eGFR 51 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), FGF-23, and Klotho levels were measured at baseline and after a median 8 months on ACEi. Children with lower 25(OH)D levels had higher urinary protein/creatinine ratios at baseline (P=0.03) and at follow-up (P=0.006). Levels of 25(OH)D and serum vitamin D-binding protein were not associated, but 25(OH)D \u226450 nmol/L associated with higher diastolic BP (P=0.004). ACEi therapy also associated with increased Klotho levels (P<0.001). The annualized loss of eGFR was inversely associated with baseline 25(OH)D level (P<0.001, r=0.32).

BK, in doses of 1-100 \u03bcg/kg ic, produced dose-related increases in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and dose-related deceases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). When decreases in MAP were prevented by intravenous injections of angiotensin II (Ang II), increases in ICP, in response to BK, were enhanced. Increases in ICP, ICP/MAP ratio, and area under the curve and decreases in MAP in response to BK were inhibited by the kinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and enhanced by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril and by Ang-(1-7). Increases in ICP, in response to BK, were not attenuated by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor (N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) or the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) but were attenuated by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, sodium meclofenamate. Decreases in MAP were not attenuated by either inhibitor. These data suggest that erectile responses are mediated by kinin B2 receptors and modulated by decreases in MAP. These data indicate that ACE is important in the inactivation of BK and that erectile and hypotensive responses are independent of NO in the penis or the systemic vascular bed. Erectile responses to cavernosal nerve stimulation are not altered by BK or HOE-140, suggesting that BK and B2 receptors do not modulate nerve-mediated erectile responses under physiologic conditions.

The risk of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia associated with HCTZ was lower than with CTD, while the risk of gouty arthritis was similar. Despite lower risks of metabolic side-effects, meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that, for any given difference in achieved clinic SBP, HCTZ therapy was associated with 18% higher adverse cardiovascular events when compared with CTD.",

    "483": "Di-, tri-, and tetra-tyrosine peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity were synthesized by papain-catalyzed polymerization of L-tyrosine ethyl ester in aqueous media at 30 \u00b0C. Varying the reaction pH from 6.0 to 7.5 and the initial concentration of the ester substrate from 25 to 100 mM, the highest yield of oligo-tyrosine peptides (79% on a substrate basis) was produced at pH 6.5 and 75 mM, respectively. In the reaction initiated with 100 mM of the substrate, approx. 50% yield of insoluble, highly polymerized peptides accumulated. At less than 15 mM, the reaction proceeded poorly; however, from 30 mM to 120 mM a dose-dependent increase in the consumption rate of the substrate was observed with a sigmoidal curve. Meanwhile, each of the tri- and tetra-tyrosine peptides, even at approx. 5mM, was consumed effectively by papain but was not elongated to insoluble polymers. For deacylation of the acyl-papain intermediate through which a new peptide bond is made, L-tyrosine ethyl ester, even at 5mM, showed higher nucleophilic activity than di- and tri-tyrosine. These results indicate that the mechanism through which papain polymerizes L-tyrosine ethyl ester is as follows: the first interaction between papain and the ester substrate is a rate-limiting step; oligo-tyrosine peptides produced early in the reaction period are preferentially used as acyl donors, while the initial ester substrate strongly contributes as a nucleophile to the elongation of the peptide product; and the balance between hydrolytic fragmentation and further elongation of oligo-tyrosine peptides is dependent on the surrounding concentration of the ester substrate.", 
    "484": "Bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) from the South American pit viper snake venom were the first natural inhibitors of the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) described. The pioneer characterization of the BPPs precursor from the snake venom glands by our group showed for the first time the presence of the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in this same viper precursor protein. The confirmation of the BPP/CNP expression in snake brain regions correlated with neuroendocrine functions stimulated us to pursue the physiological correlates of these vasoactive peptides in mammals. Notably, several snake toxins were shown to have endogenous physiological correlates in mammals. In the present work, we expressed in bacteria the BPPs domain of the snake venom gland precursor protein, and this purified recombinant protein was used to raise specific polyclonal anti-BPPs antibodies. The correspondent single protein band immune-recognized in adult rat brain cytosol was isolated by 2D-SDS/PAGE and/or HPLC, before characterization by MS fingerprint analysis, which identified this protein as superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), a classically known enzyme with antioxidant activity and important roles in the blood pressure modulation. In silico analysis showed the exposition of the BPP-like peptide sequences on the surface of the 3D structure of rat SOD. These peptides were chemically synthesized to show the BPP-like biological activities in ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological bioassays. Taken together, our data suggest that SOD protein have the potential to be a source for putative BPP-like bioactive peptides, which once released may contribute to the blood pressure control in mammals.", 
    "485": "The detailed mechanisms determining the course of congestive heart failure (CHF) and associated renal dysfunction remain unclear. In a volume overload model of CHF induced by creation of aorto-caval fistula (ACF) in Hannover Sprague-Dawley (HanSD) rats we explored the putative pathogenetic contribution of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), active products of CYP-450 dependent epoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, and compared it with the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Chronic treatment with cis-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) cyclohexyloxy]benzoic acid (c-AUCB, 3 mg/l in drinking water), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) which normally degrades EETs, increased intrarenal and myocardial EETs to levels observed in sham-operated HanSD rats, but did not improve the survival or renal function impairment. In contrast, chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi, trandolapril, 6 mg/l in drinking water) increased renal blood flow, fractional sodium excretion and markedly improved survival, without affecting left ventricular structure and performance. Hence, renal dysfunction rather than cardiac remodeling determines long-term mortality in advanced stage of CHF due to volume overload. Strong protective actions of ACEi were associated with suppression of the vasoconstrictor/sodium retaining axis and activation of vasodilatory/natriuretic axis of the renin-angiotensin system in the circulating blood and kidney tissue.",

However, identification of targets that retard the progression of established DN-which is more clinically relevant-is lacking. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that arginase inhibition would prevent the progression of established DN. Effects of arginase inhibition were compared with treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, a current standard of care in DN. Experiments were conducted in Ins2(Akita) mice treated with the arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-l-cysteine (BEC) or captopril starting at 6 wk of age for 12 wk (early treatment) or starting at 12 wk of age for 6 wk (late treatment). Early and late treatment with BEC resulted in protection from DN as indicated by reduced albuminuria, histological changes, kidney macrophage infiltration, urinary thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and restored nephrin expression, kidney nitrate/nitrite, kidney endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, and renal medullary blood flow compared with vehicle-treated Ins2(Akita) mice at 18 wk of age. Interestingly, early treatment with captopril reduced albuminuria, histological changes, and kidney macrophage infiltration without affecting the other parameters, but late treatment with captopril was ineffective. These findings highlight the importance of arginase inhibition as a new potential therapeutic intervention in both early and late stages of diabetic renal injury.",

Despite this, up to 40% of patients with CKD and an indication for RAS blockade do not receive these medications. The purpose of this study was to examine variables associated with the prescription of RAS blockers in patients with CKD and to identify opportunities to increase their use.", 
    "522": "The electronic medical records of patients with moderate to severe CKD and an indication for RAS blockade were reviewed. For patients with an indication for RAS blockade who were not prescribed these medications, previous notes were reviewed to ascertain reasons why RAS blockade was not prescribed.", 
    "523": "Six hundred twenty-seven patients with moderate to severe CKD and an indication for RAS blockade were identified. Of these patients, 225 (36%) were not prescribed RAS blockade. This group was found to have significantly less diabetes, to be significantly older and to have significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure than the group on RAS blockade. For the majority (59%), no documented reason for not being prescribed RAS blockade was found. Among documented reasons, hyperkalemia and a history of acute kidney injury were the most common.", 
    "524": "The authors found that a large proportion of patients with CKD and an indication for RAS blockade were not prescribed these medications. For the majority, there was no provider-documented reason explaining why these medications were not prescribed, and the findings suggest that there may be opportunities to increase RAS blocker prescribing.", 
    "525": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its product Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], and Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas, have been shown to regulate organogenesis during embryonic development in various species. However, it is not known whether a local ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is present in the fetal pancreas. It is hypothesized that there is a local ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in the embryonic pancreas in mice that is involved in regulating islet cell development. To address this issue, the endogenous expression profile of axis constituents in embryonic mouse pancreata was examined. Involvement of the ACE2 axis in the regulation of pancreatic development was also examined. The present experiments showed in an in vivo animal model that endogenous expression levels of ACE2 and the Mas receptor were upregulated in mouse pancreata in late embryogenesis, peaking on embryonic day E16.5, when it reached 3 folds compared to that seen at E12.5. Consistently, endogenous expression of Ang-(1-7) also peaked at E16.5. Treatment with the ACE2 inhibitor DX600 did not alter islet development. However, prenatal treatment with A779, a Mas receptor antagonist, reduced the \u03b2-cell to \u03b1-cell ratio in neonatal islets, impaired islet insulin secretory function, and impaired the pups' glucose tolerance. In ex vivo pancreas explant cultures, A779 again decreased the \u03b2-cell to \u03b1-cell ratio, apparently through its effects on \u03b2-cell proliferation (reduced proliferation shown with Ki67 staining), and also decreased Insulin and Ngn3 mRNA expression. Furthermore, treatment of explant cultures with Ang-(1-7) increased mRNA levels of Insulin and pancreatic progenitor marker Ngn3, as well as Nox4, the ROS generation enzyme; these stimulatory effects were attenuated by co-treatment with A779, suggesting that Ang-(1-7), via Mas receptor signaling, may promote differentiation of pancreatic progenitors into insulin-producing cells via modulation of reactive oxygen species. These data together suggest that a Mas receptor-mediated mechanism may stimulate pancreatic cell development.", 
    "526": "Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with poor glycemic control. However, whether SDB contributes to diabetic microangiopathies, especially diabetic retinopathy (DR), is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between SDB and DR.", 
    "527": "Between January 2010 and November 2012, 136 patients underwent a sleep test and were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of DR. Sleep test results and known risk factors for DR were compared between groups. Optic fundi were examined using indirect ophthalmoscope or retinal photographs and diagnosed by experienced ophthalmologists. Multivariate stepwise (backward) logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with DR.", 
    "528": "Ninety-nine patients without DR (NDR) and 37 patients with DR were assessed. Patients in the DR group had significantly longer duration of diabetes, were more likely to have hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and were more likely to be taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (p=0.000 for each). In the multivariate backward logistic regression analysis, minimum SO2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; p=0.001), HbA1c (OR, 1.40; p=0.021), duration of diabetes (OR, 1.23; p<0.001), and history of CVD (OR, 8.96; p=0.008) remained significant.", 
    "529": "Minimum SO2 values were associated with DR independent from glycemic control level, duration of diabetes, and history of CVD. This finding suggests that SDB may contribute to the development of DR not through frequency, but due to the degree of intermittent hypoxia.", 
    "530": "This study was performed to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on bone metabolism and histology, and the action of captopril on the components of the skeletal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and bradykinin receptor in normal male mice. The mice were orally administered captopril (10\u2009mg/kg) for 4 weeks with vehicle-treated mice as normal control. The histology of trabecular bone at the distal femoral end was determined by hematoxylin & eosin, Safranin O and Masson-Trichrome staining. The captopril-treated mice showed a decreased level of testosterone (p<0.05) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (p<0.05) in serum as compared to those in the control group. Captopril has detrimental effects on trabecular bone as demonstrated by the loss of cancellous bone mass and network connections as well as changes to the chondrocytes zone. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (p<0.05), renin receptor (p<0.01), angiotensin II (p<0.05) and bradykinin receptor 2 (p<0.05) was significantly up-regulated following the captopril treatment. Thus, the potential underlying mechanism of the damage of captopril on bone can be attributed the increased activity of local bone RAS and the activation of bradykinin receptor.", 
    "531": "To provide a detailed analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of Prestance (perindopril A/amlodipine) in a subgroup of 1936 people participating in the Russian observational CONSTANTA program, most cases of whom were given the drug as a substitute for earlier ineffective monotherapy and combination therapy, without using other antihyperterisive agents.", 
    "532": "The analysis included 1936 patients (aged 58.2\u00b17.5 years; 35% men) with uncontrolled hypertension who received angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (AT II) receptor antagonists alone or in conjunction with free or fixed-dose combinations of two-three antihypertensive agents and who were given Prestance to correct antihypertensive therapy, as decided by their doctors. The goal blood pressure (BP) was <140/<90 mm Hg for all the patients. Their treatment lasted three months.", 
    "533": "At the end of trial, the patients received Prestance (perindopril A/amlodipine) in the following doses: 5/5 mg (15% of the patients), 10/5 mg (39.9%), 5/10 mg (9.8%), 10/10 mg (36.6%). In the analyzed group, the baseline BP was 163.4\u00b113.7/94.6+10,1 mm Hg; heart rate (HR), 74.0\u00b110.9 beats/min; 3 months later, there were decreases in BP to 130.8\u00b110.2/78.5\u00b17.2 mm Hg (as compared to the baseline values; p<0.001) and in HR to 67.9?5.4 beats/min (p<0.01). The mean BP reduction was 32.6\u00b110.8/16.1\u00b17.2 mm Hg. A total of 1607 (83.0%) patients achieved the goal BP while 1520 (78.5%) patients did this without having another antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "534": "To switch hypertensive patients receiving ineffective monotherapy or dual therapy using ACE inhibitors or AT II receptor blockers to fixed-dose perindopril A and amlodipine combination (Prestance) is a rational way of optimizing a therapy regimen in these patients with a wide range of baseline BP levels; moreover, four out of five patients did not need any additional antihypertensive drug.",

Smoking is a major risk factor for IHD.The deletion (D) allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism has been associated with hypertension, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. The present study was carried out to determine the association of the ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in IHD patients with and without smoking.", 
    "537": "One hundred seven male IHD patients admitted consecutively in the Cardiology unit of a Government Hospital and 100 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study.The patients were further divided into smokers and nonsmokers. All the subjects were checked for I/D polymorphism of ACE gene, which is mapped to 17q23.3 with OMIM no 106180, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The subjects were also investigated for lipid profile and ejection fraction (EF).", 
    "538": "We found significant difference in the distribution of D allele between patients and controls (p=0.009, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.139 to 2.517).The significantly lower EF (p<0.001) was suggestive of greater cardiovascular compromise in smokers. The frequency of ID genotype was significantly associated with cases compared to controls (p=0.012, OR 2.054, 95% CI 1.1694-3.624) but was not significantly associated with smokers as compared to nonsmokers.", 
    "539": "We infer significant association of D allele with IHD. The smokers with ID genotype should be put on prophylactic ACE inhibitor therapy to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with IHD.", 
    "540": "Approximately 5-10% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) exhibit hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), defined as a continued need for higher than 300 IU/kg/week doses of epoetin or a 1.5 mg/kg/week dose of darbepoetin. ESA hyporesponsiveness contributes to the morbidity, mortality and health-care economic burden of ESRD patients. The most common causes of ESA resistance are absolute or functional iron deficiency and inflammation. Maintaining adequate iron stores is clearly accepted as the most important strategy for reducing the ESA requirement and for enhancing ESA efficacy. Recent clinical studies have shown that iron administration to ESRD patients is associated with an increased risk of infection and atherosclerosis. ESA hyporesponsiveness due to chronic inflammation in ESRD patients has been reported to be improved by a number of interventions, including the use of biocompatible hemodialysis membranes, ultrapure dialysate, ascorbic acid therapy, vitamin E supplementation, and statin therapy. Other causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness include inadequate dialysis, hyperparathyroidism, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, primary bone marrow disorders, myelosuppressive agents, hemoglobinopathies, hemolysis, and hypersplenism. This article summarizes the common causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness and the proposed therapeutic interventions.", 
    "541": "SCLERODERMA: renal crisis (SRC), a somewhat rare but serious complication of systemic scleroderma, is one of only a few known rheumatologic emergencies; it presents in as many as 10% of patients with scleroderma. Before the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat SRC, the mortality rate for SRC was extremely high-as much as 90% after 1 year. However, the mortality rate has significantly improved with the early and aggressive use of ACE inhibitors. SRC typically includes acute renal failure and accelerated hypertension. Patients may report headache, changes in vision, fever, dyspnea, and encephalopathy. Laboratory study results can show elevated creatinine levels, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on blood smear. Given this clinical and laboratory presentation, SRC can easily be mistaken for TTP in clinical practice, as we demonstrate in 2 presentations of similar cases of SRC, the first in a 36-year-old Caucasian woman and the second in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman. In both cases, SRC masqueraded as TTP, and both patients were almost mistakenly treated for TTP until the clinical picture changed and certain laboratory test and kidney biopsy results confirmed otherwise.",

A large proportion of women who have \"normal\" coronary arteries on angiography without any significant evidence of flow-limiting disease also have biochemical or imaging evidence of myocardial ischemia. In these women it is believed to be a dysfunction of coronary microcirculation and/or macrocirculation, or vasotonic angina (VA), that leads to abnormal vasoconstriction, and potentially to myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Despite having a \"normal\" or near normal coronary angiography, these women should therefore undergo additional testing with acetylcholine to assess endothelial function. Long-term survival is believed to be relatively good. Predictors of poorer prognosis include documentation of severe endothelial dysfunction and presence of concurrent angiographycally visible coronary atherosclerosis. Because atherosclerosis is common in patients with VA, medical and lifestyle interventions for preventing or treating atherosclerosis should be implemented when appropriate. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the mainstays of medical therapy for VA. Other agents have been tried with variable success, including beta-blockers. There are no available data on any specific treatment of VA in women (versus men).",

In regular clinic visits, his blood pressure was normotensive and serum creatinine (Cr) was within the normal range. On admission, hypertension (blood pressure 214/105 mmHg), proteinuria, and hypercreatinemia (3.6 mg/dL) led to the diagnosis of sclerotic renal crisis (SRC). Thrombocytopenia (5.4 \u00d7 10(4)/\u03bcL), erythrocyte fragmentation, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were suggestive of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). The immediate initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy and plasma exchange (PE) rapidly improved the disorientation and thrombocytopenia.

However, the median time taken by the patient to call the emergency services is often very long, up to 2 hours. The presence of a physician as first responder ensures good quality resuscitation in case of cardiac arrest, and allows recording of a first ECG, which can be very informative, especially in ACS without ST segment elevation. Treatment at this stage is limited to sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin. If the first ECG shows ST segment elevation, the patient should be immediately oriented for reperfusion, usually by percutaneous coronary intervention. in the absence of ST segment elevation, the diagnosis of ACS remains unconfirmed. This does not imply that the risk is lesser, but rather that the risk cannot be evaluated accurately in the pre-hospital setting. The use of risk scores can guide the choice of management towards an invasive strategy, including coronary angiography (immediately, or within 24-72 hours). Low-risk patients are candidates for an invasive strategy, provided non-invasive tests demonstrate the presence of ischemia. During the hospital phase, antiplatelet treatment should be initiated and must be adapted to the patient bleeding and thrombotic risk. Clopidogrel is recommended only in patients who are not amenable to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Statin therapy should be initiated from day one, regardless of the initial cholesterol level, preferably with 80 mg atorvastatin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers should also be prescribed to complete the medical prescription both in-hospital and in the long term.",

Here, we used the new Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) system to describe the incidence, predictors, and impact of AmB-induced AKI on hospital mortality in 162 patients treated with AmB (120 with deoxycholate preparation and 42 with liposomal preparation). KDIGO stage 1 requires an absolute increase of \u22650.3 mg/dl or \u22651.5\u00d7 over baseline serum creatinine (SCr), while stage 2 requires \u22652\u00d7, and stage 3 requires \u22653\u00d7. A binary KDIGO definition (KDIGObin) corresponds to stage \u22651. For comparison, we included two definitions of AKI traditionally utilized in nephrotoxicity studies: \u22650.5 mg/dl (NT0.5) and \u22652\u00d7 (NT2\u00d7) increase in baseline SCr. The overall incidence of AmB-induced AKI by KDIGObin was 58.6% (stage 1, 30.9%; stage 2, 18.5%; stage 3, 9.3%). Predictors of AKI by KDIGObin were older age and use of furosemide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I). Traditional criteria detected lower incidences of AKI, at 45.1% (NT0.5) and 27.8% (NT2\u00d7). Predictors of AKI by traditional criteria were older age and use of vancomycin (NT0.5) and use of vancomycin and vasopressors (NT2\u00d7). KDIGObin detected AKI 2 days earlier than the most sensitive traditional criterion. However, only traditional criteria were associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. In conclusion, the increase in sensitivity of KDIGObin is accompanied by a loss of specificity and ability to predict outcomes. Prospective studies are required to weigh the potential gain from early AKI detection against the potential loss from undue changes in management in patients with subtle elevations in SCr.",

We examined, in hypertensive rats, whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme-independent enzymes generating angiotensin II in the tissues modulate blood pressure, peripheral circulation and renal function. What is the main finding and its importance? The results suggest that chymostatin-sensitive enzymes diminish vascular tone in renal and extrarenal vascular beds. Chymase or similar chymostatin-sensitive enzymes have a significant role in the synthesis of angiotensin II in different tissues but do not control blood pressure in the short term, similarly in salt-dependent or Goldblatt-type rat hypertension. In salt-dependent hypertension, chymase blockade protected renal outer medullary perfusion, probably by reducing the angiotensin II content in the kidney. Chymase is presumed to be a crucial enzyme of the non-angiotensin-converting enzyme pathway of angiotensin II (Ang II) generation in tissues, a process involved in vascular remodelling and development of hypertension. We examined the role of chymase in hypertension induced by exposure of uninephrectomized rats to high dietary salt intake (UNX HS) and in the Goldblatt renal artery stenosis (two-kidney, one-clip) model. In acute experiments with anaesthetized rats of either model, chymostatin at 2 mg kg(-1) h(-1) or 0.05% DMSO solvent was infused i.v. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, iliac blood flow (a measure of hindlimb perfusion), total renal blood flow and intrarenal regional perfusion (laser-Doppler technique) were measured continuously, along with the glomerular filtration rate and renal excretion. In both models, chymase blockade distinctly decreased plasma and tissue Ang II without lowering mean blood pressure or consistently altering the other functional parameters measured. Unexpectedly, in Goldblatt hypertensive rats the blockade increased the renal and hindlimb vascular resistances by 51 and 33%, respectively (P < 0.05). In UNX HS hypertensive rats, chymase blockade abolished the solvent-induced decrease in outer medullary blood flow. We conclude that chymase or similar chymostatin-sensitive enzyme(s) has a significant role in the synthesis of Ang II in different tissues but does not participate in short-term control of blood pressure in salt-dependent or Goldblatt-type rat hypertension. In the Goldblatt model, chymase appeared to reduce the renal and hindlimb vascular resistances by an unknown mechanism. In salt-dependent hypertension, chymase blockade protected renal outer medullary perfusion, probably by reducing Ang II content in the kidney.",

Studies were included if they were published in English, conducted in humans \u2265\u00a018\u00a0years of age or older, and used noninvestigational medications. Immunosuppressive medications such as the antiproliferative mycophenolate, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, and the proliferation signal inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus have been shown to prevent the development of CAV. Certain cardiovascular medications, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), gemfibrozil, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have also demonstrated efficacy in preventing this disease process. Prevention of CAV has also been observed with prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus infection and antioxidant medications.

A total of 59 L. helveticus strains were isolated from traditional fermented dairy products and the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fermented milks produced with the isolated microorganisms was assayed. The ACE-inhibitory activity of 38 L. helveticus strains was more than 50%, and 3 strains (IMAU80872, IMAU80852, and IMAU80851) expressing the highest ACE-inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. Particularly, the gastrointestinal protease tolerance and thermostability of the ACE-inhibitory activity in the fermented milks were assessed. Based on these 2 criteria, IMAU80872 was found to be superior over the other 2 strains. Furthermore, IMAU80872 exhibited a high in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity at the following fermentation conditions: fermentation temperature at 40\u00b0C, inoculation concentration of 1\u00d710(6) cfu/mL, and fermentation for 18h. Finally, by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we observed changes of the metabolome along the milk fermentation process of IMAU80872.

We collected information about the following groups of drugs prescribed: aspirin, b-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), statins, and sartans.", 
    "650": "Before surgery, 89.78% of the total population of patients received b-blockers, 81.56% ACEI, 88.27% statins, and 3.19% sartans. After CABG, 94.48% of patients received aspirin, 96.04% b-blockers, 85.16% ACEI, 92.09% statins, and 2.14% sartans. During the years analysed, a declining trend away from preoperative prescription of b-blockers (p < 0.001), ACEI (p < 0.001), and statins (p < 0.001) was observed. In contrast, sartans (p < 0.01) were more often administered over time. At the date of discharge, the tendency to prescribe b-blockers (p < 0.05), ACEI (p < 0.001), and statins (p < 0.001) was also declining.",

To evaluate attitudes and preferences for the clinical management of hypertension and hypertension associated with COPD by a large community sample of physicians in Italy. A predefined 18-item survey questionnaire was anonymously administered to both specialised physicians (SPs) and general practitioners (GPs), who have been included in an educational programme, performed between January and June 2014. A total of 1181 physicians (767 males, mean age 55.8 \u00b1 7.3 years, average age of medical activity 27.6 \u00b1 8.3 years), among whom 64 (5.4 %) SPs and 1117 (94.6 %) GPs, provided 21,809 valid answers to the survey questionnaire. Concomitant presence of hypertension and COPD was frequently associated (21-40 %) with hypertension-related organ damage and comorbidities. Concomitant presence of hypertension and COPD was able to affect physicians' ability to achieve the recommended therapeutic targets. To achieve the recommended BP goals, ACE inhibitors or ARBs were considered the most effective antihypertensive strategies, both in monotherapies and in combination therapies with either diuretics or calcium-channel blockers. This observational, cross-sectional survey provides useful information on physicians' attitudes and preferences for the clinical management of patients with hypertension and hypertension associated with COPD.", 
    "653": "The Joint National Committee (JNC 8) hypertension guidelines have modified the blood pressure goals across the spectrum of disease processes and patient characteristics. This article will elucidate these changes and help clinicians improve the clinical care of patients with hypertension. Patients are now conceptually categorized into two different patient populations: those who are at a low- or high-risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A low-risk population comprises patients aged 60 or older who do not have disease processes that enhance ASCVD or CKD disease development. High-risk patients are those with CKD and/or diabetes, and patients less than 60 years of age who remain at risk of future development. The current recommendation for blood-pressure goals in the low- and high-risk population is 150/90 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg, respectively. In all patients considered for antihypertensive therapy, the first line antihypertensive pharmacotherapy should include either a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Beta blockers no longer have a role as standalone therapy. Thiazide- type diuretics and CCB continue to demonstrate benefit in the African American population and should continue to be considered as first line agents. CKD patients with concomitant hypertension should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB.", 
    "654": "Treatment of hypertension remains challenging in clinical practice. One major problem is incorrect utilization of the principal drug classes. Drugs from each class are currently used in accordance with an assumption that the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect is dose dependent. While this is true for most drugs, it is not appropriate for all drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).", 
    "655": "This review is based on a PubMed/Cochrane database search for articles on the dose-dependent effect of RAS blockers on BP and cardiovascular protection.", 
    "656": "Of the RAS blockers, most angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have a flat dose-response curve for BP decrease, meaning an increase in dose prolongs duration of action, but does not yield greater potency. Perindopril is the only ACE inhibitor to show a real dose-response curve for BP decrease. While the effectiveness of RAS blockers on target organ damage is dose dependent and at least partially unrelated to BP control, there is evidence that the only way to obtain a beneficial effect is to use them at full dose. Thus, RAS blockers need to be used at the correct dose, based on the results of controlled clinical trials and meta-analysis. Furthermore, for all-cause mortality, ACE inhibitors have been shown to be better than ARBs, a specific efficacy supported by perindopril-based studies including ASCOT-BPLA (the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-BP Lowering Arm), ADVANCE (the Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation trial) and HYVET (HYpertension in the Very Elderly Trial).",

CVD accounts for 45-50% of deaths among dialysis patients. Therapy of acute and chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) that is effective in the general population is frequently less effective in patients with advanced CKD. Drug therapy in such patients may require dose modification in some cases. Oral anti-platelet drugs are less effective in those with advanced CKD than in persons with normal or near normal renal function. The intravenous antiplatelet drugs eptifibatide and tirofiban both require dose reductions in patients with advanced CKD. Enoxaparin requires dose reduction in early stage CKD and is contraindicated in hemodialysis patients. Unfractionated heparin and warfarin maybe used without dose adjustment in CKD patients. Atenolol, acetbutolol and nadolol may require dose adjustments in CKD. Metoprolol and carvedilol do not. Calcium channel blockers and nitrates do not require dose adjustment, whereas ranolazine does. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may safely be used in CKD patients with close observation for hyperkalemia. The safety of spironolactone in such patients is questionable. Statins are less effective in reducing cardiovascular complication in CKD patients and their initiation is not recommended in dialysis patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with higher shortterm mortality, but better long-term morbidity and mortality than percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with advanced CKD with non-ST segment ACS and chronic CHD.",

Adherence to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists was 49.3%, 40.4% and 16.1%, respectively, and was associated with better survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. NDMC was consumed less frequently by deceased (76.0%; MedCI 2.55\u2009\u00b1\u20093.04) than surviving (79.3%; 3.60\u2009\u00b1\u20093.81) or readmitted (78.4%; 3.80\u2009\u00b1\u20094.13) patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for deceased vs both other).

Cases were subjects who died or were hospitalized for reinfarction or heart failure in the subsequent year, and each was matched with up to four controls. The primary outcome was a composite of reinfarction, heart failure or death. The primary analysis examined whether use of the prodrug ACE inhibitors ramipril or perindopril was more common among cases than use of lisinopril, an active ACE inhibitor.",

TRMHs showed different degrees of hydrolysis (DH from 11 to 22%) and hydrophobic/hydrophilic peptide ratio. Protein content varied from 71 to 74%. Gly, Pro, Asp and Asn were the most prominent amino acids, while hypoxanthine was the major nucleotide related compound present. The antioxidant activity was assayed using various tests. TRMH-Neutrase exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in DPPH scavenging, reducing power and inhibition of \u03b2-carotene bleaching tests. However in the total antioxidative efficacy, TRMH-Crude exhibited the highest activity. TRMH-Crude and TRMH-Neutrase were the most potent to prevent DNA oxidation by Fenton reagent. Concerning anti-ACE activity, TRMH-A26 and TRMH-Neutrase exhibited the highest activity with 87% at 5mg/ml. The results revealed that TRMHs could be employed as a protein source in food additive processing or diets for aquatic organisms and other farmed animals.",

The purpose of our study was to assess the association of a spectrum of CVD related genes and combined state of hypertension hypercholesterolemia (HH) in unrelated Lebanese. Twelve polymorphisms were studied by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization of DNA from 171 healthy individuals and 144 HH subjects. Two genes were significantly associated with HH: ACE (OR: 9.20, P<0.0001) and PAI-1 (OR: 2.29, P = 0.007), respectively with the occurrence of the risky alleles \"Del\" and \"4G\". The frequencies of the Del and 4G alleles were found to be 0.98 and 0.90 in the HH group versus 0.84 and 0.79 in the healthy group, respectively. Serum ACE activity and PAI-I increased significantly with Del/Del and 4G/5G genotypes. The co-expression of Del/4G(+/+) was detected in 113 out of 171 (66.0%) controls and 125 out of 144 (86.8%) HH subjects. Del/4G(-/-) was detected in only 6 (3.5%) controls and undetected in the HH group. Three venous thrombosis related genes [FV(Leiden), MTHFR(A1298C) and FXIII(V34L)] were significantly related to the prominence of the co-expression of Del/4G(+/+). A range of 2 to 8 combined polymorphisms co-expressed per subject where 5 mutations were the most detected. In Del/4G(+/+) subjects, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) produced significant elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 contrary to IL-10, and no variations occurred for IL-4. ACE inhibitor (ramipril) in combination with statin (atorvastatin) and not alone reversed significantly the situation. This first report from Lebanon sheds light on an additional genetic predisposition of a complex spectrum of genes involved in CVD and suggests that the most requested gene FVL by physicians may not be sufficient to diagnose eventual future problems that can occur in the cardiovascular system. Subjects expressing the double mutations (Del/4G) are at high risk for the onset of CVDs.",

Renal biopsy showed crescentic poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis (CPAGN) with isolated C3 deposition in the glomeruli. Electro-microscope examination showed subepithelial deposition of electron dense material. She received the double pulse therapies of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as well as the treatment of oral prednisolone, angiotensin converting enzyme-II (ACE-II) inhibitor, dipyridamole and traditional Chinese medicine. The complete clinical remission was achieved after 9 months. No serious adverse effects were observed during the follow-up. Our findings indicated that CPAGN with isolated C3 deposition might have a favorable prognosis after aggressive immunosuppressive treatment. However, the influence of isolated C3 deposition on CPAGN prognosis remains to be clarified.", 
    "675": "Prenatal exposure to elevated testosterone levels induces adult life hypertension associated with selective impairments in endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated relaxation in mesenteric arteries. We tested whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril restores EDHF function through regulating the activities of small (Kcnn3) and intermediate (Kcnn4) conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in mesenteric arteries. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle or testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 15 to 19), and their 6-mo-old adult male offspring were examined. A subset of rats in these two groups was given enalapril (40 mg/kg/day) for 2 wk through drinking water. Blood pressures were assessed through carotid arterial catheter and endothelium-dependent mesenteric arterial EDHF relaxation, using wire myography. Ace and Kcnn3 and Kcnn4 channel expression levels were also examined. Renal and vascular Ace expression and plasma angiotensin II levels were increased in testosterone offspring. Blood pressure levels were significantly higher in testosterone offspring than in controls, and treatment with enalapril significantly attenuated blood pressure in testosterone offspring. EDHF relaxation in testosterone offspring was reduced compared to that in controls, and it was significantly restored by enalapril treatment. Kcnn4 channel expression and function were similar between control and testosterone rats, but it was not affected by enalapril treatment. Relaxation mediated by Kcnn3 was impaired in testosterone offspring, and it was normalized by enalapril treatment. Furthermore, enalapril treatment restored expression levels of Kcnn3 channels. These findings suggest that enalapril has a positive influence on endothelial function with improvement in EDHF relaxation through normalization of Kcnn3 expression and activity.",

    "683": "The detailed mechanisms determining the course of congestive heart failure (CHF) in hypertensive subjects with associated renal dysfunction remain unclear. In Ren-2 transgenic rats (TGR), a model of angiotensin II (ANG II)-dependent hypertension, CHF was induced by volume overload achieved by creation of the aorto-caval fistula (ACF). In these rats we investigated the putative pathophysiological contribution of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and compared it with the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). We found that untreated ACF TGR exhibited marked intrarenal and myocardial deficiency of EETs and impairment of renal function. Chronic treatment of these rats with cis-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)cyclohexyloxy]benzoic acid (c-AUCB, 3 mg/L in drinking water), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) which normally degrades EETs, increased intrarenal and myocardial EETs, markedly improved survival rate, and increased renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and fractional sodium excretion, without altering RAS activity. Chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) with trandolapril, (6 mg/L in drinking water) improved survival rate even more, and also inhibited the development of renal dysfunction; these beneficial actions were associated with significant suppression of the vasoconstrictor/sodium retaining axis and further activation of the vasodilatory/natriuretic axis of the systemic and intrarenal RAS, without modifying tissue availability of biologically active fatty acid epoxides. In conclusion, these findings strongly suggest that chronic sEH inhibition and chronic treatment with ACEi, each of them altering a different vasoactive system, delay or even prevent the onset of decompensation of CHF in ACF TGR, probably by preventing the development of renal dysfunction.",

Experimental studies have provided evidence of a pathogenic role for endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its cognate receptors in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. ET-1, mainly through the activation of ETA receptor, contributes to renal cell injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. In animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, ETA-selective antagonists have been shown to provide renoprotective effects, supplying the rationale for clinical trials in patients with diabetic nephropathy with ETA-receptor antagonists administered in addition to renin-angiotensin system blockade.",

With the consent of volunteers, blood and urine samples were collected after an overnight fasting. Samples were collected from the diabetic patients before and after treatment for 6 weeks. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out on the aliquoted samples to measure the concentration of kininase II. NO was detected via colorimetry. Plasma Kininase II or ACE levels were significantly (P <0.01) increased by 18% in untreated diabetics when compared with healthy volunteers. However, after treatment there was a significant decrease of 20% in their ACE levels. Plasma prekallikrein levels were raised significantly (P <0.01) by 28% in diabetic patients in contrast with the control subjects and the levels were significantly reduced (P <0.0001) by 44% after treatment with metformin hydrochloride. NO levels were found to be significantly decreased in plasma by 56% and in urine by 62% in untreated diabetic patients as compared with the healthy subjects. However, when the treated diabetic patients were compared with untreated diabetics, there was an increase of 50% in plasma and 37% in urine samples. The high levels of kininase II, prekallikrein, and reduced NO may be partly responsible for the induction of renal, cardiac, and hypertensive complications associated with type 2 diabetes. Reduced NO level is an indication of endothelial dysfunction resulting in increased blood pressure. Oral anti-diabetic treatment is associated with protective effects through the reduction of kininase II (ACE), prekallikrein, and elevation of NO levels.",

Adjusted ORs for OMT from period 1 to period 6 were as follows: 1, 1.14 (P = 0.024), 1.21 (P = 0.001), 1.40 (P < 0.001), 1.47 (P < 0.001), and 1.69 (P < 0.001), respectively.",

    "697": "The risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is high in chronic kidney disease patients, and it increases with the progression of kidney function deterioration. The most common causes of SDC are the following: ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia torsade de pointes, sustained ventricular fibrillation and bradyarrhythmia. Dialysis influences cardiovascular system and results in hemodynamic disturbances as well as electrolyte shifts altering myocardial electrophysiology. Studies suggest that this procedure exerts both detrimental (poor volume control can exacerbate hypertension and left ventricle hypertrophy) and beneficial effects (associated with fluid removal and subsequent decrease in left ventricle stretch). Dialysis-related vulnerability to serious arrhythmias is the result of sudden shifts in fluid status and electrolytes, particularly potassium, which alter the physiological milieu. Also Ca(2+) ions, in which concentration alters during dialysis, are of key importance in the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes, thus exerting significant effects on hemodynamics. Due to the fact that SCD occurs with similar frequency in peritoneal dialysis and in hemodialysis patients, it seems that end-stage renal disease factors are more important than the specific ones associated with dialysis type. The results of randomized trials suggested that hemodialysis patients may not derive the same benefit of cardiovascular disease therapy including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as the general population with normal kidney function. Noninvasive tests used to stratify SCD risk in HD patients have poor positive value, and thus, combining tests including HRV, baroreceptor sensitivity and effectiveness index as well as its function indices and heart rate turbulence should be implemented. There are only few large randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the influence of cardioprotective medications or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in dialysis patients on life quality and survival, and their results are sometimes contradictory. The decision concerning treatment and/or ICD implantation in this group of patients should be made on the basis of careful assessment of individual risk factors. Moreover, due to the high hazard of cardiovascular mortality including SCD in dialysis patients, physicians should concentrate on the early selection of high-risk patients, monitoring them and introduction of preventive measures.", 
    "698": "The interaction of PEGylated anti-hypertensive drugs, amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril with lipid bilayer membrane dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) has been studied in nine different simulation systems consisting of 128 lipid molecules and appropriate number of water molecules by molecular dynamics method and by utilizing GROMACS software. The influences of PEGylation on the mentioned drugs and the differences in application of two types of spacer molecules on the performance of drugs and DMPC membrane have been evaluated and mass density of the components in the simulation box, mean square displacement (MSD), electrostatic potential, hydrogen bonding, radial distribution function (RDF), area per lipid, order parameter, and angle distribution of the component molecules including drug, DMPC and PEG has been investigated. Furthermore, umbrella sampling analysis indicated that, PEGylation of the drugs made amlodipine to behave more hydrophilic, whereas in case of lisinopril and atenolol, PEGylation made these drugs to behave more hydrophobic. In almost all of the simulated systems, PEGylation increased the diffusion coefficient of the drugs.",

Hypercalciuria was detected in 23 patients and was related to acidosis (P=0.028), higher lactate levels (5.9 \u00b1 3.5 versus 3.7 \u00b1 1.7 mmol/L; P=0.013) and smaller height (-2.1 \u00b1 1.5 SD versus -0.8 \u00b1 1.5 SD; P=0.026). Urolithiasis was diagnosed in 7 cases. Glomerular disease (19/38) was more frequent in cases with severe hypertriglyceridemia (P=0.042) and occurred at an older age (P=0.007). Microalbuminuria occurred in 15/31 cases; ACE inhibitors were prescribed in only 8 cases. The frequency of renal complications did not differ according to the diet group (continuous enteral feeding or uncooked starch). Logistic regression concluded as risk factors: lactic acidosis for tubular disease and age>10 years for glomerular disease.",

    "703": "Omapatrilat (OMA), which simultaneously inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin (NEP)), is widely used in experimental protocols related to hypertension and heart failure. The penetration of OMA across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the effects of ACE/NEP inhibition on the recovery from ischaemic stroke have not yet been investigated. Angiotensin (Ang) I injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or intravenously (IV) is converted to Ang II by ACE and induces an immediate increase in blood pressure. The pressor responses to OMA administered ICV, orally or IV were studied in male Wistar rats instrumented with an ICV and arterial and venous catheters. OMA infused ICV rapidly appeared in the systemic circulation and more effectively attenuated the systemic than the central pressor responses to Ang I. OMA administered orally (5, 25, 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/kg body weight) or IV (0.5, 1, 5, 25\u00a0\u03bcmol/kg body weight) completely abolished increases in blood pressure to IV Ang I up to 2\u00a0h after treatment. The pressor responses to ICV Ang I were not altered, indicating that systemically administered OMA does not cross the BBB. To study the effects of ACE and NEP inhibition in the brain on the recovery from ischaemic stroke, OMA was infused ICV over a 5-day period before and 24\u00a0h after the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 90\u00a0min. ICV application of OMA had no effect on infarction volume and marginally improved neurological outcome. We demonstrate for the first time that simultaneous inhibition of ACE and NEP in the brain tissue does not alter the recovery from ischaemic stroke.",

In the paediatric population, it is used most commonly for the treatment of heart failure, hypertension in type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Due to the lack of a suitable liquid formulation, the current study evaluates the development of a range of oral liquid formulations of ramipril along with their in vitro and in vivo absorption studies. Three different formulation development approaches were studied: solubilisation using acetic acid as a co-solvent, complexation with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) and suspension development using xanthan gum. Systematic optimisation of formulation parameters for the different strategies resulted in the development of products stable for 12 months at long-term stability conditions. In vivo evaluation showed C(max) of 10.48\u2009\u00b5g/ml for co-solvent, 13.04\u2009\u00b5g/ml for the suspension and 29.58\u2009\u00b5g/ml for the cyclodextrin-based ramipril solution. Interestingly, both ramipril solution (co-solvent) and the suspension showed a T(max) of 2.5\u2009h, however, cyclodextrin-based ramipril produced T(max) at 0.75\u2009h following administration.

Papers from 1970 to the present, with particular emphasis on the past decade, were examined. In addition, abstracted information translated to English in PubMed was also included. Finally, studies and reviews relevant to nutrient or drug uptake, particularly in human intestine were included for evaluation.

During the ensuing intestinal phase, these hydrolytic products are transported into the epithelial cell and, eventually, the portal vein. A critical component of this process is the uptake of intact di-peptides and tri-peptides by an independent PepT1. A number of \"peptide-mimetic\" pharmaceutical agents may also be transported through this carrier, important for uptake of different antibiotics, antiviral agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In addition, specific peptide products of intestinal bacteria may also be transported by PepT1, with initiation and persistence of an immune response including increased cytokine production and associated intestinal inflammatory changes. Interestingly, these inflammatory changes may also be attenuated with orally-administered anti-inflammatory tripeptides administered as site-specific nanoparticles and taken up by this PepT1 transport protein.",

We examined several agents that might prevent renal impairment or enhance the recovery of renal function after ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Different degrees of preventive effects were observed in rats treated with captopril, BQ-123 (endothelin type A receptor antagonist), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor), and losartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist). Only minimal changes in renal morphology were observed after treatment with losartan, SNP, captopril, and BQ-123 compared with control animals. On the other hand, lesions were prominent in the N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME)- and L-arginine-treated rats. The Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity of ischemic kidneys was, however, preserved in all treatment groups, except in those treated with L-arginine and L-NAME, which showed a marked reduction in Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity. Our post-treatment data suggest that losartan and SNP have the greatest potential for therapeutic use to mitigate post-ischemic renal damage and functional impairment.",

This study examined the effects of chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor (captopril, 3 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan, 3 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), or AT2 receptor agonist (CGP42112A, 0.14 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) on remodeling of the guinea pig intrinsic cardiac plexus following chronic myocardial infarction (MI). MI was surgically induced and animals recovered for 6 or 7 wk, with or without drug treatment. Intracellular voltage recordings from whole mounts of the cardiac plexus were used to monitor changes in neuronal responses to norepinephrine (NE), muscarinic agonists (bethanechol), or ANG II. MI produced an increase in neuronal excitability with NE and a loss of sensitivity to ANG II. MI animals treated with captopril exhibited increased neuronal excitability with NE application, while MI animals treated with CGP42112A did not. Losartan treatment of MI animals did not alter excitability with NE compared with untreated MIs, but these animals did show an enhanced synaptic efficacy. This effect on synaptic function was likely due to presynaptic AT1 receptors, since ANG II was able to reduce output to nerve fiber stimulation in control animals, and this effect was prevented by inclusion of losartan in the bath solution. Analysis of AT receptor expression by Western blot showed a decrease in both AT1 and AT2 receptors with MI that was reversed by all three drug treatments. These data indicate that neuronal remodeling of the guinea pig cardiac plexus following MI is mediated, in part, by activation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors.",

However, other antiproteinuric treatments have begun to be studied, such as direct renin inhibitors or aldosterone blockers. Beyond antiproteinuric treatments, other drugs such as pentoxifylline or bardoxolone have yielded conflicting results.

Two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats were treated with lisinopril (10\u2009mg/kg/day for four weeks) or with pyrvinium pamoate (Wnt signaling inhibitor, single dose of 60\u2009ug/kg, every 3 days for 2 weeks). The treatment with lisinopril reduced the systolic blood pressure from 220 \u00b1 4 in 2K1C rats to 112 \u00b1 5\u2009mmHg (P < 0.05), whereas the reduction in blood pressure with pyrvinium pamoate was not significant (212 \u00b1 6 in 2K1C rats to 170 \u00b1 3\u2009mmHg, P > 0.05). The levels of collagen types I and III, osteopontin, and fibronectin decreased in the unclipped kidney in both treatments compared with 2K1C rats.

As established in landmark randomised trials and recommended in clinical guidelines, prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease focuses on control of the two main renal risk factors, hyperglycaemia and systemic hypertension. Treatment of systemic hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is advocated because these drugs seem to exert specific renoprotective effects beyond blood pressure lowering. Emerging evidence shows that obesity, glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria, and dyslipidaemia might also adversely affect the kidney in diabetes. Control of these risk factors could have additional benefits on renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, despite multifactorial treatment approaches, residual risk for the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes remains, and novel strategies or therapies to treat the disease are urgently needed. Several drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes are associated with pleiotropic effects that could favourably or unfavourably change patients' renal risk profile. We review the risk factors and treatment of diabetic kidney disease, and describe the pleiotropic effects of widely used drugs in type 2 diabetes management on renal outcomes, with special emphasis on antihyperglycaemic drugs.",

    "740": "Patients with complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular complications have increased hospital stay with greater economic burden. Prevention of complications should be started before the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) by working on risk factors and thereafter by intervention upon confirmatory diagnosis which can prevent further damage to \u03b2-cells. The actual risk of getting microvascular complications like microalbuminuria and retinopathy progression starts at glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7%. As per the American Diabetes Association, a new pediatric glycemic control target of HbA1c <7.5% across all ages replaces previous guidelines that had called for different targets by age. Evidence shows that prevalence of microvascular complications is greater in patients with age >20 years as compared to patients <10 years of age. Screening of these complications should be done regularly, and appropriate preventive strategies should be followed. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blocker reduce progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria and increase the regression rate to normoalbuminuria. Diabetic microvascular complications can be controlled with tight glycemic therapy, dyslipidemia management and blood pressure control along with renal function monitoring, lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation and low-protein diet. An integrated and personalized care would reduce the risk of development of microvascular complications in T1DM patients. The child with diabetes who receives limited care is more likely to develop long-term complications at an earlier age. Screening for subclinical complications and early interventions with intensive therapy is the need of the hour.",

We aimed to clarify the relationships between the chronic use of different classes of antihypertensive medications and different types of falls, to determine the effect of medication dose, and to assess whether the risk of falls is associated with differences in cerebral blood flow. We assessed demographics, clinical characteristics, and chronic antihypertensive medication use in 598 community-dwelling people with hypertension, aged 70 to 97 years, then followed them prospectively for self-reported falls using monthly calendar postcards and telephone interviews. Antihypertensive medication use was not associated with an increased risk of falls. Participants reporting use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a significantly decreased 1-year risk of injurious falls (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.96), whereas those using calcium channel blockers had a decreased risk of all falls (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.91) and indoor falls (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.91), compared with participants not taking these drugs. Larger doses of these classes were associated with a lower fall risk. Participants taking calcium channel blockers had higher cerebral blood flow than those not taking these medications.

We also investigated whether ACEi might thereby improve atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) efficiency. We studied renal cortical PDE1-5 isozyme activities in sham (SH)-operated, MI rats and in MI rats treated with perindopril (ACEi) 1\u00a0month after coronary artery ligation. Circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), its second intracellular messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cGMP/ANP ratio were also determined. Cortical cGMP-PDE2 (80.3 vs. 65.1\u00a0pmol/min/mg) and cGMP-PDE1 (50.7 vs. 30.1\u00a0pmol/min/mg), and cAMP-PDE2 (161 vs. 104.1\u00a0pmol/min/mg) and cAMP-PDE4 (307.5 vs. 197.2\u00a0pmol/min/mg) activities were higher in MI than in SH rats. Despite increased ANP plasma level, ANP efficiency tended to be decreased in MI compared to SH rats. Perindopril restored PDE activities and tended to improve ANP efficiency in MI rats. One month after coronary ligation, perindopril treatment of MI rats prevents the increase in renal cortical PDE activities. This may contribute to increase renal ANP efficiency in MI rats.",

    "748": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition is 1 of the most effective strategies for the management of heart failure with reduced systolic function. However, trials that included patients with preserved systolic function have not shown a clear beneficial effect. Pooling evidence from several heart failure trials provides the opportunity to better assess the differential effects of RAAS inhibition across the continuum of systolic function. The authors searched MEDLINE for large-scale trials published from 1966 to March 2014 that compared RAAS inhibitors against placebos. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were conducted in heart failure populations with either clinical signs of heart failure or reduced ejection fractions. Inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to pool outcomes of interest, with metaregression used to test for trends. In 16 trials with 54,621 randomized heart failure participants, RAAS inhibition reduced the risks for hospitalization for heart failure by 20% (relative risk [RR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 0.83), cardiovascular mortality by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.90), and all-cause mortality by 11% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92). However, proportional effects decreased with increasing mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for all outcomes (p for trend <0.01). Although there was no significant proportional effect on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in trials with a mean LVEF >50%, RAAS inhibition was still found to decrease the risk for heart failure hospitalization in patients with preserved LVEFs (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97). In conclusion, the relative beneficial effects of RAAS inhibition in heart failure decreases with increasing left ventricular systolic function. Nonetheless, RAAS inhibition significantly reduces the risks for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with moderately reduced LVEFs and the incidence of hospitalization in patients with preserved left ventricular function.", 
    "749": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized as an episodic swelling disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinical features include nonpitting edema of external or mucosal body surfaces, and patients often present with swelling of the extremities, abdominal pain, and swelling of the mouth and throat, which can lead to asphyxiation. Patients with HAE classically have no associated urticaria, which is often referred to as nonhistaminergic angioedema. Treatment for HAE involves long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis, and management of acute attacks. Up until the past few years, acute HAE episodes were predominately treated with supportive measures. Three classes of medications have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of acute HAE attacks. Ecallantide, a recombinant protein that acts as a reversible inhibitor of kallikrein, is currently indicated for acute attacks of HAE in those aged \u226512 years. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials, EDEMA3 and EDEMA4, patients treated with 30 mg of ecallantide demonstrated statistically significant improvement in symptoms compared to those on placebo. In addition to its use as treatment for HAE, ecallantide has been used off label in the management of nonhistaminergic angioedema, not due to HAE. Ecallantide has shown promise in the treatment of these other forms; however, data are limited to mainly case reports at this time. Ecallantide is generally a safe and well-tolerated medication; however, based on reports of anaphylaxis, ecallantide does contain a black box warning. Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, ecallantide cannot be self-administered and must be given by a health care professional. Overall, ecallantide is a safe and effective medication for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE.",

The cluster TSTI0006C was analyzed in the main 25 amino acid residues and named T.\u00a0stigmurus Hypotensin (TistH), showing a molecular mass of 2.7\u00a0kDa, an absence of cysteines and the presence of two C-terminal proline residues, which are a bradykinin-potentiating peptide (BPP) signature. Here, we describe the homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of TistH. In addition, we evaluated the cardiovascular effects elicited by TistH in normotensive rats. Firstly, TistH showed no cytotoxic effect on horse erythrocyte. Furthermore, in normotensive rats TistH was able to potentiate the hypotensive action of bradykinin (BK) and induced a vasorelaxant effect in mesenteric artery rings by endothelium-dependent release of nitric oxide (NO) and demonstrated independent inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Our data can contribute to a better understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of TistH and suggest its potential use in cardiovascular diseases.",

    "754": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a progressive proteinuric renal disorder in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease worldwide, particularly in developed countries. Therapeutic targeting of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is the most validated clinical strategy for slowing disease progression. DKD is paradoxically a low systematic renin state with an increased intrarenal RAS activity implicated in its pathogenesis. Angiotensin II (AngII), the main peptide of RAS, is not only a vasoactive peptide but functions as a growth factor, activating interstitial fibroblasts and mesangial and tubular cells, while promoting the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. AngII also promotes podocyte injury through increased calcium influx and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Blockade of the RAS using either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers can attenuate progressive glomerulosclerosis in animal models, and slows disease progression in humans with DKD. In this review, we summarize the role of intrarenal RAS activation in the pathogenesis and progression of DKD and the rationale for RAS inhibition in this population.",

    "759": "Increased vascular 20-HETE is associated with hypertension and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) through induction of vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression. Cyp4a12tg mice, whose Cyp4a12-20-HETE synthase expression is under the control of a tetracycline (doxycycline, DOX) promoter, were used to assess the contribution of ACE/RAS to microvascular remodeling in 20-HETE-dependent hypertension. Treatment of Cyp4a12tg mice with DOX increased systolic blood pressure (SBP; 136 \u00b1 2 vs. 102 \u00b1 1 mmHg; P < 0.05), and this increase was prevented by administration of 20-HEDGE, lisinopril, or losartan. DOX-induced hypertension was associated with microvascular dysfunction and remodeling of preglomerular microvessels, which was prevented by 20-HEDGE, a 20-HETE antagonist, yet only lessened, but not prevented, by lisinopril or losartan. In ACE 3/3 mice, which lack vascular endothelial ACE, administration of 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a known inducer of 20-HETE production, increased SBP; however, the increase was about 50% of that in wild-type (WT) mice (151 \u00b1 1 vs. 126 \u00b1 1 mmHg). Losartan and 20-HEDGE prevented the DHT-induced increase in SBP in WT and ACE 3/3 mice. DHT treatment increased 20-HETE production and microvascular remodeling in WT and ACE 3/3 mice; however, remodeling was attenuated in the ACE 3/3 mice as opposed to WT mice (15.83 \u00b1 1.11 vs. 22.17 \u00b1 0.92 \u03bcm; P < 0.05). 20-HEDGE prevented microvascular remodeling in WT and ACE 3/3 mice, while losartan had no effect on microvascular remodeling in ACE 3/3. Taken together, these results suggest that RAS contributes to 20-HETE-mediated microvascular remodeling in hypertension and that 20-HETE-driven microvascular remodeling independent of blood pressure elevation does not fully rely on ACE activity in the vascular endothelium.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be continued, but if held, may be restarted as soon as feasible. Routine aspirin therapy is not recommended without previous coronary stent implantation or risk assessment for myocardial ischemia. Elective noncardiac surgery should not be performed within 30 days of bare metal stent or 12 months of drug-eluting stent implantation because of in-stent thrombosis as well as bleeding risk from dual antiplatelet therapy during surgery.

The sham-operated group was used as a negative control. Rats were administered intragastrically with the corresponding drugs or drinking water for seven weeks. At the end of the treatment, the left ventricular weight index and heart weight index were assessed. The cross-sectional size of cardiomyocytes was measured by staining myocardium tissue with hematoxylin and eosin. Collagen content was counted by Sirius red in aqueous saturated picric acid. The concentrations of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and endothelin 1 in myocardium or serum were determined by radioimmunoassay. Hydroxyproline and nitric oxide concentrations and glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities in serum were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Our results showed that seven weeks of polydatin treatment resulted in a significantly reduced left ventricular weight index, heart weight index, serum concentrations of hydroxyproline and aldosterone, an increased concentration of nitric oxide as well as enhanced activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Myocardial angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and endothelin 1 levels were also reduced. The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and collagen deposition diminished. This study suggests that polydatin may attenuate ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction in coronary artery ligation rats through restricting the excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and inhibiting peroxidation.",

Mice were assessed with cardiac MRI (ventricular structure and function, in vivo calcium influx (manganese-enhanced MRI)), pressure-volume loops, and histopathology. Combination treatment did not show benefits over treatment with AI or BB alone. Indeed, some beneficial aspects of BB and AI were lost when used in combination. None of the treatments impacted RV function. Combination treatment had no significant effect on sarcolemmal damage or histopathology.

    "836": "A key role in tumor progression play two processes--the destruction and angiogenesis. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play a leading role during tissue degradation. Tissue collagenase--MMP-1 and MT1-MMP hydrolyze fibrillar collagens, which are the basis of connective tissue matrix, and ensure the development of an invasive process. Gelatinase A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9) hydrolyze collagen type IV, which is the basis of the basal membrane, and facilitate the development of metastasis. Endogenous tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are involved in the regulation of MMP expression and activity. It has been established that MMP-9 release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) associated with the STM--the primary inductor angiogenesis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) participates in the induction of VEGF synthesis. ACE--a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, forms angiotensin II, which interactes with the receptor ATIR and induces VEGF synthesis, as well as stimulates endothelial cell proliferation. Our experimental studies devoted to the study of particularity expression of key enzymes of destruction and angiogenesis in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCC). It was studied: MMP-1, MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their endogenous regulators: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and as well as ACE. Work was performed on clinical specimens containing the tumor tissue, taking into account the presence or absence of metastasis to regional lymph nodes and the specimens of adjacent morphologically normal tissue. It was shown that the increase of MMP-1, MT1-MMP and MMP-9 expression and low of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression makes the main contribution to the destructive (invasive) potential of SCC. The change of MMP-2 expression is not so significant and it is less influenced to the destructive potential. It was shown dramatic increasing of MMP-1 and MMP-9 activity in metastasizing tumor tissue ACE activity in a tumor in most of the samples was higher than the activity in normal tissues. It was established that the expression of key enzymes degradation and angiogenesis occurs not only in tumor but also in normal tissues. Data are important for understanding the mechanisms of tumor progression and have prognostic value and may affect the therapeutic strategy for patients.",

In addition, rats with high-salt diet had higher levels of NOX-2, NOX-4 (subunits of NAD(P)H oxidase), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), glutamate and NE, and lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the PVN than normal diet rats. Bilateral PVN microinjection of PEG-CAT attenuated the levels of RAS and restored the balance of neurotransmitters and cytokines, while microinjection of ATZ into the PVN augmented those changes occurring in hypertensive rats. Our findings demonstrate that ROS component H2O2 in the PVN regulating MAP and RSNA are partly due to modulate neurotransmitters, renin-angiotensin system, and cytokines within the PVN in salt-induced hypertension.",

Significant degradation of the drug was observed in acid and base conditions, resulting primarily in cilazaprilat. In neutral condition, five degradation products were formed, while under oxidative condition, two degradation products were generated. In total, seven degradation products were formed, which were separated on an Inertsil C-18 column using a stability-indicating HPLC method. Structure elucidation of the degradation products was done by using sophisticated and hyphenated tools like, LC-MS/TOF, LC-MS(n), on-line H/D exchange, LC-NMR and NMR. Initially, comprehensive mass fragmentation pathway of the drug was laid down. Critical comparison of mass fragmentation pathways of the drug and its hydrolytic degradation products allowed structure characterization of the latter. 1D and 2D proton LC-NMR studies further confirmed the proposed structures of hydrolytic degradation products. The oxidative degradation products could not be characterized using LC-MS and LC-NMR tools. Hence, these degradation products were isolated using preparative HPLC and extensive 1D ((1)H, (13)C, DEPT) and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, HETCOR and HMBC) NMR studies were performed to ascertain their structures. Finally, degradation pathways and mechanisms of degradation of the drug were outlined.",

    "862": "The presence of elevated levels of albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of progressive renal function loss over time. This association is found in various pathophysiological conditions, including diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, and various primary renal diseases, but also, the general, otherwise healthy population. Emerging data report that elevated albuminuria causes tubulointerstitial damage through activation of proinflammatory mediators, which ultimately leads to a progressive decline in renal function. Nowadays, various drugs are available that decrease the rate of GFR loss in patients with kidney disease. Well known are renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, but there are also other drugs and interventions, like intensive glucose control, anti-inflammatory agents (pentoxifylline), or a low-protein diet. These interventions have an additional effect beyond their original target, namely lowering albuminuria. Analyses from clinical trials show that the reduction in albuminuria observed during the first months of treatment with these drugs correlates with the degree of long-term renal protection: the larger the initial reduction in albuminuria, the lower the risk of ESRD during treatment. In addition, in treated patients, residual albuminuria is again the strongest risk marker for renal disease progression. These observations combined provide a strong argument that albuminuria is an appropriate therapeutic target in patients with CKD.", 
    "863": "Albuminuria is a risk factor for progression of kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers slow the progression to ESRD, an effect that is correlated with reduction in albuminuria. This has led to the hypothesis that albuminuria should be a target for therapy. This work argues that there are issues with this hypothesis. The previously reported studies were not designed to test the hypothesis that achieving a specific albuminuria target would be beneficial in and of itself irrespective the mechanism used to achieve that goal. One cannot assume that the beneficial effect observed was causally related to the effect on albuminuria or that it would extend to other interventions. Most importantly, it is not known if the approach of maximizing therapy to reduce proteinuria is safe. Recent studies have shown that combining renin-angiotensin system therapies decreases albuminuria without significant clinical benefit but with increased risk of adverse events. More studies are needed, but at this time, albuminuria has not jumped the hurdle needed to be accepted as a surrogate end point or target for treatment. Primum non nocere, first do no harm.",

    "865": "A 51-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, and bloating. Medical history was significant for hypertension and medications included captopril, metoprolol and aspirin. Vital signs and laboratory tests were unremarkable. Due to the presence of significant abdominal tenderness with guarding on examination, a FAST (focused assessment with ultrasound in trauma) examination was performed and revealed free fluid in the abdomen. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was quickly obtained, which revealed a large amount of simple-appearing free fluid within the abdomen and mucosal edema throughout the small bowel. The patient underwent an emergent diagnostic laparoscopy and was ultimately diagnosed with angioedema of the small bowel, deemed secondary to captopril usage. Captopril was discontinued and symptoms gradually resolved with supportive care. When imaging is obtained in cases such as this one, small bowel submucosal edema and ascites are often present. Supportive care and cessation of ACEi usage are the cornerstones of treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: In patients on ACEi, it is important to keep this diagnosis in mind to potentially avoid an unneeded surgical intervention, as the condition is self-limiting and can be treated primarily with supportive measures.",

    "871": "Membranous nephropathy is one of the leading causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults, which is characterized by edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, lipiduria, and proteinuria. Determination of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) disease progression risk is important for guiding initial therapy, with immunosuppressive therapy being reserved for high-risk patients. Because IMN may spontaneously remit in approximately 30% of patients, it is important to carefully select which patients should begin immunosuppressive therapy so as to maximize clinical benefit while limiting toxicity. An observation period of at least 6\u00a0months with conservative management that includes the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is recommended. Initial treatment in high-risk IMN is a 6-month course of alternating steroids and alkylating agents. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) represent an alternative first-line therapeutic option for high-risk patients who refuse treatment with steroid or alkylating agent therapy or for whom these treatments are contraindicated. Additional options are essential for patients with IMN who fail to adequately respond to initial therapies or who cannot use recommended therapies due to contraindications or intolerance, risks associated with repetitive dosing with alkylating agents, or potential exacerbation of impaired renal function with CNIs. While evidence for the use of alternative therapies in IMN is modest at best, our review summarizes the available literature for rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and azathioprine. Rituximab has generally demonstrated beneficial outcomes with limited toxicity. Evidence supports a role for mycophenolate mofetil, although the evidence is of low quality and limited duration. Results from ongoing studies are required before adrenocorticotropic hormone can be recommended as therapy for treatment-resistant patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin and azathioprine are unlikely to have a role in IMN. With the advent of new tools and biomarkers measuring disease activity combined with new data regarding possible treatment options, the management and prognosis of IMN are likely to improve.",

In this study, the effects of prenatal undernutrition on the febrile response and hypothalamic innate immune system were evaluated in male rats. Pregnant rats were divided into normally nourished (NN) and undernourished groups (UN). The febrile and anorectic responses to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were evaluated in the offspring of NN and UN dams. The hypothalamic expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were also evaluated. The UN rats exhibited significantly lighter body weights than the NN rats at birth; however, their mean body weight was the same as that of the NN rats by postnatal day 10. In adulthood, the UN rats exhibited significantly stronger febrile responses than the NN rats, and the anorectic responses of the UN rats also tended to be stronger than those of the NN rats. On the other hand, no differences in hypothalamic interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, TLR4, or NPY mRNA expression were detected between the NN and UN rats.

The five peptides were able to inhibit ACE with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 65.4 (GLTSK) to 191.5 \u03bcM (MPACGSS). The combination of GLTSK and MTEEY increased the ACE inhibition by 30% compared to equieffective doses of the single peptides.

According to molecular docking analysis, the five peptides interacted with four (His353, Ala354, Glu411 and Tyr523) out of 6 catalytic residues. Moreover, MPACGSS had the highest antioxidant activity according to Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (421.58 \u03bcmol FeSO4 mg(-1)), Fe(2+) chelation (2.01 \u03bcmol Na2EDTA mg(-1)) assays, and also in DPPH (748.39 \u03bcmol Trolox per mg of dry peptide) and ABTS (561.42 \u03bcmol Trolox mg(-1)) radical scavenging assays.

    "904": "Hypertension is almost universal in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and contributes to the substantial cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality observed in these patients. The management of blood pressure (BP) in ESRD is complicated by a number of factors, including missed dialysis treatments, intradialytic changes in BP, medication removal with dialysis, and poor correlation of BPs obtained in the dialysis unit with those at home and with CV outcomes. Control of extracellular volume with ultrafiltration and dietary sodium restriction represents the principal strategy to manage hypertension in ESRD, and antihypertensive medications are subsequently added if this strategy is inadequate. While reduction in BP with medication improves CV outcomes, few head-to-head clinical trials have been performed to firmly establish the superiority of one antihypertensive medication class over another. Therefore, individualization of therapy is necessary, and patient comorbidities must be considered. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers are reasonable first-line agents for most patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs exert cardioprotective effects that are independent of BP reduction. Medications that are removed with dialysis may be preferred in patients who are prone to develop intradialytic hypotension. Intradialytic hypertension can be managed with challenging the patient's dry weight and using nondialyzable medications. Within a class of antihypertensive medications, there may be large variability in drug removal with dialysis, which must be considered upon medication selection. Studies demonstrate that even thrice-weekly dosing of medication after dialysis has robust BP-lowering effects, which may be a useful regimen in nonadherent patients.", 
    "905": "The management of chronic heart failure (HF) with low ejection fraction (EF) has changed considerably over the past 30 years: the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and recently, the Ifblocker, ivabradine, has led to a significant reduction in overall mortality and HF mortality. Recently, a trial testing a dual inhibitor blocking the angiotensin-II receptor and neprylisin, the enzyme responsible for B-type natriuretic peptide degradation, showed that this complex molecule improved clinical outcomes compared with the ACEI enalapril. However, challenges remain in the management of HF, with suboptimal implementation of guideline-recommended therapies, a changing profile of patients who are older and have multiple comorbidities and a high rate of early rehospitalization for HF. Use of devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy are also associated with an improvement in outcomes in this condition. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), a growing fraction of the HF population, remains a clinical dilemma: no pharmacological intervention has so far demonstrated any convincing benefit on outcome. Heterogeneity of the populations tested, role of comorbidities, difficulties in identifying patients with HFpEF, as well as a mismatch between the clinical phenotypes and the treatments tested, can explain the failure to find beneficial interventions. Overall, the management of HF after discharge remains fragmented and concerted action by all professionals concerned is needed.",

EDTA was utilized as an anticoagulant to inhibit the hydrolysis of fosinopril in whole blood during blood collection and processing. To prevent the ex vivo conversion to fosinoprilat, formic acid was added to rat plasma to effectively stabilize fosinopril. A sensitive, rapid and robust ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of fosinopril and fosinoprilat in rat plasma. Protein precipitation was employed for plasma sample clean-up. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Welch Ultimate XB-C18 column using gradient elution with a total run time of 5min. Analytes and their stable isotope labeled internal standards were detected by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometric assay. The assay involves quantitation of both analytes in small-volume (50\u03bcL) plasma, with the lower limit of quantification of 0.1 and 1ng/mL for fosinopril and fosinoprilat, respectively. The method was fully validated in linear calibration ranges of 0.1-150ng/mL for fosinopril and 1-1500ng/mL for fosinoprilat with acceptable accuracy and precision. Assay recoveries were high (>95% for fosinopril and >91% for fosinoprilat) and matrix effect was negligible. Both analytes were found to be stable in stabilized rat plasma for 6h at room temperature, 30 days at -80\u00b0C, and following three freeze-thaw cycles and were also stable in processed samples for 36h at 4\u00b0C.

Little is known about the influence of EH and the antihypertensive drugs (AHD) on cardiovascular reactions to combined breath hold (BH) and exercise. In this pilot study, healthy divers (HCON) were compared with treated hypertensive divers with regard to heart rate (HR) and mean blood-pressure (MAP) responses to BH, exercise and the combination of both. Ten subjects with EH and ten healthy divers were tested. 3 different 20\u2009s stimuli were applied: BH combined with 30\u2009W or 150\u2009W and 150\u2009W without BH. The time-charts during the stress intervals and during recovery were compared. Subjects treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor showed higher changes for MAP values if breath hold was performed. HR responses were obviously changed if a \u03b2-blocker was part of the medication. One subject showed extreme MAP responses to all stimuli and conspicuous HR if BH was involved. The modulation of HR-/MAP-response in EH subjects depends on the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a \u03b2-blocker may give the best protection. It is recommended to include short apnea tests in the fitness-to-dive examination to individually predict potential endangerment.", 
    "913": "Activation of the angiotensin 1-7/Mas receptor (MasR) axis counteracts angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated cardiovascular disease. Recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) generates Ang 1-7 from Ang II. We hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of rhACE2 are dependent on Ang 1-7 action. Wild type male C57BL/6 mice (10-12 weeks old) were infused with Ang II (1.5 mg/kg/d) and treated with rhACE2 (2 mg/kg/d). The Ang 1-7 antagonist, A779 (200 ng/kg/min), was administered to a parallel group of mice. rhACE2 prevented Ang II-induced hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction while A779 prevented these beneficial effects and precipitated systolic dysfunction. rhACE2 effectively antagonized Ang II-mediated myocardial fibrosis which was dependent on the action of Ang 1-7. Myocardial oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity was further increased by Ang 1-7 inhibition even in the presence of rhACE2. Activation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by rhACE2 were suppressed by the antagonism of Ang 1-7 while the activation of pathological signaling pathways was maintained. Blocking Ang 1-7 action prevents the therapeutic effects of rhACE2 in the setting of elevated Ang II culminating in systolic dysfunction. These results highlight a key cardioprotective role of Ang 1-7, and increased Ang 1-7 action represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.",

However, earlier studies relied on hospital coding to define AKI, which may underestimate true risk. This nested case-control study characterized the risk of community-acquired AKI associated with NSAID use among 78,379 users of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and/or diuretics, where AKI was defined as a 50% or greater increase in creatinine from baseline. The AKI incidence was 68/10,000 person-years. The relative increase in AKI risk was similar for NSAID use in both triple (adjusted rate ratio 1.64 (95% CI 1.25-2.14)) and dual combinations with either renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (1.60 (1.18-2.17)) or diuretics (1.64 (1.17-2.29)). However, the absolute increase in AKI risk was higher for NSAIDs used in triple versus dual combinations with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or diuretics alone (numbers needed to harm for 1 year treatment with NSAID of 158 vs. over 300). AKI risk was highest among users of loop diuretic/aldosterone antagonist combinations, in those over 75 years of age, and in those with renal impairment. Thus, the nephrotoxic potential of both dual and triple combinations of NSAIDs with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and/or diuretics yields a higher incidence of AKI than previously thought.", 
    "920": "In dialyzed patients, preservation of residual renal function is associated with better survival, lower morbidity, and greater quality of life. To analyze the evolution of residual diuresis over time, we prospectively monitored urine output in 401 pediatric patients in the global IPPN registry who commenced peritoneal dialysis (PD) with significant residual renal function. Associations of patient characteristics and time-variant covariates with daily urine output and the risk of developing oligoanuria (under 100 ml/m(2)/day) were analyzed by mixed linear modeling and Cox regression analysis including time-varying covariates. With an average loss of daily urine volume of 130 ml/m(2) per year, median time to oligoanuria was 48 months. Residual diuresis significantly subsided more rapidly in children with glomerulopathies, lower diuresis at start of PD, high ultrafiltration volume, and icodextrin use. Administration of diuretics significantly reduced oligoanuria risk, whereas the prescription of renin-angiotensin system antagonists significantly increased the risk oligoanuria. Urine output on PD was significantly associated in a negative manner with glomerulopathies (-584 ml/m(2)) and marginally with the use of icodextrin (-179 ml/m(2)) but positively associated with the use of biocompatible PD fluid (+111 ml/m(2)). Children in both Asia and North America had consistently lower urine output compared with those in Europe perhaps due to regional variances in therapy. Thus, in children undergoing PD, residual renal function depends strongly on the cause of underlying kidney disease and may be modifiable by diuretic therapy, peritoneal ultrafiltration, and choice of PD fluid.",

To render support to the experimental results, a series of quinazolinone derivatives were docked into active site of ACE and identified the probable binding modes compared to Lisinopril. Also we have identified common pharmacophore hypothesis (AAADDRR) among the best docked conformers of most potent compounds in a series of compounds. The most potent 9b, 9c, 9e compounds shared common active site with the Lisinopril binding site and retained the key active site residue interactions.

    "923": "Women with preeclampsia display low renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity and a high antiangiogenic state, the latter characterized by high levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt)-1 and reduced placental growth factor levels. To investigate whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system suppression in preeclampsia is because of this disturbed angiogenic balance, we measured mean arterial pressure, creatinine, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system components in pregnant women with a high (\u226585; n=38) or low (<85; n=65) soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio. Plasma ET-1 levels were increased in women with a high ratio, whereas their plasma renin activity and plasma concentrations of renin, angiotensinogen, and aldosterone were decreased. Plasma renin activity-aldosterone relationships were identical in both the groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that plasma renin concentration correlated independently with mean arterial pressure and plasma ET-1. Plasma ET-1 correlated positively with soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and negatively with plasma renin concentration, and urinary protein correlated with plasma ET-1 and mean arterial pressure. Despite the lower plasma levels of renin and angiotensinogen in the high-ratio group, their urinary levels of these components were elevated. Correction for albumin revealed that this was because of increased glomerular filtration. Subcutaneous arteries obtained from patients with preeclampsia displayed an enhanced, AT2 receptor-mediated response to angiotensin II. In conclusion, a high antiangiogenic state associates with ET-1 activation, which together with the increased mean arterial pressure may underlie the parallel reductions in renin and aldosterone in preeclampsia. Because ET-1 also was a major determinant of urinary protein, our data reveal a key role for ET-1 in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Finally, the enhanced angiotensin responsiveness in preeclampsia involves constrictor AT2 receptors.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the involvement of hypertension and angiotensin system in neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction in the presence of neuroinflammatory stimulus. Memory impairment was induced by chronic neuroinflammation that was developed by repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th day. Memory functions were evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test on days 13-15, followed by biochemical and molecular studies in the cortex and hippocampus regions of rat brain. LPS at the dose of 25\u03bcg ICV caused memory impairment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) but not in normotensive Wistar rats (NWRs). Memory deficit was obtained with 50\u03bcg of LPS (ICV) in NWRs. Control SHRs already exhibited increased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and expression, neuroinflammation (increased TNF-\u03b1, GFAP, COX-2 and NF-kB), oxidative stress (increased iNOS, ROS and nitrite levels), TLR-4 expression and TUNEL positive cells as compared to control NWRs. Further, LPS (25\u03bcg ICV) exaggerated inflammatory response, oxidative stress and apoptosis in SHRs but similar effects were witnessed at 50\u03bcg of LPS (ICV) in NWRs. Oral administration of perindopril (ACE inhibitor), at non-antihypertensive dose (0.1mg/kg), for 15days attenuated LPS induced deleterious changes in both NWRs and SHRs.

This study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and tolerability of single and multiple doses of trandolapril in healthy Chinese subjects. Healthy subjects (six men and six women) were randomized into a single-dose, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 crossover study (1-2-4\u00a0mg, 2-4-1\u00a0mg, and 4-1-2\u00a0mg), and a multiple-dose study (2\u00a0mg/day, 6\u00a0days). Serial blood and urine samples were collected after drug administration and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method, and the trandolapril and trandolaprilat PK parameters were obtained. PD was evaluated by the changes in blood pressure and heart rates after dosing. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, and changes in laboratory tests. In the single-dose study, trandolapril was absorbed rapidly, and peak plasma levels (C max, 1.57, 3.77, and 7.99\u00a0ng/mL) and AUCs (1.89, 3.46, and 6.47\u00a0ng/mL) were dose-dependent. The AUC0-\u221e of trandolaprilat was dose-dependent, but in a non-linear fashion. The cumulative urine excretion of trandolapril and trandolaprilat was 5.51, 6.20, and 7.41\u00a0% for three doses, respectively. In the multiple-dose study, steady-state pharmacokinetics was observed; there was no trandolapril accumulation, but there was mild trandolaprilat accumulation (R\u00a0=\u00a01.67). Trandolapril was well tolerated. The most pronounced reductions in blood pressure were observed at 8\u00a0h after administration, which was later than T max. No orthostatic hypotension occurred. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following single and multiple oral doses trandolapril in healthy Chinese subjects are similar to those observed in non-Chinese healthy subjects.",

    "975": "Radiation induced lung injury has long been considered a treatment limiting factor for patients requiring thoracic radiation. This radiation induced lung injury happens early as well as late. Radiation induced lung injury can occur in two phases viz. early (<6 months) when it is called radiation pneumonitis and late (>6 months) when it is called radiation induced lung fibrosis. There are multiple factors that can be patient, disease or treatment related that predict the incidence and severity of radiation pneumonitis. Radiation induced damage to the type I pneumocytes is the triggering factor to initiate such reactions. Over the years, radiation therapy has witnessed a paradigm shift in radiation planning and delivery and successfully reduced the incidence of lung injury. Radiation pneumonitis is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. Steroids, ACE inhibitors and pentoxyphylline constitute the cornerstone of therapy. Radiation induced lung fibrosis is another challenging aspect. The pathophysiology of radiation fibrosis includes continuing inflammation and microvascular changes due to pro-angiogenic and pro- fibrogenic stimuli resembling those in adult bronchiectasis. General supportive management, mobilization of airway secretions, anti-inflammatory therapy and management of acute exacerbations remains the treatment option. Radiation induced lung injury is an inevitable accompaniment of thoracic radiation.", 
    "976": "Despite extensive debate about the first choice for treating essential hypertension, monotherapy effectively normalizes blood pressure (BP) values in only a limited number of hypertensive patients. Thus, the aim of combination therapy should always be to both improve BP control and to reduce cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive drugs can be effectively combined if they have different and complementary mechanisms of action. This is crucial to obtain additive BP-lowering effects without impacting on tolerability. One typical combination is the association of drugs blocking and stimulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium antagonist or diuretic, respectively). In contrast, some combinations (e.g., calcium antagonists plus diuretics or beta-blockers plus RAS blockers) have no additive BP-lowering effects, while other combinations (e.g., clonidine plus alpha-1 receptor blockers) can have a negative interaction. Regardless, BP reduction is not the only mechanism that reduces cardiovascular risk. Scientific evidence indicates that some drug classes are better than others in this respect, and therefore some drug combinations are also better than others. The results of the ASCOT-BPLA and ACCOMPLISH trials suggested that an ACE inhibitor/calcium antagonist combination had better cardioprotective effects than beta-blocker/diuretic or ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. It is worth noting that no controlled clinical trials have used hard endpoints when investigating the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker/calcium antagonist combination. In conclusion, combination therapy is needed for optimal antihypertensive management, with the first choice being an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist. This approach should improve BP control and provide better cardiovascular protection.", 
    "977": "Heart failure represents a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in older people and despite significant therapeutic advances, it is still characterized by important unmet needs, thus remaining a challenging field of clinical research. The recent PARADIGM-HF trial compared the novel compound LCZ696, a combination of the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, versus the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in 8,442 patients with symptomatic chronic systolic heart failure. LCZ696 led to a 20% reduction in the rate of death or hospitalization for heart failure and a 16% reduction in the rate of all-cause death compared to enalapril at 3.5 years of follow-up. Despite those impressive results, the clinical application of this novel agent that requires the substitution of a cornerstone of current heart failure therapy, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, should follow careful steps as imposed by the study design, the recruited population and the outcome in specific patient subgroups. Further insights into the effects of LCZ696 will be provided by the ongoing PARAGON-HF trial in patients with diastolic heart failure.",

The DDI risk does not exhibit a class effect, eg, the effects of clopidogrel on cerivastatin versus other statins, the effects of proton pump inhibitors on clopidogrel (omeprazole, esomeprazole versus pantoprazole, rabeprazole), the effects of rifampicin on clopidogrel versus ticagrelor and prasugrel, and the effects of calcium channel blockers on clopidogrel (amlodipine versus P-glycoprotein-inhibiting calcium channel blockers). The mechanism of the DDIs with clopidogrel involves modulating CYP enzymes (eg, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4), paraoxonase-1, hepatic carboxylesterase 1, P-glycoprotein, and organic anion transporter family member 1B1.",

This was a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the INternational VErapamil SR-Trandolapril STudy (INVEST), which involved 22,576 clinically stable patients aged \u2265 50 years with hypertension and CAD randomized to either verapamil SR- or atenolol-based hypertension treatment strategies. The subgroup consisted of 117 patients undergoing 24-hour ambulatory monitoring at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Hourly systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) decreased after 1 year for both verapamil SR- and atenolol-based treatment strategies compared with baseline (P<0.0001). Atenolol also decreased hourly HR (P<0.0001). Both treatment strategies decreased SBP variability (weighted standard deviation: P = 0.012 and 0.021, respectively).

    "1002": "LCZ696 is a single molecule which combines the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan with the neprilysn inhibitor sacubitril (AHU377). In the recently published PARADIGM-HF trial, LCZ696 proved superior to enalapril in reducing overall mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and other endpoints in patients with systolic dysfunction heart failure. Increases in counter-regulatory natriuretic peptides which oppose sodium retention, vasoconstriction, and the deleterious structural changes which follow neurohormonal activation are thought to account for these improved outcomes. In two large hypertension studies, LCZ696 has proved to be a potent, effective antihypertensive agent with tolerability similar to valsartan and placebo and potency comparable to amlodipine. Although several have occurred in the heart failure population, there have been no cases of angioedema noted in the hypertension trials, although few black patients-a group at high risk for its occurrence-have been studied. Whether LCZ696 will displace angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as preferred renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents in hypertension will require demonstration of improved long-term outcomes compared with currently preferred first-line drugs. In this regard, experience has shown that it is difficult to extrapolate results achieved in heart failure to the treatment of hypertension, a condition in which neurohormonal activation is less critical in determining long-term prognosis. It will be particularly important to demonstrate renal protection with LCZ696 in patients with diabetes, proteinuria, and hypertension-the only therapeutic area other than heart failure in which RAS blockade has proved essential for optimal endpoint reduction. Superiority over available RAS blockers in terms of 'vascular protection' in high-risk populations represents another path to acceptance of LCZ696 as a preferred agent in cardiovascular medicine.",

DM was more prevalent in Arabs (68 vs. 32%), but its burden showed a decreasing trend over time compared with South Asians. More diabetics presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (47.5 vs. 22.7%), which tended to occur 8 years earlier compared with heart failure. Over the study period, beta-blocker use increased substantially (from 10 to 71%).

It is responsible for increased healthcare expenditure, driven by frequent and often prolonged hospital admissions associated with an increased mortality. A clinically useful classification of the syndrome is, patients with left ventricular systolic impairment (Heart Failure and reduced ejection fraction, HFREF) and patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (HFPEF). The pharmacological treatment for patients with HFREF has evolved over the last twenty five years, focusing on modulation of the neurohormonal activation which represents a hallmark of this condition. This has led to the development of a stepwise treatment algorithm predominately based on inhibition of the renin angiotensin aldosterone pathway and counteracting sympathetic over-activation. In particular since the early trials in chronic heart failure (CHF) demonstrated a significant mortality benefit with ACE-inhibitors, subsequent studies have been conducted in conjunction with these drugs. The rationale being that it would be unethical to trial any new agent without the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors. The recent publication of the PARADIGM -HF study has challenged this convention by trialling a novel pharmacological agent against an ACE-inhibitor in a landmark trial. The review sets out the current pharmacological treatment for patients with heart failure and discusses the recent findings with this novel class of medication.",

Although cardioprotective effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been demonstrated, their cardiac effects in chronic myocardial infarction (MI) are unclear. We determined the effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor on cardiac function and remodelling in rats with chronic MI. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrated, for the first time, that DPP-4 inhibitor, but not metformin, exerted similar efficacy in improving cardiac function and attenuating cardiac fibrosis compared with enalapril in rats with chronic MI. These findings reveal benefits additional to the glycaemic control by the DPP-4 inhibitor in chronic MI, and it might become the new drug of choice for MI in patients with diabetes mellitus. Adverse cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI) leads to progressive heart failure. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are new antidiabetic drugs that exert cardioprotection. However, their role in cardiac function and remodelling in chronic MI is unclear. We hypothesized that the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin reduces adverse cardiac remodelling and improves cardiac function in rats with chronic MI. These effects were also compared with enalapril and metformin. Male Wistar rats (n\u00a0=\u00a036) with chronic MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery were divided into six groups to receive vehicle, vildagliptin (3\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) \u00a0day(-1) ), metformin (30\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) \u00a0day(-1) ), enalapril (10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) \u00a0day(-1) ), combined metformin and enalapril or combined vildagliptin and enalapril for 8\u00a0weeks. At the end of the study, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), heart rate variability (HRV), left ventricular (LV) function, pathological and biochemical studies of cardiac remodelling were investigated. Our study demonstrated that rats with chronic MI had increased oxidative stress levels, depressed HRV, adverse cardiac remodelling, indicated by cardiac fibrosis, and LV dysfunction. Treatment with vildagliptin or enalapril significantly decreased oxidative stress, attenuated cardiac fibrosis and improved HRV and LV function. We conclude that vildagliptin exerts similar cardioprotective effects to enalapril in attenuating oxidative stress and cardiac fibrosis and improving cardiac function in rats with chronic MI. Metformin does not provide these benefits in this model. Moreover, addition of either metformin or vildagliptin to enalapril does not provide additional benefit in attenuating cardiac remodelling or improving LV function compared with enalapril alone.",

Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.",

In five clinical trials (52,565 subjects), perindopril was associated with a significant reduction in all six cardiovascular endpoints. Network and Bayesian meta-analyses suggested that (with the exception of amlodipine and heart failure), each agent was at least as effective as an initial diuretic to prevent these events. Short-term trials have demonstrated that the combination of perindopril and amlodipine is safe and effective, with statistically greater lowering of blood pressure than either agent alone and a potential synergistic effect on pedal edema.

Renin-angiotensin system blockers include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and antialdosterones. Several lines of evidence support the cardioprotective effects of RAS blockers: they reduce ischemic events and improve outcome in heart failure independently of their effect on heart function and blood pressure. Moreover, early RAS blocker administration has remarkable survival and heart function benefits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, perioperative studies on the effects of RAS blockers remain few and inconclusive. Results from clinical trials and observational studies are conflicting, and they raise more questions than answers.

Study drugs were added to other recommended medication. The trial was prematurely terminated after median follow-up of 27 months. The primary endpoint of the study was a combination of cardiovascular mortality and the first hospitalization for heart failure. LCZ696 drug, an inhibitor of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin (Arnie), has led to a reduction in the primary composite target by 20% (p <0.001). The treatment has decreased cardiovascular mortality by 20%, p <0.001 and hospitalization for worsening heart failure by 21%, p <0.001. LCZ696 has also decreased total mortality by 16%, p <0.001. The use of LCZ696 has been accompanied by frequent symptomatic hypotension and hypotension with a decrease in systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, however, LCZ696 was less often associated with an increase in serum creatinine and serum potassium than enalapril.

We identified patients from the Registry for Catastrophic Illness, a nation-wide database encompassing almost all of the patients receiving dialysis therapy in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008. Propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for new-onset AF. Among 113,186 patients, 13% received ACEIs, 14% received ARBs therapy, and 9% received ACEIs or ARBs alternatively. After a median follow-up of 1524 days, the incidence of new-onset AF significantly decreased in patients treated with ACEIs (hazard ratio 0.587, 95% confidence interval 0.519-0.663), ARBs (0.542, 0.461-0.637), or ACEIs/ARBs (0.793, 0.657-0.958). The prevention of new-onset AF was significantly better in patients taking longer duration of ACEI or ARB therapy. The effect remained robust in subgroup analyses.

Adult male mice (C57B/L6) were subjected to either transverse aortic constriction or sham operation for 4 weeks, and the drugs (or saline) were orally administered through gastric tubes. Cardiac function and remodeling were evaluated through echocardiography, catheterization, histology, and analysis of hypertrophic gene expression. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy, AT1-R and \u03b21-AR expression, and cell proliferation-related molecules were also examined. Although pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, hypertrophic gene reprogramming, AT1-R and \u03b21-AR expression, and ERK phosphorylation were significantly attenuated by QL alone, QL + ARB, QL + ACEI, and QL + BB, the attenuation was stronger in the combination treatment groups. Moreover, apoptosis was reduced to a larger extent by each combination treatment than by QL alone, whereas autophagy was more strongly attenuated by either QL + ARB or QL + ACEI. None of the treatments significantly upregulated ErbB2 or ErbB4 phosphorylation, and none significantly downregulated C/EBP\u03b2 expression. Therefore, the effects of QL on chronic pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling may be significantly increased when QL is combined with an ARB, an ACEI, or a BB.",

Its mechanism depends on failure of the blood-brain barrier due to high systemic blood pressure (BP) and loss of integrity of vascular endothelium related with different triggers. Methods. We aim to report a case of PRES induced by arterial hypertension and very early systemic sclerosis (SSc) not previously known. Results. A 64-year-old female was admitted due to 1-week pulsating headache more prominent on frontal scalp, accompanied by phonophobia, photophobia, and facial flushing. Neurological exam revealed brisk deep tendon reflex. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subcortical lesions mainly located in posterior regions. BP was monitored and episodic arterial hypertension was detected. In laboratory tests positive anti-topoisomerase I antibodies were detected. BP was controlled with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and headache improved. In a new MRI a month later improvement of white matter lesions was observed. Capillaroscopy showed \"active pattern,\" considered typical of SSc. Conclusion. In SSc anti-endothelial cell antibodies impair vascular endothelium and liberation of vasoconstrictors leads to BP increasing and disruption of blood-brain barrier autoregulation mechanisms. PRES can be the first manifestation of very early SSc and this entity should be considered even in absence of skin lesions or Raynaud phenomenon.",

They divided into 5 groups: (i) control (CT), no fructose supplement fed on standard rat pellet and tap water for 60 days, (ii) metabolic syndrome (MetS) fed with 10% fructose for 60 days, (iii) rats after metabolic syndrome developed treated with enalapril over 30 days (MetS+E30), (iv) rats in which only enalapril was administered for 60 days (E60), and (v) MetS-treated with enalapril for 60 days (MetS+E60). Enalapril maleate was given at 20mg/kg per day by gavage. Fasting serum insulin, uric acid, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were significantly higher, and the amount of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and acylated and desacyl ghrelin levels was significantly lower in the MetS groups. Ghrelins were significantly lower in all 3 groups, which were administered enalapril than that of MetS and the control group. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the density of ghrelin was parallel to the serum levels of the peptide. Ghrelin immunoreactivity in the kidneys was of moderate density in the distal and collecting tubules, mild density in the proximal tubule and glomeruli, whereas the density decreased in the MetS group and other enalapril-treated groups. In conclusion, ghrelin levels in MetS groups were significantly lower than control group, and thus Enalapril treatment improves components of MetS and has direct effects on serum ghrelin levels that are independent of MetS.", 
    "1139": "Whether improvements in arterial compliance with BP lowering are because of BP reduction alone or if pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive agents contribute remains unclear. It was hypothesized that, among patients on hemodialysis, compared with a \u03b2-blocker (atenolol), a lisinopril-based therapy will better reduce arterial stiffness.", 
    "1140": "Among 200 participants of the Hypertension in Hemodialysis Patients Treated with Atenolol or Lisinopril Trial, 179 patients with valid assessment of aortic pulse wave velocity at baseline (89 patients randomly assigned to open-label lisinopril and 90 patients randomly assigned to atenolol three times a week after dialysis) were included in the secondary analysis. Among them, 109 patients had a valid pulse wave velocity measurement at 6 months. Monthly measured home BP was targeted to <140/90 mmHg by addition of antihypertensive drugs and dry weight adjustment. The difference between drugs in percentage change of aortic pulse wave velocity from baseline to 6 months was analyzed.", 
    "1141": "Contrary to the hypothesis, atenolol-based treatment induced greater reduction in aortic pulse wave velocity relative to lisinopril (between drug difference, 14.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.5% to 28.5%; P=0.03). Reduction in 44-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP was no different between groups (median [25th, 75th percentile]; atenolol: -21.5 [-37.7, -7.6] versus lisinopril: -15.8 [-28.8, -1.5] mmHg; P=0.27 for systolic BP; -14.1 [-22.6, -5.3] versus -10.9 [-18.4, -0.9] mmHg, respectively; P=0.30 for diastolic BP). Between-drug difference in change of aortic pulse wave velocity persisted after adjustments for age, sex, race, other cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline ambulatory systolic BP but disappeared after adjustment for change in ambulatory systolic BP (11.8%; 95% confidence interval, -2.3% to 25.9%; P=0.10).", 
    "1142": "Among patients on dialysis, atenolol was superior in improving arterial stiffness. However, differences between atenolol and lisinopril in improving aortic stiffness among patients on hemodialysis may be explained by BP-lowering effects of drugs.", 
    "1143": "In patients with heart failure, a variety of hemogram parameters are known to be of prognostic significance. This study aimed to investigate which of these parameters is/are useful in predicting one-year all-cause mortality in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).", 
    "1144": "Patients who were hospitalized between September 2012-March 2013 in our hospital with systolic-ADHF with ejection fraction \u226440%, symptoms, and findings of congestion were enrolled retrospectively in the study. The study population was divided into two groups based on one-year-mortality.", 
    "1145": "119 patients with ADHF (mean-age 67\u00b114 years; 55% male) were enrolled in the study. One-year-mortality occurred in 29% of patients. Hemoglobin levels, platelet, basophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower, while red-cell distribution width (RDW) was found to be significantly higher in the one-year-mortality group. Neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts were similar in the two groups. Furthermore, lower estimated glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR) and unused angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) were associated with mortality. Age, presence of hypertension, right-ventricular diameter, eGFR, ACE/ARB treatment, hemoglobin levels, RDW and platelet, leukocyte, lymphocyte, basophil, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil-counts were found to have prognostic significance in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, decreased platelet, lymphocyte-counts and hemoglobin level on admission and unused ACE/ARB treatment at discharge (p<0.05) were found to be independent factors predicting one-year-mortality.", 
    "1146": "Among hematological indices; hemoglobin level, platelet and lymphocyte counts are readily available, useful and inexpensive markers for the prediction of one-year all-cause mortality in ADHF patients."
