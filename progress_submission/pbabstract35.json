In the present study, hypertensive outpatients who were well controlled with antihypertensive medication and had similar blood pressure levels were studied, and arterial elasticity was compared between those receiving Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) and those treated with other antihypertensive agents. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (STs) on arterial elasticity were also evaluated. The study enrolled 298 outpatients who had been diagnosed with essential hypertension whose blood pressure was controlled to 150/95 or less by antihypertensive treatment (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) for at least 2 months. The small artery elasticity index (SAEI) was determined for each patient from the radial artery pulse waves using a non-invasive pulse wave analysis system CR-2000. The mean of two blood pressure measurements taken from subjects lying in a recumbent position during SAEI analysis was used for the data analysis. The patients were grouped according to the use of ARBs and STs, and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparisons. A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was carried out to identify factors contributing to the SAEI. Hypertensive patients receiving ARB treatment had a significantly higher SAEI compared to those not receiving ARBs, despite the similar blood pressure levels of both groups. No significant effects of ST treatment on the SAEI were observed (two-way ANOVA). A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis for the SAEI suggested that ARB treatment was an independent determinant of the SAEI after the adjusting of age, gender, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking and systolic blood pressure. Our results suggested that while providing blood pressure control similar to that of other antihypertensive agents, ARBs may also increase vascular elasticity and thereby delay the progression of arteriosclerosis.", 
    "1": "This randomized, prospective, two-arm clinical study evaluated the antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects and the safety of treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (irbesartan) in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) as compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIls). A total of 50 patients with CGN diagnosed by renal biopsy and protein levels in 24-hour urine higher than 1 g were enrolled. All patients received treatment for at least 24 months, 27 in group 1 (irbesartan) and 23 in group 2 (ACEs). A significant decrease in proteinuria (p < 0.001) was seen in both groups (49.2% in group, 1, and 44.8% in group 2) since the third month, and confirmed at 12 and 24 months of follow-up (58.1% and 62.7% in group 1, and 56.8% and 55.4% in group 2, respectively), with no significant differences being seen between the two groups. No differences were found in blood pressure control. No significant decrease was found in any of the groups in the glomerular filtration rate, but this showed higher values in the group treated with ACEIs (2.98 +/- 7.77 vs 1.64 +/- 6.84 ml/min/year), though the difference with irbersartan was not statistically significant. No side effects occurred among patients treated with irbesartan, whereas three patients initially treated with ACEIs showed intolerance (cough). In conclusion, irbesartan showed in our study an antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effect similar to ACEIs in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, and its administration was also shown to be safe.",

    "7": "There is a lack of consistently linked loci influencing blood pressure and hypertension status, and this may be because of genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity. We hypothesize that stratification of subjects by response to antihypertensive drug groups could be used to stringently define subsets that will have reduced genetic and etiologic heterogeneity, by partitioning contrasting mechanisms of hypertension and, thus, enhancing gene finding. We investigated the British Genetics of Hypertension Study population, which is composed of 2142 severely hypertensive white affected sibling pairs. Nonresponse to antihypertensive therapy was defined as an on-treatment blood pressure of >140/90 mm Hg or a difference between prediagnosis and on-treatment blood pressure of <20 mm Hg. Of the nonresponders, there were 89 sibling pairs (AB) who were both on antihypertensive therapy that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers, or beta-blockers), and 76 sibling pairs (CD) who were both on drugs that do not (calcium channel blockers or diuretics). Nonparametric linkage analysis carried out using markers from a 10-cM genome scan and additional \"grid tightening\" markers showed significant linkage in the AB group on chromosome 2p (logarithm of odds=4.84 at 90.68 Kosambi cM) and suggestive linkage for the CD group on chromosome 10q (logarithm of odds=2.83 at 125.96 Kosambi cM). The AB linkage locus attained genomewide significance after simulation using 10,000 replicates (P=0.005). This locus may contain a gene for the salt-sensitive form of hypertension and/or a pharmacogenetic locus affecting drug response. We have demonstrated for the first time identification of a significant locus by partitioning different pathways of hypertension using drug response.",

    "12": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was evaluated in the presence of flavanol-rich foods, i.e., wines, chocolates, and teas, and of purified flavonoids. All foods assayed inhibited ACE activity, red wines being more effective than white wine, and green tea more effective than black tea. The inhibition of ACE activity was associated with both phenolic and flavanol content in the foods. When isolated polyphenols were assayed, procyanidins (dimer and hexamer) and epigallocatechin significantly inhibited enzyme activity; similar concentrations of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, and resveratrol were ineffective. When ACE activity was assayed in rat kidney membranes in the presence of chocolate extracts or purified procyanidins, it was observed that the inhibition depended on the chocolate content of flavanols and the number of flavanol units constituting the procyanidin. These experiments demonstrate that flavanols either isolated or present in foods could inhibit ACE activity. The occurrence of such inhibition in vivo needs to be determined, although is supported by the association between the consumption of flavanol-rich foods and reductions in blood pressure observed in several experimental models.",

    "17": "Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin system and consequently plays a key role in blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Thus, ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, causing a decrease in the production of angiotensin II and an increase in the circulating vasodilator bradykinin. The ectodomain of ACE consists of two parts (N and C domains), each bearing an active site that differs in substrate and inhibitor specificity. Advances in the elucidation of the functional roles of these two domains and an expanded view of the renin-angiotensin system underscore the need for the next generation of domain-selective inhibitors with improved pharmacologic profiles. Moreover, recent breakthroughs in determining the crystal structure of testis ACE (identical to the C domain) and its homologue ACE2 provide new mechanistic insights into the interactions of ACE inhibitors and substrates with active site pockets. This review summarizes the structural basis and recent synthetic chemistry approaches to the development of novel domain-selective inhibitors.", 
    "18": "Currently, 3 phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor agents are available worldwide for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED): sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Each of these agents is effective across a broad range of etiologies, including vasculogenic ED in men. Because PDE5 enzyme is found within the vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of systemic arteries and veins, PDE5 inhibitors are mild vasodilators associated with small (and in general, clinically insignificant) decreases in blood pressure. However, because of the synergistic decrease in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in the presence of organic nitrates, these 3 agents are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates. The duration of interaction between a PDE5 inhibitor and nitrate administration depends on the specific drug being studied. The interaction between sildenafil or vardenafil and nitroglycerin is no longer observed by 24 hours. A preliminary study with sildenafil and sublingual nitroglycerin suggested the interaction is no longer observable by 4 hours. The interaction between tadalafil and nitroglycerin has dissipated by 48 hours after tadalafil administration. This is consistent with the longer elimination half-life of the drug. When PDE5 inhibitors are administered to patients with hypertension who are taking most antihypertensive agents (eg, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics), there are usually small additive decreases in blood pressure without a significant increase of adverse events. Some patients develop orthostatic hypotension when PDE5 inhibitors are used in conjunction with an alpha-blocker (typically for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy). Precautions are necessary for all 3 of the PDE5 inhibitors regarding this potential interaction. Some studies suggest that the interaction is less relevant clinically if the patient has been undergoing long-term alpha-blocker therapy. Several analyses have suggested that PDE5 inhibitors do not increase myocardial infarction rates or death rates compared with placebo controls or expected rates from age-matched populations. In contrast, recent studies have shown that PDE5 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for a host of cardiovascular diseases. In general, these agents, when used appropriately, are highly safe and effective.", 
    "19": "This study investigates the effects of the Panax ginseng (Araliaceae) extract G115 on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and nitric oxide (NO) in cultured human endothelial cells from umbilical veins (HUVEC) and bovine mesenteric arteries (BMA). In HUVEC, ACE activity was significantly reduced after 10 min incubation with aqueous extract of ginseng 5.0 and 10 mg/ml. This effect was additative with the inhibition of the traditional ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. No effect was seen on NO production from the cells. Angiotensin I-induced contraction of BMA was significantly attenuated by 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml ginseng, while no endothelium-dependent or -independent relaxation was seen. In conclusion, extract of Panax ginseng (G115) inhibits ACE activity, but does not affect NO production in HUVEC and BMA.",

When imidaprilat was infused in para-nonylphenol and MPP+-treated rats, DA efflux and *OH formation significantly decreased, as compared with that in the para-nonylphenol and MPP+-treated control. Imidaprilat was able to scavenge *OH and DA efflux induced by para-nonylphenol and MPP+. When iron(II) was administered to para-nonylphenol-pretreated animals, iron(II) clearly produced a dose-dependent increase in the levels of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA), as compared with MPP+-only-treated rats. A positive linear correlation was observed between iron(II) and 2,3-DHBA (R2=0.985) in the dialysate. However, in the presence of imidaprilat, a small increase in the levels of 2,3-DHBA products was observed. The results suggest that imidaprilat may protect against para-nonylphenol and MPP+-induced *OH formation via suppressing DA efflux in the rat striatum.",

After being weaned, male 3-week-old SHR were randomly divided into five groups that were given until the 20th week of life the following drinking fluids: (1) tap water, (2) non-treated egg white 1 g/kg/day, (3) captopril 100 mg/kg/day, (4) HEW 0.5 g/kg/day, and (5) HEW 1 g/kg/day. From the 20th to 25th week of life, animals from all groups were given tap water. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured weekly in the rats, from the 6th to 25th week of life, by the tail cuff method. Development of hypertension was attenuated in the groups treated with captopril and HEW (P<0.001 vs. the group that drunk tap water). At the 20th week of life, the arterial blood pressure values of the different groups of rats were: tap water (SBP = 219.5 +/- 5.7, DBP = 167 +/- 3.7), non-treated egg white (SBP = 206.4 +/- 1.43, DBP = 166.4 +/- 4.9), captopril (SBP = 131.7 +/- 2.74, DBP = 91.5 +/- 1.62), HEW 0.5 g/kg/day (SBP = 182.9 +/- 4.64, DBP = 127.5 +/- 2.1) and HEW 1 g/kg/day (SBP = 177.7 +/- 4.72, DBP = 120.1 +/- 2.4). SBP and DBP increased in the treated SHR when the corresponding antihypertensive treatment was removed. In spite of this, SBP remained lower in the SHR that had received captopril and HEW than in the SHR of the control groups (P<0.05). The present results suggest that HEW could be used as a functional food with antihypertensive activity.",

    "30": "Intermittent claudication (IC) is defined by leg muscle pain, cramping and fatigue brought on by ambulation/exercise; relieved on rest; and caused by inadequate blood supply and is the primary symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD has a detrimental effect on the quality of life. PAD is a debilitating atherosclerotic disease of the lower limbs and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. IC is an extremely important marker of atheroma. Up to 60% patients with IC have significant underlying coronary and/or carotid disease and 40% of all patients suffering from IC die or suffer a stroke within 5 years of presentation. The therapeutic intervention of IC essentially aims at providing symptomatic relief and reducing the systemic cardiovascular complications. Although exercise therapy is one of the most efficacious conservative treatments for claudication, the pharmacotherapeutic goals can be best achieved through an increase in the walking capacity to improve quality of life and a decrease in rates of amputation. In the development of treatment for IC, an aggressive non-pharmacological intervention and pharmacological treatment of the risk factors associated with IC are considered. In the next 2 years, the results of major trials of drugs that stabilize and regress atherosclerosis such as statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and anti-platelet agents, recombinant growth factors and immune modulators will be available for IC. Levocarnitine (l-carnitine) and a derivative, propionyl levocarnitine, are emerging agents that increase the pain-free walking and improve the quality of life in IC patients by working at the metabolism and exercise performance of ischemic muscles. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology involved, diagnosis of IC and existing and emerging pharmacotherapies with rationale for their use in its treatment.",

    "33": "ANGINA: Angina is a clinical syndrome characterized by discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back or arm. Angina usually occurs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) involving \u22651 large epicardial artery. However it can also occur in people with valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and uncontrolled hypertension. CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO RESTORING THE BALANCE BETWEEN OXYGEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOCUS ON THE DISRUPTION OF THE UNDERLYING DISEASE THROUGH: drug therapy (\u03b2 blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, antiplatelet agents, ACE inhibitors, statins); life-style modifications (smoking cessation, weight loss); or revascularization techniques such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). (1) Limitations of each of these approaches include: adverse drug effects, procedure-related mortality and morbidity, restenosis after PCI, and time dependent graft attrition after CABG. Furthermore, an increasing number of patients are not appropriate candidates for standard revascularization options, due to co-morbid conditions (HF, peripheral vascular disease), poor distal coronary artery targets, and patient preference. The morbidity and mortality associated with repeat surgical revascularization procedures are significantly higher, and often excludes these patients from consideration for further revascularizations. (2) Patients with CAD who have chronic ischemic symptoms that are unresponsive to both conventional medical therapy and revascularization techniques have refractory angina pectoris. It has been estimated that greater than 100,000 patients each year in the US may be diagnosed as having this condition. (3) Patients with refractory angina have marked limitation of ordinary physical activity or are unable to perform any ordinary physical activity without discomfort (CCS functional class III/IV). Also, there must be some objective evidence of ischemia as demonstrated by exercise treadmill testing, stress imaging studies or coronary physiologic studies. (1) Dejongste et al. (4)estimated that the prevalence of chronic refractory angina is about 100,000 patients in the United States. This would correspond to approximately 3,800 (100,000 x 3.8% [Ontario is approximately 3.8% of the population of the United States]) patients in Ontario having chronic refractory angina.", 
    "34": "Heart failure results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to act as a pump. A recent study (5) revealed 28,702 patients were hospitalized for first-time HF in Ontario between April 1994 and March 1997. Women comprised 51% of the cohort. Eighty-five percent were aged 65 years or older, and 58% were aged 75 years or older. Patients with chronic HF experience shortness of breath, a limited capacity for exercise, high rates of hospitalization and rehospitalization, and die prematurely. (6) The New York Heart Association (NYHA) has provided a commonly used functional classification for the severity of HF (7): CLASS I: No limitation of physical activity. No symptoms with ordinary exertion.CLASS II: Slight limitations of physical activity. Ordinary activity causes symptoms.CLASS III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Less than ordinary activity causes symptoms. Asymptomatic at rest.CLASS IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms at rest.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (7) estimates that 35% of patients with HF are in functional NYHA class I; 35% are in class II; 25%, class III; and 5%, class IV. Surveys (8) suggest that from 5% to 15% of patients with HF have persistent severe symptoms, and that the remainder of patients with HF is evenly divided between those with mild and moderately severe symptoms. To date, the diagnosis and management of chronic HF has concentrated on patients with the clinical syndrome of HF accompanied by severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Major changes in treatment have resulted from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of HF and the results of large clinical trials. Treatment for chronic HF includes lifestyle management, drugs, cardiac surgery, or implantable pacemakers and defibrillators. Despite pharmacologic advances, which include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone, and digoxin, many patients remain symptomatic on maximally tolerated doses. (6) THE TECHNOLOGY: Patients are typically treated by a trained technician in a medically supervised environment for 1 hour daily for a total of 35 hours over 7 weeks. The procedure involves sequential inflation and deflation of compressible cuffs wrapped around the patient's calves, lower thighs and upper thighs. In addition to 3 sets of cuffs, the patient has finger plethysmogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) attachments that are connected to a control and display console. External counterpulsation was used in the United States to treat cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. (9;10) More recently, an enhanced version namely \"enhanced external counterpulsation\" (EECP) was introduced as a noninvasive procedure for outpatient treatment of patients with severe, uncontrollable cardiac ischemia. EECP is said to increase coronary perfusion pressure and reduce the myocardial oxygen demand. Currently, EECP is not applicable for all patients with refractory angina pectoris. For example, many patients are considered ineligible for therapy due to co-morbidities, including those with severe pulmonary vascular disease, deep vein thrombosis, phlebitis and irregular heart rhythms, and heart failure. (1) Very recently, investigation began into EECP as an adjunctive treatment for patients with HF. Anecdotal reports suggested that EECP may benefit patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The safety and effectiveness of EECP in patients with symptomatic heart failure and coronary disease and its role in patients with nonischemic heart failure secondary to LV dysfunction is unclear. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of EECP in the different stages of HF and whether it is only for patients who are refractive to pharmacotherapy is unknown. 2003 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT BY THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The Medical Advisory Secretariat health technology assessment (originally published in February 2003) reported on the effectiveness of EECP for patients with angina and HF. The report concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of EECP in patients with refractory stable CCS III/IV angina as well as insufficient evidence to support the use of EECP in patients with HF.", 
    "35": "The aim of this literature review was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost effectiveness of EECP for the treatment of refractory stable CCS III/IV angina or HF. The standard search strategy used by the Medical Advisory Secretariat was used. This included a search of all international health technology assessments as well as a search of the medical literature from December 2002 to March 2006. A modification of the GRADE approach (11) was used to make judgments about the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations systematically and explicitly. GRADE provides a framework for structured reflection and can help to ensure that appropriate judgments are made. GRADE takes into account a study's design, quality, consistency, and directness in judging the quality of evidence for each outcome. The balance between benefits and harms, quality of evidence, applicability, and the certainty of the baseline risks are considered in judgments about the strength of recommendations.", 
    "36": "The Cochrane and INAHTA databases yielded 3 HTAs or systematic reviews on EECP treatment (Blue Cross Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center [BCBS TEC], ECRI, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]). A search of Medline and Embase December 2005 - March 2006 (after the literature search cutoff from the most recent HTA) was conducted using key words enhanced external counterpulsation, EECP, angina, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure. This search produced 1 study which met the inclusion criteria. This level 4a study was inferior in quality to the RCT which formed the basis of the 2003 Medical Advisory Secretariat recommendation. BCBS reviewed the evidence through November 2005 to determine if EECP improves health outcomes for refractory chronic stable angina pectoris or chronic stable HF. (12) BCBS concluded that the available evidence is not sufficient to permit conclusions of the effect of EECP on health outcomes. Both controlled trials had methodologic flaws (MUST EECP and MUST EECP quality of life studies). The case series and observational studies for both indications while suggestive of a treatment benefit from EECP have shortcomings as well.

    "37": "BACKGROUND.: In this study the effects of 24 weeks losartan and ramipril treatment, both alone and in combination, on blood pressure and left ventricular mass (LVM) and function, have been evaluated in hypertensives. METHODS.: 57 hypertensives with stage 1 and 2 essential hypertension were included. After 4 weeks run in, a randomized double-blind, 3 arm, double dummy, independent trial was used. All patients were randomly allocated to 3 treatment arms consisting of losartan (50 mg/daily), ramipril (5 mg/daily), and combined (losartan 50 mg/ramipril 5 mg/daily) for 24 weeks. LVM, LVM/h(2.7) and other echocardiographic measurements, BUN, creatinine and clearance and potassium were determined after run in and 24 weeks. RESULTS.: All groups were comparable for gender, age, BMI, BP and LVM. The prevalence of baseline left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was not significantly different among 3 groups. At the end of treatment, a significant (p<0.05) reduction in SBP, DBP, MBP, LVM and LVM/h(2.7) were observed in all groups. The absolute and percent reduction in LVM/h(2.7) were significantly higher in combined than losartan or ramipril groups and also in hypertensives with LVH. No significant change in absolute and percent reduction of SBP, DBP and MBP were found. CONCLUSIONS.: These data indicate an additional cardioprotective effect of dual blockade of RAS in hypertensive patients with and without left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "38": "Chest pain with normal coronary arteriograms represents a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to contemporary cardiology. Cardiac syndrome X (CSX), defined as typical angina-like chest pain, a positive response to exercise stress testing and normal coronary arteriograms, encompasses patients with a variety of pathogenic mechanisms. Cardiac ischemia has been documented in approximately 25% of CSX patients and is associated with endothelial dysfunction and microvascular vasodilator abnormalities. Increased endothelin-1, a powerful vasoconstrictor, has been suggested to play a pathogenic role. There is a high prevalence of postmenopausal women with CSX and thus estrogen deficiency has also been proposed to represent a possible pathogenic mechanism. Inflammatory mechanisms and endothelial dysfunction at the coronary microvascular level appear to be important in the pathogenesis of CSX. Treatment with agents that have protective effects on the vasculature and also anti-inflammatory properties, such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been effective in improving both symptoms and electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia in patients with CSX. This review discusses the roles for endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the pathogenesis of CSX, as well as the potential therapeutic implications of these mechanisms.", 
    "39": "It is well recognized that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of arterial pressure and sodium homeostasis. Recent years, many studies have shown that local tissue angiotensin II levels are differentially regulated and cannot be explained on the basis of circulating concentrations. All of the components needed for angiotensin II generation are present within the various compartments in the kidney including the renal interstitium and the tubular network. The cascade of the renin-angiotensin system demonstrates three major possible sites for the pharmacological interruption of the renin-angiotensin system: the interaction of renin with its substrate, angiotensinogen, the angiotensin converting enzyme, and angiotensin II type 1 receptors. This brief article will focus on the role of the intratubular renin-angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of hypertension and the responses to the renin-angiotensin system blockade by renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers.", 
    "40": "Angiotensin (Ang) II is known to amplified bronchoconstriction induced by acetylcholine (ACh). On the other hand all the components of renin angiotensin system were located on lungs. Contractile effects of Ang I (the precursor of Ang II) and interactions between Ang I and ACh on rat bronchial rings were characterize using angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (losartan), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril and teprotide) and chymase inhibitor (chymostatin). We found that Ang I has contractile effects and amplified ACh-induced contractions. Blocking of AT1 receptors with 10 mM losartan significantly reduced 10 mM Ang I contractile effects (12.79 +/- 9.59% from 167.62 +/- 8.92%; p<0.05). Pre-treatment with 1 mM teprotide reduced 10 mM Ang I-induced contractions (35.68 +/- 7.83%; p>0.05). Captopril and teprotide only reduced Ang I actions. This suggested that both types of Ang I effects were mediated by AT1 receptors, but possibly conversion of Ang I into Ang II were not significantly dependent by ACE or chymase.",

Patients were followed up for 297+/-19 days and 93% took one to seven (2.45+/-0.07) antihypertensives. At presentation, the adverse outcome group had higher SBP (151+/-1.5 vs 145+/-2.4 mmHg; P<0.05), proportion of diabetes (39% vs 23%; P<0.05) and creatinine (478+/-22 vs 354+/-11 micromol/l; P<0.05), but lower haemoglobin (10.6+/-0.1 vs 11.2+/-0.2 g/dl; P<0.05). PP increased with age (r(2): 0.4; P<0.0001). PP >80 mmHg was associated with adverse outcome (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test P<0.05). In a model of proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age, baseline creatinine, diabetes and haemoglobin, elevated PP was associated with poorer outcome (hazards ratio: 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.18; P<0.05) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker use was beneficial (hazards ratio: 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.99; P<0.05).",

    "45": "Mortality peri-myocardial infarction (MI) is increased with insulin resistance. As the vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) omapatrilat improves insulin sensitivity, it may be beneficial peri-MI in Zucker Insulin Resistant rats (ZIR). ZIR rats (n = 228) received omapatrilat 10 mg/kg/day, 7 days pre-MI, to 38 days post-MI, or control. Twenty-four protocol (n = 72): a subgroup of rats received the kinin receptor antagonist icatibant. Ambulatory ECG recordings, and MI size were evaluated. Thirty-eight-day protocol (n = 156): left ventricular (LV) remodeling, cardiac hemodynamics, morphology, infarct size, and RT-PCR for GLUT-4 and fetal genes were measured. Omapatrilat improved post-MI survival 24 h (62% vs 38%, P = 0.0007) which was maintained 38 days. There was a kinin-induced reduction of ventricular arrhythmias and there appeared to be a kinin-independent reduction in MI size (23.5 +/- 2.4% vs 17.0 +/- 2.2%, P = 0.053) for 24-h post-MI. Omapatrilat reduced but did not prevent LV dilatation, dysfunction, and fetal gene expression 38 days post-MI. Omapatrilat did not prevent reduced cardiac GLUT-4 expression. In ZIR rats, mortality post-MI is reduced by omapatrilat, due and a kinin-dependent reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and possibly a kinin-independent reduction in MI size. Ventricular dilatation, dysfunction, and fetal gene expression are variably attenuated but not prevented.", 
    "46": "Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by a remodeling process which involves the development of fibrosis. Since angiotensin II has been suspected to be involved in this process, the aim of our study was to investigate a possible influence of an ACE-I therapy in patients with chronic AF regarding the occurrence of left atrial structural remodeling.",

Additionally, a negative correlation (p = 0.01) between collagen content and microcapillary density was observed. To investigate the influence of an ACE-I therapy on this remodeling process, patient groups were divided into AF and SR both with or without ACE-I. Interestingly, there was a significantly lower expression of collagen I in AF with ACE-I (1.04 +/- 0.26) vs. AF without ACE-I treatment (2.07 +/- 0.24, p = 0.02). The microcapillaries were not diminished in AF with ACE-I (180 +/- 15) vs. SR with ACE-I (196 +/- 9), but there was a significant rarification in AF without ACE-I (123 +/- 18; p = 0.03).

    "52": "The unified equation was validated for first order reactions in dynamic CE with a data set of 31 250 elution profiles. Comparison with the results from conventional iterative computer simulation revealed that the unified equation is superior in terms of success rate and precision. The unified equation was applied to determine the cis-trans isomerization rate constants of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The separation of the rotational cis-trans isomeric drug has been performed in an aqueous 66 mM citric acid/Tris buffer at pH 3.0 in a 50 cm polyacrylamide-coated fused-silica capillary. Interconversion profiles featuring pronounced plateau formation and peak broadening were observed. Activation parameters DeltaH not equal and DeltaS not equal were obtained from temperature-dependent measurements between 10 and 25 degrees C in 2.5 K steps. From the activation parameters the isomerization barriers of captopril at 37 degrees C under acidic conditions were calculated to be DeltaG not equal trans-->cis=90.6 kJ/mol and DeltaG not equal cis-->trans=84.6 kJ/mol. By comparison of the kinetic data with the results obtained under basic conditions (pH 9.3) a mechanism of isomerization could be proposed.", 
    "53": "The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has changed our understanding of the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. An estimated one billion people harbour the organism worldwide but the highest prevalence is found in developing countries with up to 80% of people infected. The most favoured modes of transmission are faeco-oral and oral-oral. The mechanisms of H pylori-induced gastroduodenal disease include the provocation of local inflammatory reaction with the release of toxic cytokines, elevation of gastrin concentration and cytotoxic epithelial injury from the activity of urease and other enzymes produced by the bacterium. However, a large proportion of infected persons have no disease or are asymptomatic thereby suggesting that there may be other factors apart from H pylori infection necessary for ulcer formation. The simple finger prick test, a variant of serology and the newly developed ELISA-based Faecal Antigen Test hold the ace for large-scale epidemiological studies. The eradication of H pylori is now a very important goal of treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Most H pylori eradication regimens combine anti-secretory agent, usually a proton pump inhibitor or H2-receptor antagonist and two antibiotics (usually, Clarithromycin and Amoxycillin or Metronidazole). Emergence of antibiotic resistance is worrisome but a quadruple therapy that incorporates bismuth may be used if the triple therapy fails.", 
    "54": "An alkaline serine protease that hydrolyzes soybean protein into strong angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory hydrolysates was isolated from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. SS103 and purified. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration, cationic exchange column chromatography, and anionic exchange column chromatography. When run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing gel, the purified enzyme gave a 36-kDa band and pI 5.5, respectively. The enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 11.0 and 50 degrees C. This enzyme activity was highly inhibited by aprotinin, suggesting it belongs to the serine protease class of enzymes. The K (m) and V (max) of the enzyme, when casein was used for the substrate, were 9.7 x 10-4 mM and 244 microg/minute, respectively. From the results of this study, it is concluded that the purified alkaline protease isolated from Bacillus sp. SS103 should be further studied for production of biofunctional hydrolysates.",

This retrospective registry on a central database included 1814 patients (73.63% men, mean age 59.9 +/- 11.8 years), presented in an average time of 211.63 minutes from pain start. The most frequently used fibrinolitic was streptokinase (66.21%), administered most often in 30 minutes and for a subgroup in 20 minutes--accelerated regimen, with a good efficiency for the reperfusion of the culprit vessel evaluated non-invasively (clinical, electrical and biological methods). The global in-hospital mortality was 11.1%. The only predictors of in-hospital mortality were female gender and advanced age (>75 years) [p < 0.05]. The rate of haemorrhagic complications was not different from the one described by other clinical studies. The treatment by anticoagulants, antiaplatelets agents like aspirin, ACE inhibitors and statins were significant determinants of in-hospital survival. In the subgroup followed-up for 1 year (315 patients), the most frequent complication was the heart failure. In conclusion, in Bucarest, where availability of primary angioplasty in AMI was limited, thrombolysis with streptokinase was still very much used, with acceptable low in-hospital mortality and relatively high rate of artery reperfusion appreciated by non-invasive methods.",

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) remain an attractive alternative in heart failure patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The addition of ARBs to ACE inhibitors in the context of stable heart failure may lead to additional clinical benefits. This is in contrast to heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction, in which it does not offer any therapeutic advantage.", 
    "58": "Chronic kidney disease constitutes a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Left untreated, it progresses inexorably to greater levels of severity at variable rates. The morbid impact of chronic kidney disease is heightened by its role as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the past two decades, considerable gains have been realized in retarding progression of chronic kidney disease by emphasizing blood pressure control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Notwithstanding, the therapeutic goal of preventing or arresting chronic kidney disease progression remains unfulfilled. Currently attainable rates of decrease in glomerular filtration rate remain at 2 to 8 mL/min/y depending on the underlying disease. It is now believed that to achieve optimal therapeutic targets (proteinuria of <500 mg/day and decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 1 mL/min/y, the average age-related decline) we must introduce novel strategies and a multifaceted approach to treatment that interrupts multiple mechanisms of progression. To this end, and wherever relevant, new approaches to cause-specific treatment must be applied, such as targeted immunosuppression, intensive glycemic control, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, in all chronic kidney disease, we must interfere more effectively with the multitude of common mechanisms of progression. Established or putative, such approaches include aggressive blood pressure control; advanced renin-angiotensin system blockade; cytokine modulation and antifibrotic therapy; aldosterone blockade; endothelin blockade, nitric oxide modulation and vasopeptidase inhibition; antioxidant therapy; statin therapy; glycosaminoglycan therapy; anemia therapy; dietary restrictions; lifestyle changes; and pharmacogenomic profiling. Such a concerted, multifaceted approach to management might indeed prevent or arrest progression of chronic kidney disease, or even achieve regression of chronic kidney disease.",

Cox's regression analysis was used to establish the association of age, sex, EF, LVEDD, left atrial diameter, cardiac index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, QRS duration, severity of mitral regurgitation, body mass index, New York Heart Association class and the presence of atrial fibrillation with these events. During follow-up, 23 patients reached the primary endpoint.

However, the value of performance improvement programs in an AMC is often challenging. At Jefferson Medical College, clinical efficiency and bed availability are important priorities to the Department of Medicine. To this end, a multidisciplinary program was designed to (1) improve the quality and consistency of care by adapting and adopting national guidelines for patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome; (2) identify and improve hospital operational supports and maximize resource utilization; (3) increase hospital functional capacity to make way for increased volume; and (4) improve housestaff education and practice by using evidence-based approaches and by optimizing teaching relationships between housestaff and attending faculty. The eight-month project (November 2002 to July 2003) resulted in improvement in several quality measures including increased use of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for heart failure patients, reduced length of stay for heart failure and acute coronary syndrome patients, and increased satisfaction of the clinicians involved in caring for these patients. However, the project was not without barriers including individual physician's unwillingness to embrace change and an inability to incentivize change.

Some of these drugs increase renal urate excretion. Hyperuricaemia and gout are common problems (at least 1% of Western men are affected by gout). Raised SUA levels increase the incidence of acute gout and renal calculi. Hyperuricaemia may also predict an increased risk of vascular events. Therefore, lowering SUA levels is of clinical relevance. In this review we consider the effect on SUA levels of drugs that are prescribed for indications other than treating hyperuricaemia. These drugs may obviate the need for specific treatment (e.g. allopurinol) aimed at lowering SUA levels. Furthermore, because hyperuricaemic patients may already be on several drugs (e.g. due to associated dyslipidaemia, hypertension and/or arthritis) compliance may be improved by avoiding additional medication. The potential for adverse effects associated with polypharmacy would also be decreased.",

There are few prospective trials in pediatric cardiology, but the available data reach a similar conclusion to that of adults with heart failure. Diuretics are an important tool in patients with fluid retention, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are helpful in patients with volume overload of the ventricles. Cardiac glycosides are still in use, but there is a trend toward primary use of diuretics.

Angioedema is a rare cause of neck swelling and upper airway distress occurring after CEA in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.", 
    "81": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) display endothelial dysfunction and are at a high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies suggest that circulating detached endothelial cells (CECs) and stimulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow may reflect endothelial damage.",

In addition, the levels of CD-31+ cells were investigated. Twenty healthy age- (49 +/- 2 years) and gender- (50% men) matched subjects served as controls.", 
    "83": "CECs expressing MICA were increased (7.6 +/- 2.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3%; p < 0.05) in CKD patients, however EPCs expressing Tie-2 or VEGFR-2 were significantly decreased (0.16 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.15%; p < 0.05, and 0.42 +/- 0.10 vs. 2.80 +/- 0.72%; p < 0.01, respectively) as compared to controls. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of CD-31+ cells were significantly elevated (22.8 +/- 4.2 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.8%; p < 0.01) in CKD patients.

Further research is needed to evaluate the independent role of inflammatory endothelial markers as well as the effects of ACE inhibitors on mobilization of EPCs in patients with advanced CKD.", 
    "85": "Dietary calcium appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism and obesity risk. High calcium diets attenuate body fat accumulation and weight gain during periods of over-consumption of an energy-dense diet and to increase fat breakdown and preserve metabolism during caloric restriction, thereby markedly accelerating weight and fat loss. This effect is mediated primarily by circulating calcitriol, which regulates adipocyte intracellular Ca(2+). Studies of human adipocyte metabolism demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca(2+) in regulating lipid metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca(2+) resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and suppression of lipolysis, resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the increased calcitriol produced in response to low calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca(2+) influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity, while higher calcium diets inhibit lipogenesis, promote lipolysis, lipid oxidation and thermogenesis and inhibit diet-induced obesity in mice. Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in attenuating weight and fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy products versus supplemental calcium has been localized, in part, to the whey fraction of dairy and is likely due to additional bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in dairy, as well as the rich concentration of branched chain amino acids, which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity; however, these compounds do not fully account for the observed effects, as whey has significantly greater bioactivity than found in these compounds. These concepts are confirmed by epidemiological data as well as recent clinical trials which demonstrate that diets which include at least three daily servings of dairy products result in significant reductions in body fat mass in obese humans in the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerates the weight and body fat loss secondary to caloric restriction compared to low dairy diets. These data indicate an important role for dairy products in both the ability to maintain a healthy weight and the management of overweight and obesity.", 
    "86": "The beta-adrenergic receptor blockers play an important role in the management of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and chronic heart failure. However, concerns regarding safety and tolerability with currently available agents can limit their use. The beta-blockers vary with regard to several pharmacologic properties, including beta1/beta2 selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and, with the newest beta-blockers, vasodilation. These pharmacologic differences may result in clinically important differences in tolerability and hemodynamic properties. Nebivolol is a novel beta-blocker with both a greater degree of selectivity for beta1-adrenergic receptors than other agents in this class and an ability to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide production, leading to vasodilation and other potential clinical effects. Published randomized, controlled, multicenter studies with nebivolol have shown that once-daily treatment significantly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, compared with placebo, in a dose-dependent manner, and is well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. When compared with other beta-blockers as well as with other antihypertensive classes of agents in head-to-head trials, nebivolol demonstrated similar antihypertensive efficacy and a lower incidence of adverse events. Nebivolol has also been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in a large population of elderly patients with chronic heart failure, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction. Nebivolol is currently available in Europe for the management of hypertension and is expected to be available soon in the United States.", 
    "87": "The effects of pre-operative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment on haemodynamic status and vasoconstrictor requirements during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) were studied. Eighty patients selected for OPCAB were divided into those who had been treated with ACEIs for 4 weeks or more pre-operatively (ACEI group) (n = 43) and those who had not been treated with ACEIs (control group) (n = 37). Noradrenaline was infused during the operation when the mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) fell below 60 mmHg. No significant differences in the haemodynamic parameters measured were detected between the two groups, except for cardiac output, which was found to be significantly greater in the control group. During anastomosis of the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery (OM), a significantly larger amount of noradrenaline was required by the ACEI group compared with the control group. In conclusion, pre-operative treatment with ACEIs significantly increased the amount of vasoconstrictor necessary to maintain the target SAP during OM anastomosis during OPCAB.", 
    "88": "We planned the INNOVATION study to determine whether telmisartan, an angiotensin-2-receptor blocker, delays the progression of renal disease from incipient nephropathy to overt nephropathy in hypertensive or normotensive Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The INNOVATION study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients must have incipient nephropathy (defined as a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio of 100-300 mg/g creatinine) and a serum creatinine concentration of < 1.5 mg/dl for men and < 1.3 mg/dl for women. Patients who need treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are excluded. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to three groups: telmisartan titrated to 40 mg; telmisartan titrated to 80 mg; or placebo. The primary endpoint is the time from baseline visit to first detection of overt nephropathy (defined by a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio that is > 300 mg/g creatinine and 30% higher than the baseline on at least two consecutive visits). A total of 1855 patients have been enrolled from 160 study centres. In 527 randomized patients (28.4% of the enrolled patients), mean (SD) urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and serum creatinine concentration at baseline were 173.3 (47.2) mg/g creatinine and 0.78 (0.19) mg/dl. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients had hypertension at baseline. Mean (SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures at baseline were 137.1 (14.6) and 77.5 (10.3) mmHg. The INNOVATION study will determine whether telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, provides clinical benefits in hypertensive or normotensive patients with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "89": "The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) are well-established. A newer class of medications, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), may be a suitable replacement for ACE inhibitors as a result of a more complete inhibition of angiotensin II and better tolerability among patients. To examine the current literature on the efficacy and safety of ARBs in the setting of CHF, a Medline search was conducted of the English language literature for the years 1987 to 2005. Clinical trials that reported data on cardiac outcomes were reviewed. The earlier trials were direct ARB to ACE inhibitor comparisons (ELITE I and ELITE II). These studies indicated that ARBs do not confer an improvement in cardiac outcomes over ACE inhibitors. RESOLVD, Val-HeFT, and the 3 separate trials of the CHARM program investigated the addition of an ARB to standard therapy. The RESOLVD trial showed no significant differences in clinical events among ACE inhibitor, ARB, and their combination. Although no mortality benefit was evident in the Val-HeFT trial, a substantial reduction in CHF rehospitalizations was reported among patients who were not receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. The CHARM-Overall program demonstrated a significant benefit in cardiovascular death and hospital admissions for CHF with the addition of ARB to standard therapy, a benefit that was more pronounced in patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. In the setting of CHF, rates of cardiac outcomes do not differ substantially between ARBs and ACE inhibitors. However, their combination may improve outcomes for patients with CHF.", 
    "90": "1.-- The effects of captopril on alpha(1)-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein and phenylephrine-induced contraction was assessed in aorta of pre-hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2.-- Four-week-old SHR and WKY rats were treated with captopril [an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 1 week. 3.-- pA(2) values for BMY 7378, an alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist, were 8.63-9.20 among the different groups. Schild slopes were close to unity suggesting that contraction was produced primarily by alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor stimulation and was not changed with therapy. 4.-- Alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein values were higher in pre-hypertensive SHR than in WKY, whereas alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor mRNA was higher in WKY and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors were similar in both strains, and protein was not significantly different for alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-subtypes. 5.-- Captopril decreased maximal contraction in SHR, without having effect in WKY rats, while alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA was decreased in both rat strains but alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor protein was significantly decreased only in SHR, and increased alpha(1A)-mRNA in SHR, no effect of captopril treatment was observed on alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein nor on alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor protein. 6.-- These data suggest that ACE inhibition by captopril influences both expression and function of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors in aorta of pre-hypertensive rats, probably avoiding alpha(1D)-subtype expression by blockade of angiotensin II synthesis.", 
    "91": "Cerebral vasospasm is a common and serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). At present, no consistently effective preventative and therapeutic measures are available, perhaps because of incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of vasospasm. Experimental studies provide evidence that the incidence and severity of vasospasm after SAH can be modulated by drugs that affect neurotransmitter levels, intracellular signalling mechanisms, vascular smooth muscle function, inflammation and cellular proliferation, and the concentration of 'spasmogenic' factors. Preliminary clinical studies indicate that some illicit drugs and common prescription medications can have similar effects in humans. Recognition of these pharmacological effects is important because medications that can worsen or alleviate vasospasm are frequently administered to SAH patients to treat coincident medical problems.", 
    "92": "Perindopril is a third-generation ACE inhibitor that is characterised as a small, lipophilic molecule with a therapeutically active carboxyl side group. These and other features combine to make this a unique member of a very well-established class of drugs that have proven efficacy in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) demonstrated benefit in the secondary prevention of patients with stroke, whereas the Perindopril and Remodelling in Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) trial supports extended routine use after myocardial infarction. The most recent evidence from the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) show that perindopril is able to improve the prognosis of patients with a relatively low global cardiovascular risk, denoted either by the presence of stable coronary artery disease or of essential hypertension in conjunction with at least three other risk factors. The fact that major relative risk reductions have been reported for these two studies is matched by the significance of the findings to modern clinical practice. Both studies were conducted in the context of advance concomitant care that is typically better in clinical trials than in routine practice. In particular, the benefits observed were seen to be of a similar magnitude, and also independent of those resulting from statin therapy. Of particular interest is the likely complimentary action of these treatment strategies with regard to the stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. Perindopril is a well-established drug, the full value of which is only now becoming fully apparent.",

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure is the primary treatment modality, with surgical treatments as alternatives. Oral appliances and pharmacological therapy remain adjunctive modalities. Non-specific treatments include weight loss, postural therapy and behavioural measures. Pharmacotherapy goals include the reduction of risk factors for sleep apnoea; correction of underlying predisposing metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism or acromegaly; treatment of associated symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness; and prevention of apnoeas/hypopnoeas. This paper reviews data supporting the treatment of sleep apnoea with various pharmacological agents, including intranasal corticosteroids, decongestant sprays, nicotine therapy, opiate antagonists, methylxanthine derivatives, oestrogen and progesterone, testosterone, thyroid hormone, growth hormone therapy for acromegaly, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, glutamate antagonists, acetazolamide, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, physostigmine, modafinil and TNF-alpha antagonists, in addition to supplemental oxygen, and carbon dioxide inhalation.

    "94": "This review examines key pharmacological strategies that have been clinically studied for the primary or secondary prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Much information (neuropsychological, genetic and imaging) is already available to characterise an individual's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. However, regulatory pathways for obtaining a prevention indication are less well charted, and such trials tend to involve 3- to 7-year studies of 1000 - 5000 individuals, depending on baseline status. Treatments developed for prevention will also need to have superior safety. For these reasons, > 100 proprietary pharmacological products are currently being developed for an Alzheimer's disease treatment, but only a few are being studied for prevention. Randomised trial data are available for antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), pravastatin, simvastatin, conjugated oestrogen, raloxifene, rofecoxib, CX516 (AMPA agonist) and cholinesterase inhibitors regarding efficacy for Alzheimer's disease prevention. At least four large prevention trials of conjugated oestrogen, selenium and vitamin E, Ginkgo biloba and statins are currently underway. Strategies using other agents have not yet been evaluated in Alzheimer's disease prevention clinical trials. These include anti-amyloid antibodies, active immunisation, selective secretase inhibitors and modulators, microtubule stabilisers (e.g., paclitaxel), R-flurbiprofen, xaliproden, ONO-2506, FK962 (somatostatin releaser), SGS 742 (GABA(B) antagonist), TCH 346 (apoptosis inhibitor), Alzhemedtrade mark, phophodiesterase inhibitors, rosiglitazone, leuprolide, interferons, metal-protein attenuating compounds (e.g., PBT2), CX717, rasagaline, huperzine A, antioxidants and memantine. Studies combining lifestyle modification and drug therapy have not been conducted. Full validation of surrogate markers for disease progression (such as amyloid imaging) should further facilitate drug development. Reducing the complexity of prevention trials and gaining regulatory consensus of design is a high priority for the field.", 
    "95": "Cardiovascular disease accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The clinical trial data available to guide therapy in this growing population subset are relatively limited. This review will focus on treatment approaches and recommendations obtained from subgroup analyses of elderly patients from major clinical trials for the management of chronic stable angina, acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), and coronary revascularization. Recent advances in the treatment of stable angina have shown that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering therapy as adjunctive measures show benefit in the elderly by reducing the occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. However, if patients experience disabling or unstable anginal symptoms despite effective medical therapy, coronary revascularization must be considered. Several clinical trials have shown a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events when using intravenous glycoprotein receptor antagonists periprocedurally during percutaneous revascularization approaches in elderly patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, especially when these measures are performed as soon as possible. However, the success of myocardial revascularization by a percutaneous or surgical approach is highly dependent on the patient's associated comorbidities, especially in patients over age 80 years.", 
    "96": "The hypertensive patient with type 2 diabetes is especially at risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) studies suggested that treatment to a lower target blood pressure resulted in better prevention of clinical disease in these patients. Most trials comparing antihypertensive drugs have shown only minimal differences between the various agents. The evidence from the trials suggests that diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and the angiotensin-receptor antagonists (ARBs) will all successfully reduce adverse clinical events. The largest of the comparative hypertensive drug trials, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), demonstrated that a diuretic has a better hypotensive effect, and was more successful in preventing many aspects of cardiovascular disease compared with CCBs and ACE inhibitors. The importance of good blood pressure control and the general equivalence of antihypertensive drugs were again shown in the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial, which compared an ARB with a CCB. Choice of antihypertensive agent should be individualized and guided by the presence of concomitant clinical disease and the need to protect any specific target organ system in the diabetic hypertensive. Diuretics, being potent hypotensive drugs with clearly demonstrated clinical benefit, should form part of the antihypertensive regimen of most diabetic hypertensives. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are especially useful in preventing nephropathy. Most patients will require a combination of antihypertensive drugs to achieve tight blood pressure control of under 130/80 mm Hg in the diabetic hypertensive. The clinician should concentrate on seeking this lower target blood pressure rather than be excessively concerned about which is the best antihypertensive agent.",

    "121": "In recent years understanding of the role of aldosterone has expanded beyond the known classic effects of promoting renal sodium retention and potassium and magnesium loss. It is now well documented that aldosterone causes myocardial and perivascular fibrosis, blocks the myocardial uptake of norepinephrine, and increases plasminogen activator inhibitor levels. In conjunction with angiotensin II, aldosterone causes vascular damage, endothelial dysfunction, and decreased vascular compliance. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a major role in the development of both hypertension and heart failure and is therefore, a key target for therapeutic interventions. Commonly prescribed medications for control of hypertension and congestive heart failure are inhibitors of the RAAS, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II (A-II) receptor antagonists. There is a well-documented increase in aldosterone levels that occurs over several months during chronic treatment with an ACE-I or A-II receptor antagonist. Such suppression of circulating aldosterone however, is transient, as exemplified by the term \"escape\" used to describe the phenomenon. This rebound of aldosterone even occurs when patients receive both an ACE-I and A-II receptor antagonist. In addition, ACE-I and A-II receptor antagonists are less effective in controlling BP in the estimated 60% of hypertensive patients who are salt (volume) sensitive and more prone to hypertension-associated morbidity such as black patients and type 2 diabetics. Thus chronic and complete blockade of aldosterone action requires an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The \"Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study\" (RALES) trial results in patients with severe heart failure NYHA class III or IV and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent showed that administration of a sub-hemodynamic dose of spironolactone (25 mg a day) as an add on therapy to ACE-I plus standard treatment resulted in a significant mortality reduction due both to decreased death from progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. These findings support the pivotal role of aldosterone in the pathophysiology of progressive heart failure. Although it is an effective antialdosterone agent, widespread use of spironolactone in humans is limited by its tendency to produce undesirable sexual side effects. At standard doses, impotence and gynaecomastia can be induced in men, whereas pre-menopausal women may experience menstrual disturbances. Data on a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, appear promising for the effective blockade of aldosterone and its harmful effects without the sexual disturbances of spironolactone. Recently Eplerenone was successfully introduced for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Growing number of experimental studies are finding a broader role for Aldosterone in driving the pathophysiology of both heart failure and hypertension. When added to conventional therapy aldosterone receptor blockers show benefits which are in addition to those conferred by ACE-I and/or AII receptor blockers.",

Serum albumin (r = -0.46, P<0.001) and net ultrafiltration (r = -0.33, P = 0.009) inversely correlated with MTAC creatinine. Sodium sieving was inversely correlated with BSA (r = -0.33, P = 0.01). Serum albumin also inversely correlated with albumin clearance (r = -0.39, P = 0.02). Finally, the independent covariates that affected alpha2-macroglobulin clearance were age (P = 0.03), diabetes (P = 0.01) and the level of residual renal function (P<0.01). Serum albumin decreased with time on PD (P = 0.02).

The short-term evolution (2 years) of the PM transport properties of patients on APD and icodextrin is still characterized by a progressive increase in small solute transport and a loss of ultrafiltration capacity, as documented in ancient studies, but not with a modification in protein clearances.

    "138": "Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is involved in the regulation of ingestive behaviour and energy homeostasis. Since deletion of the NPY Y2 and Y4 receptor gene increases and decreases food intake, respectively, we examined whether water intake during the light and dark phases is altered in Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice. The water consumption of mice staying in their home cages was measured by weighing the water bottles at the beginning and end of the light phase during 4 consecutive days. Control, Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice did not differ in their water intake during the light phase. However, during the dark phase Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice drank significantly more (46-63%, P<0.05) water than the control mice. The total daily water intake over 24 h was also enhanced. The enhanced water intake during the dark phase was not altered by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan (each injected intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg). These data indicate that NPY acting via Y2 and Y4 receptors plays a distinctive role in the regulation of nocturnal water consumption. While beta-adrenoceptors and angiotensin AT1 receptors do not seem to be involved, water intake in Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice may be enhanced because presynaptic autoinhibition of NPY release and inhibition of orexin neurons in the central nervous system are prevented.",

The objectives of medical therapy are triple: to avoid or control the evolution of the atherosclerotic process, control associated risk factors, and, whenever appropriate, to control symptoms. Four classes of medications have documented a major clinical benefit by decreasing mortality and severe adverse cardiovascular events: antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors. These medications should therefore constitute first line therapy. Beside the use of medications, life style changes (Mediterranean diet, physical exercise, smoking cessation) are also necessary.",

    "144": "Patients with chronic kidney disease and patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment show a sustained overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, which originates from signals arising in the failing kidneys and traveling via afferent renal nerves to cardiovascular centers in the brainstem. Additional important factors are increased levels of angiotensin II and asymmetrical dimethylarginine. The sympathetic overactivity contributes to hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in that patient population. Sympathetic overactivity can be reduced by adrenergic receptor blockers, centrally acting sympathicolytic drugs such as moxonidine and rilmenidine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists. Daily short hemodialysis and long nocturnal hemodialysis may reduce the elevated sympathetic activity, possibly because of an increased clearance of asymmetrical dimethylarginine, an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Prospective trials examining the potential impact of both beta-blockers and centrally acting sympatholytic drugs on cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis patients are very much needed.", 
    "145": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides cause an antihypertensive effect if they reach the systemic circulation. This was investigated for the high ACE inhibitory activity present in peas and whey in vitro gastrointestinal digests. The samples retained high ACE inhibitory activity when incubated in Caco-2 homogenates or rat intestinal acetone powder, both sources of small intestine peptidases. Only little ACE inhibitory activity was transported through Caco-2 cell monolayers in 1 h. As the Caco-2 model is tighter than intestinal mammalian tissue, sufficient absorption of these peptides might occur in vivo. After intravenous administration of 50 mg protein kg(-1) BW in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), pea digest exerted a transient, but strong antihypertensive effect of 44.4 mmHg. Whey digest exerted no effect at this dose. These results suggest that pea digest could be a promising source of ACE inhibitory peptides for use in the prevention and treatment of hypertension.", 
    "146": "Previous studies using non-specific serotonergic agonists and antagonists have shown the importance of serotonergic inhibitory mechanisms in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) for controlling sodium and water intake. In the present study, we investigated whether the serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptor subtype in the LPBN participates in this control. Male Holtzman rats had cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN. Bilateral injections of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.1, 1.25, and 2.5 microg/0.2 microl), into the LPBN enhanced 0.3 M NaCl and water intake of rats injected subcutaneously with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg bw) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (5 mg/kg bw). The increase in NaCl intake produced by 8-OH-DPAT injections was reduced in dose-related manner by pre-treating the LPBN with the selective 5-HT(1A) serotonergic antagonist, WAY-100635 (WAY, 1 and 2 microg/0.2 microl). In contrast, WAY did not affect water intake produced by 8-OH-DPAT. WAY-100635 injected alone into the LPBN had no effect on NaCl ingestion. Injections of 8-OH-DAPT (0.1 microg/0.2 microl) into the LPBN also increased 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by 24-h sodium depletion (furosemide, 20 mg/kg bw plus 24 h of sodium-free diet). Serotonin (5-HT, 20 mug/0.2 mul) injected alone or combined with 8-OH-DPAT into the LPBN reduced 24-h sodium depletion-induced 0.3 M NaCl intake. Therefore, the activation of serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the LPBN increases stimulated hypertonic NaCl and water intake, while 5-HT injections into the LPBN reduce NaCl intake and prevent the effects of serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptor activation.",

The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) - Blood Pressure lowering arm again confirms this assertion. The benefit has been proportional to the blood pressure decrease. However, the use of newest antihypertensive drugs (the long acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine very often associated to the ACE inhibitor perindopril) in the hypertensive population aged from 40 to 79 years with at least 3 additional risk factors showed significantly lower rates of cardiovascular and total mortalities, cardiovascular events, new diabetes or renal impairment as compared to the atenolol-based combination drug regimen (with thiazide as required). It should be noted that almost all the patients also received a low dose of a hypolipidemic drug, atorvastatin. Both arms (the statin arm and the arm using antihypertensive drugs) have yet been stopped, after 3 and 5 years, respectively related to the large beneficial effects noted with the new antihypertensive and statin treatments, although the primary endpoints (non fatal myocardial infarctival and fatal coronary heart disease) were not reached. This study raises many unsolved questions about the explanation for such benefits or the future management of the hypertensive people whose characteristics were very similar to those people frequently encountered in clinical practice. However, the present study emphasizes the considerable efficacy of a combination of amlodipine-perindopril and a low dose of statin.", 
    "152": "In the management of hypertension, the constant lowering of target pressures ever more frequently requires combination treatment in order to achieve the goals set. A combination of amlodipine and perindopril effectively lowered the blood pressure, and significantly reduced overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke risk in comparison with atenolol/bendroflumethiazide. In combination with both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers, diuretics reduced blood pressure more effectively that the respective components used alone. Now, however, the long-term use of diuretics is suspected of increasing the risk of terminal kidney failure and diabetes. This also means an enhanced probability of a cardiovascular event. In the ASCOT study, the combination of beta blocker and diuretic proved inferior to treatment with a calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor. For the long-term application of diuretics as antihypertensive monotherapy, therefore, further comparative studies involving the latest antihypertensives are mandatory.", 
    "153": "Current studies confirm the previous European recommendations according to which the individual evaluation of the patient's risk is superior to a breakdown into general therapeutic groups. Studies on primary prevention show that patients with atrial fibrillation in particular obtain greater benefit from losartan than from atenolol, and that even a small reduction in blood pressure reduced the stroke risk. The greatest benefit was seen in those patients in whom the target pressure was achieved within a period of six months. The combination of a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor prevented significantly more strokes than the combination of a beta blocker and a diuretic. In studies investigators secondary prevention a sartan was found to prevent more cardiovascular events than nitrendipine.", 
    "154": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study demonstrated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, significantly reduces mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke in high-risk cardiovascular patients, beyond the benefits from blood pressure lowering. The tolerability of ramipril 10 mg/day has been an important concern when applying these results. Following the same criteria as the HOPE study, we investigated the adverse effects profile and tolerability of 10 mg ramipril in high-risk patients at our institution. In total, 92 patients with high cardiovascular risk were eligible for this study. Initially, ramipril was prescribed 2.5 mg orally once daily, and then titrated up to 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mg/day at 1-month intervals. The target maintenance dose was 10 mg/day. All adverse events were recorded during at least 3 months of follow-up. After 4-6 months of the titration protocol, only 18 patients (25.3%) reached and remained on ramipril 10 mg/day; 11 (15.5%), 22 (30.9%), and 20 patients (28.2%) remained on 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/day, respectively. Twenty-one patients (22.6%) had at least one adverse event. Twelve patients (13.0%) stopped treatment because of adverse effects. A total of 23 episodes of adverse events were reported, including cough (15.1%), dizziness (6.0%), and hypotension (2.4%). Ramipril was relatively well tolerated in our study population. However, only one-quarter of our patients reached the target maintenance dose of 10 mg/day. Dry cough, dizziness, and hypotension were the major side effects. About 15% of our patients discontinued ramipril treatment, which is comparable with previous reports.", 
    "155": "Patients with untreated heart failure (HF) exhibit a blunted hemodynamic and neuroendocrine response to a high sodium intake, leading to excessive sodium and water retention. However, it is not known whether this is the case for patients with compensated HF receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Therefore, we determined the hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to 1 wk of a low-sodium diet (70 mmol/day) and 1 wk of a high-sodium diet (250 mmol/day) in 12 HF patients and 12 age-matched controls in a randomized, balanced fashion. During steady-state conditions, hemodynamic and neuroendocrine examinations were performed at rest and during bicycle exercise. In seated HF patients, high sodium intake increased body weight (1.6 +/- 0.4%), plasma volume (9 +/- 2%), cardiac index (14 +/- 6%), and stroke volume index (21 +/- 5%), whereas mean arterial pressure was unchanged. Therefore, the total peripheral resistance decreased by 10 +/- 4%. Similar hemodynamic changes were observed during an incremental bicycle exercise test. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and norepinephrine were suppressed, whereas plasma pro-B-type natriuretic peptide remained unchanged. In conclusion, high sodium intake was tolerated without any excessive sodium and water retention in medically treated patients with compensated HF. The observation that high sodium intake improves cardiac performance, induces peripheral vasodilatation, and suppresses the release of vasoconstrictor hormones does not support the advice for HF patients to restrict dietary sodium.", 
    "156": "Hypertension is a common disorder associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, in the US only about one-third of those who are aware of their hypertensive status have their blood pressure adequately controlled. One reason for this is the variable and unpredictable response individuals have to pharmacologic treatment. Clinicians often resort to \"trial-and-error\" to match patients with effective drug treatment. Hypertension pharmacogenetics seeks to find genetic predictors of drug response. To date, more than forty studies have investigated associations between genetic polymorphisms and response to antihypertensive drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers have been most frequently studied, followed by angiotensin II blockers, diuretics, adrenergic alpha-agonists, and calcium channel blockers. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system genes have been the most widely studied, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D variant being typed in about one-half of all hypertension pharmacogenetic studies. In total, 160 possible gene polymorphism-drug interactions have been explored, with about one-quarter of these showing that genes predict drug response. However, disparate and conflicting findings have been the rule rather than the exception, and the discovery of clinically relevant antihypertensive drug-response genes remains elusive. While there is a growing enthusiasm that pharmacogenetics of hypertension is important, the translation of pharmacogenetic findings to clinical practice in the future will depend on additional studies to enhance our pharmacogenetics knowledge base, the availability of pharmacogenetic screening tests that are affordable and easy to implement in clinical practice, a cohort of clinicians who are trained to interpret genetic test results, and health care systems that pay for them. Caution regarding the future of hypertension pharmacogenetics is warranted.", 
    "157": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) activation of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor facilitates the production of brain interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and contributes to the induction of the fever following the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether proinflammatory transcription factors [nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1)] contribute to the ANG II-dependent production of cytokines within the brain. Interestingly, we found that a single i.c.v. injection of LPS had no effect on NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum at either 1 or 3 h post-injection (except for a decrease in hypothalamic AP-1 activity at 1 h). Furthermore, both an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist enhanced (rather than reduced) the NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities in the hippocampus and/or cerebellum of rats given LPS. In contrast, an i.c.v. injection of ANG II increased the NF-kappaB activity in the hypothalamus. These results suggest that while \"endogenous\" ANG II exerts (via AT1 receptors) inhibitory effects on the activation of transcription factors in the brain of rats given LPS, a large dose of exogenous ANG II produces effects opposite to those induced by the presumably small amount of endogenous ANG II released locally by LPS. Our results seem not to support the idea that NF-kappaB and AP-1 play key roles in the ANG II-induced enhancement of the production of proinflammatory cytokines that is induced by LPS in the rat's brain.",

Physicians should identify the risks and benefits of each drug or interventional option being considered for the treatment of HF. Inhibition of the neurohormonal axis with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers has significantly improved morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic HF. An aggressive approach targeted at improving hemodynamics and end-organ function is warranted during acute exacerbations or decompensated heart failure. Immediate recognition and management of potentially reversible causes and simultaneous initiation of supportive therapy to augment the cardiac output are key elements to the successful treatment of acute heart failure.",

The UV-B exposure affecting the stability of captopril before and after captopril-HSA interaction was also examined by using confocal Raman microspectroscopy. The results indicate that the transparent pale-yellow solution for captopril-HSA mixture in all pH buffer solutions, except pH 5.0 approximately 7.0, changed into a viscous form then a gel form with UV-B exposure time. The secondary structural transformation of HSA in the captopril-HSA mixture with or without UV-B irradiation was found to shift the maxima amide I peak in IR spectra from 1652 cm(-1) assigned to alpha-helix structure to 1622 cm(-1) because of a beta-sheet structure, which was more evident in pH 3.0, 8.0 or 9.0 buffer solutions. The Raman shift from 1653 cm(-1) (alpha-helix) to 1670 cm(-1) (beta-sheet) also confirmed this result. Captopril dissolved in distilled water with or without UV-B irradiation was determined to form a captopril disulfide observed from the Raman spectra of 512 cm(-1), which was exacerbated by UV-B irradiation. There was little disulfide formation in the captopril-HSA mixture even with long-term UV-B exposure, but captopril might interact with HSA to change the protein secondary structure of HSA whether there was UV-B irradiation or not. The pH of the buffer solution and captopril-HSA interaction may play more important roles in transforming the secondary structure of HSA from alpha-helix to beta-sheet in the corresponding captopril-HSA mixture than UV-B exposure. The present study also implies that HSA has the capability to protect the instability of captopril in the course of UV-B irradiation. In addition, a partial unfolding of HSA induced by pH or captopril-HSA interaction under UV-B exposure is proposed.",

The method was based on the reaction of carboxylic acid group of the drug with a mixture of potassium iodate (KIO3) and potassium iodide (KI) in aqueous medium at room temperature. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 352 nm as a function of time. The initial-rate and fixed-time methods were adopted for constructing the calibration curves. Both the calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 10.0-70.0 microg mL(-1). The detection limits were 0.02 microg mL(-1) and 0.15-microg mL(-1) for initial rate and fixed time methods, respectively. The proposed methods are validated statistically and through recovery studies. The point and interval hypothesis tests have been performed confirming that there is no significant difference between the proposed methods and the reference method. The experimental true bias of all samples is less than +/- 2%. The methods have been successfully applied to the determination of ramipril in tablets and capsules.",

The extent of renal damage prior to treatment with ACEi reversely correlates with the antiproteinuric effects of ACEi in established adriamycin nephrosis. Sodium restriction enhances the response to ACEi, but whether it can overcome the negative predictive value of preceding renal damage on the therapeutic response is unknown.

The impact of pretreatment damage on the therapeutic response, however, was overcome by low sodium. Thus, the impact of pretreatment damage does not warrant therapeutic nihilism, but rather optimization of therapy response by dietary sodium restriction. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether this also applies to more severe damage, and whether combining ACEi with low sodium diet can improve long-term renal outcome in human.",

Only a single AChE, however, existed in insects and was involved in insecticide resistance, recently another AChE is reported in mosquitoes and aphids. We have cloned cDNAs encoding two ace genes, designated as Ha-ace1 and Ha-ace2 by a combined degenerate PCR and RACE strategy from adult heads of the oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta. The Ha-ace1 and Ha-ace2 genes encode 664 and 647 amino acids, respectively and have conserved motifs including a catalytic triad, a choline-binding site and an acyl pocket. Both Ha-AChEs were determined to be secretory proteins based on the existence of a signal peptide. The Ha-ace1 gene, the first reported ace1 in lepidopterans, belongs to the ace1 subfamily whereas the Ha-ace2 gene showed high similarity to those in the ace2 subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Ha-ace1 gene was completely diverged from the Ha-ace2, suggesting that the Ha-ace genes are duplicated. Quantitative real time-PCR revealed that expression level of the Ha-ace1 gene was much higher than that of the Ha-ace2 in all body parts examined. The biochemical properties of purified proteins by affinity chromatography showed substrate specificity for acetylthiocholine iodide, and inhibitor specificity for BW284C51 and eserine and their peptide sequences partially identified by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer demonstrated that two Ha-AChEs were expressed in vivo.",

A retrospective study was conducted, based on 300 consecutive admissions with the medical record diagnosis of heart failure, in each of seven grade one teaching hospitals. At admission, 49.5% of patients were treated with ACEI, 19.2% with beta-blockers and 8.1% with spironolactone. Twenty-six per cent of untreated patients started ACEI treatment during their hospital stay, and 9.4% started beta-blockers The main determinants of treatment with ACEI at discharge were a primary diagnosis of heart failure (odds ratio (OR) = 1.886) and the presence of a potential contraindication (high creatinine OR = 0.458, cough OR = 0.187, renal artery stenosis OR = 0.309).

However, this progress has come at an unforeseen cost, in the form of emerging long-term effects of anthracycline treatment. A major complication of anthracycline therapy is its adverse cardiovascular effects. If these cardiac complications could be reduced or prevented, higher doses of anthracyclines could potentially be used, thereby further increasing cancer cure rates. Moreover, as the incidence of cardiac toxicity resulting in congestive heart failure or even heart transplantation dropped, the quality and extent of life for cancer survivors would improve. We review the proposed mechanisms of action of anthracyclines and the consequences associated with anthracycline treatment in children and adults. We summarise the most promising current strategies to limit or prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, as well as possible strategies to prevent existing cardiomyopathy from worsening.",

The present study was performed to asses' successful treatment in hypertensive chronic haemodialysis patients by ultra filtration only and ultra filtration combined with medics. We studied 80 hypertensive adult patients who had been on regular haemodialysis treatment for at least 12 months (average duration of 41 months). All subjects were divided in two different antihypertensive treatment groups including 40 subjects each. The first group of patients were treated with trandolapril and ultra filtration, and the second group of patients were only treated with ultra filtration (control group). Blood pressure measurements before and after HD sessions were performed for each patient. Blood pressure control was defined using World Health Organization criteria 140/90 mm Hg. Average systolic blood pressure levels, after haemodialysis, were in the first group of patients 146.33 +/- 9.7 mm Hg, and in the control group 157,86 +/- 10.33 mm Hg. Average diastolic blood pressure was 87.83 +/- 8.11 mm Hg in the first group of patients and, in the control group it was 91.03 +/- 10.67 mm Hg. There were significant differences between systolic blood pressure level in the first group of patients and the control group of patients as well as in diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05).

Between January 1998 and December 2003, &280 million prescriptions for antihypertensive agents were filled in Ontario, and total antihypertensive prescriptions increased by 58% annually; time series analyses confirmed that the prescribing rates for total antihypertensives, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers increased significantly after 1999, even after adjustment for the temporal trends in the pre-1999 data. In the 166,018 nondiabetic individuals over age 65 who were newly treated for hypertension in Ontario between July 1994 and March 2002, changes in prescription rates for total antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers occurred in directions that were consistent with guideline recommendations and were statistically significantly related to the initiation of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program.

Renal function was assessed by measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by renal scintigraphy [(renal uptake of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA)] and plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA. Compared with the placebo group, renal uptake and plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA were not significantly modified after a 7-day period of treatment with tepoxalin or enalapril alone, tepoxalin and benazepril or tepoxalin and enalapril together. No significant change was obtained in GFR after a 28-day period of dosing with tepoxalin and benazepril together.

The use of silanediols is predicated on its resemblance to the hydrated carbonyl transition-state structure of amide hydrolysis. This concept has been tested by replacing the presumed tetrahedral carbon of a thermolysin substrate with a silanediol group, resulting in an inhibitor with an inhibition constant K(i) = 40 nM. The structure of the silanediol bound to the active site of thermolysin was found to have a conformation very similar to that of a corresponding phosphonamidate inhibitor (K(i) = 10 nM). In both cases, a single oxygen is within bonding distance to the active-site zinc ion, mimicking the presumed tetrahedral transition state. There are binding differences that appear to be related to the presence or absence of protons on the oxygens attached to the silicon or phosphorus. This is the first crystal structure of an organosilane bound to the active site of a protease.",

In the last 8-10 months her hypertension had become difficult to control. Her BP ranged between 180/100 mmHg and 220/1220 mmHg on atenolol 100 mg once daily, methyldopa 500 mg three times daily, furosemide 25 mg twice daily, doxazosine 4 mg twice daily. When she was referred to our unit serum creatinine was 2.3 mg/dL and she had a mild proteinuria (70 mg/dL) without microematuria. Ultrasonography showed a left kidney size in the low-normal range (LD 11 cm) and a small right kidney (LD 9 cm). Renal angiography showed a severe, ostial stenosis of the left renal artery and a total thrombosis of the right renal artery with a blood supply to the right kidney provided by collateral channels. An ACE-I was added to the therapy but a sharp increase in serum creatinina (up to 6.4 mg/dL) prompted us to withdraw the drug. She underwent a renal angioplasty on the left side and a Palmaz stent was placed. The control angiography showed a good anatomical result. Three months after the manoeuvre the patient was again referred to our unit with headache, nausea vomiting and hyper-tension refractory to amlodipine 10 mg/day, doxazosine 4 mg twice a a day, atenolol 50 mg/day, furosemide 50 mg/day. A doppler ultrasonography and a magnetic resonance angiogram showed no restenosis on the treated artery. An ACE-I was again administered and BP on this drug was 145/90 mmHg after one month and 130/85 after three months. Headache, nausea and vomiting disappeared. Serum creatinina kept unchanged (2.2 mg/dL). Comment. In this case the benefit of angioplasty on blood pressure control was indirect. Apparently the manoeuvre showed no effect on blood pressure, but the angioplasty allowed us to use of an ACE-Inhibitor, without any negative effect on renal function, and thus to adequately control blood pressure.",

Both the experimental and therapeutic efficiency of different antioxidative compounds (like various antioxidative enzymes) , drugs, metabolites and vitamins for the maintenance of an appropriate intracellular redox potential underline the importance of an excessive ROS-formation for these diseases. Control of excessive ROS-formation can be obtained by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-) inhibitors, by AT (1)-receptor blockers, by statins and other lipid lowering compounds, by improved expression of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase etc.), by compounds such as probucol, certain vitamins, pyruvate, by lipid apheresis and by physical exercise training, which displays surprising efficacy.",

The present study evaluated the economic impact of a modest increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin on CHF hospitalizations. Patients with CHF were identified through the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) database. The efficacy of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin in the first year of treatment were retrieved from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial, a meta-analysis, the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, respectively. Cost of CHF hospitalization was based on the National List of Provincial Costs. Costs of drug treatment were based on the 2002 Alberta Health and Wellness Drug Benefit list. Physician visits for drug titration were also included in the model. A total of 85,679 patients with CHF were identified with a total of 106,130 hospital discharges. A 10% increase in use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin would incur in a total cost due to avoidable hospital admissions of 0.4 million dollars, 1.3 million dollars, 3.7 million dollars and 1.2 million dollars, respectively. Similarly, the costs of drug treatment would be 2.2 million dollars, 1.3 million dollars, 0.3 million dollars and 0.5 million dollars, respectively. An increase in the use of the above medications would save 6.6 million dollars due to avoidable hospital admissions.

    "211": "It is now well established that the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the onset and progression of cardiovascular and renal diseases, and that its main effector, angiotensin II (Ang II) has major pro-inflammatory activity that induces the expression of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. By means of these actions, Ang II induces vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis, and participates in destabilizing atherosclerotic plaque and establishing chronic kidney diseases. Blocking the RAS by inhibiting Ang II generation or blocking angiotensin receptors reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease beyond the levels due to the lowering of blood pressure, and these benefits are at least partially due to the reduction/prevention of both local and systemic inflammatory processes. The aim of this review is to describe the role of the RAS (and particularly Ang II) in initiating and maintaining these processes, and to summarize experimental and clinical evidence supporting the role of drugs acting on the RAS in preventing or modulating inflammation.",

Targeting the renin-angiotensin system clinically delays the onset of type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. Moreover, at least one other angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue (ACE2) plays a significant role in the regulation of heart and kidney function, and as it generates angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin I, it is proposed to counteract the detrimental effects associated with the activation of the classic renin-angiotensin system.",

Since average all-cause mortality risk in these patients is high (up to 27%), definitive diagnostics are recommended to screen all post-MI patients for ALVD, defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of heart failure symptoms. Post-MI management strategies for patients with ALVD target the two routes of progression to heart failure: (1) cardiac remodeling mediated by neurohormonal activation, and (2) continued and recurrent myocardial ischemic events. Clinical trials of neurohormonal antagonists in post-MI ALVD patients have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate left ventircular remodeling and that beta-blocker therapy reverses remodeling for patients already on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Neurohormonal antagonist therapy is also associated with significant reductions in sudden death in post-MI ALVD patients.", 
    "220": "Deficient bioenergetic signaling contributes to myocardial dysfunction and electrical instability in both atrial and ventricular cardiac chambers. Yet, approaches capable to prevent metabolic distress are only partially established. Here, in a canine model of tachycardia-induced congestive heart failure, we compared atrial and ventricular bioenergetics and tested the efficacy of metabolic rescue with the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat. Despite intrinsic differences in energy metabolism, failing atria and ventricles demonstrated profound bioenergetic deficiency with reduced ATP and creatine phosphate levels and compromised adenylate kinase and creatine kinase catalysis. Depressed phosphotransfer enzyme activities correlated with reduced tissue ATP levels, whereas creatine phosphate inversely related with atrial and ventricular load. Chronic treatment with omapatrilat maintained myocardial ATP, the high-energy currency, and protected adenylate and creatine kinase phosphotransfer capacity. Omapatrilat-induced bioenergetic protection was associated with maintained atrial and ventricular structural integrity, albeit without full recovery of the creatine phosphate pool. Thus therapy with omapatrilat demonstrates the benefit in protecting phosphotransfer enzyme activities and in preventing impairment of atrial and ventricular bioenergetics in heart failure.", 
    "221": "The autocrine modulation of cardiac K(+) currents was compared in ventricular and atrial cells (V and A cells, respectively) from Type 1 diabetic rats. K(+) currents were measured by using whole cell voltage clamp. ANG II was measured by ELISA and immunofluorescent labeling. Oxidative stress was assessed by immunofluorescent labeling with dihydroethidium, a measure of superoxide ions. In V cells, K(+) currents are attenuated after activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the resulting ANG II-mediated oxidative stress. In striking contrast, these currents are not attenuated in A cells. Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) also has no effect, in contrast to current augmentation in V cells. ANG II levels are enhanced in V, but not in A, cells. However, the high basal ANG II levels in A cells suggest that in these cells, ANG II-mediated pathways are suppressed, rather than ANG II formation. Concordantly, superoxide ion levels are lower in diabetic A than in V cells. Several findings indicate that high atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels in A cells inhibit RAS activation. In male diabetic V cells, in vitro ANP (300 nM-1 muM, >5 h) decreases oxidative stress and augments K(+) currents, but not when excess ANG II is present. ANP has no effect on ventricular K(+) currents when the RAS is not activated, as in control males, in diabetic males treated with ACE inhibitor and in diabetic females. In conclusion, the modulation of K(+) currents and oxidative stress is significantly different in A and V cells in diabetic rat hearts. The evidence suggests that this is largely due to inhibition of RAS activation and/or action by ANP in A cells. These results may underlie chamber-specific arrhythmogenic mechanisms.",

The primary end point was the change in LV end diastolic volume index (EDVI) after six months' treatment.", 
    "224": "LV EDVI increased with enrasentan but decreased with enalapril (3.9 (1.8) v -3.4 (1.4) ml/m2, p = 0.001). Enrasentan increased resting cardiac index compared with enalapril (0.11 (0.07) v -0.10 (0.07) l/m2, p = 0.04), as well as LV mass index (0.67 (1.6) v -3.6 (1.6) g/m2, p = 0.04). Other variables were comparable between groups. Enalapril lowered brain natriuretic peptide more than enrasentan (-19.3 (9.4) v -5.8 (6.9) pg/ml, p = 0.005). Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) (p = 0.02) increased more with enrasentan than with enalapril. Enrasentan was associated with more serious adverse events compared with enalapril (six (16.7%) patients v one (2.8%), p = 0.02); the rate of progression of heart failure did not differ.", 
    "225": "In asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction, LV EDVI increased over six months with enrasentan compared with enalapril treatment, with adverse neurohormonal effects. This suggests that enrasentan at a dose of 60-90 mg/day over six months causes adverse ventricular remodelling despite an increase in the resting cardiac index.", 
    "226": "Recent clinical trials have explored whether angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or aldosterone blockade should be added to standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/beta blocker treatment in heart failure. Both strategies are of some value but it is unclear which strategy should be used first in patients with mild but symptomatic heart failure. The arguments for and against each strategy are discussed. The strongest argument for aldosterone blockade is the consistency in the results of the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study) studies, but what is lacking is a trial of aldosterone blockade in patients with mild, symptomatic heart failure as such. The strongest argument for ARBs is that the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) Added trial result was positive in the precise patient population of interest (mild, symptomatic heart failure). The strength of this argument is diminished by the somewhat different results in Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial). A third possibility is to use neither an ARB nor an aldosterone blocker and arguments can be marshalled for this position also. Clinicians should now assess these various arguments to select what they believe would be best for their patients.", 
    "227": "The disablement process is often accompanied by sarcopenia or muscle loss, which is associated with virtually all identified disability risk factors. Clinically, the association between body composition and physical performance has been documented by several studies. However, loss of strength is greater than loss of muscle mass with age implying that the quality of remaining muscle may be reduced. Although there are limited data explaining potential physiological mechanisms that contribute to muscle quality, sarcopenia is frequently associated with fat accumulation, and the percentage of body fat increases with age even if weight does not. However, the relationship between fat and muscle function may not be linear, suggesting that there may be an optimal ratio of lean to fat mass for physical function. There are no definitive pharmacological interventions proven to prevent decline in physical function either by modulating body composition or by other means. One exception may be angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). ACE is an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, the central hormonal regulator of blood pressure. Recent evidence suggests that ACEIs may improve physical function by means of direct effects on body composition in older persons, rather than through its blood-pressure-lowering effects. Clinical and genetic studies in humans and experimental evidence in animals suggest that modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is associated with metabolic and biochemical changes in skeletal muscle and fat, changes that are associated with declining physical function. ACEIs may modulate this process through a variety of molecular mechanisms including their influence on oxidative stress and on metabolic and inflammation pathways. This review describes potential biological mechanisms of ACE inhibition and its contribution to declining physical performance and changing body composition. Promising pharmacoepidemiological studies and experimental evidence in animals suggest that there are appropriate models in which to study this effect.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a cellular receptor for two divergent coronaviruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). In addition to hostcell receptors, lysosomal cysteine proteases are required for productive infection by some viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV, but not HCoV-NL63, utilizes the enzymatic activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin L to infect ACE2-expressing cells. Inhibitors of cathepsin L blocked infection by SARS-CoV and by a retrovirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein but not infection by HCoV-NL63 or a retrovirus pseudotyped with the HCoV-NL63 S protein. Expression of exogenous cathepsin L substantially enhanced infection mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein and by filovirus GP proteins but not by the HCoV-NL63 S protein or the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. Finally, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification had substantially less effect on infection mediated by the HCoV-NL63 S protein than on that mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein. Our data indicate that two coronaviruses that utilize a common receptor nonetheless enter cells through distinct mechanisms.",

Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55-2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74-1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts.

The binding of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein to cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the first step in SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we assayed the inhibitory effects of small peptides derived from S protein on the binding of S protein to ACE2 and on the S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus infectivity. SP-4 (residues 192-203), SP-8 (residues 483-494), and SP-10 (residues 668-679) significantly blocked the interaction between S protein and ACE2 by biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with IC(50) values of 4.30 +/- 2.18, 6.99 +/- 0.71, and 1.88 +/- 0.52 nmol, respectively. Peptide scanning suggested the region spanning residues 660-683 might act as a receptor-binding domain. SP-10 blocked both binding of the S protein and infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells. In conclusion, this is the first report of small peptides designed to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2. Our findings suggest that SP-10 may be developed as an anti-SARS-CoV agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection.",

In our population, 45% of the patients had an angiotensin II plasma concentration higher than 16 pmol/L (median concentration was 14.1 pmol/L). Spironolactone use was an independent predictor of elevated plasma angiotensin II levels. Furthermore, spironolactone users had significantly higher plasma active renin protein and aldosterone levels.

    "250": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific biomarker of inflammation. Recent research has shown that inflammation is an important step in the genesis of atherosclerosis, and is involved in the development of unstable plaques. Measurement of serum levels of CRP using a high sensitivity assay (hsCRP) can demonstrate subclinical inflammatory states, which may reflect vascular inflammation. Clinical studies have shown that elevated hsCRP levels in healthy populations predict vascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke as well as the development of diabetes. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, higher hsCRP levels are associated with adverse outcomes and subsequent vascular events. There is data to suggest that aspirin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins), which all reduce vascular event rates, also reduce serum levels of hsCRP and therefore hsCRP levels may potentially guide therapy. As well as having a critical role in risk prediction, recent evidence has emerged implicating CRP directly in atherogenesis. CRP has been found in human atherosclerotic plaque and CRP has been shown to cause endothelial cell dysfunction, oxidant stress and intimal hypertrophy in experimental models. We review the postulated roles of CRP in atherogenesis and prediction of vascular events, as well as discussing current recommendations for CRP testing in patients.",

    "260": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a well known regulator of blood pressure (BP) and determinant of target-organ damage. It controls fluid and electrolyte balance through coordinated effects on the heart, blood vessels, and Kidneys. Angiotensin II (AII) is the main effector of the RAAS and exerts its vasoconstrictor effect predominantly on the postglomerular arterioles, thereby increasing the glomerular hydraulic pressure and the ultrafiltration of plasma proteins, effects that may contribute to the onset and progression of chronic renal damage. AII may also directly contribute to accelerate renal damage by sustaining cell growth, inflammation, and fibrosis. Interventions that inhibit the activity of the RAAS are renoprotective and may slow or even halt the progression of chronic nephropathies. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can be used in combination to maximize RAAS inhibition and more effectively reduce proteinuria and GFR decline in diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease. Recent evidence suggests that add-on therapy with an aldosterone antagonist may further increase renoprotection, but may also enhance the risk hyperkalemia. Maximized RAAS inhibition, combined with intensified blood pressure control (and metabolic control in diabetics) and amelioration of dyslipidemia in a multimodal approach including lifestyle modifications (Remission Clinic), may achieve remission of proteinuria and renal function stabilization in a substantial proportion of patients with proteinuric renal disease. Ongoing studies will tell whether novel drugs inhibiting the RAAS, such as the renin inhibitors or the vasopeptidase inhibitors, may offer additional benefits to those who do not respond, or only partially respond, to this multimodal regimen.", 
    "261": "The link between the kidney and hypertension has been considered a villain-victim relationship. High blood pressure levels are a well-recognized feature in chronic renal disease, but the ability of mild-to-moderate hypertension to produce renal insufficiency has been questioned. Nephrosclerosis, benign nephrosclerosis, and hypertensive kidney disease are terms that clinicians use when renal damage is thought to be secondary to essential hypertension. Many cases of end-stage renal disease are ascribed to so-called benign nephrosclerosis. This entity could actually be a primary renal disease affecting the preglomerular microvasculature, perhaps genetically mediated and ethnically influenced, and showing a heterogeneous clinical expression. African Americans suffer from nephrosclerosis more frequently than Caucasians. Nephrosclerosis affecting Caucasians seems to show a less aggressive pattern and could represent early age-related renal sclerosis. The risk of end-stage renal disease is increased when atherosclerotic lesions in large renal arteries coexist. Age, systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, and concomitant cardiovascular disease are well-known promoters of renal failure. A multifactorial strategy, including antihypertensive and antiproteinuric drugs, and lipid-lowering and anti-platelet agents, could improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with nephrosclerosis.", 
    "262": "End-stage renal disease is a social and economic threat worldwide. In this context, any medical intervention that may prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease becomes extremely important. Improving the cardiovascular status is another major objective in the management of this population, because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among dialysis patients. Moreover, this is only the tip of the iceberg, because many patients die before reaching end-stage renal disease. Today, several interventions are available to delay the progressive loss of renal function and/or prevent the development of cardiovascular disease, but we are still far from being satisfied. These interventions include low protein diets, correction of calcium-phosphate disorders and anemia, blood pressure and proteinuria control, and smoking cessation. Other interventions, such as the administration of lipid-lowering agents, are emerging as particularly promising therapeutic approaches. Recently, growing attention has been paid to polytherapeutic approaches to chronic kidney disease, in order to control different causal factors involved in progression and reduce them as much as possible. However, larger prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trials are needed to demonstrate their actual usefulness. All the interventions are likely to be more effective if performed as early as possible in the course of the disease, because it has been widely demonstrated that early and regular nephrologic care is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality.", 
    "263": "The level of proteinuria is one of the most important risk factors for progressive renal function loss in renal diseases. Any therapeutic measure that reduces proteinuria will slow or halt the progression of proteinuric nephropathies. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or AT1-receptor antagonists (ARA) is currently the most powerful available antiproteinuric treatment. Recent investigations point out that blockade of RAAS at other levels (e.g., aldosterone or renin antagonists) could also induce a significant decrease in proteinuria. Because angiotensin II is also generated from angiotensin I by enzymes other than ACE, ARA would provide a more effective blockade of angiotensin II; however, ACE inhibition increases plasma levels of substances such as bradykinin and N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline, which have strong antifibrotic properties. These differential effects of ACE inhibitors and ARA are the rationale for combined administration of both agents, which in clinical studies has demonstrated a significantly higher antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect than by either drug alone. Salt and protein restriction, as well as cautious use of diuretics, can also increase the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS blockade. Treatment with statins or other lipid-lowering agents leads to reduction in proteinuria levels, as some meta-analyses have demonstrated. Smoking is associated with an increased risk for the appearance of proteinuria, so cessation of smoking should be mandatory in proteinuric renal diseases. Recent studies have highlighted an epidemic increase of obesity-related proteinuric glomerulopathies; weight loss is effective not only in this condition, but also in overweight patients with proteinuric nephropathies of other etiologies.",

The number of patients with hyperkalemia (>5.5 mEq/L) at 12 months of treatment was 12 (8.8%), while the number of patients with hypokalemia (<or=3.5 mEq/L) was 7 (5.1%). However, the occurrence of hyperkalemia was almost the same regardless of the dose of spironolactone or the ACE-I or ARB concomitantly administered.

    "273": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a novel class of antihypertensive agents that concomitantly inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, on renal function and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response in anesthetized 9-10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Intravenous injection of omapatrilat at 10 micromol/kg decreased systemic blood pressure and renal vascular resistance. Renal plasma flow was unchanged, whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtration fraction (FF) were reduced. Increased urinary sodium excretion of tubular origin was observed. These parameters remained unaltered with vehicle treatment. Micropuncture study revealed that the maximal reduction of early proximal flow rate (EPFR) induced by orthograde perfusion of Henle's loop with artificial tubular fluid (ATF) was significantly reduced by omapatrilat treatment (28.5+/-3.1% vs. 72.0+/-2.8% of control) and was not significantly changed in the vehicle-treated group (vehicle 70.8+/-1.7% vs. control 71.0+/-2.1%). EPFR at zero perfusion was comparable between omapatrilat and vehicle treatment (29.7+/-2.2 vs. 31.3+/-2.1 nl/min, respectively). Luminal perfusion of 10(-4) mol/l 7-nitroindazole in ATF abrogated the blunting of TGF response by omapatrilat but elicited no change in the vehicle-treated group. The suppression of the TGF mechanism and the reduction in FF suggest that omapatrilat respectively dilates the afferent and efferent arterioles. Under such conditions, reduction of GFR may indicate a fall in intraglomerular pressure. The restoration of nitric oxide signaling in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of SHR seems to participate in the inhibition of TGF by omapatrilat. These findings suggest that omapatrilat may provide a novel approach to the treatment of systemic and glomerular hypertension.", 
    "274": "Antihypertensive therapy based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke in the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS). The present study assessed the effect of perindopril on the 24-h blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with lacunar infarction using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). There was a 4-week observation period, a 4-week treatment period 1 (perindopril at 2 mg/day), and a 4-week treatment period 2 (perindopril at 4 mg/day). Twenty-seven hypertensive patients with lacunar infarction (10 dippers and 17 non-dippers) were enrolled. The average 24-h BP values were significantly decreased after both treatment periods. When the patients were divided into dippers and non-dippers, perindopril exhibited a different BP-lowering effect in the groups with these two circadian BP patterns. In dippers, daytime BP was significantly decreased, whereas nighttime BP was not, so an excessive fall of nighttime BP was not observed. In non-dippers, both daytime and nighttime BP were decreased, with a stronger BP-lowering effect at night. There was a significant inverse correlation between the magnitude of the change in nighttime BP and the night/day ratio. These results suggested that perindopril could induce a sustained decrease of the 24-h BP in patients with lacunar infarction. In particular, a more pronounced nighttime BP-lowering effect was observed in non-dippers. As the incidence of non-dippers is reported to be high among patients with cerebrovascular disease, better nighttime BP control by perindopril might have helped to improve the outcome of such patients in PROGRESS.",

    "276": "To clarify the beneficial effects of cilnidipine, an L- and N-type calcium channel blocker, which were clinically observed against diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophied hearts of hypertensive patients, we investigated the effects of cilnidipine on cardiac remodeling and enhanced gene expression in stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats in comparison with that of captopril, a well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, at threshold doses with little blood pressure lowering effect. The expression of type III collagen and beta/alpha-myosin heavy chain as well as transforming growth factor-beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor were suppressed by both treatments, indicating the prevention or amelioration of cardiac dysfunction. Such beneficial effects were much more intense with cilnidipine treatment than in captopril. These results indicate that Ca2+ is a key factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling in hypertension. One possible beneficial effect of cilnidipine in the prevention of cardiac dysfunction may be due to the decreased amount of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta and basic fibroblast growth factor via direct action for Ca2+ influx and also via inhibition of local renin-angiotensin system in the myocardium.", 
    "277": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading cardiovascular health problems in Europe and the United States. Acute decompensated HF remains a lethal diagnosis with a morbidity and mortality that often exceeds neoplastic or infective diseases. The incidence of HF continues to increase despite an intensive effort to increase education and delivery of healthcare to these affected patients. Yet, current guidelines in the United States do not address the management of acute decompensated HF, and focus predominantly on chronic stable systolic HF as well as patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Although the European Society of Cardiology has established some parameters for the management of acute HF, these guidelines are largely established by expert opinion, and are predominantly devoid of prospective randomized data in this cohort of patients. Current pharmacotherapies for acute decompensated HF include diuretics, neurohormonal antagonists, vasodilators, and inotropes. Regrettably, all of these drugs have their limitations in acute HF. Neurohormonal antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality, but may be inadequate to achieve and maintain the necessary hemodynamic relief required in advanced HF; while, bolus diuretics, a mainstay of initial symptomatic relief, may be maladaptive and up-regulate adverse neurohormonal regulatory mechanisms longterm with no positive impact on longterm mortality. Today, for those advanced HF patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal conventional therapy, limited treatments exist; but as newer therapies evolve, the options will expand to include more than palliative care, heart transplant and ventricular assist devices for these patients.", 
    "278": "Heart failure (HF) is a common complication of myocardial infarction (MI) that carries a poor prognosis when present. HF and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) occur in approximately 40% of patients who suffer acute MI. The estimated mortality of patients developing HF or LVSD post-MI is 20% to 30%, with that risk varying based on the presence of HF upon initial assessment versus occurring later during the MI hospitalization. Clinical factors and comorbidities associated with post-MI HF include age, diabetes, hypertension, female gender, infarct size, and tachycardia. Factors associated with decreased survival in patients with post-MI HF include Killip class, age, low blood pressure, tachycardia, male gender, and anterior location of MI. Despite extensive data identifying this patient population as high risk, patients with post-MI HF or LVSD are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based medications or revascularization procedures than those without HF. Despite the high prevalence of HF after MI, few studies have examined therapies to prevent it. This review summarizes studies that reported the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of patients with post-MI HF or LVSD. Additionally, we discuss therapies to prevent post-MI HF and treatment of patients with post-MI HF and/or LVSD.",

Blood pressure response rates reached 69.6% on enalapril plus lercanidipine as compared with 53.6% on enalapril plus HCTZ (difference between treatments, P > 0.05).

    "291": "Insulin sensitivity decreases for the first time in females at the time of menarche. A much more profound decrease in insulin sensitivity is observed at the end of pregnancy. This physiological insulin resistance is not accompanied by a rise in overall sympathetic activity as reflected in plasma noradrenaline levels, but there is evidence of moderate sympathetic overactivity in muscle and the heart. Pre-eclampsia is characterized by increased insulin resistance, sympathetic overactivity and a particular lipid profile. Thus it is the first manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia have persistent insulin resistance after pregnancy associated with increased sympathetic activity of the cardiovascular system, and coronary artery disease later in life. Aging is accompanied by a greater increase in sympathetic traffic in women than in men, and inflammation (measured via C-reactive protein) seems to be more strongly related to metabolic syndrome in women than in men. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be shown. As the key factors of metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance and sympathetic overactivity, are closely inter-related, treatment should be aimed at cutting the vicious circle at many points: lifestyle modification (diet, increasing exercise) as a basis of therapy, use of insulin sensitizers (e.g. metformin) to decrease insulin resistance, central sympatholytics (e.g. moxonidine), and AT-receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to overcome sympathetic overactivity, hypertension and inflammation.",

Individuals with diabetes are not only more likely to develop hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, but are also at a significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Angiotensin II plays a key pathophysiological role in the progression of diabetic renal disease, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II antagonists has therefore become an important therapeutic strategy to reduce renal and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated the effects of angiotensin II antagonists on the reduction of albuminuria and the progression of renal disease from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria. More importantly, several endpoint trials have shown that the antiproteinuric effects of losartan and irbesartan translate into cardiovascular and renoprotective benefits beyond blood pressure lowering, thereby delaying the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation by several years. These and other studies indicate that angiotensin II antagonists not only improve survival and quality of life of patients with diabetic nephropathy, but also have the potential to reduce the substantial healthcare burden associated with managing these patients. ACEi also appear to exert similar beneficial effects in diabetic patients, but whether clinically significant differences in renoprotection or mortality exist between angiotensin II antagonists and ACEi in patients with type 2 diabetes remains to be fully investigated in appropriate head-to-head studies.", 
    "297": "Observational studies have provided evidence that a consistent fraction (approximately 15-20%) of hypertensive patients displays a glucose intolerance state that may be aggravated by antihypertensive drug regimens based on thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers. This review examines the relative and absolute diabetogenic effects of antihypertensive drugs, by comparing the impact of 'new' (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) versus 'old' (diuretics and beta-blockers) drugs on new-onset diabetes in recent clinical trials. Evidence is provided that compared with diuretics and beta-blockers, new-onset diabetes is less common with 'new' drugs, and that conventional antihypertensive compounds, particularly when combined together, may amplify the natural time-dependent tendency towards the development of this metabolic disease. This paper provides new insights into the potential mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon and the clinical significance of antihypertensive drug-induced diabetes.", 
    "298": "More than half of all persons with heart failure (HF) have diastolic HF. The prevalence of diastolic HF increases from 46% in persons younger than 45 years to 59% in those 85 years and older. The annual mortality rate associated with diastolic HF is >10%. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms of HF, elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide, preserved left ventricular systolic function, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction by Doppler examination on two-dimensional echocardiography. Approximately 80% of patients with diastolic HF have increased left ventricular mass and a history of hypertension. Neurohormonal activation is a key aspect of this condition. Studies suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, specifically direct cardiac effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone, contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of diastolic dysfunction. Hence, there is a rationale for use of agents that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients with heart failure.",

Twenty-one type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy with a 24 h urinary protein excretion rate (UPER) of > 1.0 g/24 h and creatinine clearance (Ccr) of 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2 completed the entire study.",

Although there was no comparable change in BP and plasma/urinary biochemical parameters, 24-h UPER was significantly reduced by the combination therapy (2.9 +/- 1.4 g/24 h) compared with that of ramipril (3.5 +/- 1.8 g/24 h) and of candesartan (3.3 +/- 2.0 g/24 h) single therapy (P < 0.05). Urinary TGF-beta1 level was reduced in all three therapies compared with that of the control (28.4 +/- 16.1 pg/mg cr) (P < 0.05). However, the combination therapy showed the most significant change (combination 19.6 +/- 10.6 pg/mg cr; ramipril 24.7 +/- 13.3 pg/mg cr; candesartan; 23.4 +/- 11.7 pg/mg cr).

Further study on the dose-titration is mandatory in terms of safety and especially for maximizing renoprotection in this patient population.", 
    "303": "Recent reports have shown a decrease in blood pressure associated with the consumption of flavanol-containing foods. However, the mechanism behind this effect is not yet known. Previously we demonstrated that the flavanol epicatechin and its related oligomers, the procyanidins, inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro. In this study, we further characterized epicatechin monomer, dimer, tetramer and hexamer ACE inhibitory effect, by performing fluorescence quenching and kinetic assays, using angiotensin I as substrate. Assessment of ACE activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) indicated that the tetramer was the most active inhibitor decreasing the formation of angiotensin II by 52% (P<0.001). When ACE activity was measured using isolated rabbit lung ACE, dimer, tetramer and hexamer inhibited angiotensin II production at IC(50) values of 97.0, 4.4, and 8.2 microM, respectively. The quenching of ACE tryptophan fluorescence was assayed to evaluate the molecular interaction between ACE and procyanidins. The hexamer was the most active quencher decreasing ACE fluorescence by 56%, followed by the tetramer and the dimer, decreasing ACE fluorescence by 37% and 36%, respectively. ACE activity was evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of the ACE activator chloride ion (Cl(-)). Increased Cl(-) concentrations reduced IC(50) values for the dimer and tetramer. Finally, ACE inhibition was determined in the presence of different albumin concentrations. The presence of albumin did not reverse the ACE inhibition by dimer and tetramer, but decreased hexamer inhibition by 65%. In summary, the inhibitory effect of procyanidins on ACE and the extent of this inhibition were largely dependent on procyanidin structure. ACE inhibition by procyanidins in vivo might provide a mechanism to explain the benefits of flavonoid consumption on cardiovascular diseases.",

    "309": "Recent studies have revealed that angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and tumor growth. We previously reported that the clinically used vitamin K(2) (VK) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) exerted potent anti-angiogenic activities. The aim of our current study was to examine the combination effect of VK and ACE-I on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethyl-nitrosamine, and orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth in rats. When used individually, both VK and ACE-I at clinically comparable low doses exerted significant inhibitory effects on tumor development in the liver. A combination treatment of VK and ACE-I showed a more potent suppressive effect against hepatocarcinogenesis. Neovascularization increased during hepatocarcinogenesis, and VK and ACE-I significantly attenuated angiogenesis in the tumor. In orthotopic HCC transplantation, VK and ACE-I also showed marked suppressive effects against HCC development similar to those against hepatocarcinogenesis. In both experiments, the suppressive effects of VK and ACE-I against angiogenesis were similar in magnitude to their inhibitory effects against hepatocarcinogenesis and orthotopic HCC development. In the orthotopic model, VK and ACE-I treatment resulted in a marked increase of apoptosis in the tumor, whereas tumor cell proliferation itself was not altered. Since both VK and ACE-I are widely used in clinical practice without serious side effects, this combination therapy may be an effective new therapeutic strategy against hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC growth in the future.",

Oxidative stress was suggested to be implicating in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Many antioxidative plants were shown to be cardioprotective in experimental models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of pretreatment with alcoholic extract of Tinospora cordifolia in an in vivo rat model. The model adopted was that of surgically-induced myocardial ischemia, performed by means of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (LAD) for 30 min followed by reperfusion for another 4 h. Infarct size was measured by using the staining agent TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride). Lipid peroxide levels in serum and in heart tissue were estimated spectrophotometrically by the methods developed by Yagi and Ohkawa et al. respectively. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. A dose dependent reduction in infarct size and in lipid peroxide levels of serum and heart tissue were observed with the prior treatment of T. cordifolia with various doses for 7 d compared to control animals. Hence, the present study suggests the cardioprotective activity of T. cordifolia in limiting ischemia-reperfusion induced myocardial infarction.", 
    "311": "Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 are potent vasoconstrictors that appear to play a role in retinal blood flow regulation. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of the angiotensin and the endothelin system in the regulation of retinal vessel diameters during isometric exercise in healthy humans. The study design was randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, and three-way cross over. Twelve healthy subjects performed squatting exercises for 6 min during infusion of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), an ET(A)-receptor antagonist (BQ-123), or placebo. Retinal vessel diameters were measured continuously with the Zeiss retinal vessel analyzer. Systemic hemodynamics were assessed noninvasively, and intraocular pressure was measured with applanation tonometry. Squatting induced a significant increase in blood pressure and pulse rate, which was paralleled by a vasoconstriction in retinal arteries and veins. Intraocular pressure was only slightly increased during the squatting periods. BQ-123 significantly blunted the exercise-induced decrease in venous (P < 0.01) and arterial (P < 0.02, ANOVA) vessel diameters but had no effect on basal retinal diameters. By contrast, enalapril did neither influence vessel diameter at baseline conditions nor in response to isometric exercise. The data of the present study indicate that retinal vasoconstriction during isometric exercise is modified by ET(A)-receptor blockade, whereas it is not altered by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Hence, the present data indicate that endothelin-1, but not angiotensin II, is involved in retinal blood flow regulation during isometric exercise.",

    "313": "MI was induced by coronary ligation. After 2 weeks rats were randomised to quinapril (QUI), HCTZ added to quinapril (QUI+HCTZ), or low sodium diet added to quinapril (QUI+LS). Survival was monitored for 62 weeks, after which left ventricular (LV) pressures were measured and blood for neurohumoral characterisation was collected. A separate group of rats, subjected to the same procedure, was evaluated after 35 weeks.", 
    "314": "After 62 weeks, mortality was comparable in all groups. However, survival was improved by HCTZ until 35 weeks. This effect on survival was paralleled by decreased proteinuria and LV end-diastolic pressures in QUI+HCTZ rats at 35, but not 62 weeks. Plasma renin activity was significantly decreased in QUI+HCTZ rats at 35 weeks. Contrary to HCTZ, LS added to QUI caused no benefit.", 
    "315": "Adding HCTZ, but not LS, to quinapril improved survival, neurohumoral status, and proteinuria during the early chronic phase of experimental post-MI LV dysfunction. Since no adverse effects were observed, HCTZ may safely be used to improve ACEi therapy.", 
    "316": "Hypertensive crisis is a serious condition that is associated with end-organ damage or may result in end-organ damage if left untreated. Causes of acute rises in blood pressure include medications,noncompliance, and poorly controlled chronic hypertension. Treatment of a hypertensive crisis should be tailored to each individual based on the extent of end-organ injury and comorbid conditions. Prompt and rapid reduction of blood pressure under continuous surveillance is essential in patients who have acute end-organ damage.", 
    "317": "Acute heart failure and cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a common cause of respiratory distress among patients presenting to the emergency department. The emergency department is frequently the primary entry point into the health care system for these patients and is the site of initial stabilization, evaluation, and management of the patient.Emergency physicians, alongside cardiologists, play a critical role as these patients are treated in the emergency department and transferred to the cardiac ICU. The approach to the critically ill patient who has heart failure should be multidisciplinary and involve the emergency physician and the cardiologist who will care for the patient.", 
    "318": "Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that results in diminished tissue perfusion and volume overload. Because of increasing population age and improved survival after myocardial infarction, the prevalence of heart failure is likely to increase dramatically. Primary care physicians are in an ideal position to care for patients throughout the spectrum of heart failure, from identifying patients at increased risk to managing the final stages of the disease. New understandings of heart failure pathophysiology have led to more effective treatments aimed at blocking neurohormonal pathways. There is still much to be learned about the pathophysiology and treatment of diastolic heart failure, and rapidly expanding knowledge of heart failure is likely to lead to better treatment in the coming years.", 
    "319": "Impaired cardiac function is frequently accompanied by peripheral vascular dysfunction and a pro-inflammatory condition, which may be associated with elevated levels of angiotensin II. We hypothesized that the magnitude of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery of post myocardial infarction patients will correlate with serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) will increase FMD by reducing TNFalpha and CRP. Patients were treated with low dose (10 mg/day) quinapril (Q) or enalapril (E) and their effects on FMD and inflammatory markers were evaluated after 8 and 12 weeks. Before treatment, in both groups FMD showed a low value (Q: 2.95+0.42% and E: 3.3+/-0.33%), whereas TNF-alpha (Q: 31.65+/-8.23 pg/ml and E: 29.5+/-5.9 pg/ml) and CRP (Q: 7.28+/-2.96 mg/ml and E: 7.08+/-3.02 mg/ml) were elevated. In the Q group, but not in the E group FMD increased significantly, (to 5.96+1.10%), whereas TNF-alpha (19.0+/-12.21 pg/ml) and CRP (to 3.91+/-1.82 mg/L) significantly decreased after 8 and 12 weeks of Q treatment. Moreover, the magnitude of FMD showed a strong inverse correlation with serum levels of TNF-alpha and CRP after Q treatment. Thus, in post myocardial infarction patients endothelial dysfunction assessed by FMD correlates with elevated levels of plasma inflammatory markers, and low dose quinapril improves endothelial function, likely by reducing vascular inflammation.", 
    "320": "The effects of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, atenolol, a beta adrenergic receptor blocker and amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker were investigated in chronic alcohol administered rats. Adult male Wistar rats (240-320 g) were used in the present study. Alcohol was given to rats by a modified liquid diet for 21 days. Perindopril (2.5 and 5 mgkg(-1)), atenolol (5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) and amlodipine (5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) were injected to rats in different groups intraperitoneally for 21 days. Control rats were pair fed by an isocaloric liquid diet containing sucrose as a caloric substitute for alcohol. Saline was injected to control rats for 21 days. Rats were anesthetized with ether. Their hearts were removed and 1 mm3 samples from left ventricles were fixed. Five fields per heart were examined and photographed with transmission electron microscope. Blood alcohol levels were also measured spectrophotometrically. Daily alcohol consumption of the rats was in a range of 12.09-15.5 g kg(-1). Blood alcohol concentrations were found as 145.63 mg dl(-1) at 21st day of alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol consumption caused some marked myocardial injuries. Perindopril and atenolol but not amlodipine produced some significant beneficial effects on alcohol-induced myocardial damages. Our results imply that perindopril and atenolol but not amlodipine have protective effects on heavy chronic alcohol consumption-induced myocardial injury in rats.",

The EST gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the recombinant protein is a non-disulfide-linked homotrimer with a monomer molecular weight of 33,000 in both solution and crystalline states, indicating that these ESTs function as trimers. EST hydrolyzed dl-MATI to produce DAT with a degree of conversion of 49.5% and an enantiomeric excess value of 97.2% at an optimum pH of about 8 to 10 and an optimum temperature of about 57 to 67 degrees C. The crystal structure of EST has been determined by X-ray diffraction to a resolution of 1.6 A, confirming that EST is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes and includes a catalytic triad of Ser97, Asp227, and His256. The active site is located approximately in the middle of the molecule at the end of a pocket approximately 12 A deep. EST can hydrolyze the methyl ester group without affecting the acetylthiol ester moiety in dl-MATI. The examination of substrate specificity of EST toward other linear esters revealed that the enzyme showed specific activity toward methyl esters and that it recognized the configuration at C-2.",

In this randomized double-blind study we investigated renin-angiotensin system blockade obtained with 3 doses of olmesartan medoxomil (20, 40, and 80 mg every day) in 30 normal subjects and compared it with that obtained with lisinopril alone (20 mg every day) or combined with olmesartan medoxomil (20 or 40 mg). Each subject received 2 dose regimens for 1 week according to a crossover design with a 1-week washout period between doses. The primary endpoint was the degree of blockade of the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I 24 hours after the last dose after 1 week of administration. At trough, the systolic blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I was 58% +/- 19% with 20 mg lisinopril (mean +/- SD), 58% +/- 11% with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 62% +/- 16% with 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, and 76% +/- 12% with the highest dose of olmesartan medoxomil (80 mg) (P = .016 versus 20 mg lisinopril and P = .0015 versus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil). With the combinations, blockade was 80% +/- 22% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 83% +/- 9% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil (P = .3 versus 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil alone). These data demonstrate that a higher dose of the long-acting ARB olmesartan medoxomil can produce an almost complete 24-hour blockade of the blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin in normal subjects. Hence, a higher dose of a long-acting ARB is as effective as a lower dose of the same compound combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in terms of blockade of the vascular effects of angiotensin.",

It is also a powerful predictor for heart disease and all-cause mortality. In diabetic patients, microalbuminuria has been correlated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy and the development of renal insufficiency. Furthermore, its correlation with markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein suggests that microalbuminuria may indicate generalized endothelial dysfunction rather than isolated nephropathy. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to reduce albuminuria, resulting in renal protection. Recently, dualaction beta-adrenergic blockers such as carvedilol have been shown to exert favorable effects on albuminuria in diabetic patients with hypertension. Insulin resistance reflects a predictable risk for diabetes, and there appears to be a good correlation between insulin resistance, albuminuria, and progression of renal disease in diabetes with or without hypertension. As in microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dual-action beta-blockers help improve insulin sensitivity.",

Data were used from the Doetinchem Cohort Study, and blood pressure data were collected from GPs (1987-1997). A marginal generalized linear model (GEE) was used to assess the gene-drug interaction on the mean difference in systolic/diastolic blood pressure.

As the elderly population grows in coming decades, the prevalence of HF is expected to increase substantially. In addition to its human toll, HF yields a substantial economic burden, with direct and indirect cost estimates ranging from $27 to $56 billion annually. It is associated with an unacceptably high rehospitalization rate--50% within 6 months--which not only drives burgeoning costs but also provides a signal that current management approaches to HF are less than optimal. Evidence-based treatment approaches, which include the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone, and nesiritide, may offer opportunities for reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates in HF. Yet, because of inadequate discharge guidance and follow-up, many patients with HF are caught in a \"revolving door\" process that ultimately culminates in exacerbation and rehospitalization. Hospital-based disease management programs have consistently been shown to optimize care and reduce rehospitalization rates in patients with HF. The Hackensack University Medical Center HF program is discussed as an example of a successful HF program.

High glucose stimulated superoxide both extracellularly (lucigenin chemiluminescence, cytochrome c reduction) and intracellularly (dihydrorhodamine 123 fluorescence). The dihydropyridines amlodipine, nisoldipine, BayK 8644 or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat attenuated extra- and intracellular superoxide formation; nifedipine blocked extracellular increases only, ramiprilat was without antioxidant effect. Dihydropyridines and captopril also prevented NADPH-driven superoxide release. Antioxidant actions were blunted by a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist or an inhibitor of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and were accompanied by improved NO release (amperometric sensor). p38MAPK inhibition prevented the NO-sparing actions of dihydropyridines but not angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus, dihydropyridines and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors limit high glucose-induced superoxide formation and improve NO bioavailability in human endothelial cells, in part via bradykinin and p38MAPK.",

None of the immunosuppressive medications or the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a higher likelihood of anemia. In multivariate analysis the eGFR, serum albumin and serum transferrin, potential markers of nutritional status and/or chronic inflammation, and also iron deficiency were independently and significantly associated with anemia.

    "386": "The long-term clinical effects of ACE-inhibitors have similarities with those of both fibrates and glitazones, activators of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma, respectively. The antioxidant enzyme catalase, a heme protein that degrades hydrogen peroxide, is found at high concentrations in peroxisomes. Catalase activity is one of the recognized surrogate markers indicative of PPAR activation in the rat liver. The purpose of the study was to establish the effect of moexipril on catalase activity and to compare it with the effect of both saline controls and that of the known PPAR agonist clofibrate (positive control). Three groups of seven rats were used. All substances were applied i.p. daily for 5 days, followed by a 2-day break. The cycle was repeated eight times. After the final cycle (day 56) the animals were sacrificed and liver tissue collected. The number of catalase positive cells in both moexipril group (95% CI 57-61) and clofibrate group (95% CI 72-80) is higher than in controls (95% CI 3-16) (p < or = 0.01). The number of catalase positive cells in the clofibrate group is higher than in the moexipril group (p < or = 0.01). High-dose subchronic exposure to the ACE-inhibitor moexipril induces catalase activity in the rat liver to an extent comparable to fibrates. We suggest that some of the long-term advantages of ACE inhibitor use - beyond mere BP lowering - might be due to a PPAR mediated effect.", 
    "387": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that is difficult to treat. Anti-arrhythmic drug therapy, to maintain sinus-rhythm, is limited by inadequate efficacy and potentially serious adverse effects. There is increasing interest in novel therapeutic approaches that target AF-substrate development. Recent trials suggest that angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) may be useful, particularly in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or failure. The clinical potential and mechanisms of this approach are under active investigation. Angiotensin-II is involved in remodelling and may have direct electrophysiological actions. Experimental studies show protection from atrial structural and possibly electrical remodelling with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs, as well as potential effects on cardiac ion-channels. This article reviews information pertaining to the clinical use and mechanism of action of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in AF. A lack of prospective randomized double-blind trials data limits their application in AF patients without another indication for their use, but studies under way may alter this in the near future. This exciting field of investigation may lead to significant improvements in therapeutic options for AF patients.", 
    "388": "Blockade of angiotensin II (ANGII) receptors or converting enzyme inhibition attenuates reflex increases in epinephrine during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Because ANGII receptors are found in several sites within the central nervous system, the aim of this study was to examine whether acute captopril attenuates the reflex increase in adrenal preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) induced by hypoglycemia. We infused vehicle (control) or insulin (30 U/kg IV) in anesthetized rats or in rats pretreated with captopril (Cap-insulin; 2.5 mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg per hour IV) while measuring hemodynamics and SNA from adrenal preganglionic, adrenal postganglionic, and lumbar sympathetic nerves. Hypoglycemia elicited similar adrenal preganglionic SNA increases in insulin-treated (260% +/- 31% from 100% baseline) and Cap-insulin-treated (255% +/- 34%) rats. Likewise, increases in adrenal postganglionic SNA and lumbar SNA were equivalent in the insulin and Cap-insulin groups. Hypoglycemia also elicited a tachycardia in insulin-treated rats that was attenuated in Cap-insulin-treated rats, and corresponding blood pressure decreases in insulin rats were enhanced in Cap-insulin-treated rats. Thus, blockade of ANGII formation by captopril did not affect hypoglycemia-induced activation of adrenal preganglionic SNA, indicating that the renin-angiotensin systems in the brain and spinal cord do not modulate increases in adrenal SNA during hypoglycemia.", 
    "389": "Albumin microparticles have found many applications in diagnosis and treatment in recent years and more than 100 diagnostic agents and drugs have been incorporated into albumin microparticles. In the present study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) based microparticles bearing captopril were prepared by an emulsification-heat stabilization technique. Four batches of microparticles with varying ratio of drug and polymer were prepared. The prepared microparticles were studied for drug loading, particle size distribution, in vitro release characteristics, in vivo tissue distribution study and stability studies. The microparticles had mean diameter between 2 and 11 microm of which more than 70% were below 5 microm and incorporation efficiency of 41-63% was obtained. In vitro release profile for formulations containing captopril-loaded albumin microparticles with heat stabilizing technique shows slow controlled release up to 24 h. The in vivo result of drug-loaded microparticles showed preferential drug targeting to liver followed by lungs, kidneys and spleen. Stability studies showed that maximum drug content and closest in vitro release to initial data were found in the formulation stored at 4 degrees C. In the present study, captopril-loaded BSA microparticles were prepared and targeted to various organs to a satisfactory level and were found to be stable at 4 degrees C.", 
    "390": "Sodium depletion with diuretics augments the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy for hypertension and renal dysfunction, and possibly for left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Underlying mechanisms may involve altered angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor pharmacokinetics. We hypothesized that the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide causes increased steady-state levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors lisinopril and zofenopril in rats with myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to induce myocardial infarction. After 1 week, rats were randomized to 50 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide or control treatment for 3 weeks. The last week, rats received lisinopril or zofenopril in equipotentent dosages (3.3 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively). Rats were sacrificed at Tmax after the last dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, and tissues were collected for analysis of drug concentrations. Lisinopril concentrations in plasma were significantly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, at unchanged tissue concentrations. This increase could be fully explained by decreased renal function, as evidenced by increased plasma creatinine levels (lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide 82+/-5 microM versus lisinopril 61+/-5 microM, P < 0.001). In contrast, zofenoprilat levels in kidney and non-infarcted left ventricle were markedly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas plasma concentrations were unchanged. Although hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase plasma creatinine in zofenopril-treated rats as well, this increase was less pronounced (zofenopril + hydrochlorothiazide 61+/-3 microM versus zofenopril 54+/-2 microM, P = 0.15). Hydrochlorothiazide increases steady-state angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drug levels, most likely by affecting their renal clearance. Notably, the lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor zofenopril accumulated in tissue, whereas the hydrophilic lisinopril increased in plasma. Whether combining different angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors with hydrochlorothiazide translates into distinct clinical profiles requires further study.",

A copper medium containing copper sulfate, histidylleucine and sodium lactate as a carbon source was used for the isolation. One mutant showed a decreased peptide uptake ability due to PTR2 transcriptional repression, but for other mutants, the decrease was not due to the transcriptional repression. The peptide concentration in sake brewed with these mutants increased to about 1.5-fold that of sake brewed with the parental strain. The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of sake brewed with the mutant was about 3.6-fold that of sake brewed with the parental strain.",

Based on literature data and our own experience, we propose a rational treatment strategy. Patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL [> 135 micromol/L]) are at greatest risk for the development of end-stage renal disease and should receive immunosuppressive therapy. In patients with normal renal function (serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL [< 135 micromol/L]), risk for developing end-stage renal disease can be estimated by measuring urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin or alpha1-microglobulin and immunoglobulin G. For low-risk patients, a wait-and-see policy is advised. High-risk patients likely benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. Currently, combinations of steroids with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide are the best studied. We prefer cyclophosphamide in view of its fewer side effects. Cyclosporine may be an alternative option in patients with well-preserved renal function, although long-term data are lacking. Other immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab, currently are under study; however, data are insufficient to support their routine use.",

The present study has analyzed the effect of chronic administration of a newly developed compound, omapatrilat, on clinical, histological and biochemical changes due to aging. Omapatrilat combines the action of an ACEI and of an inhibitor of a neutral endopeptidase involved in the metabolism of the atrial natriuretic peptide. The final effect is a decrease of a vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory mechanism like the RAS and the potentiation of two vasodilating compounds like bradykinin and the atrial natriuretic peptide. Based on these actions, its protective effect might be greater than formerly used pharmacological agents. Determinations have been performed on young adults (6 months old), adults (12 months old) or senile (18 months old) rats. Omapatrilat (35 mg/kg/day during 6 months and 20 mg/kg/day thereafter) was administered in the drinking water since weaning until sacrifice. Cardiovascular, renal, and cerebral structure as well as cognitive behavior, cardiovascular and renal function has been analyzed. The biochemical analysis has also established whether the beneficial action of Ang II inhibition is related to an increased activity of the nitric oxide synthase as observed in previous studies. Moreover, this study has tried to determine the relationship between the protective effect of these drugs and the levels of antioxidant defenses present in the blood and/or in the tissues. Hence, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants have been evaluated.",

Using propranolol as a model compound the effect of formulation and dosing variables was explored as a means to characterize the limiting parameters of this model. In addition, verapamil and captopril were selected as reference compounds to compare this model to sublingual absorption in humans. Rabbits were dosed sublingually and systemic absorption was measured over time. Sublingual absorption of propranolol was dependent on dosing solution pH and volume. Intra-oral spray device did not affect the overall exposure compared to instillation using a syringe. Despite species and dosing regimen differences the relative bioavailabilities of propranolol and verapamil were very similar in rabbits and humans. In contrast, captopril absorption from the sublingual cavity of rabbits was low and did not agree with that observed in man.

The ACE active site model - predicted over 18 years ago using a series of potent ACE inhibitors of diverse chemical structure - was recreated using published data and commercial software. Comparison between the predicted structures of the three inhibitors bound to the active site of ACE and those determined experimentally yielded root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.43-0.81 A, among the distances defining the active site map. The bound conformations of the chemically relevant atoms were accurately deduced from the geometry of ligands, applying the assumption that the geometry of the active site groups responsible for binding and catalysis of amide hydrolysis was constrained. The mapping of bound inhibitors at the ACE active site was validated for known experimental compounds, so that the constrained conformational search methodology may be applied with confidence when no experimentally determined structure of the enzyme yet exists, but potent, diverse inhibitors are available.",

A total of 160 patients, 76 men and 84 women, aged 61-75 years, with sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP)>90 mmHg and <110 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP)>140 mmHg were randomized to receive temisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d. or lisinopril 20 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d. for 24 weeks, according to a prospective, open-label, blinded end point, parallel-group design. At the end of a 2-week wash-out period and after 12 and 24 weeks of active treatment, 24-h noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed and cognitive function was evaluated through six different tests (verbal fluency, Boston naming test, word-list memory, word-list recall, word-list recognition and Trails B). Both treatments significantly reduced ambulatory BP. However, the telmisartan/HCTZ combination produced a greater reduction in 24-h, day-time and night time ABPM values. Lisinopril/HCTZ did not induce significant changes in any of the cognitive function test scores at any time of the study, whereas at both 12 and 24 weeks telmisartan/HCTZ significantly improved the word-list memory score (+17.1 and +15.7%, respectively, P<0.05 vs baseline), the word-list recall score (+13.5 and +16.9%, P<0.05) and the Trails B score (-33 and -30.5%, P<0.05). These results suggest that in elderly hypertensive patients treatment with telmisartan/HCTZ produces a slightly greater reduction in ambulatory BP than lisinopril/HCTZ combination and, unlike this latter, improves some of the components of cognitive function, particularly episodic memory and visuospatial abilities.", 
    "419": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of hospitalization and is associated with a poor prognosis, although in the past decade substantial progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology and therapy of CHF with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor antagonists either individually or in combination, certain beta-receptor blockers, and judicious use of aldosterone antagonists, has reduced hospital admission rates and mortality from CHF with reduced LV ejection fraction. More clinical trials are needed, however, particularly in patients with CHF and preserved LV ejection fraction. In patients who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy, and who have long QRS intervals (>0.12 s) and markedly reduced LV ejection fraction, the value of cardiac resynchronization therapy with a biventricular pacemaker has now been demonstrated. Yet, morbidity and mortality remain high, indicating a major need for further improvement. Novel therapies include medical management with statins, vasopressin antagonists, erythropoietin, oxypurinol and levosimendan, which improve vascular and myocardial function and reduce fluid overload, in addition to surgical approaches, which reduce LV remodeling. These routes might not, however, suffice in patients with CHF and LV dysfunction. Prevention of apoptosis and particularly regeneration of cardiac muscle would represent a shift of the current paradigm. Stem-cell-based therapies are rapidly evolving, and while basic science is needed to optimize these strategies, medium-sized clinical studies could help to verify the beneficial effects on LV function. In this review, we discuss current treatment methods and new strategies to improve treatment of CHF.",

Both the Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings were measured by recording isometric tension after the rings were exposed to AOPP-BSA in the absence or presence of captopril to assess the injury effect of AOPP-BSA and the protective effect of captopril on the aortic endothelium, respectively. Co-incubation of aortic rings with AOPP-BSA (3 mmol/L) for 90 minutes resulted in a significant inhibition of EDR to ACh, but had no effects on endothelium-independent relaxation to SNP. After incubation of the rings in the co-presence of captopril (3 to 30 micromol/L) or enalaprilat (30 micromol/L) with AOPP-BSA (3 mmol/L) for 90 minutes, captopril significantly and enalaprilat only partly attenuated the inhibition of EDR induced by AOPP-BSA. This protective effect of captopril (30 micromol/L) was abolished by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 micromol/L), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, the superoxide anion scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD, 200 U/mL), and the nitric oxide precursor L-arginine (3 mmol/L) also ameliorated the impaired EDR caused by AOPP-BSA. But D-arginine had no effect on the impaired EDR caused by AOPP-BSA. AOPP-BSA can trigger endothelial dysfunction and captopril can protect the endothelium against functional damage induced by AOPP-BSA in rat aorta, increase nitric oxide bioavailability. The mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction induced by AOPP-BSA may include the decrease of NO and the generation of oxygen-free radicals.", 
    "421": "Heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with endothelial dysfunction. There is conflicting evidence on the exact nature of this endothelial dysfunction and how endothelium-dependent vasodilation is affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Furthermore, consequences of acute ACE-I withdrawal are largely unknown. Therefore, we studied the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) to the effects of ACE-I therapy and its withdrawal on endothelial function in MI rats. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to induce MI and were assigned to quinapril or vehicle from 2 weeks to 8 months post-MI. In parallel, MI rats treated for 14 months with quinapril were subjected to treatment withdrawal for 0, 4, and 6 weeks. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation and underlying endothelium-derived mediators were studied in isolated aortic rings. Long-term quinapril (8 months) resulted in markedly improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rats with myocardial infarction, which could be attributed to marked improvement in non-NO/prostanoid-mediated relaxation (ie, EDHF). After 14 months of follow-up, maximum vasodilation was still preserved by quinapril. Withdrawal after 14 months of treatment caused significantly impaired ACh-induced EDHF-mediated relaxation within 4 weeks. A marked reduction in EDHF-mediated relaxation caused this impairment. NO-mediated relaxation was unaffected. These findings highlight the importance of EDHF impairment in development of endothelial dysfunction after myocardial infarction and the possibility of improving EDHF-mediated vasodilation with chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. In addition, withdrawal of chronic ACE inhibition after MI should be considered carefully, as profound endothelial dysfunction may develop rapidly.", 
    "422": "The effects of the sodium-hydrogen (Na/H) exchange inhibitor cariporide (HOE642), on insulin sensitivity and vascular function were studied in the JCR:LA-cp rat and the db/db mouse. In the insulin-resistant rat, cariporide reduced fasting insulin levels (42%, P < 0.02) and insulin response in a meal tolerance test (50%, P < 0.01), indicating increased insulin sensitivity. The ACE inhibitor, ramipril, used as a reference agent, reduced the insulin response to the meal, but not fasting levels. The EC50 for acetylcholine-mediated relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings was significantly lower in cariporide-treated rats (P < 0.002), but not in ramipril-treated rats. Flow response of the coronary circulation to bradykinin was significantly greater in both cariporide- and ramipril-treated rats, (3-fold decrease in the EC50, P < 0.05). Cariporide-treated hearts were smaller, slower beating, with greater developed LVP. In the obese db/db mouse, chronic treatment with cariporide obviated vascular hypercontractility and improved endothelial function. Thus, cariporide had beneficial effects on the abnormal insulin metabolism and associated vascular dysfunction in the JCR:LA-cp insulin-resistant rat, which develops advanced cardiovascular disease and ischemic myocardial lesions. It also improved vascular function in a similar mouse model of insulin resistance. These effects were markedly greater than those of ramipril.", 
    "423": "The aims of the present work were to determine whether a brief renin-angiotensin system blockade with AT1 receptor antagonist or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may provide long-lasting protection against hypertension and proteinuria in both young and adult Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats. Young pre-hypertensive Lyon hypertensive rats were orally treated with 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d of losartan, or with 0.4 mg/kg/d of perindopril from 3 to 12 weeks of age. Adult Lyon hypertensive rats were treated with 10 mg/kg/d of losartan, 0.4 mg/kg/d of perindopril, or a combination of both from 12 to 20 weeks of age. Telemetric blood pressure (BP) and urinary protein excretion were evaluated during and after treatment cessation. In young prehypertensive Lyon hypertensive rats, losartan fully prevented the hypertension and proteinuria; these effects were dose dependent and persisted long after treatment withdrawal. When renin-angiotensin system blockade was initiated in adult Lyon hypertensive rats with established hypertension, 10 mg/kg/d of losartan or 0.4 mg/kg/d of perindopril induced a significant regression in both blood pressure (15%-20%) and proteinuria (40%-50%) as did in young Lyon hypertensive rats; the combination treatment produced an additional effect only on blood pressure. After treatment cessation, a reduction in blood pressure persisted in all the pretreated adult Lyon hypertensive rats whereas the effect on proteinuria was less marked. In conclusion, whatever the blocker used, an early renin-angiotensin system blockade in prehypertensive Lyon hypertensive rats induces a durable prevention of hypertension and associated renal alterations. The similar renin-angiotensin system blockade in adult Lyon hypertensive rats provides a regression of hypertension and proteinuria, but the persistence of these beneficial effects is less pronounced than in young Lyon hypertensive rats, thus suggesting that the treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should be initiated as early as possible before the full expression of hypertension, to achieve the maximal long-lasting effects in mature stage.", 
    "424": "In patients with coronary artery disease, the concomitant presence of renal function impairment is associated with decreased survival. We aimed to assess whether in coronary artery diseased patients renal function impairment is associated with systemic vascular function, functional parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, or inflammation as potential mediators for cardiovascular risk.", 
    "425": "We studied 125 patients, 87% male, with a mean age of 62.2+/-8.2 years; 72% had 3-vessel disease, and mean renal function was 74+/-13 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Internal thoracic artery rings were sampled during coronary bypass surgery and used for in vitro vascular measurements. We could not establish an association between endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (response to methacholine) and renal function. In addition, vascular response to potassium chloride, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II were not associated with renal function. Finally, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, usage of ACE inhibitors, C-reactive protein, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were not related to renal function.", 
    "426": "In coronary artery disease patients, mild renal function impairment is not associated with systemic vasomotor responsiveness, inflammation, or functional systemic parameters of the renin-angiotensin system. The relation between systemic endothelial dysfunction and mild renal insufficiency might be more complicated than previously thought.", 
    "427": "Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma modulation is a new pharmacological approach that, based on selective receptor-cofactor interactions and target gene regulation, should result in potent insulin sensitization in the absence of PPARgamma-mediated adverse effects. Here, we characterize two angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan and irbesartan, as new selective PPAR modulators (SPPARMs). Analysis of PPARgamma protein conformation using protease protection showed that telmisartan directly interacts with the receptor, producing a distinct conformational change compared with a glitazone. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed selective cofactor binding by the ARBs compared with glitazones with an attenuated release of the nuclear receptor corepressor and absence of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 recruitment by ARBs. Consistently, selective cofactor binding resulted in differential gene expression profiles in adipocytes (ARB versus glitazone treated) assessed by oligo microarray analysis. Finally, telmisartan improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice in the absence of weight gain. The present study identifies two ARBs as new SPPARMs. SPPARM activity by ARBs could retain the metabolic efficacy of PPARgamma activation with reduction in adverse effects exerting in parallel AT1 receptor blockade. This may provide a new therapeutic option for better cardiovascular risk management in metabolic diseases and may initiate the development of new classes of drugs combining potent antihypertensive and antidiabetic actions.",

    "432": "Approximately 10% of adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). This condition, a leading cause of renal failure, is characterized by damage to specific areas of the renal filtration system. It manifests with increased serum creatinine levels, overt proteinuria, and in some patients, end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The mortality rate for HIVAN-related ESRD is high-30% within the first year of onset. Most instances of HIVAN occur in patients of African descent. Although advances in defining the pathology have been made, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear. Potential benefits of potent combination antiretroviral therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and corticosteroids have been reported in small clinical trials and case reports. Cyclosporine is another option, but clinical experience with this agent in managing HIVAN is limited. Few conclusions can be drawn from the limited body of available evidence. Antiretroviral therapy, ACE inhibitors, and corticosteroids are possibly associated with reversal of serum creatinine level increases and proteinuria, but studies are necessary to further define the role of these agents in therapy. Close monitoring is advised when treating any patient with HIVAN.", 
    "433": "The diagnostic categories of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were stablished in an effort to identify populations at risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both IGT and IFG are associated with increased risk of developing T2DM, but recent analyses found that the thresholds of risk vary among different populations and an even lower diagnostic threshold of IFG may be appropriate. IGT has been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and some analyses have demonstrated an increased mortality risk compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance. In contrast, a continuum of increased risk of microvascular manifestations of T2DM has been demonstrated with IFG but an association of IFG with cardiovascular events has not been well established. Although both IGT and IFG are associated with resistance to insulin and increased insulin secretion, they do not identify the identical patient populations and are not equivalent in predicting development of T2DM or cardiovascular events. IFG and IGT have been associated with other features of insulin resistance, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, abdominal obesity, microalbuminuria, endothelial dysfunction, and markers of inflammation and hypercoagulability, traits collectively referred to as the metabolic syndrome. Analyses of combinations of these components have also been associated with progression to T2DM, cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. The foundation of treatment for IGT, IFG, and the metabolic syndrome is lifestyle modification, including both dietary change and routine exercise. To date, several clinical trials have found that lifestyle modification is the most efficacious strategy to prevent progression to T2DM. Alternative treatments include pharmacotherapy with metformin or acarbose, both of which have been demonstrated to decrease the development of T2DM. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating newer pharmacotherapies, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, metglitinides and thiazolidinediones, to prevent both T2DM and cardiovascular events. In combination with lifestyle modification, these therapies offer hope for effective prevention of T2DM and its consequences in high-risk patients.", 
    "434": "Patients with diabetes mellitus who present with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes have a higher risk of adverse outcomes than patients without diabetes, and appear to derive greater benefit from evidence-based therapies. However, patients with diabetes mellitus are less commonly treated with proven therapies, so renewed efforts are needed to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with diabetes mellitus who present with acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "435": "Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia. To terminate or prevent atrial fibrillation, conventional \"channel-blocking antiarrhythmics\" are generally administered, which directly inhibit current flows through transmembrane sodium, calcium and/or potassium channels that give rise to the atrial action potential. However, prospective, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that cardiomyocyte ion channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have limited long-term-efficacy for preventing recurrences of atrial fibrillation, their safety is far from ideal (because of the high incidence of proarrhythmic and extracardiac side-effects), and do not reduce mortality. Researchers during the last 10 years have revealed that the pathogenetic basis of the recurrence, persistence or permanence of atrial fibrillation is electrical and structural remodelling established by profound alterations in the electrophysiological, contractile and (ultra)structural properties of the myocardium (atrial remodelling). Accordingly, recent interest has shifted from ion channel blockers to the development of drugs that target underlying arrhythmogenic substrates by interference with receptors and specific signal transduction pathways involved in electrical and structural remodelling (non-channel drugs). They include antifibrotic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II AT1 receptor and aldosterone antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, anti-inflammatory statins and glucocorticoids, and a series of new atrioselective antifibrillatory agents that are currently undergoing clinical trials.", 
    "436": "The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of health care maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD. RCTs impacting current practices address use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria, but most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data. While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.",

The incidence rate was similar in boys and girls (53 vs 60%) and in those on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (56 vs 54%). Chronic glomerulonephritis as an underlying renal disease was significantly more frequent in the hypertensive than in the normotensive subjects (37 vs 10%, P = 0.004).

    "459": "Recent studies indicate the presence of vascular alterations in 2-month-old Syrian cardiomyopathic hamsters (SCH). These alterations include enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the aorta, increased contractile response to angiotensin II and impaired vasorelaxation to acetylcholine in norepinephrine-precontracted aortic rings. The mechanisms leading to these vascular alterations are not known nor has their relationship to the cardiac abnormalities been established. We assessed the status of the cardiovascular system of 2-month-old hamsters first to establish if the observed vascular alterations are secondary to cardiac dysfunction, and second to examine the role of oxidative stress in the etiology of vascular dysfunction. Cardiac function parameters evaluated by echocardiography included stroke volume (SV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output index (COI), heart rate (HR) and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT). In addition, heart/body weight (heart/BW) ratios and systolic blood pressure were determined in normal hamsters and SCH. Our results indicated that systolic blood pressure increased 56% in SCH when compared to control animals (P<0.05). The increased blood pressure coexisted with normal COI, SV, LVEDV, LVPWT, LVFS, EF, HR and heart/BW ratios. NAD(P)H oxidase activity increased 77% in SCH compared to control animals (P<0.02). The increased oxidase activity was abolished by pre-treatment of animals with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan (25 mg/kg BW/day) for 10 days. Losartan also abolished the increased blood pressure observed at 2 months of age. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abrogated the increased blood pressure when administered for 30 days to 1-month-old animals. Altogether, these findings suggest that the angiotensin II-dependent vascular abnormalities present in young cardiomyopathic hamsters are associated with oxidative stress and precede the echocardiographic abnormalities characteristic of heart failure.", 
    "460": "Recent findings from our laboratory suggest that intracellular peptides containing putative post-translational modification sites (i.e., phosphorylation) could regulate specific protein interactions. Here, we extend our previous observations showing that peptide phosphorylation changes the kinetic parameters of structurally related endopeptidase EP24.15 (EC 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Phosphorylation of peptides that are degraded by these enzymes leads to reduced degradation, whereas phosphorylation of peptides that interacted as competitive inhibitors of these enzymes alters only the K(i)'s. These data suggest that substrate phosphorylation could be one of the mechanisms whereby some intracellular peptides would escape degradation and could be regulating protein interactions within cells.",

Side effects, such as cough, dizziness, nausea, and headache, are frequently cited as reasons for lack of adherence and persistence with hypertension therapy. Use of newer classes of antihypertensive agents with better tolerability than older agents may be one way to improve adherence and persistence. Recent studies have shown higher rates of adherence and persistence with therapy in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or newer calcium channel blockers compared with other antihypertensive agents. Health insurance coverage can also affect patient adherence and persistence.", 
    "462": "Side effects associated with some antihypertensive agents can adversely affect patient adherence to a treatment regimen. Controlled clinical trials involving >11,000 patients have consistently shown that the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are generally well tolerated. Adverse effects, such as headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea, have been described as mild to moderate. The frequency of cough is significantly lower in patients treated with ARBs than in those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Angioedema, a less common but more serious side effect, also appears to be seen less frequent with ARBs than with ACEIs, although cross-reactivity is possible. Quality of life (QOL) is another important factor affecting treatment adherence. Recent studies have shown improvements in QOL measures in patients switched from other classes of antihypertensive agents to ARBs.", 
    "463": "Angiotensin II, the principal effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), has potent vasoconstrictive and other effects that can lead to cardiac and renal complications. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which block the effects of angiotensin II at the receptor level, antagonize angiotensin II's vasoconstrictive and prooxidant effects, decrease aldosterone secretion, and mitigate sympathetic activity. The antihypertensive efficacy of the ARBs has been demonstrated in large clinical trials. In addition to their blood pressure-lowering effect, these agents also provide cardiovascular (CV) protection and reduce CV mortality as effectively as other classes of antihypertensive agents. By inhibiting the RAAS, the ARBs also have renoprotective effects and are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes. They have also been shown to lower the incidence of new-onset diabetes in high-risk hypertensive patients. Combining ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs increases their antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "464": "Asymmetric human internal organ organization has been a research topic for many years. Currently, although we know many mechanisms leading to the creation of specific internal organ organization, the problem requires further investigation. Transforming Growth Factor-beta superfamily (TGF-beta SF) molecules seem to play a major role in the process. They affect the cell by signaling through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Smad proteins seem vital in transmitting the signal between the receptor and the nucleus. We present the case of an 18-year-old female patient, who was admitted to the hospital because of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Physical examination revealed that the patient also had a complete reversal of the intra-abdominal anatomy - situs inversus totalis. We suggest that disturbed TGF-beta and Smad signaling could be responsible for both nephrotic syndrome and situs inversus totalis.",

For instance serum creatine kinase levels are often dismissed as a means of gaining an understanding of what is happening or a means of monitoring a patient. This paper shall show how serum creatine kinase levels may be used to explore the processes taking place that create muscle inflammation. This is achieved by a detailed longitudinal study. Firstly, considerable laboratory data is gathered such as serum creatine kinase levels and blood pressure information. Secondly, the data is quantified using a scientific model. We shall illustrate the approach through an extensive nine-year study of a particular polymyositis patient. We identify three basic processes that may contribute to muscle inflammation and show how they may be interpreted from specific patient data. Furthermore, details are given for controlling and monitoring the disease to maximise the reduction in the muscle attack while reducing significantly the muscle inflammation and keeping the drug concentration at a minimum to ensure minimum side-effects and how to identify and handle drug-drug, drug-natural product and adverse drug interactions. Examples are given for a natural product, azathioprine and trandolapril.", 
    "470": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem in the United States. It is estimated that nearly 20 million Americans have some degree of chronic kidney disease defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than sixty milliliters per minute or evidence of kidney damage by imaging study, biopsy, biochemical testing or urine tests with an estimated glomerular filtration rate more than sixty milliliters per minute. Hypertension is present in more than 80% of patients with CKD and contributes to progression of kidney disease toward end stage (ESRD) as well as to cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. In fact the risk for cardiovascular death in this patient population is greater than the risk for progression to ESRD. Proteinuria is an important co-morbidity in hypertensives with CKD and increase risk of disease progression and cardiovascular events. Treatment of hypertension is therefore imperative. The National Kidney Foundation clinical practice guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of <130 mmHg systolic and <80 mmHg diastolic for all CKD patients. Recent post-hoc analyses of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study indicate that lower blood pressure may provide long-term kidney protection in patients with nondiabetic kidney disease. Specifically a mean arterial pressure <92 mmHg (e.g. 120/80 mmHg) as compared to 102-107 mmHg (e.g. 140/90 mmHg) is associated with reduced risk for ESRD. In most cases achieving this goal requires both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic intervention. Dietary sodium restriction to no more than 2 grams daily is important. In addition, moderate alcohol intake, regular exercise, weight loss in those with a body mass index greater than 25 kg/M(2) and reduced amount of saturated fat help to reduce blood pressure. The first line pharmacologic intervention should be an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker in those with diabetes or non-diabetics with more than 200 mg protein/gram creatinine on a random urine sample. For non-diabetics with less than 200 mg protein/gram creatinine on a random urine sample, no specific first-line drug class is recommended. After initial dosing with an ACEi, ARB or other drug, a diuretic should be added to the regimen. Thereafter, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, apha blockers and alpha 2 agonists (e.g. clonidine) and finally vasodilators (e.g. minoxidil) should be added to achieve blood pressure goal. Combinations of ACEi and ARB are helpful in reducing proteinuria and may also lower blood pressure further in some some cases. Blood pressure should be monitored closely in hypertensive patients with CKD and both clinic and home blood pressure measurements may help the clinician adjust treatment.", 
    "471": "Cardiac artery disease and heart failure are major causes for morbidity and mortality in diabetes in general and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in particular. Hypertension and dyslipidemia are more common in diabetes and the prevalence of coronary artery disease in diabetics is two-fold to four-fold higher than in nondiabetics. In those with CKD the incidence of cardiovascular complications is nearly two-fold higher than those without CKD. Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiology of cardiac disease is complex process involving both microvascular and macrovascular disease. In addition, myocardial lipotoxicity may be a novel contributing factor particularly in type 2 diabetics. Compelling evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials indicates that treatment with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system are cardioprotective in diabetics with microalbuminuria and early stages of kidney disease. Multiple risk factor intervention aimed at optimal blood pressure control (BP <130/<80 mmHG), lowering LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl, lowering triglyceride level to 150 mg/dl, A1C <6.5%, treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, administration of once daily low-dose aspirin and smoking cessation together reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetics. Novel studies including diabetics with nephropathy aimed at improving outcomes in diabetics by treatment of anemia and optimal control of dyslipidemia are now underway. These and other clinical trials should provide important new insights into improving the quality of life in diabetics and ultimately preventing cardiac disease.", 
    "472": "Rat uterus maintained in situ was used as a bioassay of kinins possibly released in vivo by hyperglycaemia or insulin. Intravenous injections of bradykinin induced contractions of rat uterus which were suppressed by HOE 140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. Des-Arg9-bradykinin, a kinin B1 receptor agonist, did not elicit any response. After propranolol, the effects of bradykinin were enhanced and dose-dependent. This potentiation did not appear in adrenalectomized rats. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, largely increased the effects of bradykinin. In animals pretreated with propranolol, captopril and atosiban, an oxytocin antagonist, intravenous infusion of glucose induced hyperglycaemia and after a delay increased the uterine contractile activity. This contractile effect of glucose was abolished by HOE 140. Infusion of insulin with glucose induced contractions of the uterus. These responses did not appear or were suppressed by HOE 140 or by soya bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), a plasma kallikrein inhibitor. These results are direct evidence that insulin induces a release of kinins.",

In this review, we describe novel strategies in the treatment of SSc. Utilizing the MEDLINE and the COCHRANE REGISTRY, we identified open trials, controlled trials, for treatment of SSc from 1999 to April 2005. We used the terms scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, methotrexate, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, relaxin, low-dose penicillamine, IVIg, calcium channel blockers, losartan, prazocin, iloprost, N-acetylcysteine, bosentan, cyclophosphamide, lung transplantation, ACE inhibitors, anti-thymocyte globulin, and stem cell transplantation. Anecdotal reports were omitted. Methotrexate, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, relaxin, low-dose penicillamine, and IVIg may be beneficial in improving the skin tightness in SSc. Calcium channel blockers, the angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist losartan, prazocin, the prostacyclin analogue iloprost, N-acetylcysteine and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. Epoprostenol and bosentan are approved for therapy of pulmonary hypertension (PAH). Other options under investigation include intravenous or aerolized iloprost. Cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse therapy is effective in suppressing active alveolitis. Stem cell and lung transplantation is a viable option for carefully selected patients. Renal crisis can be effectively managed when hypertension is aggressively controlled with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients should continue taking ACE inhibitors even after beginning dialysis in hope of discontinuing dialysis. Antithymocyte globulin and mycophenolate mofetil appear safe in SSc. The improvement in skin score and the apparent stability of systemic disease during the treatment period suggest that controlled studies of these agents are justified. Stem cell transplantation is under investigation for severe disease. Novel therapies are currently being tested in the treatment of SSc and have the potential of modifying the disease process and overall clinical outcome. The evaluation of these studies is still a difficult process.",

Recent data suggest that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy; in contrast, the results on the renoprotective effect of calcium channel antagonists are conflicting. We evaluated the effectiveness of lercanidipine, in comparison with ramipril, on the reduction in albumin excretion rate (AER) and blood pressure in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria. A total of 277 patients were enrolled in a multicentric, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial; 180 were randomized to receive 10-20 mg/day of lercanidipine or 5-10 mg/day of ramipril and followed up for 9-12 months. The primary outcome was the change in AER from baseline. After 9-12 months of follow-up, a reduction in AER of -17.4+/-65 microg/min (p<0.05) and -19.7+/-52.5 (p<0.05) in the lercanidipine and ramipril group, respectively, was observed, without differences between the groups. A significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in both the lercanidipine and ramipril-based treatment groups (p<0.0001 for both). This study demonstrated that treatment with lercanidipine 10-20 mg/day does not worsen albuminuria in microalbuminuric Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. Indeed, both lercanidipine and ramipril treatments resulted in a significant reduction in AER without a statistically significant difference between the two groups.",

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of different stages of kidney dysfunction (defined using the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [K/DOQI] classification system) and changes in kidney function on mortality in a cohort of patients with heart failure. A retrospective analysis was conducted of data from the randomized controlled trials Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction. A total of 6640 participants with asymptomatic and symptomatic heart failure were studied. Estimated GFR (eGFR) were calculated and then categorized according to the K/DOQI classification system into the following categories: > or =90, 60 to 89, 30 to 59, and 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Reduction in eGFR from baseline was calculated and subsequently categorized according to rate of decline (<5, 5 to 10, 11 to 15, and >15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year). Independent of baseline differences, lower levels of eGFR were associated with a higher total mortality compared with those with eGFR > or =90 ml/min (30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2: hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.59, P = 0.004; 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2: HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.19, P < 0.001). eGFR deteriorated rapidly (>15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year) in 12% of participants. This decline was associated with a significant increase in mortality compared with slower decline (<5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year), despite adjustments for baseline kidney function, baseline heart failure, or change in heart failure (HR 5.63; 95% CI 4.90 to 6.46; P < 0.0001). The levels of eGFR from the K/DOQI classification system are associated with mortality in a well-characterized heart failure population. Rate of decline in kidney function is a strong predictor of increased mortality in this population, independent of worsening heart failure and baseline kidney function.",

We investigated the relationship between the efficacy of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes. Patients with type 2 diabetes without proteinuria, were treated with RAS inhibitors, the first being an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and the second, an angiotensin II (ATII) receptor blocker (ARB) for 8 weeks each. There was no significant difference (except serum ACE activity) between the two treatments. However, by analysis segregated with ACE gene polymorphism, ARB significantly decreased transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) compared to ACEI in patients with the I/I genotype but not in patients with the D/I+D/D genotype. DeltaATII and DeltaTGF-beta have a negative correlation with the I/I genotype and a positive correlation with the D/I+D/D genotypes. These correlation coefficients are significantly different. We suggest that in I/I patients, TGF-beta was reduced by ARB via effects on (ATII) type 2 receptors (AT2). In our experiments, the effect of ARB on TGF-beta reduction was only detected by segregation of ACE genotypes. This indicates that the selection of medicine in light of a patient's genotype is important in treating diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "497": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity through its effects on target organs like the brain, heart, and kidney. Structural alterations in the microcirculation form a major link between hypertension and target organ damage. In this review, we describe damages related to hypertension in these target organs and the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension-induced cardiovascular diseases such as dementia, cardiac ischemia and remodeling, or nephropathy. We also focus on the therapeutical potential on the basis of such mechanisms. Several antihypertensive agents like diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been shown to reduce effectively hypertension associated cardiovascular events and to improve end organ damage. More recently, aldosterone antagonism has also shown beneficial effects. Part of the favorable effects of these agents is due to blood pressure lowering as such. Other mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, or endothelial dysfunction have appeared to play a key role in the pathogenesis of target organ damage and therefore represent another important pathway for therapy. In this review, we discuss the different therapeutic approaches aiming at reducing cardiovascular events and damages induced by hypertension.",

Such changes in microalbuminuria have not been observed when beta-blockers are used. A prespecified secondary end point of the Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trial was to examine the effects of different beta-blockers on changes in albuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomized to either metoprolol tartrate (n=737) or carvedilol (n=498) in blinded fashion after a washout period of all antihypertensive agents except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Blinded medication was titrated to achieve target blood pressure, with a-5 month follow-up period. The current analysis examined microalbuminuria, using spot urine albumin:creatinine, in participants who had values at screening and trial end. A greater reduction in microalbuminuria was observed for those randomized to carvedilol (-16.2%Delta; 95% confidence interval, -25.3, -5.9; P=0.003). Of those with normoalbuminuria at baseline, fewer progressed to microalbuminuria on carvedilol versus metoprolol (20 of 302 [6.6%] versus 48 of 431 [11.1%], respectively; P=0.03). Microalbuminuria development was not related to differences in blood pressure or achievement of blood pressure goal (68% carvedilol versus 67%, metoprolol). Presence of metabolic syndrome at baseline was the only independent predictor of worsening albuminuria throughout the study (P=0.004). Beta-blockers have differential effects on microalbuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. These differences cannot be explained by effects on blood pressure or alpha1-antagonism but may relate to antioxidant properties of carvedilol.", 
    "499": "Obesity is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for renal disease, but the mechanism is unclear. Renal plasma flow response to captopril, as an index of renin-angiotensin system activity, was measured by para-aminohippurate clearance technique in 100 healthy, normotensive subjects in balance on a high-salt diet. Of the 100 subjects, body mass index exceeded 25 in 56 and exceeded 30 in 22. The average vasodilator response to captopril was 27+/-7 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (P<0.0001). After adjustment for other predictors of the renal plasma flow response to captopril using a multivariate linear regression model, there was a highly significant relationship between age- and plasma renin activity-adjusted body mass index and the renal plasma flow response to captopril; however, a quadratic model provided a substantially better fit (r=0.55; P<0.0001; P=0.03 versus linear correlation). The strong association between increasing body mass index and angiotensin-dependent control of the renal circulation suggests that this may be a mechanism by which obesity contributes to renal disease. Weight loss should be considered in the overweight or obese patient for renal protection.", 
    "500": "Despite increased pulsatile stress, thrombotic rather than hemorrhagic events represent a major complication of hypertension. The pathophysiology of thrombosis in hypertension involves the interaction among vascular endothelium and particularly the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems. Because hypertension is often associated with some degree of inflammation, the combination of chronic inflammation and chronic shear stress may convert the normal anticoagulant endothelium into a procoagulant surface, expressing tissue factor. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system leads to activation of nuclear factor kappaB-dependent proinflammatory genes, also accelerating the expression of tissue factor. Renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems interact at several levels to modulate coagulation, fibrinolysis, and vasodilatation in such a way that these 2 systems could have a major influence on the occurrence of thrombotic complications. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists may favorably influence the balance between the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin axis, regulating blood pressure as well as reducing the risk of thrombosis, which may explain part of the clinical efficacy of these drugs.", 
    "501": "Pure allicin, prepared biosynthetically by reacting synthetic alliin with an immobilized alliinase enzyme, is known to possess cardioprotective effects. However, in its pure form, allicin is pharmacologically unstable. S-allylmercaptocaptopril (CPSSA) is a new stable synthetic compound produced by chemical reaction between allicin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Using the fructose-induced metabolic syndrome rat model we studied the effects of short-term treatment with two doses of CPSSA on cardiovascular risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, in comparison to the effects of allicin and captopril separately. Allicin (8 mg/(kg day)) significantly reduced insulin, triglycerides, and homocysteine concentrations, and had a slight effect on SBP. Captopril (50mg/(kg day)) only improved blood pressure and homocysteine. Treatment with low dose of CPSSA (5mg/(kg day)) lowered SBP but did not improve any other measured parameter, while treatment with a higher dose (50mg/(kg day)) significantly decreased blood pressure, triglycerides, and homocysteine concentrations. We conclude that the combined molecule CPSSA integrates the anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering, and homocysteine-reducing effects of both allicin and captopril, making it a potential cardiovascular protective agent.",

    "507": "(1) Some angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (captopril, enalapril, ramipril and trandolapril), and in patients with recent myocardial infarction and heart failure or marked left ventricular dysfunction (captopril, ramipril and trandolapril). (2) Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, otherwise known as angiotensin receptor blockers, have haemodynamic effects similar to ACE inhibitors, but differ in their mechanism of action and certain adverse effects. (3) Five clinical trials have evaluated angiotensin II receptor antagonists (candesartan, losartan and valsartan) in terms of their effect on mortality and on the risk of clinical deterioration in patients with symptomatic heart failure, but without severe renal failure, hyperkalemia or hypotension. In these trials, candesartan and valsartan were used at much higher doses than those recommended for the treatment of arterial hypertension. (4) In patients with heart failure who were not taking an angiotensin II receptor antagonist or an ACE inhibitor at enrollment, no significant difference was found between losartan and captopril in terms of mortality or the risk of clinical deterioration. (5) In patients with heart failure who had stopped taking an ACE inhibitor because of adverse effects, candesartan had no effect on mortality as compared with placebo, but it did reduce the risk of clinical deterioration (3 fewer hospitalisations per year per 100 patients). However, candesartan was associated with adverse effects such as renal failure and hyperkalemia, especially in patients who had experienced these same adverse effects while taking an ACE inhibitor. (6) In patients with heart failure who were already taking an ACE inhibitor, adjunctive candesartan or valsartan treatment did not influence mortality in comparison to the addition of a placebo. Adding candesartan or valsartan reduced the risk of hospitalisation (between 1 and 3 fewer hospitalisations per year per 100 patients), but increased the risk of renal failure and hyperkalemia. (7) In patients with heart failure and incapacitating dyspnea despite ACE inhibitor + diuretic combination therapy, there are no trials comparing the addition of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist versus spironolactone. Adjunctive spironolactone therapy prevents 5 to 6 deaths per year per 100 patients in this setting. (8) In patients with heart failure who do not have markedly altered cardiac contractility, candesartan appears to have no clinical advantages over placebo. (9) In some of these trials, mortality was higher with angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy than with placebo among patients who were already taking a betablocker. (10) Two trials have compared an angiotensin II receptor antagonist with an ACE inhibitor in patients with recent myocardial infarction who had heart failure or an altered left ventricular ejection fraction, but who did not have hypotension or severe renal failure. However, there are no placebo-controlled randomised trials assessing the effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists on mortality. (11) In patients with recent myocardial infarction, these trials showed no difference in mortality between angiotensin II receptor antagonist treatment (losartan or valsartan) and captopril. They did not rule out the possibility that these angiotensin II receptor antagonists are moderately less effective than captopril. Adding valsartan to ongoing captopril therapy did not reduce mortality or morbidity as compared with placebo, but did increase the risk of adverse effects. (12) Overall, these trials confirm the advantage of angiotensin II receptor antagonists over ACE inhibitors with respect to some adverse effects (cough, skin rash, etc.). However, the two drug classes share certain serious adverse effects such as hyperkalemia, renal failure and hypotension. In one trial, angioedema was less frequent with angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy (one less case per 500 patients).", 
    "508": "Alcohol abuse increases the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and causes oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction in the lung. The mechanisms of ethanol (EtOH)-induced oxidative stress in the lung remain to be defined. Chronic alcohol ingestion has been associated with increased renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity. Therefore, the current study investigated the ability of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, to modulate oxidative stress in the lung after chronic EtOH ingestion in a well-established rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets containing EtOH (36% of calories) or maltose-dextrin as an isocaloric substitution for EtOH (Control) for 6 wk. Selected animals were also treated with lisinopril (3 mg/liter) for 6 wk. Chronic EtOH ingestion increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid glutathione disulfide levels and superoxide formation in lung parenchyma. These effects of EtOH were attenuated by lisinopril treatment. Chronic EtOH ingestion failed to increase ACE expression or angiotensin II levels in lung homogenates, but increased angiotensinogen, angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptor levels, and ACE activity. Chronic EtOH ingestion also increased the levels of the NADPH oxidase subunit, gp91phox, an effect that was attenuated by lisinopril, but had no effect on lung p22phox or p47phox levels. These findings suggest that EtOH-mediated RAS activation plays an important role in pulmonary oxidative stress and provide new insights into mechanisms by which EtOH causes oxidative stress in the lung and potential strategies of lung protection through ACE inhibition.", 
    "509": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and structural abnormalities of the right ventricle (RV). The most important aspect in the treatment of ARVD/C is establishing a correct diagnosis based on the International Task Force criteria. In our experience, cardiologists are not aware of these diagnostic criteria for ARVD/C and place too much importance on the results of magnetic resonance imaging of the RV. Patients with ARVD/C generally all have an abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram, abnormal echocardiogram, and ventricular arrhythmias with a left bundle branch block morphology. If noninvasive testing suggests ARVD, invasive testing with an RV angiogram, RV biopsy, and electrophysiology study are recommended. We encourage patients to participate in the National Institutes of Health-sponsored multicenter clinical trial of ARVD/C (http://www.ARVD.comorhttp://www.ARVD.org). Once a diagnosis of ARVD/C is established, the main treatment decision involves whether to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). ICDs are recommended for patients who have experienced syncope, sudden death, or a sustained ventricular arrhythmia, and also for patients with overt evidence of ARVD, particularly if the electrophysiology study is abnormal or there is a family history of sudden death. We also recommend treatment of patients with ARVD/C with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and that all patients with ARVD/C be screened for a mutation in the gene for plakophilin-2, because this is present in more than one third of patients with ARVD/C and may be helpful in the management of first-degree relatives.", 
    "510": "Amyloidosis is a systemic disease in which clinical manifestations are caused by the replacement of normal tissue with insoluble amyloid fibrils. Cardiac involvement causes a restrictive cardiomyopathy and is associated with poor functional outcomes. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide are particularly helpful in distinguishing restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis, but a tissue biopsy is required to make the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Although standard treatment options for congestive heart failure may provide symptomatic relief in cardiac amyloidosis, prognosis remains dismal. Judicious diuretic use remains the mainstay of therapy, but achieving optimal fluid balance is difficult because patients are usually \"preload dependent.\" Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in low doses are often helpful but may lead to orthostatic hypotension, particularly in patients who also have involvement of the autonomic nervous system. beta Blockers may be useful if given relatively early in the disease process, but should be used with caution in patients with advanced disease because they may exacerbate symptoms. Therapy aimed at the underlying disease process in primary systemic amyloidosis is based on treatment regimens used in multiple myeloma, such as melphalan and prednisone. These offer limited benefit when cardiac involvement is significant, but newer treatments, including the novel anthracycline 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin, potentially combined with autologous stem cell transplantation, offer some hope for the future.", 
    "511": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used to treat patients with cardiovascular and kidney diseases, but inhibition of ACE alone does not fully explain the beneficial effects. We reported that ACE inhibitors directly activate bradykinin B1 receptor at the canonical Zn2+ binding site, leading to prolonged nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon, a novel PKC isoform, is up-regulated in myocardium after infarction, suggesting a role in the development of cardiac dysfunction. In cytokine-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells, B1 receptor activation by ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, quinaprilat) or peptide ligands (des-Arg10-Lys1-bradykinin, des-Arg9-bradykinin) inhibited PKC epsilon with an IC50 = 7 x 10(-9) M. Despite the reported differences in binding affinity to receptor, the two peptide ligands were equally active, even when inhibitor blocked the cleavage of Lys(1), thus the conversion by aminopeptidase. The synthetic undecapeptide (LLPHEAWHFAR) representing the binding site for ACE inhibitors on human B(1) receptors reduced PKC epsilon inhibition by enalaprilat but not by peptide agonist. A combination of inducible and endothelial NO synthase inhibitors, 1400W [N-(3(aminomethyl) benzyl) acetamidine dihydrochloride] and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (2 microM), significantly reduced inhibition by enalaprilat (100 nM), whereas the NO donor (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (100 microM) inhibited PKC epsilon activity just as the B1 ligands did. In conclusion, NO generated by B1 receptor activation inhibits PKC epsilon.", 
    "512": "We investigated the role of oestrogen in the function and structure of the microcirculation of female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and evaluated the effect of 17beta-oestradiol on their cardiovascular response to pharmacological agents that block the formation of angiotensin II. Ten-week-old SHRs were randomly assigned to the following groups: intact, ovariectomized, and ovariectomized treated with 17beta-oestradiol (1.5 mg delivered over 60 days) and/or captopril (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 8 weeks). Systolic blood pressure was determined from the time of ovariectomy up to 18 weeks of age, at which time endothelial function and microvascular density in skeletal muscle were evaluated. Both 17beta-oestradiol and captopril prevented development of hypertension in ovariectomized rats. Furthermore, coadministration of both drugs had a greater antihypertensive effect than either one alone. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation was impaired in ovariectomized SHRs, and the response was improved by treatment with 17beta-oestradiol and/or captopril. In addition, 17beta-oestradiol replacement in ovariectomized rats enhanced the effect of captopril on acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation. Ovariectomized rats also showed lower microvascular density than intact rats, an effect that was prevented by 17beta-oestradiol replacement or captopril treatment and, to a significantly larger extent, by coadministration of both. We concluded that both 17beta-oestradiol and captopril attenuated the development of hypertension and improved the impairment in microvascular density of ovariectomized SHRs. Moreover, when simultaneously administered, oestradiol and captopril had an additive effect on blood pressure and the microvasculature.", 
    "513": "Anaemia is a frequent complication of diabetic nephropathy. It has only recently been recognised that in diabetic patients anaemia is seen not only in preterminal renal failure, but also frequently in patients with only minor derangement of renal function. At any level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) anaemia is more frequent and severe in diabetic compared to nondiabetic patients. A major cause of anaemia is an inappropriate response of erythropoietin to anaemia. Additional factors are iron deficiency and iatrogenic factors, e.g. ACE inhibitor treatment. When serum creatinine is still normal, the erythropoietin concentration is predictive of more rapid loss of glomerular function. When serum creatinine is elevated, the haemoglobin values are predictive of the rate of progression. It is currently under investigation whether reversal of anaemia attenuates the rate of progression. Because most of the late complications of diabetes (retinopathy, neuropathy, heart disease, peripheral arterial disease) involve ischaemic tissue damage, it would be intuitively plausible that treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin should be beneficial, but definite evidence for this hypothesis is currently not available.",

The assay shows the high selectivity and sensitivity necessary to monitor small changes in the levels of the ACEI peptides after consumption of drinks developed to effect lowering of the blood pressure. Four different sample preparation methods were tested and evaluated. The final sample preparation method selected is simple and effective and consists mainly of the removal of proteins by acidification and heating, followed by a large volume injection. Additional sample preparation steps such as solid phase extraction and liquid/liquid partitioning were studied. Although they resulted in cleaner extracts, losses of specific peptides such as SAP were frequently seen. The isotope labeled form of one of the peptides to be quantified, [U(13)C]IPP, was used as an internal standard. The limit of detection of the assay is below 0.01 ng ml(-1). The limit of quantification is between 0.05 and 0.2 ng ml(-1), which is approximately 10% of the expected peptide concentration in plasma based on a normal diet. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all peptides have shown to be below 25% and the method has an accuracy of better than 75%. The long-term stability is good. At least 200 samples could be analysed before the system had to be cleaned. The assay has been successfully applied to blood samples collected from volunteers during a human trial.",

Increasing doses of atenolol and sustained-release verapamil were associated with decreasing risk of the composite primary outcome (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). Combination therapy with two drugs (verapamil/trandolapril or atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) reduced the risk of primary outcome compared with monotherapy (verapamil or atenolol), and triple therapy (verapamil/trandolapril/hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide/trandolapril) further reduced the risk.",

In the Systolic Evaluation of Lotrel Efficacy and Comparative Therapies (SELECT) study, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to identify patients with systolic hypertension and to determine the impact of 8 weeks of treatment with either amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl 5/20 mg combination therapy (n=149), amlodipine besylate 5 mg (n=146), or benazepril HCl 20 mg (n=148). Combination therapy was significantly more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure than either monotherapy (p<0.0001). Significantly greater percentages of patients in the combination group compared with either monotherapy achieved blood pressure control (p<0.0001). Adverse events were low in all three treatment arms, with less peripheral edema in the combination group than in the amlodipine-treated group. The combination of amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl given to patients with stage 2 systolic hypertension resulted in significantly greater reductions in blood pressure and pulse pressure than those seen with monotherapy and was at least as well tolerated as the separate components. This data supports the recommendation of the JNC 7 for the use of combination therapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension.",

These peptides, and also HEW and HEW<3000 Da, had been characterized previously in vitro as potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). EW and the products mentioned earlier were orally administered by gastric intubation, to 17-20-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We measured the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. Distilled water served as negative control, and we used captopril (50 mg/kg) as positive control to carry out similar experiments with a known ACE inhibitor. HEW, HEW<3000 Da and the three peptide sequences decreased SBP and DBP in SHR but they did not modify these variables in WKY rats. The peptide sequences YAEERYPIL, RADHPFL and IVF showed a potency to decrease blood pressure greater than HEW or HEW<3000 Da.

She denied shortness of breath, tightening of the throat, swelling of the tongue, generalized cutaneous eruption, urticaria, or pruritus. She also denied symptoms consistent with facial paresis. Her past medical history was significant for hepatitis C infection, coronary artery disease, and hypertriglyceridemia. She had a 15 pack-year smoking history and denied both alcohol and drug abuse. She had never received a blood transfusion and was HIV negative. Physical examination disclosed a tender, swollen, and erythematous lower lip with induration, oozing, and crusting (Figure 1). Pinpoint openings evident throughout the lip surface exuded a clear, sticky, mucoid secretion. Tongue, parotid glands, and regional lymph nodes were normal. The working diagnosis was angioedema secondary to lisinopril. The presumptive offending drug was discontinued, and conservative therapy (topical clobetasol ointment, oral ranitidine, and oral fexofenadine) was initiated. Despite treatment, signs and symptoms persisted unabated. One week after initial presentation, a punch biopsy of her lower lip was taken to rule out granulomatous cheilitis and sarcoidosis. Histopathology included diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, minimal microabscess formation, and notable absence of granulomata. There was neither hypertrophy nor detectable abnormality of the salivary glands, with the exception of infiltrating mononuclear cells. Based on the clinical history and compatible pathologic findings, a diagnosis of cheilitis glandularis was made. Specifically, crusting and erosion clinically suggested a diagnosis of the superficial suppurative subtype of cheilitis glandularis. The patient received oral penicillin (dicloxacillin, 1.0 g/d) combined with oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 1.0 g/d). Within 2 weeks of starting the antibiotics, the lip swelling significantly decreased (Figure 2) and the patient was left with a mildly indurated nodule at the labial commissure.

Paradoxically, although advances in coronary angioplasty and effective drugs have increased survival post infarction, the myocardial damage and subsequent neurohormonal activation-induced remodeling causes significant morbidity years later in the form of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) together with beta blockers modify the neurohormonal activation associated with heart failure and are key treatments for improving cardiac function and survival. Anemia is a significant risk factor predicting morbidity and mortality in heart failure. This article describes the various etiologies of anemia in heart failure. Of particular importance is the fact that recent stem cell studies have shown that the drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system inhibit erythropoiesis in vivo and may cause anemia in patients with both normal renal function and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The role of angiotensin-II as an erythropoietic growth factor and ACE in facilitating erythropoiesis is described in this article. Anemia has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor and its treatment correlates with improvement in clinical outcomes. Thus, anemia, its etiology (especially the contribution of ACEIs and ARBs), physiologic and prognostic impact, and treatment in the setting of heart failure are critical areas for investigation.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationships between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and coronary artery disease (CAD) and stent restonosis in diabetic patients. One hundred and thirty consecutive patients with CAD and 47 consecutive patients (14 males, mean age, 58.0 +/- 10.0) without CAD were enrolled in the study. All patients had type 2 (noninsulin dependent) DM. The patients with CAD underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting. Ninety-four (59 males, mean age, 60.3 +/- 9.8) underwent control coronary angiography at the end of the follow-up period (mean duration, 9.1 +/- 2.9 months). ACE gene I/D genotyping was identified in all patients. No significant difference was found among patients with and without CAD with respect to ACE gene I/D polymorphism (P = 0.460). In the control coronary angiography, stent restenosis and new lesion development were comparable in each genotyping subgroup. However, a significant relationship was observed between restenosis and the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) in patients with D allele (ACEI ratio, 43.5% in the restenosis group and 56.5% in non-restenotic group, P < 0.05). We did not find any relationship between ACE gene I/D polymorphism and CAD and stent restenosis and new lesion development in diabetic patients. On the other hand, ACEI treatment may reduce stent restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients with D allele (DD or ID).", 
    "543": "Kallikreins cleave plasma kininogens to release the bioactive peptides bradykinin (BK) or kallidin (Lys-BK). These peptides then activate widely disseminated B2 receptors with consequences that may be either noxious or beneficial. We used cultured cells to show that kallikrein can bypass kinin release to activate BK B2 receptors directly. To exclude intermediate kinin release or kininogen uptake from the cultured medium, we cultured and maintained cells in medium entirely free of animal proteins. We compared the responses of stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express human B2 receptors (CHO B2) and cells that coexpress angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) as well (CHO AB). We found that BK (1 nM or more) and tissue kallikrein (1-10 nM) both significantly increased release of arachidonic acid beyond unstimulated baseline level. An enzyme-linked immunoassay for kinin established that kallikrein did not release a kinin from CHO cells. We confirmed the absence of kininogen mRNA with RT-PCR to rule out kininogen synthesis by CHO cells. We next tested an ACE inhibitor for enhanced BK receptor activation in the absence of kinin release and synthesized an ACE-resistant BK analog as a control for these experiments. Enalaprilat (1 microM) potentiated kallikrein (100 nM) in CHO AB cells but was ineffective in CHO B2 cells that do not bear ACE. We concluded that kallikrein activated B2 receptors without releasing a kinin. Furthermore, inhibition of ACE enhanced the receptor activation by kallikrein, an action that may contribute to the manifold therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors.",

Its frequency increases regularly because of the progressive increase of life expectancy and better management of cardiovascular diseases. The prognosis is very poor (5-year mortality: 50%) as is quality of life; heart failure is a very costly disease. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEYS POINTS: Aims of treatment are improvement of symptoms and thus improvement of quality of life and increase of survival. The treatment systematically combines: general advice, dietary measures; medical treatment (with betablockers, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, diuretics, in some cases aspirin or oral anticoagulants, digitalis and amiodarone) according to severity of heart failure, presence of congestion, aetiology, age; etiologic treatment if possible; treatment and prevention of precipitating and exacerbating factors. According to clinical and paraclinical features, one may propose cardiac multisite stimulation, cardiac surgery, physical stress training and cardiac transplantation. In order to decrease frequency of heart failure, prevention of cardiovascular diseases which lead to heart failure must be done as often is possible (hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease).",

The kinetic parameters, K(m) and k(cat), of hydrolysis of the substrate Cbz-Phe-His-Leu catalyzed by the testicular (C-domain) enzyme were determined over a wide range of chloride concentrations. Chloride anions were found to be enzyme activators at relatively low concentrations, but they inhibit enzymatic activity at high concentrations. A general scheme for the effect of chloride anions on activity of the C-domain of bovine angiotensin-converting enzyme accounting for binding the \"activating\" and \"inhibiting\" anions is suggested.", 
    "547": "The Task Force of the National Heart, Lung and Blood institute issued the first standardized, algorithmic approach to treating hypertension in 1973. The concept of a stepped-care approach was born at that time. Their initial recommendation for antihypertensive drug therapy was diuretics. Subsequent Joint National Committee (JNC) Reports on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended that initial drug therapy be either a diuretic or beta-adrenergic blocker, and then either of these two drugs, and then a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitors). The JNC-V then recommended any of the four classes or an alpha-beta-blocker as initial therapy, but diuretics and b-blockers were preferable. That diuretics or beta-blockers should be the initial drug for noncomplicated hypertensive patient was also the recommendation of the Sixth Joint National committee report. Safety issues that arose after introduction ACE inhibitors and CCBs have since been mostly resolved. Drug treatment thresholds varied among the US, Canadian, British and WHO/ISH recommendations despite the fact that all were based on the same set of data. The concept of \"the lower the blood pressure the better without causing symptoms\" was the rule until the J-curve hypothesis emerged and generated a long debate. Now the current evidence supports the old concept, at least for some conditions such as hypertension in diabetic patients or in those with nephrotic-range proteinuria. Despite the repeated recommendations that thiazide-diuretics are preferred as the initial agent in hypertension treatment, many clinicians ignore these guidelines. This practice has added a signficant cost to hypertension treatment worldwide.",

Carvedilol or captopril were applied on malignant cells at 0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 50 micromol. Cell survival was determined 48 hrs after drugs action by MTT. On all cell lines tested, carvedilol was a very potent inhibitor of cell proliferation. The order of sensitivity of various human cell lines to carvedilol's antiproliferative action was: myelogenous leukemia K562 (IC50 = 22.66 +/- 2.14 micromol), > cervix carcinoma HeLa (IC50 = 30.56 +/- 5.16 micromol), > melanoma Fem-x (IC50 = 32.17 +/- 5.75 micromol), > breast tumor MDA-MB-361 (IC50 = 35.04 +/- 2.95 micromol). In contrast, captopril, used in doses from 0.1-50 micromol, was ineffective (IC50 > 50 micromol) to the same cell lines. It is important to note that captopril in concentrations > 1 micromol led to a statistically significant increase in the percent of survived melanoma Fem-x cells (p < 0.05). Understanding the action of these established and clinically accepted agents could provide a basis for design of improved therapeutic regimens in the treatment of cancer diseases.", 
    "549": "Atrial fibrillation, the most commonly encountered arrhythmia in clinical practice, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Its incidence and prevalence are increasing, and it represents a growing clinical and economic burden. Recent research has highlighted new approaches to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo show that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62% and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin was better than aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%, but the risk of major hemorrhage with warfarin was twice that with aspirin. Anticoagulation treatment needs to be tailored individually for patients on the basis of age, comorbidities, and contraindications. However, warfarin remains under-prescribed in clinical practice, for reasons related to patients (comorbidities) and physicians. The limitations of warfarin treatment have prompted the development of new anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics that do not require as frequent monitoring. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was compared with warfarin in the SPORTIF program, which found both agents to be broadly effective in the prevention of embolic events, but observed abnormal liver function tests in 6% of patients on ximelagatran. Liver function monitoring during treatment is thus needed. Idraparinux, a factor Xa inhibitor administered by once weekly subcutaneous injections, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. The ACTIVE trial is currently assessing the role of aspirin plus clopidogrel, compared with adjusted dose warfarin, in the prevention of vascular events in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs interfere with atrial remodeling and show promise in atrial fibrillation, as suggested in the LIFE trial. Preliminary studies suggest that statins may reduce the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for occlusion of the left atrial appendage are currently under investigation in patients at high risk of thromboembolism but with contraindications for chronic warfarin.", 
    "550": "We review the evidence linking mild renal insufficiency (MRI) with increased cardiovascular risk. MRI is associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors, including nighttime hypertension, and increased levels of lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, asymmetric dimethyl-arginine, and inflammation and insulin resistance markers and mediators. Epidemiologic evidence associates coronary artery disease and nephrosclerosis, a frequent cause of early renal insufficiency in the elderly. In a middle-aged general population MRI was found in 8% of women and 9% of men, but was not associated with cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, in a representative sample of middle-aged British men the risk of stroke was 60% higher for the sub-group with MRI: in people at high cardiovascular risk (mostly coronary disease), the HOPE study found a 2-fold (unadjusted) or 1.4-fold (adjusted) higher incidence of cardiovascular outcomes with MRI. The combined incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke increased with the level of serum creatinine. Several studies have examined the cardiovascular risk associated with MRI in hypertension. In HDFP, as in HOPE, cardiovascular mortality increased with serum creatinine (five-fold difference in cardiovascular mortality between the lowest and the highest creatinine strata). The risk associated with renal insufficiency was independent of other classic cardiovascular risk factors. Two trials of hypertensives with low risk (HOT and a small Italian trial) found that cardiovascular outcomes approximately doubled in subjects with MRI. Another study (MRFIT) found that it was not baseline creatinine, but its increase on follow-up that predicted future cardiovascular disease. These observational data suggest that regardless of etiology MRI is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and is found in 10% of populations at low cardiovascular risk and in up to 30% of those at high risk. No prospective therapeutic trials aimed at reducing the cardiovascular burden in people with MRI are available. Subgroup analyses of the HOPE study indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril is beneficial and does not increase the risk of such side effects as acute renal failure or hyperkalemia. Thus the frequent practice of withholding ACE inhibitors from patients with mild renal insufficiency is unwarranted, especially since MRI identifies a group at high risk that appears to benefit most from treatment. Moreover, there is evidence that ACE inhibitors improve renal outcomes in renal insufficiency. Prospective studies should test the predictive power of early renal insufficiency for cardiovascular disease and prognosis with various therapeutic options.",

Compared with DS rats, omapatrilat significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (-26 mmHg), improved renal function, histological findings, and messenger RNA expression levels of collagen I, collagen III, and TGF-beta. Combined treatment with omapatrilat and AM further improved renal function, histological findings, and mRNA expression levels of collagen I, collagen III, and TGF-beta, without a further reduction in blood pressure.

Factors with a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, nitric oxide (NO), and serum cytokine concentrations including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured at baseline and in the posttreatment period.

    "600": "Accumulating evidence has made it clear that not only does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) exist in the circulation where it is driven by renal renin, but it is also active in many tissues-and likely within cells as well. These systems might not be completely independent of each other, but rather interact. These local RAASs affect tissue and cellular angiotensin II concentrations and appear to be associated with clinically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic actions in the cardiovascular system and elsewhere. Evidence in support of this possibility is reviewed here. In addition, direct (pro)renin action after binding to its specific receptor, the existence of renin transcripts, which apparently encode an intracellular renin, the discovery of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme homologue (ACE2), which leads to enhanced generation of angiotensin-(1-7) and the newly appreciated role of angiotensin-receptor dimerization in the regulation of angiotensin activity, all point to the conclusion that the RAASs are complexly regulated, multifunctional systems with important roles both within and outside the cardiovascular system.", 
    "601": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, which block ANG II formation, are commonly used for treatment of hypertension. There is substantial evidence that the proximal tubule (PT) is a primary target site for captopril but the molecular mechanisms for its action in PT are not well defined. The aim of this study was to determine the physiological and molecular changes in PT provoked by acute captopril treatment in the absence of changes in blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Captopril (infused at 12 microg/min for 20 min) did not change blood pressure or GFR but induced an immediate (<10 min) increase in PT flow measured with a nonobstructive optical method (to 117 +/- 14% of baseline) along with a rapid diuresis from 2.1 +/- 0.6 mg/min (baseline) to 3.7 +/- 0.9 mg/min (captopril). Captopril also provoked a significant retraction of PT Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), NHE regulatory factor (NHERF)-1, myosin-VI, and Na(+)-P(i) cotransporter type 2 (NaPi2), but not ACE, out of apical microvillus-enriched membranes. Proteomic analysis with MALDI-TOF MS revealed an additional eight abundant membrane-associated proteins that redistributed out of the microvillus-enriched membrane during captopril treatment: megalin, myosin II-A, clathrin, aminopeptidase N, DPPIV, ezrin, moesin, and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit beta(2). In summary, captopril can rapidly depress PT reabsorption in the absence of a change in GFR or BP and provokes the redistribution of a set of transporters and transporter-associated proteins that likely participate in the decrease in PT reabsorption and may also contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "602": "Agents that counteract the negative impact of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are effective antihypertensives and reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Contrary to common perception, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not share the apparent benefit of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in reducing risk of cardiovascular-disease outcomes, particularly stroke, in randomised clinical trials. RAAS agents, especially ARBs, are well tolerated. Use of ARBs alone or in combination with other classes of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure and/or medications to control other conditions (e.g., insulin sensitivity) reduces risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes and Type 2 diabetes with excellent tolerability. Selected issues related to use of RAAS agents as antihypertensive therapies (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, global risk management, multiple drug therapy and coronary heart disease) are addressed.",

Only patients who had a functional capacity of class IV and who already received loop diuretic and ACE inhibitor therapy before their admission were included. Patients with recurrent admissions during this period were excluded. Eighty-five patients fulfilled these criteria: group I consisted of 25 patients who died during hospitalization whereas group II consisted of 60 patients who were discharged alive after treatment. Age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction derived from 2-D echocardiography, serum sodium (Na), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatinine, uric acid levels, white blood cell counts and drugs used on admission were the selected parameters as predictors of in-hospital mortality in these patients. When stepwise logistic regression analysis was used, female sex and serum uric acid levels at admission appear to be the only predictors of death during that hospitalization independent of other variables.",

    "606": "ACE inhibitors have significantly decreased cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the extended 12-year study of the SOLVD (Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) Prevention and Treatment trials (X-SOLVD) demonstrated a significant benefit with a reduction of cumulative all-cause death compared with placebo (50.9% vs 56.4%) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86; 95% CI 0.79, 0.93; p < 0.001]. The survival benefits and significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity related to treatment with ACE inhibitors are likely achieved by titrating the dose of ACE inhibitors to the target dose achieved in clinical trials. Although the ATLAS (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril And Survival) study, which randomly allocated HF patients to low- or high-dose lisinopril, showed no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.82, 1.03), the predetermined secondary combined outcome of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization was reduced by 15% for the patients receiving high-dose lisinopril compared with low-dose (p < 0.001) with a 24% reduction in HF hospitalization (p = 0.002). Despite the use of ACE inhibitors, blockade of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) remains incomplete, with evidence of continued production of angiotensin II by non-ACE-dependent pathways. The safety and potential benefits of angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) in patients with impaired systolic function have been assessed in moderate to large clinical trials. In patients with impaired LV systolic function and HF, combination therapy with ARBs with recommended HF therapy including ACE inhibitors in patients who remain symptomatic may be considered for its morbidity benefit. Based on the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity)-Added data, candesartan cilexetil in addition to standard HF therapy results in a further reduction of cardiovascular mortality. Close monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels is needed in this setting. The VALIANT (VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarction Trial) results suggest that valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients following an acute MI with HF and/or LV systolic dysfunction and may be used as an alternative treatment in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. There was no survival benefit with valsartan-captopril combination compared with captopril alone in this trial. Despite these results, ACE inhibitors remain the first-choice therapeutic agent in post-MI patients, and ARBs can be used in patients with clear intolerance. Although the use of ACE inhibitors may be appealing in patients with HF and preserved LV systolic function, there is currently no evidence from large clinical trials to support this.",

In this work calibration models were set up with tablets of the same active ingredient but of miscellaneous origin and manufacturess. Consequently the tablets had different excipients and appearance. The pharmaceutical preparations used included atenolol 100 mg tablets, enalapril 20 mg tablets and acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) tablets of different dosage units. In order to proof if the calibration models set up are generally feasible the assay declared by the manufacturer was used to calculate the partial least square (PLS) calibration. With respect to enalapril tablets simultaneous analysis by HPLC, according to USP 26 was carried out. It was investigated if such methods allow a determination of active ingredients in tablets within limits of +/- 10% of declaration. It was shown that it is possible to set up calibration models to quantify active ingredients in tablets independent of adjuvants or optical appearance. Additionally it could be shown that NIR-spectroscopy is also applicable to determine the concentration of active ingredients in blister-packed tablets.",

Male Wistar rats weighing 300-350 g were microinjected with phosphate buffer (PB-DRN, N = 11) or 1 microg/0.2 microl, in a single dose, ibotenic acid (IBO-DRN, N = 9 to 10) through a guide cannula into the DRN and were observed for 21 days in order to measure basal sodium appetite and water intake and in the following situations: furosemide-induced sodium depletion (20 mg/kg, sc, 24 h before the experiment) and a low dose of dietary captopril (1 mg/g chow). From the 6th day after ibotenic acid injection IBO-DRN rats showed an increase in sodium appetite (12.0 +/- 2.3 to 22.3 +/- 4.6 ml 0.3 M NaCl intake) whereas PB-DRN did not exceed 2 ml (P < 0.001). Water intake was comparable in both groups. In addition to a higher dipsogenic response, sodium-depleted IBO-DRN animals displayed an increase of 0.3 M NaCl intake compared to PB-DRN (37.4 +/- 3.8 vs 21.6 +/- 3.9 ml 300 min after fluid offer, P < 0.001). Captopril added to chow caused an increase of 0.3 M NaCl intake during the first 2 days (IBO-DRN, 33.8 +/- 4.3 and 32.5 +/- 3.4 ml on day 1 and day 2, respectively, vs 20.2 +/- 2.8 ml on day 0, P < 0.001).

The patient had been medicated with lisinopril and valsartan for hypertension for one month prior to admission. An abdominal computerized scan (CT) showed a dilated and thickened loop of the small bowel with massive ascites and a small nodule in the jejunum. The patient's abdominal pain was thought to be due to isolated visceral angioneurotic edema induced by lisinopril and/or valsartan, and medication of these two drugs was therefore stopped. Her symptoms resolved and an abdominal CT demonstrated almost complete resolution of ascites and of small bowel edema except for a small nodule in the jejunum. A laparoscopic operation was performed to excise the small nodule of the jejunum, and a histological diagnosis of accessory pancreas of the jejunum was made.

A cross-sectional study of 3887 Chinese men (n = 1958) and women (n = 1929) was used to explore the association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use and bone mineral density (BMD). The participants were aged 65 years and above, and were recruited using a combination of private solicitation and public advertising from community centers, housing estates, and the general community in Hong Kong. Demographic, medical, and lifestyle information was obtained from face to face interviews using standardized questionnaire, and physical examination measurements included anthropometry, tibial, and brachial systolic blood pressures, femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine BMD. In multiple regression analyses, after adjusting for age, weight, height, thiazide, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, statin, corticosteroid, and calcium supplement use, history of diabetes, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity level, ACEI use was associated with higher femoral neck BMD (+0.015 g/cm2, P = 0.035) in women, and higher femoral neck (+0.015 g/cm2, P = 0.017), total hip (+0.016 g/cm2, P = 0.021), and lumbar spine (+0.043 g/cm2, P < 0.001) BMD in men. Thiazide use was associated with higher BMD at all three sites in general, although associations with BMD increase at the total hip (P = 0.07) and femoral neck (P = 0.09) were weak in men. Calcium channel blocker use was only significantly associated with BMD increase at the lumbar spine (P = 0.03) in women, and beta-blocker use did not have significant associations with BMD at any site. This study suggests that in addition to thiazide diuretics ACEI may have possible benefits in treating not only hypertension but also osteoporosis among older Chinese.", 
    "616": "We report the first identification, gene cloning, recombinant expression and biochemical characterization of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) related dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase (DCP) in a protozoan parasite. The mammalian counterpart of this enzyme, peptidyl dipeptidase A (a carboxyl dipeptidase) also known as ACE leads to the cleavage of angiotensin I to produce a potent vasopressor. The catalytic enzyme activity of its Escherichia coli DCP counter part can be inhibited by the antihypertensive drug captopril, suggesting that this class of enzymes constitutes a novel target for drugs and vaccines. By utilizing a DNA microarray expression profiling approach, we identified a gene encoding a DCP enzyme for the kinetoplast protozoan Leishmania donovani (LdDCP) that was differentially expressed in promastigote and amastigote stages of the parasite life cycle. Both RNA and protein levels of LdDCP are higher in axenic amastigotes compared to promastigotes. Immuno-fluorescence analysis revealed the cytosolic expression of the protein. Primary structure analysis of LdDCP revealed the presence of an active Zn binding site. When expressed in E. coli, the recombinant enzyme showed carboxy-dipeptidase activity with synthetic substrates. Replacement of two histidine and one glutamic acid at positions 466, 470 and 467, respectively, with alanine residues in its active site resulted in loss of enzyme activity. Captopril, an ACE specific inhibitor was able both to reduce significantly LdDCP enzyme activity and to inhibit promastigote growth. Both its cytosolic location and close homology to DCPs from bacterial species suggests a role in parasite nutrition. Further, identification of LdDCP now provides an opportunity to investigate Leishmania peptidases for their potential as drug and vaccine targets.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of enalaprilat (Vasotec) administration on renal function during CO2 pneumoperitoneum, given that this drug, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, alters hormone-induced changes during pneumoperitoneum.",

    "637": "Hemodynamic and acid-basic parameter differences did not influence renal function. Plasma renin activity decreased significantly in group B compared with group C and stayed close to the values in group A. Creatinine clearance remained constant in group B, while in group C, creatinine clearance dropped, and this difference was statistically significant. Urinary debt and sodium-excretory fraction increased in group B during pneumoperitoneum and 60 minutes after this period in comparison with the other groups without reaching statistical significance.",

    "639": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, has several immunosuppressant actions. MPA depletes guanosine and deoxyguanosine nucleotides preferentially in T and B lymphocytes, inhibiting proliferation and suppressing cell-mediated immune responses and antibody formation, major factors in acute and chronic rejection. MPA also can induce T-lymphocyte apoptosis. MPA suppresses dendritic cell maturation and can induce human monocyte-macrophage cell line differentiation, decreasing the expression of interleukin (IL)-1 and enhancing expression of the IL-1 receptor antagonist. In addition, MPA inhibits adhesion molecule glycosylation and expression and lymphocyte and monocyte recruitment. Activated macrophages produce nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide, which combine to generate tissue-damaging peroxynitrite. MPA depletes tetrahydrobiopterin and decreases NO production by inducible NO synthase without affecting constitutive NO synthase activity. By these mechanisms, MMF exerts anti-inflammatory activity, which could attenuate both acute and chronic rejection. Unlike calcineurin inhibitors, MMF is nonnephrotoxic and does not induce transforming growth factor-beta production, which is fibrogenic. MMF inhibits arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, a contributor to graft proliferative arteriopathy, and does not increase blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels. By decreasing high-density lipoprotein oxidation and macrophage recruitment, MMF also may delay onset/progression of graft atherosclerosis. Thus, MMF may prevent chronic rejection by several mechanisms. MMF activity is synergistic with that of other agents such as valganciclovir for treating cytomegalovirus infection. MMF also has synergistic activity with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists in the treatment of some nephropathies in experimental animals. This combination may prevent progression toward end-stage renal disease in humans with chronic allograft, lupus, and diabetic nephropathies.",

    "644": "Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to reduce blood pressure by evoking vasodilation either directly by causing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle or indirectly by acting in the rostral brainstem to reduce central sympathetic outflow, which decreases the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. An increasingly large body of literature suggests that alterations in the NO system may play an important role in the development or maintenance of clinical hypertension. As proof of concept, pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in humans and animals causes moderate to severe hypertension. Certain forms of secondary hypertension are accompanied by the accumulation of endogenous NOS inhibitors, which may contribute to the development of hypertension. Furthermore, targeted disruption of the endothelial isoform of NOS in mice causes moderate hypertension, implying that hypertension may also develop from reductions in NOS expression. These gene knockout studies in animals have initiated the search for single nucleotide polymorphisms in human NOS genes, which could potentially lead to decreases in NOS protein expression. Conversely, increases in NOS expression or NO production have been linked with several commonly used cardiovascular therapies, including exercise training and the use of both statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Finally, increases in the production of oxidants such as superoxide anion can lead to the inactivation of NO, thereby reducing NO bioavailability. Thus, alterations in the expression or activity of NOS or in the availability of NO have the potential to play a causal role in clinical hypertension. The purpose of this article is to show how emerging basic research on the NO pathway is elucidating novel antihypertensive drug targets that are on the cusp of clinical application.", 
    "645": "Vasopeptidase inhibition is a novel treatment approach in cardiovascular disease such as hypertension and heart failure. Since the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) turned out to represent a very successful principle in the treatment of hypertension in numerous large scale clinical studies, their results encouraged attempts to inhibit other key enzymes in the regulation of vascular tone as well--such as the neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Similar to ACE, NEP is an endothelial cell surface metalloproteinase, which is involved in the degradation of several regulatory peptides including the natriuretic peptides and thus augments vasodilatation and natriuresis through increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). By simultaneous inhibition of the RAS and potentiation of the natriuretic peptide system, combined NEP/ACE inhibitors--the so called vasopeptidase inhibitors--reduce vasoconstriction and enhance vasodilatation, therefore, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Based on these considerations, numerous preclinicial studies with vasopeptidase inhibitors were performed and revealed promising results in experimental hypertension. Correspondingly, large scale clinical studies in patients with hypertension are on the way. Their preliminary results indicate that combined inhibition of ACE and NEP by vasopeptidase inhibitors represents an effective strategy in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease such as heart failure. However, clinical data also suggest that the incidence of angioedema may increase on vasopeptidase inhibition. Therefore, careful evaluation of the safety of this promising therapeutic principle in large scale clinical studies is mandatory before vasopeptidase inhibition may be considered a novel option in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

    "649": "Pharmacological interruption of the angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 receptor signaling during nephrogenesis in rats perturbs renal tubular development. This study aimed to further investigate tubular developmental defects in neonatal rats subjected to ANG II inhibition with enalapril. We evaluated tubular ultrastructural changes using electron microscopy and estimated spectrophotometrically activity or concentrations of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochromes a and c, which are components of mitochondrial respiratory chain, on postnatal days 2 and 9 (PD2 and PD9). Renal expression of sodium-potassium adenosinetriphosphatase (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase) and two reflectors of mitochondrial biogenesis [mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20)] also were studied using Western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Enalapril disrupted inner mitochondrial membranes of developing cortical and medullary tubular cells on PD2 and PD9. These findings were paralleled by impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, as revealed from the changes in components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as decreased cytochrome c level in the cortex and medulla on PD2 and PD9, decreased cytochrome a level in the cortex and medulla on PD2, and diminished cortical SDH activity on PD2 and PD9. Moreover, tubular expression of the most active energy-consuming pump Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was decreased by enalapril treatment. Renal expression of TFAM and TOM20 was not altered by neonatal enalapril treatment. Because nephrogenesis is a highly energy-demanding biological process, with the energy being utilized for renal growth and transport activities, the structural-functional alterations of the mitochondria induced by neonatal enalapril treatment may provide the propensity for the tubular developmental defect.", 
    "650": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia seen in clinical practice. The understanding of the pathophysiology of AF has changed drastically during the last several decades. Recent observations have challenged the concept of the multiple circuit reentry model in favor of single focus or single circuit reentry models. Atrial electrical dysfunction provides a favorable substrate and transmembrane ionic currents are key determinants. Recent research is focusing increasingly on the atrial structural remodeling, which underlies the development of AF in different pathological conditions. This has led to concepts about how interfering with the substrate might prevent AF development and recurrence. Particular interest has been generated in the role of renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in reversing the electrical and structural remodeling of diseased atria. The mechanisms for the preventive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) in AF are probably complex. They may comprise general haemodynamic changes leading to lower intra-atrial pressure and wall-stress, or reduce in atrial fibrosis, connexin43 over-expression and conduction delay. The promising results of several clinical trials concerning RAS blockade may herald a whole new era of AF treatment, where AF is prevented and treated by modifying its substrate rather than fighting it electrically. This review centers on the pathophysiology of the structural and electrical remodeling in AF, the possible mechanisms by which RAS blockade may reverse electrical and structural remodeling of diseased atria and on the role of ACEi or ARB blockers in AF prevention and treatment that has already been postulated both experimentally and clinically.", 
    "651": "Atypical membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) has been reported to have a good prognosis when treated with corticosteroids. However, this recommendation is based on uncontrolled trials and is associated with many complications. The purpose of our study is to determine whether steroid therapy is indicated for atypical MPGN. The cases of seven patients with atypical MPGN are reported in this study. Urinary abnormalities of five of them were detected by urine screening at school, of two because of macrohematuria. Hypocomplementemia was noted in six patients. All but one patient were treated without corticosteroids, and five with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or the Chinese herbal medicine Sairei-to (TJ-114). One patient recovered spontaneously from proteinuria and was therefore not treated, and one who developed severe proteinuria during observation was treated with corticosteroids. After an average follow-up period of 10.0 years, five patients showed normal urinary findings, one had hematuria and one proteinuria. At the most recent follow-up, the renal function of all patients remained within the normal range, and serum C3 had returned to normal levels in five out of six. These findings suggest that the indication of steroid therapy for atypical MPGN should be re-examined, since most of the patients with atypical MPGN seem to have an excellent prognosis without treatment with corticosteroids.", 
    "652": "Glomerular disease in the dog is not only a common form of renal disease but also an important cause of chronic renal failure. The presence of immune complexes in glomerular capillary walls is a major cause of canine glomerular disease and is commonly referred to as glomerulonephritis. Leakage of plasma proteins, principally albumin, across the damaged glomerular capillary walls results in persistent proteinuria--the clinicopathological hallmark of glomerulonephritis. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to being a marker of disease, persistent proteinuria is associated with progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions and loss of additional nephrons. Perhaps the best treatment for glomerulonephritis is the identification and correction of any underlying inflammatory, immune-mediated or neoplastic disease that results in the deposition or formation of glomerular immune complexes. In cases of idiopathic glomerulonephritis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to decrease proteinuria and potentially slow disease progression.", 
    "653": "Hyperkalemia is a life threatening metabolic condition. The common risk factors for hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, potassium supplementation and excessive consumption of potassium containing diet. A mild to moderate increase in serum potassium causes an increase in myocardial excitability, but further increase leads to impaired myocardial responsiveness, including that to pacing stimulation. Hyperkalemia has been reported to cause failure of atrial capture due to pacemaker exit block. We report a case where hyperkalemia resulted in failure of both the atrial and the ventricular pacemaker capture.", 
    "654": "In the course of development and validation of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for ramipril and its biologically active metabolite ramiprilat, evidence was found for an unknown interfering metabolite. Sample treatment included isolation from plasma or urine by solid-phase extraction, methylation with trimethylsilyldiazomethane and acylation with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA). When liquid chromatography was used to fractionate plasma extracts prior to derivatization, the alkyl, acyl-derivative of ramipril was obtained from two separate LC fractions. Electrospray ionization mass spectral data, together with circumstances for the derivatization, were consistent with the presence of an N-glucuronide of ramipril. Interference from the metabolite was eliminated by including a wash step after extraction/alkylation, prior to acylation. The final assay had a lower limit of quantification at 1.0 nmol/L and a linear range of 1-300 nmol/L. Intra- and inter-batch precision for ramipril and ramiprilat in plasma or urine were better than 10 and 5% at 2 and 80 nmol/L, respectively.",

It most occur occurs the mouth and larynx as well as lips and eyelids; less often other skin regions or even the gut can be involved. ACE inhibitor (ACEi)- induced angioedema typical occurs after several years on medication. A 72-year-old woman developed recurrent ACEi-induced angioedema. The drug was stopped and she received an AT(1)-receptor antagonist as an alternative antihypertensive. This medication also led to angioedema, which was not immediately recognized as medication-associated. AT(1)-receptor antagonists are not suitable alternatives for ACEi because they also carry an increased risk for inducing angioedema.", 
    "660": "The aim of this study was to compare the degree of taste disturbance by losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, with that of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Perindopril erbumine (2 mg), losartan potassium (25 mg), or vehicle was given to Japanese volunteers (n = 7) for 14 days in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover design with a 14-day washout period. Gustometry by filter-paper test and electrogustometry were performed before and at the end of each trial. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum and salivary zinc concentrations were measured. One subject dropped out because of a perindopril-induced dry cough, but no one claimed a taste disturbance. Detection thresholds of 4 basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, and bitter) by the paper-disc test and electrogustometry were significantly worsened, and plasma renin activity was elevated by the drugs, whereas the deteriorating effects of 2 drugs did not significantly differ. These drugs did not affect zinc concentrations in plasma and saliva. It was concluded that losartan and perindopril similarly alter taste sensitivity during repeated dosing of the drugs.", 
    "661": "Although it is possible to suggest that the ACE inhibitor may have a certain class effect in regards to the benefits observed in the treatment of chronic heart failure, it does not seem reasonable that the same can be assumed in the case of ARB II. Morbidity-mortality studies in chronic heart failure have only been conducted with three of the seven ARB II presently commercialized in our country. These are losartan (ELITE II), valsartan (Val-HeFT) and candesartan (CHARM). The three studies have demonstrated the utility of these drugs, although with different nuances. In these clinical comments, we review the evidence available, stressing what effects could be common to all the ARB II, such as the prevention of diabetes or atrial fibrillation and what effects may only be attributable to some of these, at least up to now. However, new information of the already finished studies and some still on-going clinical trials may help us to know the effects of the ARB II in this disease more and better.", 
    "662": "An important explanatory theory for the mechanism of postexercise proteinuria is that angiotensin II could be inhibited by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Because of the kininase effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme, it is unclear whether the kallikrein-kinin system contributes to the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on postexercise proteinuria. The aim of this study was to evaluate any possible involvement of the kallikrein-kinin system in the therapeutic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on postexercise proteinuria. We evaluated urinary protein levels in exhausted rats receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) or an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist (losartan). Enalapril (30 mg/kg/day, two days) or losartan (20 mg/kg/day, two days) were given to animals using an intragastric catheter. Urinary protein levels increased (41 %) in rats which were exhausted via treadmill running (p < 0.05). In animals that received drug treatment (enalapril or losartan), but did not exercise to exhaustion, urinary protein levels were not different from the control group. Urinary protein levels were found to be significantly lower (p < 0.05) in animals which performed acute exhaustive exercise after enalapril or losartan administration, compared to rats which were exhausted without drug administration. Inhibition of postexercise proteinuria by either enalapril or losartan suggested that angiotensin II plays an important role in postexercise proteinuria, however, it appears the kallikrein-kinin system is not involved in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors effect.", 
    "663": "Autosomal-recessive Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), T-cell immunodeficiency and facial dysmorphism is caused by defects in the SMARCAL1 gene. The gene product is involved in the transcriptional regulation of other genes. A 12-year-old boy of consanginous Turkish descent developed disproportionate short stature from spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia at the age of 6 and nephrotic syndrome at the age of 10 years. Renal biopsy revealed FSGS, the kidney function was normal, T-lymphocytes were diminished without infectious complications, and he has had no cerebral ischemia. Analysis of the patient's SMARCAL1 gene revealed a novel homozygous C1798T transition leading to a R561C substitution. The parents and two healthy sisters were found to be heterozygous. A younger brother, who is also homozygous for the mutation, is clinically asymptomatic and has no proteinuria at the age of 18 months. Still, his CD4 cells are diminished. For SMARCAL1 mutations a clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported: severe SIOD with in utero or early-childhood onset leading to end-stage renal disease within a few years is caused by nonsense, frame shift or splice mutations. Many patients die from infections and cerebrovascular insults during childhood. Mild SIOD manifests later and progresses more slowly without infectious or cerebral vascular complications--the underlying defect being missense mutations in all three patients reported so far. The novel R561C missense mutation in our patient with mild SIOD is additional evidence for the genotype-phenotype correlation reported for SMARCAL1 mutations.", 
    "664": "Clinical studies have demonstrated that some antihypertensive agents provide renoprotection independent of BP lowering. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies evaluated the mechanisms involved in this protection. First, the in vitro effects of several angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and beta blockers (BB) on various mediators were compared: Formation of pentosidine (an advanced glycation end product), hydroxyl radical-induced formation of o-tyrosine, and transition metals-induced oxidation of ascorbic acid (the Fenton reaction). All of the six tested ARB but neither the six CCB nor the nine BB inhibited pentosidine formation. ARB, as well as BB but not CCB, inhibited hydroxyl radicals-mediated o-tyrosine formation. ARB but neither BB nor CCB inhibited efficiently transition metals-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid. Second, the in vivo consequences for the kidney of these various in vitro effects were evaluated. Hypertensive, type 2 diabetic rats with nephropathy, SHR/NDmcr-cp, were given for 20 wk either olmesartan (ARB) or nifedipine (CCB), or atenolol (BB). Despite similar BP reduction, only ARB significantly reduced proteinuria and prevented glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage (mesangial activation, podocyte injury, tubulointerstitial injury, and inflammatory cell infiltration). It is interesting that only ARB prevented abnormal iron deposition in the interstitium, corrected chronic hypoxia, reduced expressions of heme oxygenase and p47phox (a subunit of NADPHoxidase), and inhibited pentosidine formation (which correlates well with proteinuria). These observations confirm unique renoprotective properties of ARB, independent of BP lowering but related to decreased oxidative stress (hydroxyl radicals scavenging and inhibition of the Fenton reaction), correction of chronic hypoxia, and inhibition of advanced glycation end product formation and of abnormal iron deposition. These benefits of ARB may contribute to the renoprotection observed beyond BP lowering.",

The arterial blood pressure changes were recorded each week. The Sodium Hydrogen Exchange (NHE) activity of erythrocytes was determined 2 weeks after the study. The surviving animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last dose, and the sections of their hearts and kidneys were assessed histologically for injury by a pathologist masked to the treatment.",

    "676": "The treatment of patients with congestive heart failure has markedly improved over the past 25 years. The most successful therapy has been attenuation of neurohumoral overactivation with antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as beta-adrenergic blockade. Cardiac surgical interventions, which include not only aortocoronary artery bypass surgery but also interventions that remodel the heart and repair the mitral valve, have also been advocated. However, randomized clinical trials to prove their benefit and to identify which patients could derive the most benefit from these interventions are lacking. Cardiac devices, such as biventricular pacemakers (for cardiac resynchronization) and implantable cardiac defibrillators, have proved useful in improving survival and quality of life. The treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure has shown some promise, as has immune modulation therapy, but more research to conclusively prove their efficacy is necessary. Cell therapy with skeletal myoblasts or pluripotential stem cells is an interesting and emerging area of research that shows enormous promise. However, fundamental questions regarding the optimal use of this therapy remain unanswered. Finally, although exciting, these developments, along with the changing demographics of the Canadian population, will require a change in the way we provide care for patients with congestive heart failure. These changes will require greater involvement of health care professionals other than physicians, and greater emphasis on outpatient care, early detection and prevention, and evidence-based practice.", 
    "677": "Results of studies of effects of loop and thiazide diuretics on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are discussed. A number of prospective trials have shown that in patients with CHF not receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) diuretics lessen considerably probability of decompensation. At the same time retrospective analysis of some large randomized trials revealed elevated mortality among patients with CHF receiving high doses of loop diuretics without potassium sparing diuretics. Especially significant during treatment with high doses of loop diuretics is elevated risk of sudden (or arrhythmic) death which according to data from SOLVD and PRAISE trials increases 30-50%. Current recommendations on the use of loop and thiazide diuretics in complex therapy of patients with CHF are given. An attention is paid to that therapy of CHF should be started with prescription of ACEI and diuretic added in the presence of symptoms and signs of congestion. In moderate and severe CHF as basic therapy it is recommended to use combination of ACEI, b-adrenoblocker and spironolactone, which allow to confine to medium doses of loop diuretics (furosemide not more than 80 mg/day). Mechanisms of diuretic resistance in CHF and methods of its management are also reviewed in detail.",

Compared with general population patients with diabetes have higher mortality in acute phase of myocardial infarction as well as in early and late postinfarction period. Primary prevention of ischemic heart disease in patients with diabetes should include abolition of hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia. Measures of primary prevention comprise the use of aspirin, beta-adrenoblockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and strict control of glycemia.",

Understanding of the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction has improved, including the notion that dysfunctional endothelial nitric oxide synthase, in part due to deficiency of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, likely plays an important role. Major progress has been made in understanding the role of endothelial progenitor cells, which likely contribute to both ischemia-induced neovascularization and endothelial regeneration after injury. Endothelial progenitor cell function is altered in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "681": "Recent research on endothelial and endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction supports their clinical significance and has led to important insights in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and at the same time provides an important opportunity to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Endothelial function represents a valuable surrogate endpoint to assess the impact of therapeutic interventions.", 
    "682": "The neurohormonal model of congestive heart failure (CHF) has replaced the previously accepted hemodynamic model. A shift in this paradigm has allowed alterations in therapy of CHF such that agents that target the neurohormonal axis and specifically the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, are utilized. Employment of these drugs markedly improves survival in patients with CHF. Recent animal and human data demonstrate that aldosterone is directly pathogenic in this disease process and is insufficiently suppressed by these agents. Furthermore, when aldosterone is directly antagonized, vascular and myocardial damage is greatly ameliorated in both experimental animals and humans. Significant mortality benefits of aldosterone antagonists in patients with CHF from systolic dysfunction have been subsequently witnessed. Herein, the pathophysiology of CHF, the beneficial role of aldosterone antagonists in this disease process, and potential adverse consequences of these agents are reviewed.",

Fractalkine mRNA levels in 10(-6)-10(-8) M angiotensin II solution showed no significant differences. Fractalkine mRNA levels in the 5 or 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha solution significantly increased compared with those in the control in a time- and dose-dependent manner (by 94 to 253%). Fractalkine mRNA levels in the 50-200 microg/ml AGE-BSA solution also increased compared with those in BSA solution in a time- and dose-dependent manner (by 119 to 261%).

NEP-deficient mice possess increased levels of brain Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). The objective of this study was to determine whether tissue NEP specific activity differs according to age and/or across mouse strains, especially those strains predisposed toward formation of Abeta-amyloid plaques following overexpression of the human Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). The C57Bl/6J mouse strain appears to be relatively susceptible to cerebral amyloidosis, whereas the Swiss Webster (SW) strain appears more resistant. We investigated whether NEP specific activity in brain and kidney homogenates from SW and C57 mice of 6, 40, and 80 weeks old varied according to mouse strain, age, and gender. Among the variables tested, NEP specific activity varied most dramatically across mouse strain, with the kidney and brain of SW mice displaying the highest activities. Aging was associated with a reduction in brain NEP specific activity in both strains. Gender-specific differences were identified in kidney but not in brain. We conclude that aging- and strain-dependent differences in NEP specific activity may play a role in the differential susceptibility of some mouse strains for developing cerebral amyloidosis following human APP overexpression.",

    "695": "Renal complications resulting from type 2 diabetes mellitus are costly and common. Finding optimal therapy is important for the prevention and management of diabetic nephropathy. Research has focused on antihypertensive agents that modify the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Because of their effects on the glomerulus, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been studied as interventions at various stages of diabetic nephropathy. The ACE inhibitors may delay the progression to microalbuminuria and then clinical albuminuria. The ARBs decrease albuminuria in patients with microalbuminuria and decrease adverse renal events, specifically the progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with clinical albuminuria and hypertension. Limited data suggest that combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs may slow the progression of microalbuminuria to clinical albuminuria. Because of the variability in degree of albuminuria evaluated and in study designs (numbers of patients, study duration, drug dosages, and outcomes measured), a detailed review of the available literature about ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the prevention or treatment of diabetic nephropathy may provide insight to clinicians.",

Discontinuation-rate changes for cases were 2 to 8 times those for controls. Generic-substitution rates depended on availability and initial generic utilization. Elasticity of demand for drugs was generally low, -0.16 to -0.10, for asymptomatic conditions (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs, statins), and moderate, -0.60 to -0.24, for symptomatic conditions (COX-2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, triptans, SSRIs).",

    "701": "Recent antihypertensive studies have demonstrated that small peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity had an ability to lower or to modulate a pressor blood pressure response in mild hypertensive subjects. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Based on our previous finding that a small peptide, Val-Tyr (VY), was accumulated in the rat aorta and kidney as well as in the circulating blood system, we here investigated whether antihypertensive small peptides exert an antiproliferative effect on serum- or mitogen-induced human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Treatment with some ACE inhibitory small peptides (VY, Ile-Trp [IW], and Ile-Val-Tyr [IVY]) had diverse effects on serum-stimulated VSMC proliferation that were independent of their ACE inhibitory activity, though only VY exerted a potent antiproliferative action. VY also showed a greater inhibition of WST-8 incorporation in response to angiotensin (Ang) II-stimulation than the other two small peptides. The attenuation of Ang II-stimulated WST-8 incorporation by VY was not affected by Ang II receptor antagonists (losartan and saralasin ([Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II)), indicating that the antiproliferative action of VY may not be due to the peptide's antagonistic effect against Ang II receptors. Treatment with VY had a significant inhibitory effect on the WST-8 incorporation induced by the stimulation of a voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644. Even in the presence of a K+ channel blocker (paxillin) the inhibition was apparent, suggesting that VY inhibited the proliferation of VSMCs by serving as a natural L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, but not as a K+ channel agonist.", 
    "702": "The aim of the study was to compare the effect of 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on neurohormonal and circulatory variables in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with asymptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR). Ten CKCSs with mild to severe untreated MR were treated with 2 ACE inhibitors, quinapril and enalapril (each at 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 7 days), in a double-blind, crossover study with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. Blood samples were drawn and echocardiography was performed on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Both treatments reduced ACE activity (P < .001) and increased renin activity (P < .001) and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (P < .005). The ACE inhibitors had no effect on the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite (NOx) or asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). On day 0, a lower NOx concentration (P = .02) was found in samples taken in the clinic as compared to samples taken in the homes of the dogs. Quinapril caused a significant reduction in more variables that reflect the severity of MR (eg, jet size and left ventricular end diastolic diameter) than did enalapril. However, in terms of specific variables, no significant difference was identified between the effects of the 2 treatments on MR. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect NOx and ADMA concentrations in asymptomatic dogs, but exercise, stress, or some combination may influence NOx concentrations in these dogs.",

    "704": "Mesangial IgA glomerulonephritis (MIgAGn) is the most common biopsied primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, with a poor long-term prognosis for renal function in over a third of all patients. No proven therapy currently exists for MIgAGn. Recent studies have suggested some benefit with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), especially in hypertensive patients with kidney failure and proteinuria, though other studies have failed to corroborate these findings. We report eight adult patients with biopsy proven MIgAGn followed in a single hospital. They all received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Compassionate use of MMF was based on the presence of clinical and analytical data suggesting a high risk of short- to medium-term progression to chronic renal failure. MMF treatment was stopped after two and three months in two patients who had advanced renal failure at the start of therapy because of disease progression and greater fluid retention. Several months later they both required dialysis and kidney transplantation. The mean duration of MMF therapy in the other six patients was 15 (range: 10-18) months. The mean serum creatinine concentration fell from 1.82 +/- 0.47 to 1.55 +/- 0.41 mg/dl (p = 0.04). Protein loss in 24-hour urine collection fell from 1.95 +/- 1.35 to 0.77 +/- 0.58 g/day (p = 0.02). These results in this low number of patients showed that treatment with MMF in high-riks patients with MIgAGn and early stage kidney failure generally stabilized the disease and reduced proteinuria. MMF was well tolerated and may be of some benefit in a subgroup of patients with MIgAGn and a poor prognosis.", 
    "705": "Non-stochastic and stochastic 2D linear indices have been generalized to codify chemical structure information for chiral drugs, making use of a trigonometric 3D-chirality correction factor. These descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional 2D non-stochastic [Y. Marrero-Ponce. J. Chem. Inf. Comp., Sci. l 44 (2004) 2010] and stochastic [Y. Marrero-Ponce, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13 (2005) 1293] linear indices to distinguish sigma-stereoisomers. In order to test the potential of this novel approach in drug design we have modelled the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of perindoprilate's sigma-stereoisomers combinatorial library. Two linear discriminant analysis models, using non-stochastic and stochastic linear indices, were obtained. The models showed an accuracy of 100% and 96.65% for the training set; and 88.88% and 100% in the external test set, respectively. Canonical regression analysis corroborated the statistical quality of these models (R(can) of 0.78 and of 0.77) and was also used to compute biology activity canonical scores for each compound. After that, the prediction of the sigma-receptor antagonists of chiral 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines by linear multiple regression analysis was carried out. Two statistically significant QSAR models were obtained when non-stochastic (R2 = 0.982 and s = 0.157) and stochastic (R2 = 0.941 and s = 0.267) 3D-chiral linear indices were used. The predictive power was assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validation experiment, yielding values of q2 = 0.982 (s(cv) = 0.186) and q2 = 0.90 (s(cv) = 0.319), respectively. Finally, the prediction of the corticosteroid-binding globulin binding affinity of steroids set was performed. The best results obtained in the cross-validation procedure with non-stochastic (q2 = 0.904) and stochastic (q2 = 0.88) 3D-chiral linear indices are rather similar to most of the 3D-QSAR approaches reported so far. The validation of this method was achieved by comparison with previous reports applied to the same data set. The non-stochastic and stochastic 3D-chiral linear indices appear to provide an interesting alternative to other more common 3D-QSAR descriptors.", 
    "706": "Heart failure results in neurohormonal activation of which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is the main mediator. Activation of this system leads to the production of angiotensin II (ATII), which leads to multiple adverse short-term and long-term effects, including hemodynamic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) exert favorable effects in congestive heart failure (CHF) by inhibiting the production of ATII. It has been shown that ACEIs may not be able to suppress the production of ATII completely because there are RAS-independent mechanisms of ATII production. Hence, it was thought that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might be more useful in CHF because they directly block the ATII receptors. Many studies have been done to evaluate the role of ARBs in CHF. We reviewed these studies and have attempted to define the place and ARBs in the therapy for CHF.", 
    "707": "Augmentation index (AI), a measure of enhanced wave reflection, has been proposed as a bedside measure of aortic stiffness. However, because AI is potentially sensitive to various factors other than vessel wall stiffness, the utility of AI as a stiffness indicator may be limited. To assess relations between AI and vascular properties, we used arterial tonometry and aortic Doppler flow to evaluate trough (24 hours) and peak (4 hours) pulsatile hemodynamics and pulse wave velocity in 159 individuals with systolic hypertension at the completion of a 12-week period of monotherapy with the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (80 mg; n=75) or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (40 mg; n=84). Characteristic impedance (Zc) was calculated from the ratio of change in carotid pressure and aortic flow in early systole. Systolic ejection period (SEP), timing of wave reflection, and AI were assessed from the carotid waveform. Comparable acute reductions in mean pressure were associated with greater reductions in peripheral resistance with enalapril, whereas neither drug had an acute effect on Zc. Both drugs reduced AI, but neither drug altered the timing of wave reflection. Both drugs increased heart rate and shortened SEP. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the acute reduction in AI was most affected by reductions in SEP and peripheral resistance. Change in AI was inversely related to change in Zc and pulse wave velocity did not enter the model. Our findings indicate that AI is a complex surrogate marker that is inversely related to changes in proximal aortic stiffness in systolic hypertension.",

The studied population consisted of 70 men and 21 women (mean age 69 +/- 12 years). Ischemia was the underlying cause of heart failure in 61 patients. Overall, 100% of the patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor, 72% with a beta-blocker, and 47% with spironolactone. In 32% (95% confidence interval 22-42) of the patients, microalbuminuria was present, which is significantly higher than in the general population.

    "711": "Diabetic eye disease affects quality of life for patients with diabetes by decreasing visual acuity and increasing the risk of blindness. In the course of diabetic retinopathy (DR) the loss of capillary integrity, microaneurysm formation, and ischemia is observed, which in turn drives the progression of DR. The macular edema is the result of fluid accumulation in the retina secondary to capillary leakage and/or microaneurysms. This contributes to loss of vision in DR. There is substantial evidence that control over metabolic factors can effectively prevent the development and progression of DR. For many patients who fail to achieve the optimal level of metabolic control the standard care should include the early detection and timely treatment of DR. Laser photocoagulation therapy, and vitrectomy are invasive methods, recommended to treat only the late stages of disease. A number of pharmacological agents that could slow the progression of DR in earlier stages are now being tested. It is likely that at least one of these agents, will be effective in reducing the progression of DR and the associated vision loss. With the introduction of these drugs in the coming years, there will be a need for improved screening and monitoring of patients with DR. New technologies are giving patients more access to optimal screening and may make this a more achievable goal.", 
    "712": "Chronic heart failure is characterised by excess adrenergic activity that augurs a poor prognosis. The reasons for increased adrenergic activity are complex and incompletely understood. The circumstantial evidence relating increased activity to adverse outcome is powerful, but not yet conclusive. In normal subjects, autonomic control of the circulation is predominantly under the control of sympatho-inhibitory inputs from the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, with a small input from the excitatory ergo- and chemo-receptors. In heart failure, the situation is reversed, with loss of the restraining input from the baroreceptors and an increase in the excitatory inputs, resulting in excessive adrenergic activity. The circumstantial evidence linking neuroendocrine activation with poor outcome coupled with the clinical success of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has long suggested that inhibition of adrenergic activity might be beneficial in heart failure. There is a number of potential ways of achieving this. Improved treatment of heart failure itself may reduce sympathetic drive. There is an interplay between angiotensin II, aldosterone and the sympathetic nervous system, and thus RAAS antagonists, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and spironolactone could directly reduce sympathetic activation. Exercise rehabilitation may similarly reduce sympathetic activity.Recently, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been conclusively shown to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalisations and increase survival. However, the demonstration that central reduction of sympathetic activity with agents such as moxonidine increases morbidity and mortality suggests that we do not properly understand the role of sympathetic activation in the pathophysiology of heart failure.",

    "714": "Despite clinical trials demonstrating that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems can reduce the mortality and morbidity risk associated with heart failure, these drugs have remained underutilized in general clinical practice. In particular, many patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction fail to receive beta blockers, although this class of drugs, as well as other antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, are recommended as part of routine heart failure therapy by national expert consensus guidelines. In-hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy may improve long-term utilization by physicians and compliance by patients through obviating many of the misperceived dangers associated with beta blockade. The following review of the clinical trial data from the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) trial, the Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II), the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial, and the Initiation Management Predischarge Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) trial on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of beta blockers indicates that early initiation can be safely achieved and can improve patient outcomes.",

Patients can present at any age, but more often come to clinical attention (unless there is a family history) after age 30. Patients who are diagnosed before age 30 have a worse renal survival. Although palpation of the abdomen occasionally provides a clue to the presence of polycystic kidney disease, radiographic procedures most often suggest the diagnosis. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes give rise to cyst formation. Flank pain, hematuria, polyuria, nephrolithiasis, urinary tract infections, and hypertension may be part of the syndrome of polycystic kidney disease. It is the fourth most common cause of end-stage renal disease. Blood pressure treatment goals are less than 130/80 mm Hg.

Cognitive deterioration attributable to normal aging was distinguished from cognitive deterioration related to hypertension by means of neuropsychologic tests.

Patients with a history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attacks, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, or bypass surgery, and those diagnosed with dementia, depression, or anxiety, were excluded. Neither gender differences, duration of hypertension (10.2+/-8.2 years), nor prescribed antihypertensive drug treatment had an influence on study results. Immediate recall was impaired in both groups. The hypertensive patients evinced impairment in all tests vs. the normotensive subjects. Mean deferred recall scores +/- SD were 5.68+/-2.6 vs. 7.13+/-2.4; p<0.01. Deficits in attention speed and executive function, as measured by nonperformance on the Trail Making Test Part B, were present in 46% of hypertensive patients vs. 13% of normotensive patients (p<0.005), with more errors made by the hypertensive patients (1.15+/-1.54 vs. 0.46+/-0.9; p<0.02).

    "738": "Progressive vascular and myocardial remodeling in heart failure is effectively slowed by therapy with neurohormonal antagonists, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and adrenergic-receptor blockers. These therapies, along with the correction of hemodynamic abnormalities, have dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) also occur in heart failure. Data suggest that endothelial dysfunction and reduced NO bioavailability may be more prevalent in populations who self-identify as African Americans. Thus, differences observed in the African American population with respect to prevalence of heart failure, etiology, outcomes, and response to medication may in part be explained by differences in the relative contributions of neurohormonal activation and diminished NO bioavailability to the progression of heart failure. The African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) was designed to assess the benefit of fixed-dose combination isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine (ISDN-HYD) in an African American population with advanced heart failure. The A-HeFT enrolled 1,050 African American patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV heart failure with dilated ventricles and low ejection fractions. Patients were randomized to receive either a fixed-dose combination of ISDN-HYD or placebo added to standard neurohormonal blockade. The primary end point was a composite score in which mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life were weighted. On July 19, 2004, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early termination of the trial because of a significant mortality benefit in the cohort receiving fixed-dose ISDN-HYD. The A-HeFT confirms the benefit of fixed-dose ISDN-HYD, which may enhance NO bioavailability in African American patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure and suggests that NO-enhancing therapy is an effective new treatment strategy for heart failure. In addition, the A-HeFT affirms the critical importance of the inclusion of population subgroups in clinical trials both as a way to probe for pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease and to devise optimal treatment strategies. The rich and unique A-HeFT database will provide new opportunities to understand the pathophysiology and management of heart failure.",

Current treatments for heart failure include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin II-receptor antagonists, and vasodilating agents. This review discusses the unique characteristics of CVD in African Americans and addresses the need for targeted treatments to reduce the excess burden found in this population.",

CHF led to increased superoxide production by NOSIII and the NADPH oxidase. Decreased NO production in CHF was associated with a decrease in the expression of NOSIII and an inhibition of NO downstream signaling in the aorta.

A pre-defined substudy is being conducted within The ONTARGET Trial Programme to compare the effects of these agents, alone and in combination, on cardiac structure and function. The substudy overcomes criticisms of many previous studies, which have been performed in small numbers of patients using suboptimal methodology, by evaluating changes in left ventricular structure and function using sophisticated technology provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some 300 randomized patients within ONTARGET, recruited from selected centres in Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Thailand, will have MRI undertaken at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. As this method of assessing left ventricular dysfunction is somewhat timeconsuming, expensive and complex, and in the light of current interest in the role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a simple, inexpensive diagnostic and prognostic tool, the substudy will also examine whether changes in BNP during follow-up correlated with changes in left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "757": "Angiotensin II induces inflammatory activation of vascular smooth muscle cells and can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker with demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular structure and function in animal models. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril also reduces ventricular and vascular remodelling. The open-label study observed 75 treatment-naive, moderately or severely hypertensive (systolic blood pressure 160-190 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 90-110 mmHg) patients (age range, 42-58 years) treated with once-daily telmisartan 40 mg force-titrated to 80 mg after 1 month (n=25), once-daily ramipril 2.5 mg force-titrated to 5 mg after 1 month (n=25), or once-daily telmisartan 40 mg plus ramipril 2.5 mg (n=25); the total duration of treatment was 6 months. At baseline, blood pressure, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid cross-sectional intima-media area (CSA) were measured. Measurements were repeated 1, 3 and 6 months after initiation of treatment. After 6 months, comparable blood pressure reductions were achieved with the three treatments. Reductions in LVMI after 6 months' treatment were 11.4%, 9.9% and 15.6% with telmisartan, ramipril, and telmisartan plus ramipril, respectively. Respective reductions in IMT were 14.6%, 12.0% and 18.2%, and for CSA were 7.8%, 4.3% and 11.5%. In conclusion, treatment with telmisartan or ramipril for 6 months resulted in regression of LVH and vascular remodelling. When a combination of telmisartan and ramipril was administered, additional regression and remodelling occurred.", 
    "758": "The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan for 24 weeks on myocardial structure and function in patients with essential hypertension, and the relationship between this effect and the structural polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. Thirty-five patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without other associated morbidity were included in an open-label, non-comparative study. The patients were treated with telmisartan 40-80 mg once daily. In the final analysis, there were 29 patients who received the full course of treatment and were evaluated echocardiographically before and after treatment by the same blinded investigator, and myocardial structure and function were analysed. The myocardial mass of the left ventricle was determined in M-mode. Assessment of diastolic function of transmitral blood flow was performed using pulsed Doppler echocardiography. All patients were genotyped for insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene. Telmisartan produced a significant reduction in left ventricular mass index from 140.4 +/- 48.6 to 128.7 +/- 40.6 g/m2 that was accompanied by an improvement in characteristics of diastolic function. The decrease in LVH was more significant in the ID genotype group than in the II and DD groups. Thus, prolonged treatment with telmisartan is accompanied by an improvement in myocardial structure, expressed as a reduction in left ventricular mass and function that is more marked in patients with ID genotype of the ACE gene.", 
    "759": "Epidemiological studies have established that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. In turn, hypertension is a well-established risk factor for LVH. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has shown that 24-h mean ambulatory blood pressure is a particularly powerful predictor of LVH, being superior to casual clinic blood pressure measurements. The magnitude of the rise in blood pressure in the early morning correlates with the extent of LVH. Prospective studies have shown the advantageous effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVH in terms of regression of left ventricular mass (LVM) and subsequent reduction in overt cardiovascular disease. Meta-analysis has identified differences in the ability of different classes of anti-hypertensive agents to bring about regression of LVH, with agents that target the renin angiotensin system (RAS) appearing superior to other agents, such as beta-blockers and diuretics. The distinct pharmacological features of telmisartan suggest that it may be a suitable agent for managing hypertensive patients because it provides sustained control of blood pressure and appears to be very effective in reversing cardiac remodelling. Pre-clinical evaluation has demonstrated that telmisartan suppresses angiotensin II-induced collagen production and secretion by cultured fibroblasts, and reduces left ventricular weight in different animal models. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that, as well as reducing blood pressure (including 24-h mean ambulatory values), telmisartan brings about LVM regression in patients with hypertension, and improves left ventricular and left atrial function. Comparative studies have shown telmisartan's superiority compared with both hydrochlorothiazide and carvedilol in regressing LVM, the additional activity probably being explained by the sustained blood pressure control and the non-haemodynamic effects of targeting the RAS. The ultimate proof of the clinical value of telmisartan will be provided by the outcome trials ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial/Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (ONTARGET/TRANSCEND) currently being conducted in high-risk patients.", 
    "760": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which describes pathological changes in cardiac structure, is a powerful and reversible predictor of cardiovascular risk. There is a continuous relationship between left ventricular mass (LVM) and the likelihood of cardiovascular events, with no cut-off between the absence of such events and heightened risk. A correlation between LVH and blood pressure is well established. There is a paradox, however, that the structural changes to the heart as a result of increased workload due to high blood pressure appear to promote cardiovascular disease. This may be partially explained by the fact that ambulatory blood pressure measurements correlate more closely with LVH than resting blood pressure. Blood pressure variation throughout the day is also emerging as an important correlate of LVH, and a strong association has been identified between an early morning rise in blood pressure and increased LVM. Use of anti-hypertensive agents not only lowers blood pressure, but can also bring about LVH regression. The pathological role of angiotensin II in LVH and target-organ damage within the cardiovascular continuum suggest that agents targeting the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, may prove particularly effective and may confer beneficial effects in addition to the lowering of blood pressure. The angiotensin II receptor blockers may be very appropriate treatment options because of their placebo-like tolerability and the possibility of more complete blockade of the RAAS. Within this class of anti-hypertensive agents, pharmacological differences may mean that some agents afford greater cardioprotection than others.", 
    "761": "Angiotensin II, the effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, has profound effects on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These effects are not only hemodynamic in nature, but also comprise inflammation, thrombosis, and cell proliferation through stimulation of production of cytokines and growth factors. In diabetes mellitus these effects seem amplified with adverse consequences like atherosclerosis and occlusive microangiopathy. Suggestive evidence for this notion is the impressive beneficial effect of pharmacological interference with the renin-angiotensin system in large vessel disease as well as in renal and retinal microangiopathy. Since the circulating renin-angiotensin system does not seem to be activated in diabetes mellitus it is now thought that independent tissue renin-angiotensin systems play a role in diabetic complications. Whether any genetic propensity to diabetic angiopathy resides in genes of the renin-angiotensin system remains to be determined.", 
    "762": "Increases in blood pressure, even at modest levels, are associated with an increased risk of complications in diabetes. Trials have shown that treatment with blood pressure-lowering agents in type 2 diabetes lowers the risk of complications of cardiovascular and microvascular complications. ACE inhibitors appear superior in patients with microalbuminuria, although the choice of other agents is less clear, making blood pressure control itself more important than the particular agent used. The probability that a patient will require multiple therapies is increased in patients with diabetes, in part because of the increased likelihood of concurrent cardiovascular illness for which antihypertensives may have benefit. Finally, some drugs used to lower blood pressure have a benefit in individuals not considered hypertensive and appear to have a mechanism of action independent of blood pressure lowering.",

    "779": "We present a novel approach for ligand-based virtual screening by combining query molecules into a multiple feature tree model called MTree. All molecules are described by the established feature tree descriptor, which is derived from a topological molecular graph. A new pairwise alignment algorithm leads to a consistent topological molecular alignment based on chemically reasonable matching of corresponding functional groups. These multiple feature tree models find application in ligand-based virtual screening to identify new lead structures for chemical optimization. Retrospective virtual screening with MTree models generated for angiotensin-converting enzyme and the alpha1a receptor on a large candidate database yielded enrichment factors up to 71 for the first 1% of the screened database. MTree models outperformed database searches using single feature trees in terms of hit rates and quality and additionally identified alternative molecular scaffolds not included in any of the query molecules. Furthermore, relevant molecular features, which are known to be important for affinity to the target, are identified by this new methodology.",

Specific superoxide formation was measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, reduction of cytochrome c and rhodamine-123 fluorescence. Free NO release was determined with an amperometric NO sensor. NADPH oxidase subunits expression was examined with Western Blot. In untreated EC the intracellular superoxide is -64.3 +/- 6.0% decreased compared to Ang II stimulated EC. Elevated extracellular superoxide formation was on a -43.0 +/- 1.7% lower level in untreated EC. The DHP Ca2+-channel agonist BayK8644 and ACE inhibitors captopril and ramiprilat led extracellular superoxide concentration to control level. Enalaprilat blocked extracellular superoxide, the DHP amlodipine and nisoldipine prevented intracellular increases only (n = 8-9, p < 0.05). Icatibant (HOE 140), a kinin-B2 receptor antagonist, attenuated antioxidant actions of all tested agents except of nisoldipine. Ang II-induced superoxide was elevated by the phorbolester PMA and blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine. Suppression of substance P-evoked NO release by Ang II (>70%, n = 6) was reversed by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, the DHP amlodipine and nisoldipine and the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat. Further, Ang II reduces Nox-4 expression by 34.5 +/- 4.9. Nox-2 expression was not regulated.

Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure (BPs, BPd and BPm respectively) was measured weekly in addition to the heart rate using rat-tail plethysmography. After 3 weeks, L-NAME significantly increased BPs, BPd and BPm. Captopril treatment reversed the increments in pressure back to normal values by the fourth week. ACE inhibition by captopril reverted the L-NAME-induced hypertrophy and inhibited the enzymatic indices of cardiac damage (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase) back to normal values. Furthermore, the NO synthesis inhibition produced renal damage as indicated by significant increase in creatinine. Captopril ameliorated the raised creatinine to normal.

Its most notable functions are the formation of angiotensin II and the degradation of bradykinin. In the current experiments, we found that exogenous ACE added to vascular smooth muscle cell culture strongly induces and upregulates the genes of bradykinin receptors B1 and B2. This transcriptional regulatory property of ACE was shown to be unrelated to its known enzymatic properties. Indeed, ACE at 3.75 microg/ml added in the culture medium of vascular smooth muscle cells was found to cause marked upregulation of the mRNA expression of the genes for the B1 and B2 receptors of bradykinin by 22- and 11-fold, respectively. This phenomenon was not altered by the addition of specific angiotensin II antagonists for the AT1 or AT2 receptors. Moreover, the ACE inhibitor captopril, which inhibited ACE enzymatic activity, did not block its effect at the bradykinin receptor gene transcription level. Expression of both receptor genes was completely abolished by actinomycin D. Furthermore, transcriptional upregulation was inhibited by curcumin, suggesting involvement of different transcriptional factors in this phenomenon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed increase in NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 protein binding for consensus sequences, between ACE-treated cells versus untreated cells. The data indicate a novel biological function of the ACE unrelated to its well-known enzymatic function as a peptidyl dipeptidase.",

    "805": "The association of low doses of perindopril and indapamide in a single pill has been developed to meet the criteria required for a fixed-dose combination to be used as first-line therapy. The experience accumulated so far has demonstrated a greater antihypertensive efficacy of this preparation compared with various monotherapies, but not at the expense of a worsening of tolerability. The perindopril/indapamide combination is particularly effective in lowering systolic and pulse blood pressure. Starting treatment with this fixed-dose combination improves arterial stiffness and allows a better regression of cardiac hypertrophy than angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition or beta-adrenoceptor blockade alone. In hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes, a greater reduction of urinary albumin excretion can be obtained with the perindopril/indapamide association compared with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administered as monotherapy.

Nowadays, it is possible to identify and intervene in high-risk populations even before the clinical diagnosis of DM2. The control of dietary patterns and increased physical activity is completely feasible, as well as the management of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Pharmacological interventions targeted at blocking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and sensitising to insulin have a role in the prevention of DM2 and CVD, and are avidly explored worldwide.

In rodents, the nocturnal rise and fall of the arylalkylamine N-ace-tyltransferase (AA-NAT) activity controls the rhythmic synthesis of melatonin. This rhythm is centered around the transcriptional regulation of the AA-NAT by two norepinephrine-inducible transcription factors, the activator CREB (Ca2+/cAMP-response element binding protein) and the inhibitor ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor). CREB is activated by phosphorylation, which is one of the fastest responses in pinealocytes upon adrenergic stimulation, occurring within minutes. ICER in turn accumulates only after several hours, a time gap resulting from the required de novo protein synthesis upon adrenergic stimulation. However, these molecular components of neuroendocrine signaling in the rodent pineal gland are supplemented by the impact of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and by translational and post-translational mechanisms. By molecular crosstalk, those different inputs on pinealocytes seem to fine-tune the shape of the melatonin signal, by interacting at various levels with the NE/cAMP/pCREB/ICER pathway. In addition, these alternate signaling routes may be important in acute \"emergency\" situations. Together, concerted signaling events in the rodent pineal gland help to generate a stable and reliable hormonal message of darkness for the body, that, however, can be altered rapidly upon sudden and unexpected \"error\" signals.",

These hypertensive rats had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as well as increases in cardiac fibrosis, cell proliferation, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression, and phosphorylation of Smad2 (P-Smad2), a signaling mediator of the effects of TGF-beta. The ACE inhibitor did not decrease either blood pressure or LVH; however, it significantly decreased LV collagen from 13.3+/-0.9 to 9.6+/-0.6 microg/mg dry wt (P<0.006), and this effect was blocked by the mAb (12.1+/-0.6; P<0.034, ACE inhibitor versus ACE inhibitor+mAb). In addition, analysis of interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen (picrosirius red staining) showed a very similar tendency. Likewise, the ACE inhibitor significantly decreased LV monocyte/macrophage infiltration, cell proliferation, and TGF-beta expression, and these effects were blocked by the mAb. Ang II increased Smad2 phosphorylation 3.2+/-0.9-fold; the ACE inhibitor lowered this to 0.6+/-0.1-fold (P<0.001), and the mAb blocked this decrease to 2.1+/-0.3 (P<0.001, ACE inhibitor versus ACE inhibitor+mAb). Similar findings were seen when the ACE inhibitor was replaced by Ac-SDKP.",

Conventional pharmacologic therapy for congestive heart failure, such as diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers, are routinely used and are quite effective. For those patients who remain refractory to conventional pharmacologic therapy, cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are viable options.", 
    "833": "Mortality rates in peripartum cardiomyopathy have decreased, and this is most likely related to advances over the past 5 yrs in medical therapy for heart failure. Aggressive use of implantable defibrillators has significantly reduced the risk of sudden death in these patients. For >50% of peripartum cardiomyopathy patients, left ventricular function normalizes with pharmacologic therapy. However, subsequent pregnancies almost always are associated with recurrence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "834": "To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cardioprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we evaluated whether the effect of quinapril involved in bradykinin-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and oxidative stress-lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) pathway. Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive (DS) rats were fed a diet containing 8% NaCl and treated with one of the following drug combinations for 5 weeks, from 6 weeks of age to left ventricular hypertrophy stage (11 weeks): vehicle; quinapril; quinapril plus the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist FR172357; the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin; or quinapril plus apocynin. eNOS expression, which was decreased in hypertrophy stage, was significantly increased by quinapril and/or apocynin, but not by quinapril plus FR172357. Upregulated expression of NAD(P)H oxidase p22phox, p47phox, gp91phox and LOX-1 was significantly decreased by quinapril to a similar degree as after treatment with apocynin, but not by quinapril plus FR172357. Quinapril and/or apocynin treatment effectively ameliorated left ventricular weight and vascular changes such as increase in medial thickness and perivascular fibrosis and suppressed expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, type I collagen and fibronectin mRNA, but not that of quinapril plus FR172357. These results suggest that the ACE inhibitor quinapril may have cardioprotective effects in this model of hypertension mediated at least in part through effects on the bradykinin-eNOS and oxidative stress-LOX-1 pathway.", 
    "835": "Hypertension has a negative impact on long-term outcomes after renal transplantation. We investigated the effect of a recent decline in blood pressure among renal transplant patients in the Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS) database on long-term graft and patient survival. CTS data were used to evaluate transplant outcomes in relation to recipient systolic blood pressure (SBP) for 24,404 first cadaver kidney recipients transplanted between 1987 and 2000. Patients whose SBP was > 140 mmHg at 1 year posttransplantation but controlled to < or = 140 mmHg by 3 years had significantly improved long-term graft outcome compared with patients with sustained high SBP to 3 years (RR 0.79; CI 0.73-0.86; p < 0.001). Additional examination at 5 years showed that SBP lowering after year 3 was associated with improved 10-year graft survival (RR 0.83; CI 0.72-0.96; p = 0.01), whereas even a temporary increase in SBP at 3 years was associated with worse survival (RR 1.37; CI 1.19-1.58; p < 0.001). Changes in SBP were paralleled by changes in the incidence of cardiovascular death among recipients younger than 50 but not in older recipients. Lowering SBP, even after several years of posttransplantation hypertension, is associated with improved graft and patient survival in renal allograft recipients.", 
    "836": "Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in diabetes. Over the past decade a number of studies have addressed the underlying mechanisms. Derangements of endothelial function, also referred to as endothelial dysfunction, have emerged to be the crucial early step in the development of atherosclerosis and are also involved in plaque progression and clinical emergence. Endothelial dysfunction is a condition of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and most important of \"endothelial activation\", characterized by a proinflammatory, proliferative, and procoagulatory milieu that promotes initiation and complications of atherogenesis. A synergistic cross-talk among the conventional cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes contributes to disruption of endothelial integrity and accelerated atherosclerosis. This review will focus on the multifactorial nature of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, the relationship between endothelial dysfunction, conventional cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis, and the therapeutic options to improve endothelial function.", 
    "837": "Proteinuria is associated with macrophage-dependent interstitial fibrosis (IF). Osteopontin (OPN), a macrophage chemoattractant, may be involved in the transition of proteinuria to IF but protective properties have also been reported. To elucidate whether OPN may be involved in the proteinuria-induced cascade of tubulointerstitial damage, renal expression of OPN was studied during the development of proteinuria-induced renal damage and during anti-proteinuric intervention with ACE inhibition (ACEi). First, the temporal relationships between proteinuria, interstitial OPN induction, and IF in adriamycin nephrosis (AN), a model of chronic proteinuria-induced renal damage, were studied. Second, the effect of anti-proteinuric treatment on OPN expression was investigated. The time course of OPN induction and markers of renal damage was studied in rats with unilateral AN at 6-week intervals until week 30. In a second study, a renal biopsy was taken 6 weeks after induction of bilateral AN; subsequently, rats were treated with ACEi until termination (week 12). In unilateral AN, proteinuria developed gradually and stabilized at week 10. In proteinuric kidneys, OPN expression was induced from week 12 onwards. Simultaneously, a progressive increase in interstitial macrophages, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen type III, and focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) was observed. In bilateral AN, ACEi reduced proteinuria and OPN protein and stabilized fibrosis. In untreated animals, OPN mRNA increased, with stable OPN protein and fibrosis and increased FGS. Thus, in AN, development of proteinuria is followed by up-regulation of OPN along with markers of renal damage. The up-regulation of OPN is reversible by anti-proteinuric treatment without a corresponding reduction in fibrosis. Whereas these data are consistent with a role for OPN in the cascade of transition from proteinuria to fibrosis, intervention with ACEi showed that reduction of OPN does not attenuate established fibrosis.", 
    "838": "Aldosterone has been implicated as a potential mediator of cardiac and vascular damage in a variety of disorders. This study examined the role of aldosterone and its interplay with the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of hypertension. To this end, the effects of the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on cardiovascular mass, myocardial collagen, and coronary circulation were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "839": "Male, 22-week-old rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (12 in each). The control group received no treatment, the second group was given eplerenone (100 mg/kg/day), the third received lisinopril (3 mg/kg/day), and the fourth was given eplerenone and lisinopril. After 12 weeks of respective treatments, systemic and regional hemodynamics and cardiovascular mass indexes were measured in conscious instrumented rats.", 
    "840": "Eplerenone decreased arterial pressure but did not affect left ventricular mass or hydroxyproline concentration (an estimate of collagen). It did, however, reduce minimal coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary flow reserve. Lisinopril decreased arterial pressure and ventricular mass but did not affect regional hemodynamics. The combination therapy produced synergistic effects.", 
    "841": "Aldosterone antagonism improved coronary and systemic hemodynamics in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats but did not affect cardiovascular mass indexes. The finding that lisinopril and eplerenone decreased arterial pressure to the same extent but had different cardiovascular effects suggested that these effects might be pressure independent.", 
    "842": "Current practice guidelines suggest routine use of several effective cardiac medications in hospital survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The objectives of our population-based study were to describe decade-long trends (1990-2001) in the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, and combinations thereof, in patients discharged from all metropolitan Worcester (Mass) hospitals after AMI.", 
    "843": "The study sample consisted of 5965 adult men and women of all ages discharged after AMI from all greater Worcester hospitals in 7 annual periods between 1990 and 2001.", 
    "844": "Although consistent increases in the use of each of the effective cardiac medications examined were observed over time, particularly marked relative increases in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (168% relative increase) and lipid-lowering agents (1086% relative increase) were noted. Use of combinations of effective cardiac medications also increased substantially over time. Between 1990 and 2001, the percentage of hospital survivors treated with > or =3 cardiac medications increased from 12.9% to 74.0%. Advancing age, female sex, history of angina, hypertension, or heart failure during hospitalization, presence of an initial non-Q wave MI, and development of atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization were independently associated with underuse of combination medical therapy.", 
    "845": "The present results suggest considerable improvements over the last decade in the medical management of patients hospitalized with AMI. Educational efforts, however, aimed at clinicians and designed to improve use of these therapies, as well as efforts to simplify medication regimens and enhance rates of adherence, remain warranted.", 
    "846": "To evaluate an intervention to improve the quality of care of patients with heart failure in managed Medicare and Medicaid plans in North Carolina.", 
    "847": "Utilization of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BB) in heart failure (HF) patients remains suboptimal despite evidence-based guidelines supporting their use.", 
    "848": "Managed care plans identified adult patients with HF during 2000 (preintervention) and from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002 (postintervention). Outpatient medical records were reviewed to obtain data regarding type of heart failure, demographics, comorbidities, and therapies. The intervention consisted of guideline summary dissemination, performance audit with feedback, patient-specific chart reminders, and patient activation mailings.", 
    "849": "We sampled 1613 patients from 5 plans during the preintervention period and 1528 patients during the postintervention period. Assessment of left ventricular function (LVF) increased from 88.2% to 92.5% of patients (P < .0001). Among patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, there was no substantive change in treatment with ACE-I or vasodilators, whereas, appropriate treatment with BB increased from 48.3% (with another 11.9% with documented contraindications) to 67.9% (with another 7.5% with documented contraindications). The quality gap decreased from 39.8% to 24.6% (P < .0001).", 
    "850": "LVF assessment improved despite high preintervention rates. Treatment rates with ACE-I and vasodilators remained high, but did not improve. Treatment rates with BB improved substantially translating into a significant public health benefit. Health-care payers should consider development of financial incentives to encourage collaborative quality improvement programs.", 
    "851": "The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) have a better prognosis when systolic function is preserved as compared with those with depressed systolic function.", 
    "852": "Data from consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department at Brigham and Women's Hospital from January 1997 to December 2002 who had a diagnosis of AF and HF and a measure of ejection fraction (EF) were reviewed. Vital status was determined from the Social Security Death Index.", 
    "853": "Of 478 patients (mean age 74 +/- 13 years; 47% women), EF was preserved (> 50%) in 46%. Those with preserved left ventricular (LV) function were older (76 vs 72 years, P < .0020), included more women (62 vs 35%, P < .0001), more likely to have a history of hypertension and pulmonary disease and less likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction. At 5 years, mortality was similar between the preserved and depressed EF groups (50% vs 48%, P = .74). In multivariable analysis, age > 75 years, history of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, aortic valve disease, serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, and serum sodium < 130 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality. Therapy with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker were associated with lower mortality.", 
    "854": "Patients who present to the emergency department with AF, HF, and preserved LVEF have a similarly high mortality as compared with those with depressed LVEF. Further study is needed to assess the impact of therapies and clarify the reasons for the poor prognosis.", 
    "855": "Ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. ELITE II study showed that losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, shows a survival benefit to the same degree as captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, does in patients with heart failure. However, recent OPTIMAAL study showed that clinical outcomes after losartan are not superior to those after captopril in patients with AMI. We examined the effect of losartan on ventricular remodeling after AMI comparatively with that of enalapril.", 
    "856": "We enrolled 203 consecutive patients with AMI (mean age 62 +/- 11 years). All patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and were randomly assigned to losartan (25-50 mg, n = 101) or enalapril (2.5-10 mg, n = 102) treatment. Biplane left ventriculography was performed just after primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (acute phase) and 6 months after the onset of AMI.", 
    "857": "Any of the maximal creatine kinase level, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, and ejection fraction measured at acute phase was not different between losartan and enalapril groups. However, changes in left ventricular end-diastolic index (18 +/- 25 vs 8 +/- 24 mL/m2) and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (10 +/- 20 vs 2 +/- 18 mL/m2) from acute phase to 6 months were significantly greater in losartan than in enalapril group. Change in left ventricular ejection fraction (0.2% +/- 10.3% vs 3.4% +/- 11.6%) from acute phase to 6 months was significantly smaller in losartan than in enalapril group. The plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide at 6 months was significantly higher in losartan than in enalapril group (all P < .05).", 
    "858": "These indicate that enalapril suppresses ventricular remodeling after AMI more effectively than losartan."
