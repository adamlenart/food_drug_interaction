It is highly protein bound with a small volume of distribution and a nine-hour half-life. Candesartan is one of two angiotensin receptor blockers approved for use in heart failure. MEDLINE was searched using OVID and PubMed to evaluate the evidence for using candesartan in patients with heart failure. Pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic evaluations, as well as clinical trials, were selected and are presented in this review. Clinical evidence supports the indication for use in systolic heart failure. Results for use in patients with diastolic heart failure were non-significant. Candesartan was well tolerated in the trials, with hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension being the most common adverse events. Use of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors needs further study; however, candesartan appears to provide added benefit in this setting. Candesartan is a safe and effective option for patients with systolic heart failure. Data regarding other angiotensin receptor blockers is underway.", 
    "1": "Nephrotoxicity is the most common and clinically significant adverse effect of calcineurin inhibitors. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity is manifested by both acute azotemia and chronic progressive renal disease and tubular zdysfunction. An elevation in the plasma potassium concentration due to reduced efficiency of urinary potassium excretion is common in cyclosporine-treated patients; it may be severe and potentially life-threatening with concurrent administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, which diminishes aldosterone release. Tubular injury induced by cyclosporine can also impair acid excretion. This may be presented as a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis associated with decreased aldosterone activity and suppression of ammonium excretion by hyperkalemia. Some patients treated with cyclosporine develop hypophosphatemia due to urinary phosphate wasting. Renal magnesium wasting is also common presumably due to drug effects on magnesium reabsorption. Hypomagnesemia has also been implicated as a contributor to the nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus are associated with hypercalciuria. Attention must be paid to drug dose, side effects, and drug interactions to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy.", 
    "2": "A difference in movement has been hypothesized to exist between Caenorhabditis elegans strains lacking one of two main genes for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), ace-1(+) and ace-2(+). We explored the precision of movement as an endpoint by measuring and comparing the movements of these strains (VC505 and GG202, respectively) and of N2 (wild-type). The order of movement of the strains is: N2 > VC505 > GG202; therefore, loss of the ace-2(+) gene is more detrimental to movement. We then compared the sensitivities of the three strains to an AChE inhibitor (propoxur) by generating movement-concentration curves, identifying effective concentrations that decreased movement by 50% (EC(50)), and comparing them. EC(50) show an order of: N2 approximately GG202 < VC505. Therefore, the enzymes encoded by ace-1(+) were more susceptible to propoxur than those of ace-2(+), suggesting that the innate difference in the AChE classes' contributions to movement will not always determine the strain sensitivity. Measuring movement was sufficiently precise to record differences following genetic manipulation and further chemical exposure.", 
    "3": "Microalbuminuria is a strong, consistent and independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease in patients with diabetes and/or hypertension and in the general population. Several randomized trials have shown the efficacy of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) to prevent cardiovascular events and the progression of kidney disease. These 2 classes of drugs are equally effective for renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy, but only ACEIs have been found to significantly impact the risk of all-cause mortality, predominantly cardiovascular, in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Studies on the cardiorenal efficacy of combined therapy with ACEIs and ARBs in individuals with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria and other cardiovascular risk factors have been inconclusive. The Long-term Impact of RAS Inhibition on Cardiorenal Outcomes (LIRICO) study aims to address existing questions in this setting. This is a phase III, randomized, comparative, pragmatic trial with prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) design. It will evaluate the comparative efficacy of combined therapy with ACEIs and ARBs versus monotherapy with either ACEIs or ARBs in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes in microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric individuals at cardiorenal risk. The study will enroll 2,100 patients, selected in a network of internal medicine, diabetology or nephrology outpatient clinics. Patients will be randomly allocated to ACEIs, ARBs or their combination. The study has been approved and funded by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (A.I.F.A.) within the 2005 funding plan for independent research on drugs.",

GA was assessed as usual (prescribing \"yes\" or \"no\"), through evaluation of target dosing, while adjusting for potential clinical contraindications, and through a modified Guideline Adherence Indicator-3 (mGAI-3), which assesses three relevant groups of substances according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class: ACE-Inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers (BB) and aldosterone-antagonists (AA).",

    "9": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) may cause an increase in the inflammatory status and oxidative stress as well as sympathetic nervous system overactivity, even in the absence of any other organic heart disease. We investigated the effect of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i), on indexes of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in normotensive patients with type 2 DM. We also examined the effect of the drug on the disturbances of left ventricular myocardial adrenergic innervation that may be seen in these patients. We studied 62 normotensive patients with type 2 DM, who were randomized to receive perindopril (n=32) or placebo (n=30). At the start of the study and after 6 months' therapy blood samples were taken to evaluate total peroxides (TP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the patients underwent a (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy study. ACE-i caused a significant reduction in levels of cytokines and TP (P<0.001 for IL-6 and TNF-alpha, P=0.001 for TP). There was also a reduction in total defect score (P<0.001) and the heart to mediastinum ratio at 10 min and 4 h was improved (P<0.001 for both). No significant alterations were observed in the placebo group. Our data indicate that the addition of ACE-i to the medication of normotensive diabetic type 2 patients may improve the disturbed myocardial adrenergic innervation, the systemic inflammatory status and oxidative stress. Our findings indicate the cardioprotective action of ACE-i and suggest that earlier treatment might be appropriate in those patients.", 
    "10": "Using type 1a angiotensin receptor (AT1a) receptor-deficient (Agtr1a-/-) mice and in vivo autoradiography, we tested the hypothesis that intracellular uptake of ANG II in the kidney and adrenal glands is primarily mediated by AT1a receptors and that the response is regulated by prevailing endogenous ANG II. After pretreatment of wild-type (Agtr1a+/+) and Agtr1a-/- mice (n = 6-9 each group) with or without captopril (25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or losartan (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 2 wk, [125I]Val5-ANG II was infused for 60 min. Intracellular uptake of [125I]Val5-ANG II was determined by quantitative in vivo autoradiography after washout of circulating [125I]Val5-ANG II. Basal intracellular ANG II levels were 65% lower in the kidney (P < 0.001), but plasma ANG II levels were threefold higher, in Agtr1a-/- than wild-type mice (P < 0.01). Although plasma [125I]Val5-ANG II levels were similar, urinary excretion of [125I]Val5-ANG II was fourfold higher in Agtr1a-/- mice (P < 0.001). By contrast, intracellular [125I]Val5-ANG II levels were approximately 80% lower in the kidney and adrenal glands of Agtr1a-/- mice (P < 0.01). Captopril decreased endogenous plasma and renal ANG II levels (P < 0.01) but increased intracellular uptake of [125I]Val5-ANG II in the kidney and adrenal glands of wild-type and Agtr1a-/- mice (P < 0.01). Losartan largely blocked renal and adrenal uptake of [125I]Val5-ANG II in wild-type and Agtr1a-/- mice. Thus 80% of intracellular ANG II uptake in the kidney and adrenal glands is mediated by AT1a receptors, whereas AT1b receptor- and other non-receptor-mediated mechanisms account for 20% of the response. Our results suggest that AT1a receptor-mediated uptake of extracellular ANG II may play a physiological role in the kidney and adrenal glands.", 
    "11": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is frequently activated in the patients with chronic liver diseases, and recent studies have shown that RAS plays a pivotal role in the progression of chronic liver diseases, i.e., liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Angiotensin-II (AT-II) reportedly stimulates contractility and proliferation of the activated hepatic stellate cells, and increases the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-betabeta expression through angiotensin type-I receptors (AT1-R). Many studies have demonstrated that the clinically used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and AT1-R blockers (ARB) significantly attenuated the liver fibrosis development in the experimental studies and clinical practice. AT-II also strongly promotes neovascularization, which plays a pivotal role in tumor development. AT-II induces a potent angiogenic factor; namely, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It has been reported that ACE-I significantly attenuated the experimental HCC growth and hepatocarcinogenesis along with suppression of neovascularization. The VEGF expression in the tumor was suppressed by ACE-I, too. The combined treatment of ACE-I with other clinically used agents, such as interferon, imatinib mesylate, and vitamin K, shows more potent inhibitory effects on the development of liver fibrosis and HCC. Since RAS inhibitors are widely used in the clinical practice without serious side effects, they may represent a potential new therapeutic strategy against the progression of chronic liver diseases.", 
    "12": "The clinical syndrome of chronic stable angina is an age-related condition that is one common manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD). The presence of angina significantly affects quality of life when patients must limit their activities of daily living in an effort to prevent the occurrence of anginal attacks. In addition, patients are at risk for significant complications of CAD such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and death. Therefore, treatment should focus not only on relief of symptoms and improvements in quality of life, but also on preventing disease progression and reducing the risk of complications from CAD. All patients should be instructed on the appropriate use of sublingual nitroglycerin for the immediate treatment of anginal episodes. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrate therapy, and ranolazine can prevent anginal symptoms. In addition, aggressive risk factor management, healthy lifestyle changes, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors all should be used to prevent disease progression and occurrence of myocardial infarction or death. Many patients will be candidates for revascularization of the myocardium with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting for relief of symptoms as well as improvement in prognosis. Even after revascularization, patients may still require antianginal drug therapy. All patients undergoing revascularization should be guided to make appropriate lifestyle changes and to make concerted efforts to manage risk factors for CAD.",

The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality, first HF hospitalization, and improvement of quality of life at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included mortality, hospitalizations, and change in quality of life. Prospective Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used for differences between FDC I/H and placebo groups and retrospective analyses were conducted within FDC I/H-treated and placebo groups.",

Within the placebo-treated group, beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs were efficacious in improving survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33; p<0.0001 for [beta]-blocker use and HR 0.39; p=0.01 for ACE inhibitor and/or ARB use). However, within the FDC I/H-treated group, use of beta-blockers, but not ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs, provided additional significant benefit for survival (HR 0.44; p=0.029 and HR 0.60; p=0.34, respectively), event-free survival (HR 0.62; p=0.034 and HR 0.72; p=0.29, respectively) and the composite score of death, HF hospitalization and change in quality of life (p=0.016 and p=0.13, respectively).",

The aims of present study are to investigate the relationship between systemic RAS and insulin resistance in 82 patients with EHT and compare the impact of RAS to insulin resistance with 10 renovascular hypertension (RVHT) patients who have a highly activated systemic RAS. From patients who were admitted to our hospital, patients with overt diabetes and hypertensives who had secondary HT except RVHT or chronic renal failure were excluded. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was used as an indicator of systemic RAS activity. HOMA-R as an index of insulin resistance and sum of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) during glucose tolerance test (sigmaIRI) and IRI at 120 minutes (IRI120) were used as indices of hyperinsulinemia. In the EHT patients, circulating PRA showed an independent relationship with IRI120 and sigmaIRI after adjusting confounding factors (IRI120: t = 2.70, p = 0.01, sigmaIRI: t = 3.05, p < 0.001). Excluding patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARBs), the relationship remained in univariate linear regression; after adjustment for confounding factors, PRA showed a tendency to be correlated with sigmaIRI. However, there was no significant relationship between PRA and indices of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in patients with RVHT. In conclusion, the systemic RAS may modulate insulin sensitivity in EHT patients.",

Recent results from epidemiological studies and clinical trials have demonstrated its role as modifiable risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure and lipid lowering are associated with significant reductions in recurrent strokes as well as in other vascular events in transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke patients. The PROGRESS and MOSES trials suggest that diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could confer additional benefits in stroke patients, and the SPARCL study did so for statins. These drugs are not only efficacious in the reduction of stroke recurrences, but also in other cardiovascular events.",

PEMs will be distributed with informed, a quarterly evidence-based synopsis of current clinical information produced by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada, and will be sent to all eligible general and family practitioners in Ontario. There will be three replicates of the trial, with three different educational messages, each aimed at narrowing a specific evidence-practice gap as follows: 1) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hypertension treatment, and cholesterol lowering agents for diabetes; 2) retinal screening for diabetes; and 3) diuretics for hypertension.For each of the three replicates there will be three intervention groups. The first group will receive informed with an attached postcard-sized, short, directive \"outsert.\" The second intervention group will receive informed with a two-page explanatory \"insert\" on the same topic. The third intervention group will receive informed, with both the above-mentioned outsert and insert. The control group will receive informed only, without either an outsert or insert.Routinely collected physician billing, prescription, and hospital data found in Ontario's administrative databases will be used to monitor pre-defined prescribing changes relevant and specific to each replicate, following delivery of the educational messages. Multi-level modeling will be used to study patterns in physician-prescribing quality over four quarters, before and after each of the three interventions. Subgroup analyses will be performed to assess the association between the characteristics of the physician's place of practice and target behaviours.A further analysis of the immediate and delayed impacts of the PEMs will be performed using time-series analysis and interventional, auto-regressive, integrated moving average modeling.",

In our trial we included 297 patients, aged 54.65+/-9.6 years, with treated or untreated hypertension and with high risk of cardiac events, in an opened trial of therapy based on lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Upon the examination by physicians, patients were divided into three groups in accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension. Patients from five European countries were followed up for a period of 12 weeks. Duration of treatment was 12 weeks. We adjusted daily doses of lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide after every clinical examination and recorded adverse effects of drugs. After 12 weeks of treatment, 288 patients (96%) were evaluated for efficacy, tolerability and safety. In almost 81.5% patients with mild, moderate and severe hypertension, we recorded a reduction in blood pressure to approximately normal values SBP and DBP (140/90 mmHg). Drug-related side-effects occurred in 11 patients (3.66%). The most commonly reported adverse effects associated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide were cough (5) and dry mouth (5). This research has proved good efficacy of fixed combination lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide with more than 97% patients. Based on subjective estimation by patients: this drug improved quality of life in all cases.",

The \"correct\" dose, based on drug company guidelines in package inserts, may not be correct for many patients. Tablet splitting or dividing has been an accepted practice for many years as a means of obtaining the prescribed dose of medication. As model tablets for this investigation, two batches of lisinopril- hydrochlorothiazide scored tablets labeled to contain 20/12.5 mg were used. The aim of this study was to establish possible influence of tablet splitting on content uniformity of lisinopril/hydrochlorthiazide tablets. Determination of the content uniformity of lisinopril and hydrochlorthiazide in our batches, was carried out by HPLC method. The results of content uniformity studies for halves of tablets containing combination of lisinopril-hydrochlorthiazide (supposed to contain 50% of stated 20/12.5 mg in the whole tablet) were: 49.60 +/-3.29% and 49.29+/-0.60 % (lisinopril); 50.33+/-3.50% and 50.69+/-1.95% (hydrochlorthiazide) for batch I and II, respectively. We can conclude that the results obtained in this study support an option of tablet splitting, which is very important for obtaining the required dosage when a dosage form of the required strength is unavailable, and for better individualization of the therapy.",

Under standard pharmacotherapy (beta-receptor anatgonist, calcium chanel antagonist, and diuretic) aggregability of RBC in hypertensive patients was significantly increased in spite of the treatment. However, in patients receiving additionally ACE-I spontaneous aggregation of RBC was attenuated. We found that antihypertensive therapy consisting of ACE-I along with statin improved erythrocyte aggregation nearly to the level of normotensive and normocholesterolemic patients. Interestingly, this improvement of blood rheology was observed prior to statin-induced lowering of total cholesterol.",

    "31": "Hypertensive patients with hepatic diseases given enalapril exhibited lowering of maximal concentration (C(max)) of enalaprilate and prolongation of time of its reaching (T(max)) compared to ulcer patients. MRT and AUC were increased in hepatic cirrhosis patients treated with enalapril and metoprolol. Metoprolol C(max) in this group of patients was higher than in the controls. Blood pressure monitoring showed that enalapril therapy was more effective in ulcer patients vs patients with liver diseases. Metoprolol treatment of hypertensive patients with hepatic cirrhosis resulted in development of bradycardia.",

Of these, 13,812 patients were followed up and included in the analysis: 10,626 (77%) men and 3,186 (23%) women. Diagnosis at the time of registration was acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for 2,955 patients, old myocardial infarction for 3,913 patients and unstable angina pectoris for 2,049 patients. Patients were followed up for an average of 2.7 years. At the start of the follow-up, 37.4% of the patients were prescribed statins, 50.2% calcium-channel blockers (CCB), 31.6% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), 13.5% angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and 60.2% nitrates. Univariate Cox regression model analysis showed that the hazard ratio (HR) of statins was 0.780 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.710-0.856; p<0.001); fibrates, 0.580 (95%CI, 0.425-0.790; p=0.001); CCB, 1.067 (95%CI, 0.976-1.166; p=0.153); ACEI, 1.062 (95%CI, 0.968-1.166; p=0.202); ARB, 1.036 (95%CI, 0.914-1.174; p=0.581); nitrates, 1.147 (95%CI, 1.043-1.260; p=0.005).

    "37": "Changes in the levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have been found in brains of schizophrenia patients, suggesting a possible involvement of angiotensin in the illness. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating and is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. In a previous study, a reduction of ACE activity, either in ACE knockout mice or after ACE inhibitor treatment, markedly inhibited the disruption of PPI caused by the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine. ACE is not specific for the angiotensin system and, therefore, in the present study we assessed pharmacological regulation of PPI in two other, more specific genetic mouse models of altered angiotensin activity. We used renin-enhancer knockout (REKO) mice, which display reduced renin activity, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-AT1A mice, which selectively over-express angiotensin AT1A receptors in the brain. Treatment of these mice with apomorphine, the dopamine releaser, amphetamine or the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, significantly disrupted PPI. There was, however, no difference in these effects between the genotypes. These data suggest that genetically induced changes in the activity of the angiotensin system do not alter regulation of PPI in mice. Our previous results on the effects of reduced ACE activity could be explained by mechanisms other than angiotensin, such as effects on enkephalin or bradykinin metabolism.", 
    "38": "The mammalian proton-coupled peptide transporter PepT1 is the major route of uptake for dietary nitrogen, as well as the oral absorption of a number of drugs, including beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Here we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate further the role of conserved charged residues in transmembrane domains. Mutation of rabbit PepT1 arginine282 (R282, transmembrane domain 7) to a positive (R282K) or physiologically titratable residue (R282H), resulted in a transporter with wild-type characteristics when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neutral (R282A, R282Q) or negatively charged (R282D, R282E) substitutions gave a transporter that was not stimulated by external acidification (reducing pH(out) from 7.4 to 5.5) but transported at the same rate as the wild-type maximal rate (pH(out) 5.5); however, only the R282E mutation was unable to concentrate substrate above the extracellular level. All of the R282 mutants showed trans-stimulation of efflux comparable to the wild-type, except R282E-PepT1 which was faster. A conserved negatively charged residue, aspartate341 (D341) in transmembrane domain 8 was implicated in forming a charge pair with R282, as R282E/D341R- and R282D/D341R-PepT1 had wild-type transporter characteristics. Despite their differences in ability to accumulate substrate, both R282E- and R282D-PepT1 showed an increased charge:peptide stoichiometry over the wild-type 1:1 ratio for the neutral dipeptide Gly-l-Gln, measured using two-electrode voltage clamp. This extra charge movement was linked to substrate transport, as 4-aminobenzoic acid, which binds but is not translocated, did not induce membrane potential depolarisation in R282E-expressing oocytes. A model is proposed for the substrate binding/translocation process in PepT1.",

After more than 2 years of unremitting nephrosis, she began therapy with the herb Astragalus membranaceus, used by traditional Chinese physicians to treat various immune disorders, including glomerulonephritis. After institution of Astragalus at a dose of 15 g/d, there was a marked decrease in proteinuria.

However, large inter-individual variation in antiproteinuric response to ACE inhibitors exists. In this study, we explored the mechanism of therapeutic resistance to an ACE inhibitor in the rat 5/6 nephrectomy model. At week 6 after 5/6 nephrectomy, treatment with lisinopril was initiated for 6 weeks. Proteinuria and blood pressure were evaluated weekly. At the end of the experiment, rats were divided into tertiles according to their antiproteinuric response: (1) responders (n=9), (2) intermediate responders (n=8) and (3) non-responders to ACE inhibitor therapy (n=9). At the start of treatment, proteinuria had progressively increased to 154 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 123-185) mg/24 h in the entire cohort, with comparable proteinuria and blood pressure in all groups. Following treatment with ACE inhibitor, proteinuria was significantly lower in the responders (68, CI: 46-89 mg/24 h) compared to the non-responders (251, CI: 83-420) mg/24 h). Similarly, blood pressure was reduced in the responders, but unaffected in the non-responders. At autopsy, renal ACE activity and renal ACE expression were significantly lower in the responders compared to the non-responders. Although lisinopril intake was comparable in all animals, urinary drug excretion was increased in the non-responders, demonstrating increased drug clearance. Average urinary lisinopril excretion was correlated with antiproteinuric response (R(2)=0.32, P=0.003). In conclusion, both pharmacodynamic and -kinetic factors account for the non-response to lisinopril. Whether these can be overcome simply by increasing drug dosage in non-responders should be investigated.",

    "68": "Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Most of the existing therapeutic strategies used to treat ischemic heart disease aim at either increasing the oxygen supply to the heart (thrombolysis, revascularization, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and antiplatelet therapy) or decreasing the oxygen demand of the heart (beta-blockers and nitrates). Despite the fact that a compromised energy supply to the heart muscle is central to the pathology of ischemic heart disease, therapeutic approaches that focus on altering cardiac energy metabolism have not seen major clinical use. Therapeutic strategies in which the efficiency of oxygen utilization by the heart is enhanced could theoretically benefit the ischemic heart, and could have an additive benefit to existing therapeutic strategies. The energy supply for the heart (in the form of ATP) is normally provided by the balanced metabolism of both fatty acids (major part) and carbohydrates (minor part) oxidation. During reperfusion, this balance is broken by the dramatic enhancement of fatty acid oxidation and attenuation of carbohydrate oxidation, which results in intracellular H(+) accumulation and Ca(2+) overload. This article reviews the alterations in cardiac energy metabolism that occur in the ischemic heart, and discusses the existing and proposed pharmacologic therapies to optimize the balance of fatty acids and carbohydrate oxidation for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases.",

This review describes the substudies and subpopulation analyses carried out within the EUROPA population, concluding that the benefits of perindopril extend to all stable CAD patients, even revascularized patients or those with preserved left ventricular function. Data on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CAD indicate direct vascular protection with perindopril.

We did this for reports of spironolactone-associated hyperkalaemia (where spironolactone was listed as a suspect drug) and according to whether the reports listed an ACE inhibitor as a co-suspect or concomitant medication. A further statistical analysis of the overall reporting of spironolactone (suspect drug)-associated hyperkalaemia was also performed. We also performed 3-dimensional (3-D; drug-drug-event) disproportionality analyses using a DMA known as the multi-item gamma-Poisson shrinker, which allows the calculation and display of a 3-D disproportionality metric known as the 'interaction signal score' (INTSS). This metric is a measure of the strength of a higher order reporting relationship of a triplet (i.e. drug-drug-event) association above and beyond what would be expected from the largest disproportionalities associated with the individual 2-way associations.",

When examining the reporting time trends according to the presence or absence of an ACE inhibitor, the change point seemed to be mostly attributable to an increase in the number of spironolactone (suspect drug)-associated hyperkalaemia reports with ACE inhibitors listed as a co-suspect drug. No obvious change points in INTSSs for spironolactone-ACE inhibitor-hyperkalaemia reports were observed.", 
    "74": "Although we could not pinpoint the relative contribution of many possible artifacts in the reporting process, as well as increased drug exposure, increased adverse event incidence and/or a change in patient monitoring practices, to our findings, we observed a notable change in reporting frequency of spironolactone-associated hyperkalaemia in temporal proximity to the publication of RALES. Evidence of this was provided by a trend analysis depicted in a simple graph that was supported by statistical analysis. The observed trend was in large part due to increased reporting of spironolactone-associated hyperkalaemia with reported co-medication with ACE inhibitors.",

There is increasing evidence that RAS inhibition may provide end-organ protection independent of BP lowering. Two drug classes directly target angiotensin II through complementary mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to the active peptide angiotensin II and increase the availability of bradykinin. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively antagonize angiotensin II at AT 1 receptors and may also increase activation of the AT 2 receptor and modulate the effects of angiotensin II breakdown products.",

    "79": "Eleven clinical trials each were identified that evaluated the effect of ACE-inhibitor and ARB monotherapy on end-organ protection. Five trials were identified that evaluated the effects of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB compared with treatment with either agent alone in different patient populations using different end points. In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, combination ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy resulted in better BP control than either agent alone (mean difference, 11.2 mm Hg systolic [P = 0.002], 5.9 mm Hg diastolic [P = 0.003]), as well as greater reductions in microalbuminuria (mean difference in albumin:creatinine ratio, 34%; P = 0.04). Compared with monotherapy, dual RAS inhibition reduced the occurrence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease by 60% to 62% in patients with nondiabetic renal disease (P = 0.018 vs ACE inhibitor alone; P = 0.016 vs ARB alone). A recently published study reported a nonsignificant benefit for combination therapy over monotherapy only in a subset of hypertensive patients with high levels of microalbuminuria at baseline (58.1% vs 43.4% reduction, respectively). In patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction </=40%, the relative risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 15% in those who received an ARB added to an ACE inhibitor compared with those who received placebo added to an ACE inhibitor (P = 0.011). Another study found no benefit on mortality or cardiovascular end points with combination therapy compared with ACE-inhibitor monotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating dual RAS blockade in patients at high risk for end-organ damage, as well as the most effective doses for use in combination regimens.", 
    "80": "There is accumulating evidence that antihypertensive regimens that inhibit the RAS may provide incremental end-organ protection. Combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs to provide more extensive RAS inhibition may provide greater antihypertensive efficacy and end-organ protection than use of either class alone.

Optimal medical therapy was defined as the use of all indicated medications. Follow-up data at 1 year were collected by telephone interview. We performed hierarchical logistic regression to identify patient characteristics and care patterns associated with optimal medical treatment and to examine its relationship with 1-year mortality.",

Advanced age, female sex, prior heart failure, renal dysfunction, and coronary bypass surgery during hospitalization were negative independent predictors of optimal medical therapy. Conversely, enrollment in ACS II Registry, history of dyslipidemia, presence of ST elevation and abnormal cardiac biomarker, previous myocardial infarction, and previous coronary revascularization were independently associated with the use of combination therapy. After adjusting for other validated prognosticators, patients receiving optimal medical therapy had significantly lower 1-year mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.81, P = .003) compared with those given 0 or 1 drug at discharge.

    "90": "Insulin resistance (IR) is defined as a reduced responsiveness of peripheral tissues to the effects of the hormone, referring to abated ability of insulin in stimulating glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and in inhibiting hepatic glucose output. Insulin has both a vasodilatory effect, which is largely endothelium dependent through the release of nitric oxide, and a vasoconstrictory effect through the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of endothelin-1. IR and endothelial dysfunction (ED) are not only linked by common pathogenetic mechanisms, involving deranged insulin signalling pathways, but also by other, indirect to the hormone's actions, mechanisms. Different treatment modalities have been proposed to affect positively both the metabolic effects of insulin and ED. Weight loss has been shown to improve sensitivity to insulin as a result of either altered diet or exercise. Exercise has favourable effects on endothelial function in normal states and in states of disease, in men and women, and throughout the age spectrum and, hence, in IR states. Metformin improves sensitivity to insulin and most likely affects positively ED. Studies have shown that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system alter IR favourably, while Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor type II (ATII) inhibitors improve ED. Ongoing studies are expected to shed more light on the issue of whether treatment with the thiazolidinediones results in improvement of endothelial function, along with the accepted function of improving insulin sensitivity. Finally, improved endothelial function by such treatments is not in itself proof of reduced risk for atherosclerosis; this remains to be directly tested in clinical trials.", 
    "91": "Crude myosin light chain was extracted from Japanese domestic pork loin and digested with pepsin. Antihypertensive peptide was isolated from this digest as a measure of its inhibitory activity for angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE). Through isolation with some chromatographies, a single active fraction was isolated, and it was detected as an octapeptide, Val-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly-Asn-Pro, from 47th to 54th positions of myosin light chain. The 50% inhibitory concentration of this peptide was 28.5 muM. Kinetic evaluation showed that this peptide was a noncompetitive inhibitor, but it was slowly hydrolyzed by ACE. At the dose of 10 mg/kg, this peptide showed antihypertensive activity after a maximum of 3 h of administration and was estimated as a temporally effective hypotensor.", 
    "92": "The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene accounts for 50% of the variation in serum ACE levels and activity. However, its functional significance with regard to diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease remains controversial. To review the literature assessing the significance of ACE gene polymorphism on the initiation and progression of diabetic complications and treatment implications, a systematic review of the Medline, Pubmed and EMBASE databases was performed. Keywords were 'diabetes mellitus', 'diabetic nephropathy', 'ACE gene polymorphism' and 'genotype', for the period 1966 to August 1999. Overall, ACE gene polymorphism appears to affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, with individuals homozygous for the deletion allele (DD) having a shorter time period from the onset of microalbuminuria to renal replacement therapy and decreased survival thereafter. This may reflect relative resistance to ACE inhibitor therapy. There is no association between ACE gene polymorphism and retinopathy. Further large prospective studies are required to clarify the association of ACE gene polymorphism and diabetic complications. However, it appears that the deletion allele acts in a co-dominant manner as a susceptibility factor in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. ACE genotyping may therefore provide a simple method of identifying high risk individuals and allow the implementation of early and aggressive therapy.", 
    "93": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and statins have renoprotective effects. We studied the cellular mechanisms for this effect in adriamycin-treated mice receiving captopril, losartan, simvastatin, or their combinations. The mice developed albuminuria, renal insufficiency, and parenchymal inflammation/fibrosis accompanied by overexpression of intrarenal converting enzyme and angiotensin II. Only captopril consistently improved these abnormalities and reduced the cortical expression of several proinflammatory and profibrotic factors including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). These effects were independent of blood pressure, accompanied by increased urine N-acetylseryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) levels, and the restoration of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II to baseline levels. Losartan or simvastatin alone or together had no effect, and their addition to captopril did not enhance protection. In vitro, angiotensin II stimulated TGF-beta in renal tubular cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Captopril or Ac-SDKP suppressed angiotensin II-induced MAPK activation and TGF-beta secretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition confers renoprotection in adriamycin nephropathy by reducing intrarenal angiotensin II and augmenting Ac-SDKP expression that together attenuate MAPK signaling and its downstream proinflammatory and fibrogenic properties. The addition of receptor blocker and/or statin failed to potentiate such effects.", 
    "94": "Diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (RAS) should be discussed in numerous clinical situations including refractory high blood pressure (HBP), HBP in a polyvascular patient, degradation of renal function following renin angiotensin inhibitor or flash pulmonary edema. Ultrasound-doppler coupled with gadolinium-enhanced MR or CT angiography has proven adequate for most patients with RAS. Digital subtraction angiography should be limited to revascularisation procedures. Functional testing are not sensitive or specific enough because the degree of renin activation differs widely among patients with RAS. Renal percutaneous angioplasty induces a light to moderate decrease in blood pressure, has no effect on renal function but allows to reduce the number of anti-hypertensive drugs. Stenting completed angioplasty is worthwhile in most patients with atherosclerotic RAS. ACE inhibitors decrease mortality and increase renal function in patients with RAS.",

Contraindication to beta blocking was observed in 24% of patients, mean left ventricular fraction of ejection was 39% and only 39% of patients had mean left ventricular fraction of ejection<35%. Co-medications included a diuretic agent, ACE inhibitor or ARB in 68% of cases. Eighty three percent of patients had a titration of carvedilol (median duration=1 20 days). Thirty percent reached the recommended maximal dose. The dose of carvedilol at the titration's visit for all the patients (patient in stop included) was on average 30.5 +/- 22.1 mg/day with a median on 25 [confidence interval: 23-27] During the year of follow-up, 10% of patients have stopped the treatment (3% of patients having reached the maximum recommended dose of carvedilol versus 13% for the others), for cardiovascular reasons in 50% of patients (aggravation of heart failure: 28%, symptomatic arterial hypotension: 9%, symptomatic bradycardia: 5%).

Only in univariate analysis, patients with an inclusion high weight (>85 kg) were likely less to reach recommended maximal dose (37.2 versus 8.7%, p-value<0.0001), the patients with systolic heart failure had more chance than the patients with diastolic heart failure to reach the recommended maximal dose (31 versus 17.4%, p-value=0.006), in the same way, the lack of auricular supported more the reach of recommended maximal dose (31.2 versus 24.1%, p-value=0.018)",

    "99": "Although there are many classes of drugs, including cardiac glycosides, sympathomimetic inotropes, beta-adrenergic antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and spironolactone etc. used for the treatment of heart failure, the morbidity and mortality rates of patients after these treatments are not ameliorated. Chronic administration of Sympathomimetic inotropes also increased the arrhythmogenic effects. Consequently, improvement of treatment for heart failure remains a major medical challenge for the coming years. In this present experiment, the novel Na(+)-K(+) ATPase inhibitor AT-11 was characterized for its inotropic and toxic properties. Comparing AT-11 with ouabain, we found that AT-11 concentration-dependently increased contractility in guinea pig heart preparations, and the safety index of AT-11 was better than ouabain in vitro. In the in vivo study, AT-11 was also safer than ouabain at the equieffective dose. Moreover, AT-11 slowed heart rate more than ouabain did. This may be due to a larger AT-11-induced increase in vagal reflex than with ouabain and an indirect decrease in sympathetic tone to prevent Ca(2+) overload.", 
    "100": "Effective treatment of lupus nephritis requires an understanding of disease pathogenesis, risk stratification by World Health Organization (WHO) classification and therapeutic options. Mesangial lupus nephropathy is generally associated with an excellent prognosis, whereas proliferative lupus nephropathy, especially the diffuse variant, is often characterised by hypertension, red blood cell casts and significant deterioration of renal function. Nephrotic syndrome in the absence of hypertension, active urinary sediment or significant hypocomplementaemia suggests the membranous variant of lupus nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy generally confers a good prognosis. However, persistent nephrotic range proteinuria may be accompanied by loss of renal function and end stage renal disease. Glucocorticoids, usually prednisone or methylprednisolone, remain the most effective, rapidly acting immunomodulatory therapy for both the initial episode or recurrence of active renal disease. A role for cyclophosphamide in the treatment of lupus nephritis has been established in prospective, randomised trials. The benefits of intravenous cyclophosphamide were seen in groups of patients failing prednisone, establishing cyclophosphamide as salvage or rescue therapy for patients unresponsive to glucocorticoids. Additional therapeutic strategies include azathioprine, cyclosporin, and plasmapheresis. Ancillary management can consist of hypertension control, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dietary restriction of salt and protein, and lipid lowering drugs. Current treatment of lupus nephritis is associated with preservation of renal function in the vast majority of patients; however, novel agents that are more effective and less toxic are required.", 
    "101": "We have used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify genes that are affected by congestive heart failure and those influenced by treatment with DITPA and DITPA in combination with captopril using a rat postinfarction model. The most striking result when comparing heart failure to sham operation was that all of the mitochondrial and metabolic enzymes affected were down regulated. When comparing heart failure with DITPA treatment, most of the down regulated metabolic genes were returned toward normal. When comparing heart failure with heart failure animals treated with DITPA and captopril, metabolic enzymes were no longer significantly downregulated. DITPA treatment and the combination of DITPA and captopril show that the metabolic enzymes were no longer down regulated. This represents a substantial improvement in the energy- generating capacity of the heart. These results indicate that the actions of DITPA and the combination of DITPA and captopril in heart failure can be partially explained by differences in gene activation.",

After a 4-wk placebo washout period, 463 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-115 mm Hg) aged 18 to 75 y were randomly assigned 2:1:1 to treatment with zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide, zofenopril, or hydrochlorothiazide for 12 wk in an international, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study. DBP and systolic blood pressure changes with treatment were calculated. The first 12 wk of treatment were followed by a 24-wk open-label period during which only safety was assessed. Reported here is a subanalysis of the main study results, performed in patients with and without metabolic syndrome, limited to a zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide versus zofenopril comparison. The antihypertensive effect of zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide or zofenopril was similar in patients with (77%) and without metabolic syndrome. In patients with and without metabolic syndrome, however, DBP and systolic blood pressure reductions were significantly greater with zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide (with metabolic syndrome: 14+/-8/21+/-14 mm Hg; without metabolic syndrome: 15+/-7/23+/-14 mm Hg) than with zofenopril alone (with metabolic syndrome: 10+/-9/11+/-15; without metabolic syndrome: 12+/-10/14+/-18 mm Hg). The safety of the 2 treatments was similar in patients with and without metabolic syndrome. The fixed combination of zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide improved the efficacy of zofenopril alone. This effect was particularly evident in patients with metabolic syndrome, in whom blood pressure control is more difficult to achieve and who are at greater risk for cardiovascular events.",

The present study is based on a hospital cohort heart failure registry during 2005 at Heart Failure Centre Medicine, Dept. of Medicine, SU/Sahlgrenska Hospital. In this study 150 patients were enrolled consecutively for analysis. They are aged around 80 years old with high comorbidity. One-year mortality is 30%. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that significant prognostic indicators for mortality are increasing age, New York Heart Association functional class and presence of comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure. The use of aldosterone receptor antagonist is also associated with poor prognosis. Prescriptions of ACE inhibitor and beta-blockers are 57.5% and 73% respectively. Added-on therapy with angiotensin receptor 1 antagonist is few. In around 30% of prescriptions of ACE inhibitors daily dose is less than half of target dose. In around 54% of beta-blockers daily dose is less than half of target dose. There are clear potential for improved medications with guideline recommended agents in light of the fact that in these study patients 82% of heart rates is >60 beats/min, 84% of S-creatinine is <150 mmol/l, 17.4% of systolic blood pressure is 140-160 mmHg and 10% is 160-180 mmHg.",

The plateau phase was inhibited when cells were treated with bromoenol lactone, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of iPLA(2).

Aliskiren is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of renin, with oral bioavailability of 2.6% and an elimination half-life of 40 hours, making it suitable for once-daily oral administration. Aliskiren dose-dependently reduced BP, inhibited plasma renin activity (PRA), attenuated renal damage in animal models, and showed efficient and longer- lasting blockade of the RAAS in normotensive human subjects compared with other RAAS inhibitors. The clinical efficacy and safety of aliskiren have been evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents in phase II and phase III trials of patients with mild to severe hypertension. When used as monotherapy, aliskiren led to significant dose-dependent reductions in BP from baseline that were greater than those obtained with placebo and comparable with those achieved with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). The combination of aliskiren with a diuretic, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or an ARB generally had greater and longer-lasting BP-lowering efficacy than did single agents alone. Aliskiren also countered the reactive increase in PRA caused by diuretic, CC B, ACEI, and ARB therapy. Once-daily treatment with aliskiren was well tolerated.",

Ang I is in turn hydrolyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form Ang II, a potent vasoconstrictor and the primary active product of the RAAS. Recent evidence has suggested that other metabolites of Ang I and II may have biological activity, particularly in tissues. Development of agents that block the RAAS (e.g., beta blockers, ACE inhibitors [ACE Is], and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) began as a therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension. Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated important additional cardiovascular and renal therapeutic benefits of ACE Is and ARBs. However, blockade of the RAAS with these agents is incomplete.",

    "122": "Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is invariably observed in patients undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The condition is thought to occur in response to a variety of insults, including bioincompatible dialysates (acidic solution, high glucose, glucose degradation products, or a combination), peritonitis, uremia, and chronic inflammation. Recently, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the fibrosing process have been intensively studied. Transforming growth factor-beta has been shown to be a key mediator of PF. Loss of the mesothelial cell layer has been identified in several studies and shown to correlate with submesothelial thickening and vasculopathy. An association has also been identified between increased submesothelial thickness in the peritoneal membrane and increased solute transport, suggesting a relationship between PF and loss of ultrafiltration capacity. Thus, to maintain long-term PD and improve quality of life for patients, it is important to develop interventions for prevention and treatment of PF. Several strategies for peritoneal fibrosis intervention have been reported, including developing biocompatible dialysate, targeting mediators responsible for inflammation and fibrosis, and reconstituting the peritoneum using mesothelial or bone marrow-derived cells. Recent experimental trials in animal models and clinical studies are presented in this review.", 
    "123": "Although the survival of diabetic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has improved, it is still much worse than the survival of nondiabetic patients. Diabetes has its own risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as increased levels of advanced glycation end-products, carbonyl and oxidative stress, and low-grade inflammation. An independent, graded association has been observed between a reduced glomerular filtration rate and the risk of CVD events in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both CKD and diabetes synergistically lead to a high risk of CVD. It seems that the poor survival of diabetic PD patients is predestined at the initiation of dialysis because of multiple pre-existing risk factors and comorbid diseases, particularly CVD. Recently, several trials were successful in improving the survival of patients with diabetic CKD. Tight control of glucose, blood pressure management using angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and use of statins, antioxidants, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists may improve the survival of diabetic PD patients. However, simple correction of a single CVD risk factor is not likely to be effective. New PD solutions such as those low in glucose degradation products or those with icodextrin may also be effective in reducing the risk of CVD in diabetic PD patients. Therefore, multifactorial interventions--including diet control, early referral, and choice of an optimal PD solution--may improve the survival of diabetic PD patients.",

Data sets of both bitter-taste (48 compounds) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition (58 compounds) were analyzed by means of multiple linear-regression methods to produce QSAR models that relate structure to property. For the bitter-taste data set, two variables describe the data well, both being whole-molecule descriptors: (1)chi(v) (molecular connectivity first-order valence index) and SHBa (sum of E-State indices for H-bond acceptors) yield r(2)=0.88, s=0.22. External validation and cross-validation indicate that the model may be predictive. For the ACE-inhibition data set, five variables produced a satisfactory model. Four of the descriptors relate to amino acid side chains: the E-State polarity/non-polarity index Q(v) (for position A adjacent to the N-terminus; Fig. 1) and the E-State index s(2) (for the backbone position of substitution), along with the square of the molecular connectivity path-four valence index ((4)chi(PC); for side chain B adjacent to C-terminus) and the E-State index s(5) (for the attachment point of the side chain B (Fig. 1)). Together with the E-State whole-molecule descriptor for internal H-bonding (five skeletal bonds; SHBint5), the five variables form a predictive model (r(2)=0.88, s=0.36).

If persons are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors because of cough, angioneurotic edema, rash, or altered taste sensation, angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists (ARBs) should be given. If HF persists despite diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be administered. Beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, and digoxin may be used to slow a rapid ventricular rate in persons with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.

The majority of patients (73%) had a baseline ACR within the normal range (<17 mug/mg for men and <25 mug/mg for women). Independent of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and other baseline covariates, a higher ACR, even within the normal range, was associated with increased risks for all-cause mortality (P<0.001) and cardiovascular death (P=0.01). The effect of trandolapril therapy on outcomes was not modified significantly by the level of albuminuria. Nevertheless, trandolapril therapy was associated with a significantly lower mean follow-up ACR (12.5 versus 14.6 mug/mg, P=0.0002), after adjustment for baseline ACR, time between collections, and other covariates.

We assessed the relationship between antecedent hypertension and outcomes and the association between elevated (systolic: >140 mm Hg) or low blood pressure (systolic: <100 mm Hg) in 2 of 3 follow-up visits during the first 6 months and subsequent cardiovascular events over a median 24.7 months of follow-up.

Bradykinin and substance P, substrates of angiotensin-converting enzyme, increase vascular permeability and cause tissue edema in animals. Studies indicate that amino-terminal degradation of these peptides, by aminopeptidase P and dipeptidyl peptidase IV, may be impaired in individuals with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema. This case-control study tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and antigen are decreased in sera of patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema. Fifty subjects with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema and 176 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-exposed control subjects were ascertained. Sera were assayed for angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, aminopeptidase P activity, aminopeptidase N activity, dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity, and antigen and the ex vivo degradation half-lives of bradykinin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, and substance P in a subset. The prevalence of smoking was increased and of diabetes decreased in case versus control subjects. Overall, dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (26.6+/-7.8 versus 29.6+/-7.3 nmol/mL per minute; P=0.026) and antigen (465.8+/-260.8 versus 563.1+/-208.6 ng/mL; P=0.017) were decreased in sera from individuals with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-exposed control subjects without angioedema. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (21.5+/-4.9 versus 29.8+/-6.7 nmol/mL per minute; P=0.001) and antigen (354.4+/-124.7 versus 559.8+/-163.2 ng/mL; P=0.003) were decreased in sera from cases collected during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition but not in the absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The degradation half-life of substance P correlated inversely with dipeptidyl peptidase IV antigen during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.

The cytotoxic effect of PQ is mediated by radicals, which are the products of PQ reduction in cells. The anti-oxidative action of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, appears to be through its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. In this study, the heptoprotective effect of captopril against PQ-induced hepatotoxicity was evaluated using primary cultured rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats using a two-step collagenase perfusion, following incubation in the presence of captopril at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mM with or without PQ (5 mM). Hepatoprotective effects of captopril were studied indicating glutathione level intensity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) formation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and cell viability every 70 min for 210 min. Captopril at 0.2 mM concentration maintained the LDH leakage, glutathione level and cell viability in the presence of 5 mM PQ. In spite of a significant elevation in TBARs formation in the PQ group, captopril did not show any significant protection. In conclusion, our data reveals that incubation of freshly isolated rat hepa-tocytes with captopril (0.2 mM) significantly protected the hepatocytes against the cytotoxicity of PQ (P < 0.05).",

Target doses were reached in 49% of the patients for ACE-I, but in only 18% for beta-blockers and in 9% for ARBs. Multivariate analyses showed that age >75 years was an independent factor associated with under-prescription of ACE-I-ARBs, beta-blockers or spironolactone.

    "148": "Hypertonic NaCl intake is produced by serotonin receptor antagonism in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) of dehydrated rats or in rats pretreated with a mineralocorticoid, for example deoxycorticosterone (DOCA), that receive an intracerebroventricular injection (icv) of angiotensin II (ang II). The objective of the present work was to find out whether these two mechanisms are also involved with isotonic NaCl intake. Serotonin receptor blockade by methysergide in the LPBN (4 microg/0.2 microl bilaterally) had no effect on 0.15 M NaCl (methysergide: 19.3+/-5.2 ml/60 min; vehicle: 19.3+/-4.2 ml/60 min; n=7) or water (methysergide: 3.4+/-1.4 ml/60 min; vehicle 2.2+/-0.6 ml/60 min) intake induced by systemic diuretic furosemide combined with low dose of captopril (Furo/Cap). Methysergide treatment 4 days later in the same animals produced the expected enhancement in the 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by Furo/Cap (methysergide: 16.6+/-3.5 ml/60 min; vehicle: 6.6+/-1.5 ml/60 min). Similar result was obtained when another group was tested first with 0.3 M NaCl and later with 0.15 M NaCl. Isotonic NaCl intake induced by icv ang II was however enhanced by prior DOCA treatment. A de novo hypertonic NaCl intake was produced in another group by the same combined treatment. The results suggest that a facilitatory mechanism like the mineralocorticoid/ang II synergy may enhance NaCl solution intake at different levels of tonicity, while the action of an inhibitory mechanism, like the LPBN serotonergic system, is restricted to the ingestion at hypertonic levels.",

    "159": "Congestive heart failure is a growing public health problem worldwide, particularly in the elderly population, in whom it has a substantial impact on quality of life and survival. Despite the fact that heart failure is the most common reason for hospitalisation over the age of 65 years, most clinical trials have excluded the elderly population. This is unfortunate because it may not be generally assumed that elderly patients are similar to younger ones. Nonspecific symptoms and co-morbidities in the elderly may make diagnosis of heart failure difficult. In addition, physiology changes with age, polypharmacy complicates therapy and the aim of therapy may change in the presence of co-morbidities such as cancer or dementia. Furthermore, drug interactions and adverse effects are frequent in heart failure in general, but increase significantly with age. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that treatment of heart failure should be fundamentally different in elderly patients compared with younger patients, although careful monitoring of medical therapy is of particular importance in elderly heart failure patients. Therefore, general guidelines on diagnosis and therapy of heart failure also apply to elderly patients, but therapy may need to be adjusted to cater for individual needs, potential interactions and altered elimination of drugs. This article summarises the evidence available for treatment in elderly patients with heart failure, discusses potential differences in elderly subjects compared with their younger counterparts and provides recommendations for clinical practice.",

In this review, the potential clinical strategies including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, modulation of beta-AR-mediated signal transduction and the \"molecular switch Gsalpha/Gialpha\", modulation of ion channels, the control of NO donor, the use of anti-inflammatory agents, and antioxidants, and energy metabolic modulation are introduced in details.",

When initiating combination therapy for hypertension, careful consideration must be given to the choice of medication. Clinical trial evidence has shown the efficacy of various combinations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics in reducing BP and cardiovascular risk.

Elevated blood pressure contributes importantly to the development of albuminuria and progression of renal damage in diabetic nephropathy. Strong evidence indicates that the presence of albuminuria and overt nephropathy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes is associated with a marked increase in the rate of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without chronic kidney disease is associated with a significant reduction in risk for cardiovascular events. Renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents should be considered first-step pharmacologic therapy for hypertension in diabetic patients, with addition of other agents, if needed, to meet the recommended blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg. In most instances, a diuretic is also needed to reduce blood pressure.",

Overweight and obesity are highly associated with multiple comorbidities, elevated blood pressure values, dyslipidaemia, reduced insulin sensitivity and alterations of large and minor vessels. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in adipose tissue may represent an important link between obesity and hypertension. Angiotensin II has been shown to play a role in adipocyte growth and differentiation. Adipocytes also secrete adiponectin, enhancing insulin sensitivity and preventing atherosclerosis. Blockade of the RAS with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker results in a substantial increase in adiponectin levels and improved insulin sensitivity. Obesity-related hypertension needs a comprehensive approach to treatment including both weight loss and pharmacological therapies. Antihypertensive drugs prescription should be based on guidelines recommendations for management of hypertension, taking into account the growing evidences about the relationship between some antihypertensive drugs and the development of new-onset diabetes.

    "187": "A common cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Compared to the general population, the percentage of cardiovascular deaths that are attributed to SCD is higher in patients treated by dialysis. While coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of SCD in dialysis patients, reduced heart rate variability (HRV) may play a role in the higher risk of SCD among other risk factors. HRV refers to beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate as measured by periodic variation in the R-R interval. HRV provides a non-invasive method for investigating autonomic input into the heart. It quantifies the amount by which the R-R interval or heart rate changes from one cardiac cycle to the next. The autonomic nervous system transmits impulses from the central nervous system to peripheral organs and is responsible for controlling the heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory activity. In normal individuals, without cardiac disease, the heart rate has a high degree of beat-to-beat variability. HRV fluctuates with respiration: it increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration and is primarily mediated by parasympathetic activity. HRV has been used to evaluate and quantify the cardiac risk associated with a variety of conditions including cardiac disorders, stroke, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. In this narrative review, we will examine the association between HRV and SCD. This report explains the measurement of HRV and the consequences of reduced HRV in the general population and dialysis patients. Lastly, this review will outline the possible use of HRV as a clinical predictor for SCD in the dialysis population. The current understanding of SCD based on HRV findings among the ESRD population support the use of more aggressive treatment of CAD; greater use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blockers and more frequent and/or nocturnal haemodialysis to improve the survival of a patient with kidney failure.",

The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/total glutathione (GSH t) ratio was also significantly decreased in the ramipril group compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that ramipril can protect against white matter lesions that result from chronic ischemia due to its effects on free radical scavenging. Further efficacy should be studied in the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency states and vascular dementia.",

HF medication contraindications, intolerance, and use at hospital discharge were assessed, along with 60- to 90-day follow-up data in a prespecified cohort. There were 20,118 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. At discharge, 90.6% of patients were eligible to receive beta-blockers, and 83.7% were eligible to receive an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Eligible patients discharged with beta-blockers were significantly more likely to be treated at follow-up than those not discharged with beta-blockers (93.1% vs 30.5%; P < .0001). Discharge use of beta-blockers in eligible patients was associated with a significant reduction in the adjusted risk of death (hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.74; P < .001) and death/rehospitalization (odds ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.55-0.99; P = .04), although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of residual confounding.",

References cited in other reviews were also evaluated. The current review focused on age-related pharmacodynamic changes in agents affecting the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and endocrine functions.", 
    "221": "Older adults frequently demonstrate an exaggerated response to CNS-active drugs. This is in part due to an underlying age-related decline in CNS function and in part due to increased pharmacodynamic sensitivity for some benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and opioids. The most important pharmacodynamic differences with age for cardiovascular agents are the decrease in effect for beta-adrenergic agents. This decline in response in vascular, cardiac, and pulmonary tissue may be due to a decrease in Gs protein interactions. Most studies indicate there is no decrease in cx-receptor sensitivity with age. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not show age-related differences in elderly patients. With the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, there was a slight increase in effect for older adults, but this was only for treatment-naive patients and was transient. Nondihydropyridines did not show an age- associated change in pharmacodynamic effect; however, in the elderly, there appeared to be a decrease in the PR interval prolongation normally seen with these agents. Studies of diuretics indicated that the changes in diuretic and natriuretic effects seen in the elderly were associated with pharmacokinetic changes and were not pharmacodynamic in nature. There was a lack of consistent evidence regarding whether sulfonylureas show age-related changes in pharmacodynamic effect.",

The average antioxidant capacities of 70% ethanol extracts from soybean after fermenting for 15 d at 30 degrees C were increased by a 5.2 to 7.4-fold (0.26 mM trolox equivalent/g dry weight, 91.7% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH] radical scavenging effect at 3 mg/mL) when compared with those of the unfermented soybean extracts (P < 0.01). The potentially significant antioxidant properties of MFSE are associated with its content of bioactive mevinolins (r= 0.85) and isoflavone aglycones (r= 0.98), which were derived from the soybean during Monascus-fermentation. It was also found that the water extract having a molecular mass 1 to 3 kDa showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity (65.3%), which was remarkably greater (6.5 times) than the control.",

A commercial pea protein isolate was digested using each of 5 different proteases to produce protein hydrolysates with varying properties. After 4 h of enzyme digestion, samples were clarified by centrifugation followed by desalting of the supernatant with a 1000 Da membrane; the retentates were then freeze-dried. Alcalase and Flavourzymetrade mark produced protein hydrolysates with significantly higher (P < 0.05) degree of hydrolysis when compared to the other proteases. Flavourzyme, papain, and alcalase produced hydrolysates that contained the highest levels of aromatic amino acids, while trypsin hydrolysate had the highest levels of lysine and arginine. Papain hydrolysate contained high molecular weight peptides (10 to 178 kDa) while hydrolysates from the other 4 proteases contained predominantly low molecular weight peptides (</= 23 kDa). DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity of the Flavourzyme hydrolysate was significantly (P < 0.05) the highest while alcalase and trypsin hydrolysates were the lowest. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for papain hydrolysate while Flavourzyme hydrolysate had the least inhibitory activity. Sensory analysis showed that the alcalase hydrolysate was the most bitter while papain and alpha-chymotrypsin hydrolysates were the least. Among the 5 enzymes used in this study, papain and alpha-chymotrypsin appear to be the most desirable for producing high quality pea protein hydrolysates because of the low bitterness scores combined with a high level of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and moderate free radical scavenging activity.",

We and others observed that IgA itself could directly activate mesangial cells to produce monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and this was suppressed by the treatment with steroid or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It was shown in mesangial cells that the increased expression of TGF-beta and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 induced by angiotensin II was suppressed by the treatment with ARB, calcium channel blocker (CCB), spironolactone or peroxisome proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist. It was well known in the patients with IgAN that renal or intraglomerular TGF-beta1 gene expression was increased. Interestingly, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors induced significantly lower renal TGF-beta1 gene expression in patients with IgAN. It was reported in several studies that urinary levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 or TGF-beta were increased in patients with IgAN. The increase was suppressed by the treatment with steroid, ARB or ACE inhibitor. More effective agents are necessary to ameliorate pathogenetic abnormalities and so to prevent the progression of IgAN.",

On day 90 of trandolapril treatment, FMD (8.6+/-4.1%) (p<0.01) increased, ADMA levels (229.6+/-42.9 nmol/l) (p<0.001) decreased and TBARs levels (1531.8+/-1036.0 nmol/MDA) (p<0.001) decreased significantly. FMD was negatively correlated with plasma ADMA (r=-0.228, p<0.01), and TBARs levels (r=-0.244, p=0.02), whereas ADMA and TBARs levels were correlated positively (r=0.399, p<0.0001).",

    "242": "Fatty acids are essential for membrane biosynthesis in all organisms and serve as signaling molecules in many animals. Here, we found that saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; C20:0 to C30:0) exogenously applied in ovule culture medium significantly promoted cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber cell elongation, whereas acetochlor (2-chloro-N-[ethoxymethyl]-N-[2-ethyl-6-methyl-phenyl]-acetamide; ACE), which inhibits VLCFA biosynthesis, abolished fiber growth. This inhibition was overcome by lignoceric acid (C24:0). Elongating fibers contained significantly higher amounts of VLCFAs than those of wild-type or fuzzless-lintless mutant ovules. Ethylene nullified inhibition by ACE, whereas C24:0 was inactive in the presence of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor (l-[2-aminoethoxyvinyl]-glycine), indicating that VLCFAs may act upstream of ethylene. C24:0 induced a rapid and significant increase in ACO (for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase) transcript levels that resulted in substantial ethylene production. C24:0 also promoted Ser palmitoyltransferase expression at a later stage, resulting in increased sphingolipid biosynthesis. Application of C24:0 not only stimulated Arabidopsis thaliana root cell growth but also complemented the cut1 phenotype. Transgenic expression of Gh KCS13/CER6, encoding the cotton 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, in the cut1 background produced similar results. Promotion of Arabidopsis stem elongation was accompanied by increased ACO transcript levels. Thus, VLCFAs may be involved in maximizing the extensibility of cotton fibers and multiple Arabidopsis cell types, possibly by activating ethylene biosynthesis.", 
    "243": "Previous studies revealed that mAb BB9 reacts with a subset of CD34(+) human BM cells with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) characteristics. Here we map BB9 expression throughout hematopoietic development and show that the earliest definitive HSCs that arise at the ventral wall of the aorta and surrounding endothelial cells are BB9(+). Thereafter, BB9 is expressed by primitive hematopoietic cells in fetal liver and in umbilical cord blood (UCB). BB9(+)CD34(+) UCB cells transplanted into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice contribute 10-fold higher numbers of multilineage blood cells than their CD34(+)BB9(-) counterparts and contain a significantly higher incidence of SCID-repopulating cells than the unfractionated CD34(+) population. Protein microsequencing of the 160-kDa band corresponding to the BB9 protein established its identity as that of somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Although the role of ACE on human HSCs remains to be determined, these studies designate ACE as a hitherto unrecognized marker of human HSCs throughout hematopoietic ontogeny and adulthood.", 
    "244": "The Clinical Trials described in this article were presented at the Hotline and Clinical Trial Update Sessions of the European Society of Cardiology Congress held in September 2007 in Vienna, Austria. The sessions chosen for this article represent the scope of interest of Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy. The presentations should be considered preliminary, as further analyses could alter the final publication of the results of these studies. PROSPECT evaluated echocardiographic criteria for optimal selection of patients with moderate to severe heart failure who may benefit from cardiac resynchronisation therapy, however concluded that no single echocardiographic measure can be recommended. EVEREST found that tolvaptan, a vasopressin V(2) antagonist, resulted in early weight reduction and improvement of dyspnoea in patients with acute heart failure, but lacked long term improvement. In ARISE, the anti-oxidant succinobucal did not affect the primary outcome in high risk cardiovascular patients, but improved the combination of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke, and diabetic control in diabetics. ALOFT showed that the addition of the renin inhibitor aliskiren to an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a beta-blocker leads to favourable effects on neurohormonal actions in heart failure. FINESSE markedly improved coronary patency before PCI with half-dose reteplase/abciximab in STEMI patients, however without significantly improving short-term outcome. The Prague-8 Study evaluated whether routine clopidogrel administered >6 h pre-angiography would be a safe way to achieve therapeutic drug levels in case a follow-up intervention would be considered immediately, but appeared not justified because of bleeding complications. CARESS in MI showed that high risk patients with evolving STEMI who undergo thrombolytic therapy should undergo PCI early after the thrombolysis. Finally, the ACUITY trial found that in moderate or high risk Non ST elevation ACS patients triaged to PCI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or medical management, bivalirudin, with or without associated GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, resulted in a marked reduction of bleeding at 30 days whilst preserving the ischemic and mortality benefit at 1 year follow up.", 
    "245": "Arterial hypertension is very common in children with all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). While fluid overload and activation of the renin-angiotensin system have long been recognized as crucial pathophysiological pathways, sympathetic hyperactivation, endothelial dysfunction and chronic hyperparathyroidism have more recently been identified as important factors contributing to CKD-associated hypertension. Moreover, several drugs commonly administered in CKD, such as erythropoietin, glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A, independently raise blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Because of the deleterious consequences of hypertension on the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular outcomes, an active screening approach should be adapted in patients with all stages of CKD. Before one starts antihypertensive treatment, non-pharmacological options should be explored. In hemodialysis patients a low salt diet, low dialysate sodium and stricter dialysis towards dry weight can often achieve adequate blood pressure control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are first-line therapy for patients with proteinuria, due to their additional anti-proteinuric properties. Diuretics are a useful alternative for non-proteinuric patients or as an add-on to renin-angiotensin system blockade. Multiple drug therapy is often needed to maintain blood pressure below the 90th percentile target, but adequate blood pressure control is essential for better renal and cardiovascular long-term outcomes.", 
    "246": "The pro-arrhythmic risk inherent to a new drug must be assessed at an early preclinical stage. Telemetry system implantation is a method widely used in vivo in various species. The present study was designed to assess whether conscious freely moving guineapigs can be used to predict QT prolongation in vivo. The guineapig has three advantages over the dog and the primate. First, it has specific ion channels similar to man; second, a smaller amount of test article is required for the investigation and third, its housing is less expensive. Under sterile conditions and isoflurane anaesthesia, telemetry transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally in male Dunkin Hartley guineapigs. Blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiographic intervals were measured from two days up to eight months. Chronic implantation of the telemetry device did not lead to anatomic or macroscopic alterations in the abdominal cavity and no inflammation of the peritoneum or infection was observed. Four reference compounds were used: three positive (sotalol, terfenadine and dofetilide) and one negative reference (enalapril). Single oral administration of all three positive references dose-dependently induced bradycardia and QT corrected (QTc) prolongation. In contrast, neither enalapril nor its vehicle prolonged the QTc. These results demonstrate that the guineapig is both a suitable model and a good alternative to dogs or primates to assess the potential of compounds for QT interval prolongation in the early stages of drug development.", 
    "247": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is critical in regulating systemic blood pressure, water and electrolyte balance, and pituitary gland hormones. These physiologies appear to be primarily mediated by the angiotensin II/AT(1) receptor subtype system. Overstimulation of this system can predispose cardiovascular disease (CVD) characterized by excessive vasoconstriction, fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling. If untreated, the patient typically displays a continuum of pathophysiologic conditions progressing from atherosclerosis to left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH), coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarcts, with heart failure as an endpoint. Intervention with antihypertensive therapy is necessary to inhibit this progression. RAAS blocking drugs appear to be the most effective approach. Diastolic heart failure patients benefit from treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs). Elderly CVD patients evidence age-related changes in body composition that alter the distribution and half-life of medications, thus presenting special challenges to treatment. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, renal dysfunction, liver insufficiency further complicates any therapeutic strategy. In addition, noncompliance because of cognitive impairment, depression, confusion due to the complexity of dose regimens, and lack of an appropriate social support system can disrupt positive outcome. The present review discusses the roles of an overactive RAAS and sympathetic nervous system as primary contributors to CVD. In addition, treatment strategies are discussed, focusing on middle aged and elderly hypertensive and heart failure patients.",

Patients with coagulopathies, malignancies, and independent neurological disorders were excluded from this study. Patient records were screened for age, sex, pre- and postoperative Markwalder score, arterial hypertension, medication with ACE-inhibitors, and recurrence of CSH. The rate of ACE-inhibitor treatment in our CSH patients was compared with an age-matched control group treated for herniated lumbar disc at the same time. The concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor was analyzed in hematoma samples and corresponding venous blood in 40 consecutive patients.",

In Group A, 5% (four out of 81) of the patients experienced recurrence as opposed to 18% (42 out of 229) in Group B (P = 0.00345). A negative correlation was found between the yearly rates of medication with ACE-inhibitors and recurrence (r = -0.8488; P = 0.0044). The rate of ACE-inhibitor treatment was lower in the CSH patients (25%) than in the control group (40%).

Coadministration of vildagliptin 100 mg with amlodipine 5 mg, valsartan 320 mg, or ramipril 5 mg had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for vildagliptin, amlodipine, and ramipril (and its active metabolite, ramiprilat) were contained within the acceptance range for bioequivalence (0.80-1.25). Valsartan AUC0-24h and Cmax increased by 24% and 14%, respectively, following coadministration of vildagliptin, but this was not considered clinically significant. Vildagliptin was generally well tolerated when given alone or in combination with amlodipine, valsartan, or ramipril in healthy subjects at steady state. No adjustment in dosage based on pharmacokinetic considerations is required should vildagliptin be coadministered with amlodipine, valsartan, or ramipril in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.", 
    "253": "The activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the RAAS appears to be modulated by a number of factors including the I/D polymorphism of the ACE genotype. In this study, we attempted to find independent correlates of ACE activity in 121 macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic Iranian patients under chronic ACE inhibition. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used. The presence of the D allele was independently associated with significantly higher levels of ACE activity (with the II genotype as reference, P < 0.001, B = 27.3, 95% CI = 17.6-37.1), and this association was not eliminated by potentially confounding variables. In conclusion, the D allele is a significant independent correlate of ACE activity in macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic Iranian patients under long-term ACE inhibition.",

In this single-center study, we analyzed ten children diagnosed with HIVAN from January 2000 to October 2006. There were eight boys and two girls, with a male:female ratio of 4:1. Their ages were from 5 months to 15 years (mean 6.8+/-6.2 years), with a peak age of 5-9 years. The presenting complaints included generalized edema (60%) and hypertension (50%). All patients had proteinuria on urine dipstick, with four (40%) at nephrotic range (proteinuria >or=500 mg/dl). Nine (90%) patients were in renal failure, with elevated serum creatinine (6.3-24 mg/dl) and serum urea (70-120 mg/dl). Renal disease was the first manifestation of HIV infection in six patients, whereas the diagnosis was made on autopsy in three. The duration from HIV infection to development of HIVAN ranged from 5 months to 10 years. CD4(+) cell count, done in only three patients due to financial constraints, was below 200/mm(3). The kidneys were hyperechoic on abdominal ultrasound in all patients, and three (30%) showed grossly enlarged kidneys. Histology of renal tissues available by autopsy in three patients showed mainly collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Treatments given were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in four and two patients, respectively, and one patient underwent peritoneal dialysis. On outcome analysis, seven (70%) patients died, two were lost to follow-up, and one was alive on HAART therapy at the writing of this article.

Total days in hospital per patient were similar (10.9 days in the usual care group versus 10.2 days in the intervention group; P not significant). Crude mortality was 6.2% and 5.5% in the usual care and intervention groups, respectively, with no significant difference (P=0.15) in overall survival. Post hoc analysis suggested that after the study team became experienced, days in hospital per patient were reduced by the program (11.1+/-0.91 and 8.9+/-0.61 in the usual care and intervention groups, respectively; P<0.05).", 
    "259": "The intervention program failed to improve outcomes in the present study. One explanation for these results is the near optimal physician compliance with guidelines in both groups. It is also possible that a substantial learning curve for the staff was involved, as suggested by the reduction in total days in hospital in the intervention patients during the second part of the study.",

The blood pressure reduction was similar with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (10.7/8.1 mmHg), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (10.5/6.9 mmHg) and calcium-channel blockers (9.3/7.2 mmHg). In addition angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (by 49%) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (by 59%) significantly reduced pathological proteinuria.",

For experimental CRF, healthy cats (n=5) underwent 7/8 renal ablation. After renal insufficiency and hypertension were confirmed by blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and telemetric recording of systemic blood pressure, BH was administered orally once daily at 0.9 to 2.0 mg/kg/day for 2 to 3 weeks. Within 2 months after renal ablation, renal failure and hypertension developed as evidenced by significant increases in BUN, serum creatinine and systemic blood pressure (p<0.01 or 0.05) and significantly decreased creatinine clearance accompanied by elevated plasma renin activity, angiotensin I and II, and aldosterone (p<0.01 or 0.05). BH administration corrected systemic hypertension (p<0.05) and significantly reduced angiotensin II and aldosterone (p<0.05). Upon discontinuation of BH, these values returned to the pre-administration levels. Studies on spontaneous CRF enrolled 11 cats with spontaneously occurring CRF. BH was administered orally to 6 cats once daily for 24 weeks at a final dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day, while 5 cats served as control. BH administration reduced serum creatinine and urinary protein concentration in every cat. Results demonstrate that in cats, loss of renal mass leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and associated renal hypertension, and indicate that BH is effective in correcting renal hypertension and may provide renal benefits to cats with CRF.",

Activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, level of malonic dialdehyde, osmotic resistance of erythrocytes and resistanse of LDL to oxidation and concentration of nitric oxide in the blood have been evaluated . The administration of captopril and losartan in experimental hyperlipidemia eqivalently increased activity of SOD and catalase, osmotic resistance of erythrocytes and resistanse of LDL to oxidation, whereas decreased content of malonic dialdehyde compared to the control group . Captopril was more effective than losartan in preserving of nitric oxide. We conclude that captopril and losartan inhibited oxidative stress, which are probably associated with the inhibition of angiotensin 11. Captopril and losartan are safely used in patients during cardio-vascular disease with dyslipidemia.",

Hypertension should be treated with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The blood pressure should be reduced to <140/90 mmHg and to <130/80 mmHg in persons with diabetes or renal insufficiency. The serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be reduced to <70 mg/dl with statins if necessary. Diabetics should have their hemoglobin A1c reduced to <7.0%. Aspirin or clopidogrel, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors should be given indefinitely unless contraindications exist to the use of these drugs. Long-acting nitrates are effective antianginal and antiischemic drugs. Postinfarction patients at very high risk for sudden cardiac death should have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The two indications for coronary revascularization are prolongation of life and relief of unacceptable symptoms despite optimal medical management.",

Baseline data sets, followed by 1-9 (mean=2.66) data sets, comprised of serum urea nitrogen (SUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, and magnesium concentrations, were tabulated. Each dog received an ACEI plus spironolactone for a mean of 23.8+/-26.6 weeks (range: 2-150) and a median of 15 weeks. No cardiac drugs other than an ACEI and spironolactone were administered during the study period.",

Although serum magnesium concentrations may increase significantly with time >20 weeks compared to baseline concentrations, hypermagnesemia appears to be rare, mild, and unlikely to be of clinical importance. The combination of an ACEI and spironolactone is safe in elderly small dogs with MVD with normal SUN and creatinine concentrations.", 
    "293": "Longer life expectancy and modern diagnostic and therapeutic advances favoured the ever more frequent development of ischaemic nephropathy (IN) characterized by the presence of atherosclerotic stenosis in both renal arteries (ARAS); 7% of patients older than 65 years with cardiovascular risk factors have ARAS but the prevalence grows to 20% in patients with coronary artery disease, to 42% in patients with aorto-iliac disease and to 67.5% in patients with peripheral artery atherosclerotic disease. Moreover the patient is later diagnosed with IN until de-hydratation or treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2-receptor inhibitors. This therapy may present a hazard for elderly patients with unsuspected atherosclerotic renovascular disease; the risk may grow if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated. Long life expectancy, associated comorbidities, multi-medication and functional failures induce a high risk for iatrogenic disease in elderly.",

Assessment for vasculopathy is important before pregnancy because nephropathy can increase perinatal risks including potential for preeclampsia and preterm birth. Counseling women receiving renoprotective medications including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has recently become complicated in light of new information suggesting a teratogenic risk for these agents. Most reproductive age women with overt diabetic nephropathy have preserved renal function and do not seem to have the progression of their disease affected by pregnancy. Perinatal outcomes are excellent for these women who have received care in tertiary institutions. However, there are relatively few women with significant renal impairment included in case series of pregnancies complicated by diabetic nephropathy. For these women, adverse perinatal outcomes are more common, and the effect of pregnancy on the course of their disease is less certain.", 
    "295": "Acute cerebral ischemia triggers interleukin-6 (IL-6) release into cerebrospinal fluid and blood. IL-6 induces synthesis of the acute phase proteins (APPs) in the liver. Higher blood IL-6 level in stroke patients is associated with larger infarct size, greater neurological deficit on admission, early neurological worsening, and increased risk of death or poor functional outcome. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), the major APP in man, rises in blood during acute stroke reaching maximal values between 5 and 7 day after stroke onset. Elevated CRP level in acute ischemic stroke predicts unfavorable outcome and is associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events. Increased level of fibrinogen, another APP, is associated with worse outcome in patients with ischemic stroke. The acute phase reaction accompanies also intracerebral hemorrhage. Serum IL-6 and CRP level increases in the first days after intracerebral hemorrhage. Plasma IL-6 is independently associated with hematoma enlargement and fibrinogen level predicts early neurological deterioration and outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.", 
    "296": "To test the hypothesis that early exercise training after myocardial infarction (MI) could preserve cardiac function, alleviate left ventricular (LV) remodeling and induce a protective effect on morphology, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent coronary ligation or sham operation, and were assigned to 3 groups: Sham, sedentary MI (SedMI), and exercise MI (ExMI). We measured the changes in collagen volume fraction, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) at gene and protein levels after 8 weeks of exercise training. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements. Early exercise training after MI had no effect on LV wall thinning. Cardiac function was significantly preserved in the ExMI group in comparison to the SedMI group. The collagen volume fraction in the ExMI group was significantly lower than in the SedMI group. Compared to the SedMI group, the ExMI group showed a markedly decrease at both the gene and protein levels in TIMP-1 (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in MMP-1 among the three groups. MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio in the ExMI group was significantly higher than in the SedMI group. In addition, the expression of AT1 protein in the ExMI group was significantly lower than in the SedMI group. Furthermore, both ACE mRNA expression and ACE binding in the ExMI group are significantly decreased compared to the SedMI group. Our results suggest that early exercise training after MI reduces TIMP-1 expression, improves the balance between MMPs and TIMPs, and mitigates the expressions of ACE and AT1 receptor. These improvements, in turn, attenuate myocardial fibrosis and preserve post-MI cardiac function.", 
    "297": "The clinical syndrome congestive heart failure (CHF) has its origins rooted in a salt-avid state mediated largely by effector hormones of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In addition, a systemic illness accompanies chronic RAAS activation. Its features include: the presence of oxidative stress in diverse tissues coupled with a reduction in activity of endogenous oxidoreductases, such as Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase and Se-glutathione peroxidase; a proinflammatory phenotype with activated immune cells and increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines; and a catabolic state with loss of soft tissues and bone that eventuates in a wasting syndrome termed cardiac cachexia. Pathogenic mechanisms and pathophysiologic expressions of this illness are under active investigation. In this context and less well appreciated is the importance of a dyshomeostasis of various minerals, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn, and Se, and their impact on the systemic and progressive nature of CHF. A convergence of multiple factors, some hormonal (e.g., aldosteronism, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D), others pharmacologic (e.g., loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), predispose to the heightened excretion of these minerals in urine and feces while parathyroid hormone promotes intracellular Ca2+ overloading in diverse tissues. The importance of these macro- and micronutrients to the appearance of oxidative stress, compromised antioxidant defenses, an immunostimulatory state and tissue wasting needs to be critically addressed. So, too, must the potential for nutriceuticals, complementary to today's pharmaceuticals, to assist in the overall management of CHF.", 
    "298": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure, through the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II. Excessive RAAS activity may lead to hypertension and associated target organ damage. Indeed, RAAS blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor AT (1) blockers (ARBs) has proved to be successful treatment for arterial hypertension, heart failure and diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that arterial stiffness is an important and independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. More recently, a role for advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in the development of arterial stiffening has been suggested. Advanced glycation end-products form by a nonenzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and biological proteins. Mechanisms underlying these alterations include AGE cross-linking of collagen and AGE interactions with circulating proteins and AGE receptors. New pharmacologic agents that prevent AGE formation, break cross-links, or block AGE receptors reduce vascular and myocardial stiffness, inhibit atherosclerotic plaque formation, and improve endothelial function. These agents promise to reduce the risk of isolated systolic hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, diabetes and thus, heart failure.", 
    "299": "Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the second most common cause of chronic cough in immunocompetent patients who are nonsmokers, not on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and have normal chest radiographs. Identification of GER in chronic cough patients can be difficult; most patients with GER-related cough have no esophageal symptoms and no esophageal test is adequate to make this diagnosis. Post-hoc analysis of four prospective intervention trials has identified a clinical patient profile that can predict the presence of GER-related cough 91% of the time. Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the British Thoracic Society recommend initiating an initial empiric GER therapy trial, with esophageal testing being reserved for nonresponders. The empiric trial should include conservative measures and PPIs twice daily for 3 months. Selected patients who have dysphagia might benefit from the addition of a prokinetic agent. Esophageal manometry and pH testing with impedance monitoring (if available) should be performed in nonresponders while they are on therapy. It can take more than 50 days for cough to respond to medical GER therapy. Surgical fundoplication might be helpful in very carefully selected patients. Careful evaluation and treatment resolves cough in approximately 80% of patients with GER-related cough.",

    "301": "The identification and treatment of high-risk patients for cardiovascular disease reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality. Significant risk factors for cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients over and above dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity include coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular/carotid artery disease, and diabetes. Treatment options for the reduction of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients include diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists. All of these agents, in various combinations, have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even in high-risk patients. The use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (usually in combination with a diuretic) has proven especially effective in reducing cardiovascular events in diabetes and, although both classes of drugs target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, each has a different mechanism of action. Some investigators believe that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB, usually given with other medications, may be more effective than either agent alone with other drugs. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is evaluating the cardioprotective effect of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) plus an ARB (telmisartan) in high-risk patients.",

This article reviews some of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in patients with hypertension and these comorbidities and how they relate to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Inhibition of the RAS when utilized along with other antihypertensive medications has been particularly effective in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and vascular disorders; consensus group guidelines have reflected this in their treatment recommendations. Clinical trial data demonstrate that the effectiveness of RAS blockers is enhanced by maximizing the daily dose and combining these medications with thiazide diuretics.",

At the end of the beta-blocker titration period, a BP level <130/80 mm Hg was achieved in 37% of carvedilol-treated and 36% of metoprolol-treated participants who continued to receive a renin-angiotensin system blocker. In the approximately 60% of participants in whom a BP level <130/80 mm Hg was not attained with renin-angiotensin system blockade plus beta-blockade, hydrochlorothiazide was added in 43% and 44% of carvedilol and metoprolol groups, respectively; 25% (both arms) also required a calcium channel blocker. Among those in whom goal BP was not achieved, 42% of carvedilol- and 40% of metoprolol-treated participants were not titrated to the highest dose of beta-blocker. The use of carvedilol compared with metoprolol did not effect glycemic control.",

Prescription drug cost-sharing was measured as generosity ratio of actual to expected copayment. Other measures included demographics, Charlson comorbidity, type of health plan, and health care spending. Multivariate models showed that generous drug coverage was associated with an 11% to 19% increase in persistence (P<.05) in 4 of 5 antihypertensive drug classes compared with less generous drug coverage, controlling for the other measures. Less generous drug coverage is a risk factor for poor persistence among most new antihypertensive users.",

Urea-enalapril maleate-RAE inclusion compounds containing varying proportions of guests were prepared and their thermal behaviour studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Regression analysis revealed an excellent r(2) value with regard to the influence of the relative proportion of RAE on the heat of decomposition. The inclusion compounds were found to exhibit good content uniformity and improved dissolution profile as demonstrated by increased dissolution efficiency. Studies revealed that urea inclusion may be a promising alternative for the formulation of potent poorly soluble drugs into immediate release products.",

    "316": "Patients with heart failure in the \"real world\" are often elderly and with multiple comorbid diseases. These conditions create a dilemma for the physician responsible for the treatment of heart failure and are associated with a substantial underutilization of evidence-based treatments. Clarifying the prognostic impact of comorbidities in heart failure could provide more precise risk stratification and optimize the management of these patients. The negative prognostic impact of concomitant diseases has been shown in several studies: in the TEMISTOCLE study, carried out in Italy on patients hospitalized for heart failure in Internal Medicine and Cardiology wards, the presence of comorbidities was associated with higher in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay. In the IN-CHF registry, enrolling out patients with heart failure in a cardiological setting, the rate of coexisting diseases is not very high according to the epidemiological characteristics of this population. Renal impairment, particularly in patients >70 years old, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are frequent comorbid diseases in heart failure. Renal impairment has been recognized as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in heart failure while the role of COPD is controversial. Patients with renal dysfunction and COPD have largely been excluded from randomized controlled trials for safety reasons, so data are scarce. In the IN-CHF registry the prevalence of elderly patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine > or = 2 mg/dl and age > or = 70 years) is 5.1%; this subgroup of patients has an increased risk for both 1-year death (28.1 vs 11.2%) and hospital admission (34.9 vs 22.5%) compared with the remaining population. The prescription pattern has been evaluated in the last years (2003-2005) and shows that angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) as well as beta-blockers are less prescribed in these patients (78.9 vs 86.1% and 42.2 vs 55.9%, respectively). The prevalence of patients with COPD in the registry was 13.2%: considerable differences in COPD prevalence estimates exist in the general population depending on many factors such as method for diagnosis or lack of agreement on diagnostic criteria. COPD patients were older and with more severe symptoms; with respect to the pharmacological treatment, beta-blockers are significantly less prescribed in COPD patients while a similar proportion of patients are receiving angiotensin system antagonists. The adjusted analysis shows that COPD in not an independent predictor of 1-year mortality in this population while it is independently associated with 1-year all-cause hospitalization. Non-cardiovascular hospital admissions seem to be more influenced by the presence of this comorbidity than cardiovascular admissions.", 
    "317": "Anti-neurohormonal pharmacological agents successfully tested in randomized controlled trials over the last two decades - firstly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), then beta-blockers (BB) and more recently aldosterone receptor-antagonists (ARA) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) - have significantly contributed to increase the chance of favorable outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. An ACE-I and a BB, usually combined with diuretics and often with digoxin, continue to represent the cornerstones for the treatment of heart failure; moreover, most patients who are taking these drugs are now expected to receive as add-on therapies also an ARA and/or an ARB. However, as the number of available drugs increases coupled with the hope of greater clinical benefits, these more complicated pharmacological options are destined to generate even more controversy. Now, much debate is over to which triple (ACE-I + BB + ARA or ARB) and quadruple (ACE-I + BB + ARA + ARB) therapies may be offered. Current guidelines do not fully address the aim of providing straightforward guidance about what should be the third drug of the triple therapy and as to whether or not quadruple therapy may have any role in the present-day heart failure management. Adapting any pharmacological strategy--based upon both scientific evidence and clinical reasoning--to the specific profile of the individual patient can be helpful to circumvent uncertainties and errors in daily practice of medicine and make the best use of currently available drugs.", 
    "318": "For more than 30 years, beta-blockers have widely been used in the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure, certain cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Quite recently, however, beta-blockers have been put under trial by results of some controlled studies and meta-analyses conducted in patients with essential hypertension. In summary, beta-blockers proved not better, or even worse, than alternative treatments and only marginally better than placebo. However, some arguments of caveat must be remarked. First, most of these studies have been conducted in hypertensive subjects of old age or complicated by several concomitant risk factors. A considerable portion of hypertensive patients most frequently examined in the usual practice would have not meet inclusion criteria for the above trials. In addition, several methodological issues of meta-analyses raised concern. Results were mainly driven from two major trials (LIFE and ASCOT). Unexpectedly, recent hypertension guidelines issued by the British Hypertension Society fully endorsed these results and recommended beta-blockers as fourth-line drugs in hypertensive patients with blood pressure not adequately controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and diuretics in combination. Because most of the above trials used atenolol, several lines of evidence warn against extending limitations to beta-blockers to the entire class of these drugs. Some new-generation beta-blockers, although not yet widely tested in outcome-based studies, induce peripheral vasodilatation and do not exert the detrimental effect of atenolol on central blood pressure and arterial distensibility. The present review addresses facts and theories related to the actual concern on the role of beta-blockers in the modern management of hypertensive patients.",

Multivariate calibration models PLS at various pH and PARAFAC were elaborated from ultraviolet spectra deconvolution and captopril determination. The best models for this system were obtained with PARAFAC and PLS at pH = 2.04 (PLS-PH2). The applications of the method for the determination of real samples were evaluated by analysis of captopril in pharmaceutical preparations and biological (human plasma and urine) fluids with satisfactory results. The accuracy of the method, evaluated through the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), was 0.58 for captopril with PARAFAC and 0.67 for captopril with PLS-PH2 model.

Several well conducted clinical trials indicate that aggressive treatment of hypertension in individual with diabetes reduces these complications. Combinations of two or more antihypertensive drugs are frequently required to reach the target blood pressure and to improve the cardiovascular and renal outcomes in these patients. There are physiological and clinical rationales for renin-angiotensin system blockade in hypertensive diabetics. Trandolapril/verapamil sustained released (SR) is a fixed-dose combination of trandolapril and a sustained release formulation of verapamil and indicated in treatment of hypertension in patients who require more than one drug to reach target blood pressure. The antihypertensive efficacy of trandolapril/verapamil SR has been evaluated extensively in large trials. In the INVEST trial, a verapamil SR-based treatment strategy that included trandolapril in most patients was effective in reducing the primary outcome in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease. The new onset of diabetes was also significantly lower in the verapamil SR/trandolapril treatment group in comparison with those on the atenolol/hydroclorothiazide treatment group. The BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) documented that in hypertensive diabetes and normoalbuminuria, trandolapril plus verapamil or trandolapril alone delayed the onset of microalbuminuria independent of their blood pressure-reducing effect. Thus, trandolapril/verapamil is an effective option for treatment of hypertensive diabetes patients requiring more than one agent to achieve target blood pressure.",

The CIBIS-II study was the first large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrating in 2647 patients a dramatic reduction in mortality with a beta-blocking agent in CHF patients. CIBIS-III demonstrated in 1010 patients the equivalence of 2 different therapeutic strategies in de novo CHF patients. There was no difference in morbidity and mortality between sub-groups of patients receiving first bisoprolol or enalapril. These three trials also demonstrated the good tolerability of bisoprolol fumarate. Other studies were either limited in number of patients or not randomized. However, these studies confirmed the good tolerability of bisoprolol in CHF patients, even in elderly population.

    "331": "The physiological role of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is to maintain the integrity of the cardiovascular system. The effect of angiotensin II is mediated via the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1 ) resulting in vasoconstriction, sodium retention and myocyte growth changes. This causes myocardial remodeling which eventually leads to left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation and dysfunction. Inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) specifically inhibit the AT1 receptor. It has not been known until the performance of the VALIANT (valsartan in acute myocardial infarction trial) whether blockade of the angiotensin receptor with an ARB or combination of an ACE inhibitor and ARB leads to similar outcomes as an ACE inhibitor. The VALIANT trial demonstrated equal efficacy and non-inferiority of the ARB valsartan 160 mg bid compared with captopril 50 mg tds, when administered to high risk patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure in the immediate post myocardial infarction period. The combination therapy showed no incremental benefit over ACE inhibition or an ARB alone and resulted in increased adverse effects.

ACE2 is expressed mainly in the vasculature, heart and kidney. ACE2 removes a single amino acid of the carboxy terminal of peptides. In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), it is responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7, respectively. While ACE forms Ang II, a potent vasoconstrictor, ACE2 degrades this peptide to form Ang 1-7 which has an opposite action. Therefore, ACE2 counteracts ACE in the balance of vasopressor/vasodilator as well as heart and kidney function.

We studied 250 hypertensive patients who were receiving 3 antihypertensive drugs in a single morning dose. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to the modification in their treatment strategy: changing 1 of the drugs but keeping all 3 in the morning or the same approach but administering the new drug at bedtime.

Angiotensin II plays an important role in the generation of superoxide in several disease states, including hypertension and heart failure. The goal of this study was to determine whether the activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction after endotoxin. We examined the effects of enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or L-158809 (an angiotensin receptor blocker) on increases of superoxide and vasomotor dysfunction in mice treated with LPS. C57BL/6 mice were treated with either enalapril (60 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or L-158809 (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 4 days. After the third day, LPS (10-20 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally, and one day later, vasomotor function of the aorta was examined in vitro. After precontraction with PGF(2alpha), the maximal responses to sodium nitroprusside were similar in the aorta from normal and LPS-treated mice. In contrast, the relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired after LPS (54 +/- 5% at 10(-5), mean +/- SE) compared with vessels treated with vehicle (88 +/- 1%; P < 0.05). Enalapril improved (P < 0.05) relaxation in response to acetylcholine to 81 +/- 6% after LPS. L-158809 also improved relaxation in response to acetylcholine to 77 +/- 4% after LPS. Superoxide (measured with lucigenin and hydroethidine) was increased (P < 0.05) in aorta after LPS, and levels were reduced (P < 0.05) following enalapril and L-158809. Thus, after LPS, enalapril and L-158809 reduce superoxide levels and improve relaxation to acetylcholine in the aorta. The findings suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes importantly to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction after endotoxin.",

Additionally, the solid drug was subjected to 50 degrees C for 60 days in a dri-bath, and to the combined effect of temperature and humidity, with and without light, at 40 degrees C/75% RH. The products formed under different stress conditions were investigated by LC and LC-MS. The LC method that could separate all degradation products formed under various stress conditions involved a C18 column and a mobile phase comprising of ACN and phosphate buffer (pH 3). The flow rate and detection wavelength were 1 ml min(-1) and 210 nm, respectively. The developed method was found to be precise, accurate, specific and selective. It was suitably modified for LC-MS studies by replacing phosphate buffer with water, where pH was adjusted to 3.0 with formic acid. The drug showed instability in solution state (under acidic, neutral, alkaline and photolytic stress conditions), but was relatively stable in the solid-state, except formation of minor products under accelerated conditions. Primarily, maximum degradation products were formed in acid conditions, though the same were also produced variably under other stress conditions. The LC-MS m/z values and fragmentation patterns of two of the five products matched with enalaprilat and diketopiperazine derivative, previously known degradation products of enalapril. Also, m/z value of another product matched with an impurity listed in the drug monograph in European Pharmacopoeia. Rest two were hitherto unknown degradation products. The products were characterized through LC-MS fragmentation studies. Based on the results, a more complete degradation pathway for the drug could be proposed.",

We therefore conducted a study of laboratory-defined aspirin resistance in Korean patients with ischemic stroke and considered a wide range of factors as possible predictors.", 
    "356": "A total of 88 patients taking aspirin daily for the secondary prevention of stroke were included. Platelet function was assessed using the Rapid Platelet Function Assay-Aspirin (RPFA-ASA) system and the level of urinary thromboxane B2 (TX-B2). The result of the RPFA-ASA system was expressed as an aspirin reaction unit (ARU). We analyzed a wide range of factors including demographic data, stroke risk factors, and laboratory findings to identify the clinical predictors of aspirin resistance.", 
    "357": "Eleven (12%) patients were identified as aspirin resistant by the ARU criteria. Univariate analysis showed that an older age, lower LDL cholesterol levels, and concurrent use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers were related to aspirin resistance by ARU criteria. Aspirin resistance by urinary TX-B2 criteria was observed in 18 (25%) patients and associated with an older age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers. In multivariate analysis, this association lost significance by ARU criteria, and only lower fibrinogen levels were associated with increased risk by TX-B2 criteria. In addition, the stroke subtypes and the degree of atherosclerosis were not associated with aspirin resistance. The correlation between the two criteria was poor (r=-0.115, p=0.34).", 
    "358": "Despite the comprehensive analysis of this study, we failed to identify independent predictors for laboratory-defined aspirin resistance. Additionally, little overlap was found between the two criteria with which to assess aspirin resistance.", 
    "359": "Rennin-angiotensin system is involved in liver fibrogenesis through activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Telmisartan (Tel) is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, could function as a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activator. Here we studied the effect of Tel on liver fibrosis, pre-neoplastic lesions in vivo and primary HSCs in vitro. In vivo study, we used the choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA)-diet induced rat NASH model. The rats were fed the CDAA diet for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis and pre-neoplastic lesions, and then co-administrated with Tel for another 10 weeks. Tel prevented liver fibrogenesis and pre-neoplastic lesions by down-regulating TGFbeta1 and TIMP-1, 2 and increasing MMP-13 expression. Tel inhibited HSCs activation and proliferation. These results suggested that Tel could be a promising drug for NASH related liver fibrosis.",

Cardiac catheterization is typically reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis remains unclear, those requiring coronary angiography prior to valve replacement, and in the setting of complex valve disease. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has recently been applied as a research tool to quantify the amount of aortic valve calcium (AVC), which has served as a clinical end point in several medical therapy trials. Medical therapy for aortic valve disease remains an active area of clinical research. Multiple retrospective studies have shown a benefit for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins) in reducing disease progression. However, two recently completed prospective, randomized trials yielded conflicting results. The data for using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are in the preliminary stages. This review will focus on imaging methods that are available for patients with aortic valve disease and summarize the recent trials that have evaluated medical therapy aimed to reduce progression of aortic valve disease.",

After initial stabilization, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed that documented characteristic findings and saved the patient from an unnecessary laparotomy. Although rare, this etiology of abdominal pain and hypotension should be considered as more and more individuals are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

Compared with CAF patients treated without ACEI, the expression of ACE2 significantly increased (P < 0.01), and the relative activity of ERK1/2 significantly decreased (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of ACE and the level of atrial tissue Ang II remained unchanged in CAF patients treated with ACEI.", 
    "369": "The study suggested that the dysequilibrium of ACE/ACE2 might play an important role in the process of atrial fibrillation, which may be related to the activation of ERK1/2 pathway.

    "374": "Ventilator-induced lung injury is characterised by inflammation and apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study proposed a role for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) via angiotensin II (Ang II) and/or bradykinin in acute lung injury. The authors assessed whether ACE and, if so, Ang II and/or bradykinin are implicated in inflammation and apoptosis by mechanical ventilation. Rats were ventilated for 4 h with low- or high-pressure amplitudes in the absence or presence of the ACE inhibitor captopril. Nonventilated animals served as controls. ACE activity, Ang II and bradykinin levels, as well as inflammatory parameters (total protein, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and interleukin-6) were determined. Apoptosis was assessed by the number of activated caspase-3 and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labelling)-positive cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ACE activity, levels of total protein, inflammatory parameters and the number of apoptotic cells were increased in the high-pressure amplitude group as compared with the control group. Blocking ACE activity by captopril attenuated inflammation and apoptosis in the latter group. Similar results were obtained by blocking Ang II receptors, but blocking bradykinin receptors did not attenuate the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of captopril. The current authors conclude that inflammation and apoptosis in ventilator-induced lung injury is, at least in part, due to angiotensin-converting enzyme-mediated angiotensin II production.", 
    "375": "Recent studies suggest that statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have beneficial effects for some types of infections. The present study aimed to examine the association of outpatient use of these medications on 30-day mortality for subjects aged >65 yrs and hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. A retrospective national cohort study was conducted using the Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data including subjects aged >/=65 yrs hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia, and having >/=1 yr of prior Veterans Affairs outpatient care. In total, 8,652 subjects were identified with a mean age of 75 yrs, 98.6% were male, and 9.9% of subjects died within 30 days of presentation. In this cohort, 18.1% of subjects were using statins and 33.9% were using ACE inhibitors. After adjusting for potential confounders, current statin use (odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.70) and ACE inhibitor use (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.89) were significantly associated with decreased 30-day mortality. Use of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prior to admission is associated with decreased mortality in subjects hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. Randomised controlled trials are needed to examine whether the use of these medications in patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia may be beneficial.", 
    "376": "Heart Failure (HF) accounted for 3.4 million ambulatory visits in 2000. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation recommend aggressive pharmacologic interventions for patients with HF. This may include a combination of diuretics, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and digoxin. Nitrates and hydralazine are also indicated as part of standard therapy in addition to beta-blockers and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, especially but not exclusively, for African Americans with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. For those with acute decompensated HF, additional treatment options include recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide, and in the future possible newer agents not yet approved for use in the U.S., such as Levosimendan. Medical devices for use in patients with advanced HF include LV assist devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. For refractory patients, heart transplantation, the gold-standard surgical intervention for the treatment of refractory HF, may be considered. Newer surgical options such as surgical ventricular restoration may be considered in select patients.", 
    "377": "Nearly all type 2 diabetic patients are suffering from arterial hypertension. The latter usually becomes manifest earlier than the diabetic metabolic disturbances. Adequate treatment often requires a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)-inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Metoprolol is still the most frequently used beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in this setting. Some clinical trials have shown carvedilol to be superior in improving the metabolic situation and prevention of secondary disorders caused by diabetes. Therefore carvedilol may be the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist of choice for treatment of patients at high cardiovascular risk and especially for diabetes type 2. As comparisons to metoprolol succinate as well as to optimally dosed metoprolol tartrate are missing, a definite superiority of carvedilol cannot be assumed.",

On the contrary, in the recent large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT), CREATE and CHOIR, which aimed to keep a higher haemoglobin (Hb) level than former trials, the renoprotective effect of EPO was not observed. Today, the renoprotective effect of EPO has become controversial. In order to test the hypothesis that the usage of EPO in predialysis CKD patients may ameliorate the progression of renal disease, we conducted a macro-level observational study dealing with all Japanese predialysis CKD patients.",

Based on the 2002-2004 data, we calculated the annual incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in each of the 47 prefectures. The annual amounts paid for EPO by each prefecture, presumably corresponding to the amounts used, corrected for the estimated predialysis CKD patients, were calculated. We examined the relationship between the incidence of new dialysis and the usage of EPO in each prefecture. Furthermore, the usage of EPO was compared with that of antihypertensive agents including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), and that of statin.", 
    "385": "There were prefectural differences in the annual incidence of ESRD from 2002 to 2004. We also found prefectural differences in the usage of EPO for the three consecutive years. The usage of EPO in predialysis patients was negatively correlated with the incidence of ESRD on linear and multiple regression analyses. At the same time, the usage of EPO had strong positive correlations with the usage of antihypertensive agents including ACE-I and with that of statin.", 
    "386": "Our nationwide epidemiologic study revealed that a higher use of EPO was associated with a decreased incidence of new dialysis in daily clinical practice. In addition, there were strong correlations among the usage of EPO, antihypertensive agents and statin.

    "387": "Aliskiren, the direct renin inhibitor, is the first new class of drug available in 13 years for the treatment of hypertension. Renin has long been recognized as a preferred site for blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system because it prevents conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Aliskiren binds to the active site of the renin molecule, blocking angiotensinogen cleavage, thus, preventing the formation of angiotensin I. Clinical studies have demonstrated at least equivalent or superior blood pressure lowering efficacy compared with existing drugs with a favorable side effect profile. Aliskiren possesses possible synergistic potential when combined with a thiazide diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker both in terms of efficacy and tolerability. This review aims to define the role of aliskiren in the therapeutic management of hypertension.",

With regard to antihypertensive treatment, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists are still considered as first line options. Treatment may also be initiated using a fixed dose combination containing two agents lowering blood pressure by different mechanisms. This is particularly true in patients with systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/ or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, as well as in those with high cardiovascular risk.",

Six weeks after discontinuation of quinapril, amlodipine alone caused no change (0 +/- 3/-2 +/- 3) (mean +/- SD). The MSNA decreased by 3 bursts/100 heartbeats at visits 2 v 1 and 3 v 2 (P = .02 for time effect), regardless of treatment.

    "406": "Ongoing developments in our understanding of cardiovascular disease, together with the introduction of new drugs to treat these conditions, has led to much debate over the optimal management of hypertension. The ALLHAT study showed no major differences in cardiovascular outcome among three major classes of antihypertensive drugs. Indeed, large meta-analyses have substantiated this view, and most experts would agree that BP reduction matters more than the choice of antihypertensive agent. However, recently published data from the ASCOT-BPLA trial for hypertensive patients at moderate risk of cardiac events have caused some experts to re-evaluate this view. The recent Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration publication confirmed this change. In the ASCOT-BPLA trial, antihypertensive therapy based on amlodipine+perindopril significantly reduced total and cardiovascular mortality as well as other clinically relevant outcomes in comparison with a traditional strategy based on atenolol and a thiazide diuretic, despite both regimens producing nonsignificantly different reductions in brachial BP. These findings suggest that amlodipine/perindopril may exert a beneficial effect by acting on other parameters such as central BP or BP variability. ACE inhibitors have been shown to have antiatherosclerotic and antithrombogenic effects, to improve endothelial dysfunction, and to prevent cardiac remodeling in patients with coronary heart disease. In this regard, perindopril, which has relatively high affinity for ACE and true 24-hour duration of action, is one of the most extensively studied ACE inhibitors. More recent data suggest that ACE inhibitors reduce arterial stiffness, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, and have a beneficial effect on central aortic BP, thus providing a possible explanation for the findings of ASCOT-BPLA and confirming that ACE inhibitors are an appropriate first choice for patients with hypertension.",

For patients with chronic cough who are nonsmokers, have normal spirometry, and are not being treated with an ACE inhibitor, diagnosis usually focuses on differentiation between postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, alone or in combination.

    "413": "Regardless of the type of arterial reconstruction, luminal narrowing (stenosis or restenosis) develops in approximately one third of the vessels. In the past, the focus of research has been on the mechanisms of stenosis (intimal hyperplasia, pathologic remodeling) and pharmacologic approaches to prevention. An alternative approach is to induce intimal atrophy after luminal narrowing has developed, thus limiting treatment to only those patients that develop a problem. This approach to treat established disease by reducing wall mass through induction of cell death and extracellular matrix removal would be particularly useful for treating stenosis in synthetic bypass grafts or stented vessels, in which intimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism of stenosis. This approach may be applicable as well to other vascular proliferative disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension and chronic transplant arteriopathy. Proof of principle has been shown in experiments with antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors that cause neointimal regression in baboon polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that induce medial atrophy in hypertensive arteries. Possible molecular targets could include PDGF receptors, A20, and BMP4. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of such a therapeutic approach to vascular disease.", 
    "414": "We hypothesized that correction of insulin deficiency by pulsatile intravenous insulin infusion in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with nephropathy preserves renal function by mechanisms involving cardiac autonomic function, cardiac mass, or efficiency, or by hemostatic mechanisms. The control group (8 patients) received subcutaneous insulin (3-4 injections per day). The intravenous infusion group (10 patients) received three 1-hour courses of pulsed intravenous insulin infusion on a single day per week in addition to subcutaneous insulin. Laboratory measurements included 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring with heart rate variation analysis, platelet aggregation and adhesion, plasma fibrinogen, factor VII, von Willebrand factor, fibrinolytic activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and viscosity measured at baseline and 12 months. Blood pressure control was maintained preferentially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen utilization was measured with each infusion and showed rapid increase from 0.8 to 0.9 (P = .005) at weekly treatments through 12 months. We observed an annualized decrease in creatinine clearance of 9.6 mL/min for controls vs 3.0 mL/min for infusion patients. Annualized fall in blood hemoglobin was 1.9 vs 0.8 g/dL, respectively (P = .013). There were no differences between the control and infusion group with respect to glycohemoglobin, advanced glycated end products, cholesterol, or triglycerides. No differences between the study groups for hemodynamic or hemostatic factors were evident. Blood pressures were not significantly different at baseline or 12 months. We conclude that although preservation of renal function with attenuation of loss of blood hemoglobin during 12 months of intravenous insulin infusion was associated with improvement in the efficiency of fuel oxidation as measured by respiratory quotient, this occurred without differences in metabolic/hemostatic factors, cardiac autonomic function, cardiac wall, or chamber size. Our hypothesis that preservation of renal function in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with proteinuria by weekly pulsed insulin infusion involves mechanisms from the autonomic nervous system, cardiac size, and function, or elements of hemostasis was not confirmed.",

The solid-state degradation of enalapril maleate was monitored non-isothermally at temperature range from 25 to 200 degrees C and isothermally at various temperatures (115, 120, 125, 130, and 135 degrees C) for a few hours. The collected FT-IR spectra were subjected to self-modeling curve resolution (SMCR) in order to elucidate the pure component spectral estimates. Subsequently, the relative contributions from the observed species could be obtained by projecting the pure component spectral estimates onto the collected FT-IR spectra. Accordingly, the conversion factors from enalapril maleate to diketopiperazine were calculated and were fitted to various solid-state reaction models. The activation energy values (E(a)) calculated from seven nucleation models were ranging from 176.4 to 193.9 kJ/mol. This multivariate data analysis approach proves to be an effective tool for analyzing the kinetic spectroscopic data having a high degree of overlap between original compound and its degradation product since the information from the whole spectral range is used.",

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to kappa-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from kappa-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF.

A group of 339 patients, already receiving renin-angiotensin system inhibitor treatment, were randomly assigned to cilnidipine or amlodipine. The primary endpoint was a decrease in the urinary protein to creatinine ratio. After 1-year of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in both groups which did not differ between them. The urinary protein to creatinine ratio significantly decreased in the cilnidipine compared to the amlodipine group. Cilnidipine exerted a greater antiproteinuric effect than amlodipine even in the subgroup whose blood pressure fell below the target level.

We performed two studies. Study 1: In euthanized mice, DEXA scans were obtained before and after visceral fat dissection. The dissected fat weight was determined by DEXA (VF) and by direct weighing. Study 2: In anesthetized rat preparations, visceral (mesenteric) fat blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). After baseline, vehicle or 3 mg/kg enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was administered intravenously, followed by 2 ml/kg of 640 microm capsaicin intraduodenally.

In study 2, LDF signals showed an instantaneous decline when capsaicin was administered into the duodenal lumen. After enalapril treatment, the reductions were significantly attenuated compared with those after vehicle treatment. DEXA results combined with visceral fat dissection permit determination of body fat distribution. The instantaneous decline in visceral fat blood flow suggests that the reduction is a neural- rather than a hormone-mediated event, and attenuation by enalapril suggests angiotensin II plays a role.",

    "450": "Patients with a blunted fall in nocturnal BP (known as non-dippers) have a high risk of micro- and macrovascular complications, particularly if they have hypertension, but also in normotensive patients with diabetes. A blunted fall in nocturnal BP reflects the high level of CV risk in these patients. ABPM data indicating an altered circadian BP rhythm reverse circadian BP profile should alert the physician to the potential risk of complications and should lead to efforts to treat hypertension effectively, especially at night, and to check for sleep apnoea syndrome, particularly in cases of resistant hypertension, or autonomic neuropathy (postural hypotension), a well known risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients should be carefully screened for nephropathy. However, the definitions of \"non-dipper\" vary widely. Suitable treatments are poorly defined, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), diuretics, salt restriction and the maintenance of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be used as non-specific treatments. The efficacy of taking blood pressure-lowering drugs at bedtime rather than in the morning is still debated but deserves attention. In the diabetic population, brachial pulse pressure (PP) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, but not of all-cause mortality. It is also associated with complications of both type 2 and type 1 diabetes, this effect being stronger for nocturnal than for diurnal PP, and is strongly predictive of coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. The stronger association between PP and age in diabetic than in non-diabetic populations suggests that diabetes accelerates vascular ageing. In patients with incipient nephropathy or overt renal failure, PP increases CV risk. However, misinterpretation could be related to confusion between brachial PP and central PP.

Therefore, we investigated whether NA inhibited zinc-containing enzymes other than ACE in vitro. The results revealed that NA does not inhibit leucine aminopeptidase or alkaline phosphatase in rat serum.

In a study to examine the interrelationship between hypertension, hemostasis, and alcoholism, an examination of the impact of acetaldehyde on the effects of captopril and lisinopril upon PT was undertaken. It was observed that the pre-mixing of 7.7 x 10(-3) M captopril with 40.6 mM acetaldehyde for 30 min at R.T. prior to the addition to plasma results in a prolongation of PT which is less than that caused by acetaldehyde alone. Successive additions of captopril and acetaldehyde to plasma also yield a PT which is less than that of acetaldehyde alone. These data suggest that captopril may partially inactivate and detoxify the acetaldehyde effect on hemostasis upon interaction to form a thiohemiacetal. Captopril may prolong PT by the reduction of the S-S bridges in the coagulation factors. Lisinopril behaves similarly to captopril, prolonging PT. Successive additions of lisinopril and acetaldehyde, or pre-mixtures thereof, to plasma result in a lesser prolongation of clotting time relative to acetaldehyde alone. Since primary amines similar to that of lisinopril readily form Schiff bases with acetaldehyde, these data suggest that both captopril and lisinopril may act to detoxify the acetaldehyde effect upon plasma, albeit by different mechanisms.",

In this study we developed an accurate and reproducible method of quantitation of angiotensin metabolites through coupling of liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). With this method main angiotensin metabolites (Ang I, II, III, IV, 1-9, 1-7, 1-5) can be reliably measured in organ bath of rat tissues (aorta, renal artery, periaortal adipose tissue) and in medium of cultured endothelial cells (EA.hy926), exposed to Ang I for 15 minutes, in the absence or in the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindoprilat.

Twenty-two hypertensive patients with stage IIb peripheral occlusive arterial disease and severe claudication who had been successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent implantation were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of either candesartan (32 mg) or quinapril (20 mg). Primary end point was restenosis 6 months after intervention, assessed by angiography. Secondary end points were pain-free walking distance, determined by treadmill ergometry; determination of crurobrachial indices; and intima-media thickness (IMT). At 6 months, the rate of restenosis on angiography was 34% in the candesartan group and 71% in the quinapril group (P = .043). Relevant restenosis was found in 3 patients (27%) in the candesartan group and in 7 patients (64%) in the quinapril group. Patients in the candesartan group were able to walk farther on a treadmill (increase: 135 m +/- 20 m) compared with patients in the quinapril group (increase: 83 m +/- 21 m). The IMT at the stent edge was not significantly different in the 2 groups (candesartan: 1.9 mm +/- 0.5 mm; quinapril: 2.0 mm +/- 0.3 mm).

    "536": "We evaluated the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) blockers, losartan, an Ang II receptor blocker, and enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the development of autoimmune thyroiditis in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Mice were assigned into three groups, untreated, losartan-treated (30 mg/kg/day), and enalapril-treated (10 mg/kg/day) groups. Thyroiditis was induced by iodide ingestion (experiment 1) or mouse thyroglobulin (Tg) immunization (experiment 2). Both procedures effectively induced thyroiditis. While iodide ingestion failed to induce anti-mouse Tg antibody (TgAb) production, Tg immunization resulted in a significant increase in serum TgAb levels. In both experiments, neither losartan nor enalapril interfered with the development of thyroiditis and TgAb production. These results suggest that Ang II may not be associated with the development of autoimmune thyroiditis in NOD mice. Thus, the Ang II blockade may not have therapeutic potential in HT.",

All the patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (n=21, mean age 56.4 years) received standard cardiotropic therapy (nitrates, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors on demand, diuretics, antioxidants) and placebo. Group 2 (n=37, mean age 54.3 years) received the same standard cardiotropic therapy plus impase (1 tablet each other day for 3 months). The results of the trial show that impase addition to cardiotropic therapy raised exercise tolerance, diminished the number of anginal attacks in mild and moderate exercise, enhanced coronary microcirculatory blood flow, increased reserve circulation index by 34%, improved metabolism of vascular endothelium in the whole body. Impase acts pathogenetically in endothelial insufficiency. Prevention of endothelial dysfunction by impase allows both to stop progression of cardiovascular disease and to prevent erectile dysfunction.",

(2) Current therapies for scleroderma target the immune system, with the goal of reducing inflammation and secondary tissue injury and fibrosis. Therapy targeting underlying vascular disease is designed to improve the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and to reduce ischemic injury to involved organs. (3) Few controlled trials of therapy used for scleroderma are completed, and current treatments are largely based on organ-specific therapy and uncontrolled case series suggesting disease modification. (4) Recent randomised, controlled trials in scleroderma demonstrate promising results in the treatment of interstitial lung disease with cyclophosphamide, and vascular disease of the lungs and digits with endothelin receptor antagonists, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil and prostacyclins, while trials with methotrexate show only modest benefit in controlling scleroderma-associated skin disease. (5) Prostacyclins are a therapeutic option in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Modest benefits have also been shown with alpha1-antagonists and calcium channel blockers, while the effect of ACE inhibitors has been variable.

Serum adiponectin level increased by 18% (P<.05 vs baseline) and serum leptin level decreased by 16% with placebo (P<.05 vs baseline). These findings were potentiated further in the quinapril group. In comparison with baseline, flow-mediated dilation was increased by 13% in the placebo group (P=.055 vs baseline) and by 43% in the quinapril group (P<.001 vs baseline and placebo). These findings suggest that weight loss therapy improves endothelial function and markers of obesity.

    "540": "The American Heart Association scientific statement on the treatment of hypertension in the prevention and management of ischemic heart disease was published recently. The main recommendations were as follows: (1) For most adults with hypertension, the blood pressure (BP) goal is <140/90 mm Hg but should be <130/80 [corrected] mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, known coronary artery disease (CAD), CAD equivalents (carotid artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurism, and peripheral vascular disease), or 10-year Framingham risk score of >/=10%. For those with left ventricular dysfunction, the recommended BP target is <120/80 mm Hg. (2) For primary CAD prevention, any effective antihypertensive drug or combination is indicated, but preference is given to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and thiazide diuretics. (3) For the management of hypertension in patients with established CAD (stable or unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors (or ARBs) are the basis of treatment. If further BP lowering is needed, a thiazide diuretic and/or a dihydropyridine CCB (not verapamil or diltiazem) can be added. If a beta-blocker is contraindicated or not tolerated, diltiazem or verapamil can be substituted. (4) If there is left ventricular dysfunction, recommended therapy consists of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a beta-blocker, and either a thiazide or loop diuretic. In patients with more severe heart failure, an aldosterone antagonist and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (in black patients) should be considered.", 
    "541": "More than 1 medication is required in many hypertensive patients to reach blood pressure (BP) goals, and initial treatment with 2 agents has been recommended for patients whose BP level is >20/10 mm Hg above target. Diuretics reduce BP levels and the incidence of target organ complications and together with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers, which are recommended in patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, or diabetes, are effective antihypertensive combinations. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are also effective antihypertensive agents, and evidence suggests that a CCB/ACEI combination is well tolerated and also decreases the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. Some evidence suggests that this combination may improve endothelial function more than either agent alone, and its use could potentially lead to better cardiovascular outcomes than a diuretic/ACEI or diuretic/ARB combination. The ongoing Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial compares these 2 effective combinations (ie, an ACEI/diuretic and ACEI/CCB) as initial treatment for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in older high-risk hypertensive patients. The results of this trial, when reported, should help to clarify the relative benefits of these different therapies.",

Blood pressure levels were obtained by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were determined by immunoradiometric assay. Blood pressure level was normalized in the 4 treatment groups; the HCTZ and IRBE+QUIN groups showed an increased plasma aldosterone level after 12 weeks (9.1+/-2.2 to 14.1+/-1.4 and 6.9+/-1.9 to 12.9+/-2.3 ng/dL, respectively; P<.05), whereas plasma renin activity was increased only in the HCTZ group (0.9+/-0.2-1.7+/-0.2 ng/mL/h; P<.05).

Darusentan treatment decreased mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in a dose-dependent fashion compared with placebo; the largest reductions were observed at week 10 (300-mg dose) (systolic, -11.5+/-3.1 mm Hg [P=.015;] diastolic, -6.3+/-2.0 mm Hg [P=.002]). Darusentan (300 mg) also decreased mean 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime ambulatory blood pressures from baseline to week 10.

The primary outcome was the cost to prevent 1 patient from developing ESRD. Cost analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective in 2006 US dollars. As part of a treatment regimen, ARBs significantly reduced the incidence of ESRD and doubling of serum creatinine concentration (P<.05) but not total mortality. The cost to prevent 1 patient from developing ESRD was $31,729 (95% confidence interval, $19,443-$85,442; P<.01), $189,190 (P=.13) and $51,585 (P=.068) for patients receiving ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or either of them, respectively.

In surface waters, for example, photodegradation may constitute a relevant natural attenuation process for drug residues that have been discharged from sewage treatment facilities. In the present work, the photochemical fate of the prodrug enalapril (376 Da, C20H28N2O5) and its active metabolite enalaprilat (348 Da, C18H24N2O5), a hypotensive cardioprotector previously reported to occur in contaminated rivers, was investigated in aqueous media under the influence of irradiation generated by a sunlight simulator. The experiments yielded three detectable photodegradates for enalapril (346 Da, 2 x 207 Da) whereas the photolysis of enalaprilat went hand in hand with the intermittent buildup of one photodegradate (304 Da). Fragmentation patterns of the parent compounds were established on a hybrid quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometer exploiting its MS3 capabilities. Accurate mass measurements recorded on a hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight instrument in MS/MS mode allowed us to propose elemental compositions for the molecular ions of the degradates (346 Da, C19H26N2O4; 207 Da, C12H17NO2; 304 Da, C17H24N2O3) as well as of their fragment ions. Based on these complementary data sets from the two distinct mass spectrometric instruments, plausible structures were postulated for the four photodegradates. The compounds formed by enalapril corresponded to the loss of formaldehyde out of the proline residue (346 Da), cleavage of the central amide bond (207 Da) followed by migration of the ethylester side chain (207 Da) while decarboxylation of the free carboxylic acid was described for enalaprilat (304 Da).

    "560": "Previous studies demonstrated that the proximal tubule (PT) responds to isolated increases in basolateral ([CO(2)](BL)) or \"bath\" CO(2) concentration by increasing the HCO(3)(-) reabsorption rate (J(HCO(3))). Blockade of the rabbit apical AT(1) receptor or knockout of the mouse AT(1A) receptor eliminates these effects, demonstrating a requirement for luminal ANG II that the PT itself synthesizes. In the present study, we examined the effects of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril on J(HCO(3)) in isolated perfused rabbit PTs (S2 segment), using out-of-equilibrium solutions to make isolated changes in [CO(2)](BL) at a fixed baseline HCO(3)(-) concentration of 22 mM and fixed baseline pH of 7.4. Adding 60 or 240 nM lisinopril (in vitro K(i): 0.5 or 1.2 nM) to the lumen had no effect. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that the PT secretes either angiotensinogen or ANG I. However, adding 60 nM basolateral lisinopril significantly decreased J(HCO(3)) at a [CO(2)](BL) of 20%. Moreover, 240 nM basolateral lisinopril decreased baseline (i.e., at 5% CO(2)) J(HCO(3)) by one-half and completely eliminated the response to altering [CO(2)](BL) from 0 to 20%, but left intact the stimulatory effect of 10(-11) M basolateral ANG II. At extremely high concentrations (i.e., 100 microM), luminal lisinopril replicated the effects of 240 nM basolateral lisinopril. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that lisinopril readily crosses the basolateral (but not apical) membrane to block ACE in a vesicular compartment. We conclude that the isolated PT predominantly secretes preformed ANG II, rather than angiotensinogen or ANG I.",

    "588": "The increasing evidence that inflammation in the lungs leads to the structural changes observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whereas extrapulmonary symptoms and comorbidities may be systemic manifestations of these inflammatory processes, highlights an urgent need to discover novel, effective anti-inflammatory treatments for this disease. Some studies are suggesting that, by decreasing dynamic hyperinflation, bronchodilators might reduce systemic inflammation; inhaled corticosteroids and their combination with long-acting beta2-agonists might contribute to this goal. Even so, the opinion that suppression of the inflammatory response might improve systemic complications is stimulating a search for novel anti-inflammatory therapies. Many drugs include those that inhibit the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and/or antagonise their products. However, many of these therapeutic strategies are not specific for neutrophilic inflammation because they affect other cell types, thus, it is difficult to interpret whether any clinical benefit observed is a result of a reduction in airway neutrophils. In any case, there is some evidence that drugs used to treat a co-morbid condition, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiontensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers as well as glycosaminoglycans and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, might benefit chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients because they deal with the extrapulmonary, systemic component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", 
    "589": "The effects of captopril and Ang II on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and morphine self-administration in male Wistar rat were investigated. In CPP experiment, injection of captopril before test significantly decreased the difference of the time spent in compartment A between pre- and post-conditioning compared to morphine group. In self- administration experiment number of active lever pressing was significantly greater than passive in morphine group. In captopril group number of active lever pressing was significantly lower than morphine group however, there was not significant difference between active and passive lever pressed number. The results showed that captopril significantly decreased morphine-induced conditional place preference and morphine self-administration but the effect of Ang II was not significant. It can be concluded that RAS may have a role in rewarding properties of morphine.",

This complication accounts for much of the increased morbidity, mortality and costs of care associated with diabetes. Hypertension, dyslipidaemia, a pro-inflammatory phenotype, abnormal fibrinolysis and platelet activation, insulin resistance and high blood glucose concentrations all contribute to the increased risk of macrovascular disease in diabetes. Although reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, controlling blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aspirin have been shown to decrease CVD in diabetes, it is less clear that lowering glucose levels decreases risk. The PROactive trial was undertaken to test whether treatment with the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone could decrease the number of CVD events in high-risk patients with T2DM.",

In both conditions, the risks of morbidity and mortality appear to be further increased. Impaired insulin sensitivity is also a precursor for diabetes. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is implicated in the development of both hypertension and insulin resistance. Antihypertensive agents that act by blocking the RAAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may improve insulin sensitivity and therefore prevent the deleterious consequences of insulin resistance, including type 2 diabetes. ACE inhibitors appear to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension and insulin resistance, including diabetes.

    "604": "We describe the enzymes that constitute the major bradykinin (BK)-processing pathways in the perfusates of mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) and coronary vessels isolated from Wistar normotensive rats (WNR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The contribution of particular proteases to BK degradation was revealed by the combined analysis of fragments generated during incubation of BK with representative perfusate samples and the effect of selective inhibitors on the respective reactions. Marked differences were seen among the perfusates studied; MAB secretes, per minute of perfusion, kininase activity capable of hydrolyzing approximately 300 pmol of BK/min, which is approximately 250-fold larger amount on a per unit time basis than that of its coronary counterpart. BK degradation in the coronary perfusate seems to be mediated by ANG I-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase 24.11-like enzyme, and a dl-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid-sensitive basic carboxypeptidase; coronary perfusate of WNR contains an additional BK-degrading enzyme whose specificity resembles that of neurolysin or thimet oligopeptidase. Diversely, a des-Arg(9)-BK-forming enzyme, responsible for nearly all of the kininase activity of MAB perfusates of WNR and spontaneously hypertensive rats, could be purified by a procedure that involved affinity chromatography over potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor-Sepharose column and shown to be structurally identical to rat pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB). Comparable levels of CPB mRNA expression were observed in pancreas, liver, mesentery, and kidney, but very low levels were detected in lung, heart, aorta, and carotid artery. In conclusion, distinct BK-processing pathways operate in the perfusates of rat MAB and coronary bed, with a substantial participation of a des-Arg(9)-BK-forming enzyme identical to pancreatic CPB.",

In general, management of CHF complicating acute MI is similar in older and younger patients. Actions discussed include hemodynamic monitoring; the administration of oxygen; and the use of morphine, diuretics, nitroglycerin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, spironolactone, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, digoxin, and positive inotropic drugs.

    "611": "Despite a decade of successful clinical trials for stroke prevention, substantial gaps exist in the application and implementation of this information in community practice. The frequency of guideline use is low, and there remains controversy regarding the standard of practice. Patients with stroke may have multiple risk factors and concomitant stroke mechanisms, factors that are not addressed in stroke clinical trials and guideline statements. New guidelines are needed to account for these complexities and to provide primary care physicians a practical means to achieve stroke prevention. We sought to develop guidelines that can be implemented by primary care physicians to enhance the use of medical and surgical measures for recurrent stroke prevention. We sought to test the applicability of current evidence-based guidelines to daily practice with routine and complex patient case scenarios to determine whether these could be simplified into a more easily applied form for primary care physicians. We used RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology to develop guidelines for the use of interventions supported by randomized controlled trials including carotid revascularization, anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure management for the prevention of recurrent stroke. After a systematic literature review of randomized clinical trials we developed a comprehensive list of indications or clinical scenarios to capture decision making. A diverse multidisciplinary panel reviewed and rated each indication according to the RAND Appropriateness Method. First, panelists rated each scenario (1-3 for inappropriate, 4-6 for uncertain, and 7-9 for appropriate) without interaction with other panelists. \"Appropriate\" was defined as the expected health benefit exceeding its expected negative consequences by a sufficient margin. At a formal interactive session, panelists re-rated all indications. Overall carotid endarterectomy was rated as appropriate when there was 50% to 99% ipsilateral symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, inappropriate with <50% or 100% stenosis (total occlusion), and uncertain when the surgical risk was high. Carotid angioplasty was generally rated as of uncertain value. When there was atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with warfarin was rated as appropriate when there was a low bleeding risk but of uncertain value when the bleeding risk was high. For patients who were not candidates for warfarin therapy, aspirin, aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel were all rated as appropriate initial therapies. Ticlopidine was considered inappropriate and aspirin plus clopidogrel of uncertain value. With the exception of ticlopidine and aspirin, persons with a prior cerebral ischemic event while on aspirin could receive any of the aforementioned antiplatelet agents or combinations and be considered appropriately treated. The panelists rated a blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg at 1 year after ischemic stroke as the target level and rated any of the following agents as appropriate initial therapies if there was no diabetes mellitus or proteinuria: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor blockers, or combinations of a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Patient risk played a significant role in deterring the panel from recommending certain therapies; however, the presence of atrial fibrillation or large or small cerebral vessel syndromes rarely had significant influence on treatment decisions. Appropriateness was less where bleeding or surgical risk was excessive. Using consensus evidence from clinical trials, we have developed recurrent stroke prevention guidelines for routine and more complex patient scenarios according to appropriateness methodology. Broad application of these guidelines in primary practice promises to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke.", 
    "612": "The implementation of a differential kinetic spectrophotometric method for the determination of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in pharmaceutical formulations is described. The determination method was based on the monitoring (350 nm) of the reaction between captopril and iodate, in the presence of iodide, versus time and was fully automated by exploiting the multi-pumping flow concept. The developed multi-pumping flow system included four discretely actuated solenoid micro-pumps as unique flow manifold active components. The automatic control of the solenoid micro-pumps, under time-based and pulse-counting routines, allowed the implementation of a reliable and versatile analytical determination, with the additional advantage of permitting a runtime access to important analytical parameters, such as flow rate, sample insertion and reagent addition synchronisation, facilitating this way the establishment of an approach for kinetic measurements, directly due to the efficient solution handling and accurate timing control. A linear range of determination was verified for captopril concentrations between 10.0 and 60.0 microgmL(-1) with a sample throughput of about 100 determinations per hour. The results were in agreement with those obtained by the reference procedure with relative deviations between 1.81 and 4.48%.",

Using A549 cell xenografts grown in athymic mice, we measured the effect of ramipril on radiation damage to tumors. Ramipril did not alter tumor response to radiation despite different times of drug administration with respect to radiation delivery (drug started 2 weeks before or immediately after irradiation). In contrast, using the same dose, ramipril reduced normal tissue radiation injury (30 Gy x 2 or 6 Gy x 10) as assessed by a semi-quantitative scale of skin damage and relative leg contraction. The results indicate that ramipril could offer therapeutic gain due to its different effect on normal tissues and tumors.", 
    "614": "Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent reactions of relaxations of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) were examined in the aorta preparations of the two groups (6-8 and 21-22 month). The studies also two NO synthase (NOS) isoform activity--inducible (iNOS) and constitutive (cNOS), activity of arginase and nitrate reductase and the content of high-molecular nitrosothiols (HMNT) and low-molecular nitrosothiols (LMNT) and stable metabolites of NO (NO(-)2, NO(-)3). Aging rats demonstrated only endothelium-dependent responses of VSM to acethylcholine lowering. This endothelial dysfunction depend on high activity of arginase, iNOS and salvage (by nitrate reductase) NO synthesis, both reactive oxigen species (ROS) (by xanthine oxidase) and peroxynitrite generation, as well as low activity of constitutive (eNOS, nNOS) NO synthesis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) administration (20 mg/kg, 30 or 55 days) up regalate constitutive NO synthesis by arginase, iNOS, nitrate reductase activity and ROS and peroxynitrite generation inhibition thus restore endothelium-dependent relaxations of VSM in aging rats. The result obtained suggest a new roles for the renin-angiotensin system in vascular tone regulation. Thus enalapril might serve as a novel tool to prevent aging-associated endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "615": "Immunopharmacological studies of drugs used in cardiovascular diseases provide new data concerning their modulating effect on the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. Therefore, we have made an attempt to find out whether enalapril, quinapril and losartan (drugs used in the treatment of arterial hypertension) are able to modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine serum concentrations (tumor necrosis factor alpha - TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 beta _ IL-1 beta, interleukin-6 - IL-6) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The animals were divided into four groups as follows: SHR + M (control rats receiving 1% solution of methylcellulose), SHR + E (rats receiving enalapril - 10 mg/kg), SHR + Q (rats receiving quinapril - 10 mg/kg) and SHR + L(rats receiving losartan - 20 mg/kg). 1% solution of methylcellulose and hypotensive drugs were administered by a gavage for 21 days. Arterial blood pressure was measured in conscious rats, using the tail-cuff method. Twenty four hours after the last administration of enalapril, quinapril, losartan or 1% solution of methylcellulose, the rats received a single dose of LPS (ip; 0.1 mg/kg). After 2 h, the rats were anesthetized with ether and the blood samples were collected by heart puncture. Serum TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Additionally, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were evaluated. Enalapril, quinapril and losartan significantly decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta level after 21 days. Three-week administration of quinapril lowered IL-6 serum concentration after LPS stimulation. Enalapril and losartan did not affect the IL-6 level. The results were accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure. Hypotensive drugs also showed no effect on lipid level. The latest data indicate additional properties of hypotensive drugs. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate precisely the role of proinflammatory cytokines in arterial hypertension.", 
    "616": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) are involved in the regulation of renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of NEPand ACE in the regulation of vascular responses to angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II) and bradykinin (Bk) in the coronary circulation. For this purpose we used typical inhibitors of ACE and NEP, perindoprilate (1 microM) and thiorphan (1 micromM and 10 microM), respectively, and analyzed their effects on the coronary vasoconstrictor responses to Ang I and Ang II and coronary vasodilator responses to Bk in the isolated guinea pig heart. Perindoprilate abolished coronary vasoconstriction induced by Ang I and potentiated coronary vasodilation evoked by Bk. Thiorphan at a concentration of 1 muM slightly reduced response to Ang I without a significant effect on the responses to Ang II and Bk. However, thiorphan at a concentration of 10 muM abolished coronary vasoconstrictor response to Ang I and enhanced Bk-induced vasodilation. Importantly, in the presence of perindoprilate, addition of thiorphan (10 microM) did not modify further either responses to Ang I, Ang II or to Bk. In conclusion, vascular responses induced by Ang I, Ang II and Bk in the isolated guinea pig heart are regulated by ACE but not by NEP. Moreover, thiorphan is not a perfect tool to asses functional role of NEP as it displays ACE inhibitory activity.",

The levels of blood glucose, plasma lipid and microalbuminuria were lowered in APS-treated rats compared with control rats. The ratio of kidney weight over body weight was reduced and the renal function was improved after APS treatment. The mRNA level of NF-kappaB in renal cortex was decreased and IkappaB mRNA expression was raised by APS.

The present study was designed to investigate the potential antifibrotic and anti-oxidant effects of lisinopril, fosinopril and losartan in an experimental rat model of liver injury using carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). 2. First, the potential hepatoprotective dose of each drug was screened against CCl(4)-induced acute hepatotoxicity. Then, we chose the minimum hepatoprotective dose of each drug to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotection using a chronic model of hepatotoxicity induced by CCl(4). 3. Liver function was assessed in addition to histopathological examination. Furthermore, oxidative stress markers (reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxides levels) and markers of fibrosis (hydroxyproline content and liver fibrosis area) were assessed. 4. It was found that treatment of animals with different drugs concomitantly with CCl(4) significantly counteracted the changes in liver function induced by CCl(4) (except fosinopril). In addition, the drugs ameliorated the histopathological changes induced by CCl(4). All drugs significantly counteracted lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion (except fosinopril) compared with the CCl(4)-intoxicated group. Moreover, the drugs studied significantly reduced liver hydroxyproline levels and the area of fibrosis compared with the CCl(4)-intoxicated group. 5. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the hepatoprotective effect of lisinopril, fosinopril and losartan. Both lisinopril and losartan was found to have better hepatoprotective potential than fosinopril against CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity. These hepatoprotective effects can be explained on the basis of anti-oxidant and antifibrotic mechanisms, mainly enhancement of GSH and reduction of lipid peroxidation and fibrosis.", 
    "626": "Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global disease and its resultant complication, diabetic nephropathy, is a leading cause of chronic renal failure. Microalbuminuria is an early indicator of diabetic nephropathy and is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. Data have shown that anti-hypertensives like Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) reduce microalbuminuria and retards the progression of renal disease effectively in hypertensive T2DM patients. But the effects ofARBs on preventing microalbuminuria and ensuing nephropathy in normotensive patients with T2DM is yet to be fully established. To assess the anti-microalbuminuric effects of losartan therapy in normotensive T2DM patients. Interventional Phase Two Clinical Trial was done. Study was done at Diabetic Clinic, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Pakistan over 8 months. A total of 171 normotensive patients with T2DM and microalbuminuria were evaluated. After informed consent and baseline 24-hour urinary microalbuminuria quantification the selected patients were started on losartan 50 mg/day for a six-month period. Monthly follow-ups were done to monitor the blood pressure, glycemic control, urea/creatinine/potassium levels and any untoward effects of losartan therapy. Quantitative microalbuminuria was repeated at the end of study. Out of the 171 patients, 149 (87.1%) had significant albuminuria reduction >30.0% of their baseline and the variable of final outcome of intervention (urinary albumin in mg/dl) was significantly reduced (Mean 101.9 +/- SD 21.7 baseline and 47.5 +/- 12.9 post therapy) with p<0.001 and with minimal side-effects. These anti-albuminuric effects of losartan were reversible as seen on rechecking the urinary albumin two months after discontinuation of treatment. Losartan was well tolerated and demonstrated significant anti-proteinuric effects in patients with T2DM with early nephropathy independent of hypertension, warranting further long-term large-scale studies to prove its usefulness as preventive therapy for diabetic nephropathy.",

An aldosterone antagonist can be added in selected patients with moderately severe to severe symptoms of heart failure who can be carefully monitored for renal function and potassium concentration (serum creatinine should be <or=2.5 mg/dL in men and <or=2.0 mg/dL in women; serum potassium should be <5.0 mEq/L).", 
    "628": "We have previously shown that acute intravenous injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in diabetic rats evokes a baroreflex-independent sympathoexcitatory effect that does not occur with angiotensin receptor blockade alone. As ACE inhibition also blocks bradykinin degradation, we sought to determine whether bradykinin mediated this effect. Experiments were performed in conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats, chronically instrumented to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), 2 wk after streptozotocin (55 mg/kg iv, diabetic, n = 11) or citrate vehicle (normal, n = 10). Enalapril (2.5 mg/kg iv) decreased MAP in normal rats (-15 +/- 3 mmHg), while a smaller response (-4 +/- 1 mmHg) occurred in diabetic rats. Despite these different depressor responses to enalapril, HR (+44 +/- 8 vs. +26 +/- 7 bpm) and RSNA (+90 +/- 21 vs +71 +/- 8% baseline) increased similarly between the groups (P > or = 0.22 for both). Pretreatment with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (10 microg/kg bolus followed by 0.8.mug(-1)kg.min(-1) infusion) attenuated the decrease in MAP observed with enalapril in normal rats but had no effect in diabetic rats. Moreover, the normal group had smaller HR and RSNA responses (HR: +13 +/- 8 bpm; RSNA: +32 +/- 13% baseline) that were abolished in the diabetic group (HR: -4 +/- 5 bpm; RSNA: -5 +/- 9% baseline; P < 0.05 vs. preenalapril values). Additionally, bradykinin (20 microg/kg iv) evoked a larger, more prolonged sympathoexcitatory effect in diabetic compared with normal rats that was further potentiated after treatment with enalapril. We conclude that enhanced bradykinin signaling mediates the baroreflex-independent sympathoexcitatory effect of enalapril in diabetic rats.", 
    "629": "The emerging recognition that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disorder, characterized not only by local pulmonary inflammation, but also by systemic inflammation that might have an adverse impact on various extrapulmonary organs, such as the blood vessels and the heart, among others, emphasizes the need for new and more effective forms of therapy for this debilitating disorder. Fortunately, many of the 'standard' therapeutic options used to treat COPD have the potential to influence systemic inflammation. Moreover, several new therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the underlying inflammatory processes of COPD more specifically are under development. Unfortunately, we still do not know whether treatment of lung inflammation decreases, for example, the risk of acute cardiac events, progression of atherosclerosis or thrombotic events. It is also unclear whether, alternatively, treatment of heart disease can affect the progression of lung disease. Nonetheless, initial data seem to indicate that drugs, such as statins, ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers and PPAR agonists, used to treat a co-morbid condition have the potential to benefit COPD patients.", 
    "630": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is highly prevalent in patients on renal replacement therapy and is a leading cause of death in such patients. Several studies suggest that therapeutic agents for the treatment of CHF, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, are underused in end-stage renal disease patients with CHF. Although limited data are available, growing evidence suggests that therapeutic agents for CHF improve survival and are safe to use, assuming close monitoring of adverse events. The reluctance of physicians in prescribing these therapeutic agents and the reasons underlying the inconsistent use of these agents in the dialysis population need to be addressed.", 
    "631": "The link between cancer, hypertension and anti-hypertensive drug treatment is controversial. Despite numerous studies looking either directly or indirectly at cancer and hypertension, the results are often conflicting and do little to answer the dominant questions of cause and effect. Also, the treatment of hypertension has continued to evolve, with newer therapies being made available including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Whilst the potential link with cancer is thought to be small at worst, with the overall benefits of hypertension far outweighing its negative impacts, the suggestion of a carcinogenic role for either hypertension or its treatment continues to be an emotive issue, and needs firm answers. In this review, we provide an overview establishing the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments presented and highlight possible pharmacophysiological pathways involved.", 
    "632": "At present, thrombolytic agents represent the only direct way of augmenting fibrinolytic activity in humans. While these agents are proven to be efficacious in the treatment of acute thrombotic events, they are not a viable option for long-term administration. There are numerous drugs available that indirectly to increase fibrinolytic activity by reducing plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), including ACE inhibitors, insulin-sensitizing agents, and hormone replacement therapy in women. At present, efforts are underway to develop and test synthetic, selective PAI-1 antagonists. The potential applications of PAI-1 antagonists include thrombotic disorders (arterial and venous), amyloidosis, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and perhaps even type 2 diabetes mellitus. The availability of specific PAI-1 antagonists promises to expand the limits of understanding the role the fibrinolytic system plays in human disease and break through the current confines of therapeutic options that can effectively restore and augment the activity of the fibrinolytic system.", 
    "633": "The prevention of type 2 diabetes and of cardiovascular diseases is a major public health objective. Obviously life-style changes play a major role in this strategy. The Finnish Prevention Study recently demonstrated that the remarkable diabetes prevention observed after a 4-year lifestyle intervention is maintained after a further 3-year period of follow-up without prolongation of the active intervention. Such a reminiscent effect may also be observed in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases with various pharmacological interventions: an ACE inhibitor (HOPE), a statin (4S), a fibrate (Helsinki Heart Study) or an intensive insulin therapy in type I diabetic patients (DCCT-EDIC). These intriguing results argue for a long-term memory of previous therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular prevention.",

The age at diagnosis ranged from 4 months to 12 years (median 4 years). The age of 7 patients diagnosed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) ranged from 4 to 12 years. Three infants less than 2 years old presented with cardiomegaly. Obliquely elevated ST-T segments and the late peak T waves on 12-lead ECG were present in 8 patients (67%). Three patients with ST depression during exercise had no perfusion defects on radioisotope myocardial perfusion imaging. Two patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Of the remaining 10 patients, 7 have died: 4 died suddenly and 3 died of right heart failure. Three patients with a hypertrophic left ventricular wall had a prolonged survival. The probability of survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 78%, 52% and 26%, respectively.", 
    "636": "Obliquely elevated ST-T segments and the late peak T wave on ECG are characteristic, and reflect the restrictive physiology, which may indicate abnormalities of repolarization of ventricular muscle.

    "637": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from tuna dark muscle hydrolysate prepared by alcalase, neutrase, pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, and trypsin, respectively. Among hydrolysates, the pepsin-derived hydrolysate exhibited the highest ACE I inhibitory activity versus those of other enzyme hydrolysates. The structure of the peptide was identified to be Trp-Pro-Glu-Ala-Ala-Glu-Leu-Met-Met-Glu-Val-Asp-Pro (molecular weight 1581 Da) by time of flight mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, and the IC 50 value of the peptide was 21.6 microM. The Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that the peptide acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor, and the inhibitor constant ( K i) was calculated as 26.6 microM using the secondary plots. The peptide had an antihypertensive effect according to the time-course measurement after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. Maximal reduction was detected 3 h after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight. These results suggest that the peptide derived from tuna dark muscle would be a beneficial ingredient for functional food or pharmaceuticals against hypertension and its related diseases.", 
    "638": "Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a major complication in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). SRC occurs during the first 4 years of disease evolution in more than 75% of the cases, almost exclusively in patients with diffuse SSc. Other risk factors, including preceding corticosteroid therapy, have been associated with an increased occurrence of SRC. Prior to the late 1970s, SRC was a major cause of death in SSc patients. However, the prognosis has dramatically improved with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus, prompt diagnosis and early initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors therapy will improve the outcome. Nevertheless, additional antihypertensive treatments are often needed. Quite a large proportion of patients require dialysis, although this therapy may be stopped in approximately one-third of patients. Patients remaining on dialysis after 2 years can be proposed for a renal transplantation.", 
    "639": "The prevalence of heart failure and diabetes are both increasing: 25 to 30% of patients with heart failure suffer from diabetes, and the latter aggravates heart failure. The presence of macro- or micro-angiopathy, cardiac neuropathy or renal failure worsens the clinical pattern and disturbs treatment strategies. Doppler-echocardiography and the dosage of BNP can probably help to detect and consequently to treat prematurely heart failure in the diabetic patient. The usual treatments in heart failure have similar or lower efficacy in the diabetic patient, and treatment intolerance is frequent. Treatments used for diabetes can be handled with difficulty in case of heart failure (metformin, glitazones). In the future, it is therefore extremely important: 1--to prevent the occurrence of diabetes in patients with glucose intolerance; 2--in diabetic patients, to prematurely detect cardiac dysfunction and optimally control diabetes, in order to avoid its occurrence; 3--and finally, in diabetic patients with heart failure, to optimize the medical treatment, in order that these patients have similar benefits compared to non-diabetic patients with heart failure. The ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-2 antagonists seem to have an important role. Treatments breaking the glycation bridges, as well as statins, appear as interesting therapeutic options. Finally, the exact role of myocardial revascularization, either by angioplasty or surgery, might probably be important.",

One trial (PROGRESS) compared Asians with non-Asians, reporting that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (vs placebo) were equally effective for preventing stroke in both groups. In the LIFE trial, post hoc analyses showed different outcomes for blacks and nonblacks, raising questions about the usefulness of angiotensin-receptor blockers as first-line antihypertensive agents in blacks. In 3 studies conducted exclusively in Asians (JMIC-B, FEVER, NICS-EH), calcium channel blockers were effective in preventing cardiovascular outcomes.

The present study investigated the mechanism by which ACE influences the myogenic differentiation using the ACE-transduced C2C12 cells. Overexpression of ACE induced the down-regulation of myosin heavy chain, a late myogenic marker at 3-5 days after induction of differentiation. ACE-transduced cells exhibited the immature myotubes but an early myogenic marker (myogenin) was transiently increased at day 1. In ACE-transduced cells, phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effector (p70S6K) was suppressed at 2-5 day. However, upstream effector of mTOR (Akt) was transiently suppressed at day 3. Expression of IGF-II mRNA, which is controlled by mTOR, was also down-regulated during the differentiation in ACE-transduced cells. On the other hand, the treatment of cells with captopril, an ACE inhibitor, induced up-regulations of myosin heavy chain and phosphorylated p70S6K. These results suggest that ACE negatively regulates the myotube maturation via impairment of mTOR function.",

The mechanisms underlying EtOH-induced susceptibility to lung injury continue to be defined. This study examines the hypothesis that EtOH increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activity in the lungs of a rat model of chronic EtOH ingestion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets containing EtOH (36% of calories) or maltose-dextrin as an isocaloric substitution for EtOH (control) for 6 weeks. Selected animals were also treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (3 mg/l in diet) for 6 weeks. At study completion, animals were sacrificed, and lung tissue was collected for assays of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were isolated for analysis of NO release. Compared to the control diet, chronic EtOH ingestion increased lung H2O2 production, eNOS expression and activity, lung cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content, and levels of protein nitration and oxidation. MVEC from animals with chronic EtOH ingestion released greater amounts of NO. EtOH-induced increases in lung H2O2 production, eNOS expression and activity, cGMP content, protein nitration and oxidation, and MVEC NO production were all attenuated by treatment with lisinopril. Chronic EtOH ingestion stimulates ACE-dependent increases in NO production in the lung. These novel findings indicate that chronic EtOH ingestion increases reactive species production in the lung parenchyma and provide new insights into mechanisms by which EtOH causes phenotypic alterations in the lung and alters the lung's response to inflammatory stimuli.",

No longer considered a benign consequence of aging, valve calcification is the result of an active process that, much like atherosclerotic vascular disease, is preceded by basement membrane disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lipid deposition and is associated with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and tobacco use. These realizations, in addition to pathological insights gained from emerging imaging modalities, have lead to the exploration of a variety of therapeutic interventions to delay or prevent the progression of DAVD. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and matrix metalloproteinase have all been studied as potential disease modifiers.

Studies on the cardio-renal efficacy of combined therapy with ACE-i and ARB are not available or not conclusive, in a population with cardiovascular risk with micro- or macroalbuminuria. In this paper, we present the protocol of a randomized controlled clinical trial that will address the question. The LIRICO (Long-term Impact of RAS Inhibition on Cardiorenal Outcomes) study will evaluate the comparative efficacy for cardiovascular and renal outcomes of combined therapy with ACE-i and ARB versus monotherapy with ACE-i or ARB in micro/macroalbuminuric individuals at cardio-renal risk. The study will enrol 2100 patients allocated to monotherapy with ACE-i, ARB or combined treatment with ACE-i + ARB. The LIRICO study is a randomized comparative trial, with PROBE (Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point) design. The study has been approved and funded by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA) within the 2005 funding plan for independent research on drugs. Availability of funding for this study provides, for the first time in our Country, an opportunity to organize a collaborative national network of nephrology, internal medicine and diabetology outpatient clinics to develop a large multicentre trial collaboration. The results of this trial will establish the optimal therapy for micro/macroalbuminuric individuals with cardiovascular and renal risk.", 
    "679": "Recent studies questioned the existence of a specific renoprotective effects of ACE-inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) besides their blood pressure lowering effect. In the ALLHAT study patients were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, amlodipine and lisinopril. Results showed that, even in patients with reduced GFR, neither lisinopril nor amlodipine was superior to chlorthalidone in reducing the rate of development of ESRD or a 50% or greater decrement in GFR. Because of inclusion criteria the ALLHAT population was selected as at low risk for renal outcomes. Moreover, over 50% of the patients who were randomized to lisinopril either never received the medication or received the lower possible dose. Casas et al selected RCT comparing ACE-i and ARBs with other regimens. They concluded that ACE-i and ARBs are not more renoprotective that can be explained by lowering of blood pressure (BP) in diabetic nephropathy, while in non diabetic kidney disease a blood pressure independent renoprotective effect is uncertain. They made a very heterogeneous selection of trials that was dominated by the ALLHAT study; the analysis was not based on individual patient data. The Benedict Study showed that in hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, BP reduction and ACE-i therapy both independently may prevent microalbuminuria. ACE-i therapy is particularly effective when BP is poorly controlled. We conclude that the recommendation of the Guidelines to use ACE-i and/or ARBs as first-line antihypertensive drugs for renoprotection in patients with diabetic and non diabetic kidney disease is still valid.",

The present studies were performed to explore the interaction between ANG II and ET-1 in up-regulating the expression of arginine vasopressin V(2) receptor in the IMCD of the rat. Two sets of studies were done. In the first set of studies, rat IMCD tissue was isolated and incubated with ANG II in combination with ET(A) or ET(B) antagonist. In the second set of experiments, rat IMCD tissue was incubated with ET-1 with ANG receptor antagonist saralasin. Tissue samples were then analyzed by means of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The ANG II treatment resulted in increased V(2) messenger RNA (mRNA) from control level of 138 +/- 12 amol/microg of total RNA to 385 +/- 63 amol/microg of total RNA (P < .01). The ANG II/ET(A) treatment resulted in no significant decrease in V(2) mRNA expression (319 +/- 59 amol/microg of total RNA), whereas ET-1/ET(B) antagonist and ET-1/ET(A)/ET(B) antagonist treatments resulted in reducing V(2) mRNA to control levels of 214 +/- 25 and 176 +/- 22 amol/microg of total RNA, respectively. The ET-1 treatment increased V(2) mRNA expression from control level of 221 +/- 25 amol/microg of total RNA to 383 +/- 43 amol/microg of total RNA (P < .02). The ET-1-induced increase in V(2) mRNA expression was significantly reduced to control level (210 +/- 36 amol/microg of total RNA) after saralasin treatment. Western blotting revealed that changes in protein expression in the different treatment conditions were comparable with changes in V(2) mRNA expression. These data suggested that the up-regulation of V(2) receptor induced by ANG II and ET-1 is mediated by both vasoconstricting hormones. These 2 systems interact in up-regulating the expression of V(2) receptors in the kidney.",

This study assessed temporal trends and racial differences in the use of statins, BBs, and ACEIs or ARBs after MI discharge in community-dwelling seniors. Administrative data from pharmacy assistance programs and Medicare in 2 states (1995 to 2004) were used to identify all patients hospitalized for MI who survived > or =90 days after discharge. Age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and MI-specific procedures during hospitalization were assessed. The study outcomes were filled prescriptions for any statin, BB, or ACEI or ARB <90 days after discharge. Multivariate regression was used for trend and racial difference analyses. Of 19,368 patients identified, 6,577 (34.0%) filled prescriptions for statins, 12,387 (64.0%) for BBs, and 9,934 (51.3%) for ACEIs or ARBs <90 days after MI discharge. The use of these drugs increased from 1995 to 2004, most steeply for statins (11% to 61%), less so for BBs (47% to 80%), and least for ACEIs or ARBs (46% to 58%) (all p for trend <0.001). Black patients were 14% and 5% less likely to receive statins and BBs, respectively (all p <0.05). No evidence of an interaction between race and time trend was found. In conclusion, the use of cardiovascular medications after discharge from MI hospitalization in older patients may still be inadequate but has increased over time. The underuse of statins and BBs was marked in black patients and did not improve over time.",

Two binding modes differing in the orientation of imidapril on the active site were identified, and its hydrophobic group appeared to preferentially interact with the S1 site compared with the S1' site. Compared with the lisinopril-MMP-9 model in our previous study, imidapril was stabilized effectively on the active site with less of molecular distortions. We also measured ACE and MMP-9 inhibitory activities of imidapril and lisinopril after myocardial infarction. Imidapril had a stronger inhibitory activity against MMP-9 than lisinopril. These findings show that imidapril inhibits MMP-9 directly like lisinopril and its hydrophobic interactions with the S1 site of MMP-9 would be important for enhancing inhibitory activity.",

Additionally, renal insufficiency (creatinine 11.4 mg/dl, urea 157 mg/dl), with oliguria, anaemia and a severe relapse of nephrotic syndrome, was present. Initial treatment with steroids, albumin-furosemide infusions and antihypertensive drugs was unsuccessful, and dialysis treatment was necessary. Renal biopsy showed an advanced stage of the known FSGS and, surprisingly, a thrombotic microangiopathy. Further diagnostic investigations revealed no signs of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, but echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive retinopathy grade 3 was diagnosed, making severe hypertension the most likely reason for the thrombotic microangiopathy. While adequate antihypertensive treatment led to regress of left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive retinopathy, renal function did not recover, and the patient remained dialysis-dependent.

    "722": "Cardiovascular diseases (CDs) are among the most encountered pathologies in western countries; with obesity reaching pandemic proportions, they are soon to become a worldwide problem. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for CDs, and its tight control is an imperative for the treatment of complications such as renal diseases, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. Blood homeostasis and vascular tone are regulated through at least 3 major closely interrelated pathways in which zinc metallopeptidases modulate the concentration of vasoactive mediators. Those extensively studied vasopeptidases were therefore rapidly targeted with specific inhibitors in order to control the levels of vasoconstrictors [angiotensin II (AII) and endothelin-1 (ET-1)] and vasodilators [bradykinin (BK) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)], thereby controlling blood pressure. The first class of inhibitors to be developed were against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), recently followed by dual inhibitors of ACE/neprylisin (NEP), NEP/endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), and finally triple ACE/NEP/ECE inhibitors. The dual and triple inhibitors are defined as vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI). In addition to their ability to effectively lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients, drugs targeting these enzymes also displayed antiinflammatory and antifibrotic activities. The major point emerging from recent studies undertaken to improve the management of CDs is that the combined action of different therapeutic strategies (ie, simultaneous modulation of several neurohumoral mediators) shows better results than conservative therapeutic approaches. In this review, we historically present the advances made in the comprehension of the different mechanisms of blood pressure regulation and some of the drugs that arose from this understanding.",

The present in vivo study shows that the inhibitory effect of [Met(5)]enkephalin-Arg(6)-Phe(7) administered intra-third-ventricularly on the tail-flick response was increased more than 1000-fold by the intra-third-ventricular pretreatment with three peptidase inhibitors. The antinociceptive effect produced by the [Met(5)]enkephalin-Arg(6)-Phe(7) in rats pretreated with any combination of two peptidase inhibitors was significantly smaller than that in rats pretreated with three peptidase inhibitors, indicating that any residual single peptidase could inactivate significant amounts of the [Met(5)]enkephalin-Arg(6)-Phe(7). The present data, together with those obtained from previous studies, clearly show that amastatin-, captopril-, and phosphoramidon-sensitive enzymes play important roles in the inactivation of endogenous opioid peptides, such as [Met(5)]enkephalin, [Met(5)]enkephalin-Arg(6)-Phe(7), [Met(5)]enkephalin-Arg(6)-Gly(7)-Leu(8), and dynorphin A (1-8), administered intra-third-ventricularly to rats.",

    "725": "To elucidate an anti-inflammatory role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in cardiovascular disease, we studied the effect of ACEIs in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment of human monocytic THP-1 cells with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; 100 ng/ml; 10 min) significantly increased their adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under flow condition (P < 0.001). Preincubation of THP-1 cells with imidaprilat (50 nM; 4 h), an active metabolite of imidapril, reduced MCP-1-triggered THP-1 cell adhesion (P < 0.01). Similar effects were obtained with experiments using human peripheral monocytes (P < 0.05). MCP-1 activated protein kinase C (PKC)alpha in THP-1 cells, resulting in the up-regulation of alpha4 and beta2 integrin. Imidaprilat attenuated MCP-1-induced PKC activation and integrin up-regulation in THP-1 cells. Imidaprilat also inhibited THP-1 cell adhesion induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent PKC activator. In attempt to elucidate the mechanisms for the modulation of PKC activity by imidaprilat, we found that MCP-1 or PMA increased labile zinc in THP-1 cells, which was canceled by imidaprilat. Indeed, zinc/pyrithione activated PKC and increased THP-1 cell adhesion. Zinc chelator as well as PKC inhibitor inhibited these processes, suggesting the role for labile zinc in PKC activation and THP-1 cell adhesion. Imidaprilat attenuated zinc/pyrithione-induced PKC activation and THP-1 cell adhesion. These data suggest that ACEI reduces MCP-1 or PMA-triggered monocyte adhesion to activated HUVECs by modulating labile zinc in monocytes. Our findings may point out a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of ACEIs in atherogenesis.",

A peer-reviewed and published Markov model was used to simulate progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD and all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Three treatment strategies were evaluated: (i) 'control' regimen of conventional antihypertensive therapy (excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2-receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers), (ii) 'early irbesartan' 300 mg daily and (iii) 'late irbesartan' 300 mg daily (started when overt nephropathy developed). Transition probabilities determining nephropathy progression were taken from the Irbesartan in Reduction of Microalbuminuria-2 study, Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and other published sources. Outcomes were projected over 25 years. The mean +/- SD cumulative incidence of ESRD was reduced by 8.8% +/- 0.6 and 12.4% +/- 0.7 in patients treated with early irbesartan compared with late irbesartan and control respectively. Early irbesartan treatment improved undiscounted LE by 1.38 +/- 0.08 years (discounted: 0.81 +/- 0.04 years) compared with late irbesartan and 1.41 +/- 0.08 years (discounted: 0.83 +/- 0.04 years) compared with control. Early irbesartan treatment was projected to save (mean +/- SD) pounds 2310 +/- 327 and pounds 3801 +/- 327 over patient lifetimes compared with late irbesartan and control respectively. Irbesartan treatment is predicted to improve survival and reduce costs in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria compared with 'control'. Early irbesartan treatment is more effective than late irbesartan. Irbesartan is a valuable treatment option in this patient group in a UK setting.", 
    "727": "Several studies have questioned the effect of hypertension on cognitive functions. Event related potentials (P300) have been used as a reliable and reproducible indicator of cognitive functions. In this non-randomized, open label study we investigated cognitive functions using event related potentials in newly diagnosed mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients and whether or not there was any effect of antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on the event related potentials. We selected twenty male patients of newly diagnosed mild to moderate essential hypertension by using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring who were previously untreated and compared their event related potentials with 10 normotensive controls. At the beginning of the study, the hypertensive group showed increased P300 and N2 wave latency as compared to the normotensive control subjects. After three months of Ramipril therapy at a dose of 5mg per day, there was a significant decrease in all the ambulatory blood pressure parameters and the mean P300 latency from the pretreatment values. But no significant change in the N2 latency was observed. Thus, treatment with Ramipril 5 mg daily for a period of three months can reverse some aspects of cognitive dysfunction associated with hypertension.",

Similarly to other physicians, PCP suspected CHF on the ground of ankle oedema (88%), dyspnoea (75%) and basal pulmonary crepitations (44%). Most questioned doctors ordered a chest X-ray (58-86%) to establish the diagnosis. Echocardiography was underused by PCP (19%) in comparison to other doctors (68-86%). Under-utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (-68 to -79%; NS) and, especially, beta-blockers (-35% by PCP to -51% by CARD; p < 0.05) was observed. The recommended target dose of enalapril knew more CARD (52%) and INTD (45%) than PCP (25%) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The appropriate target dose of carvedilol knew 3% of PCP, 8% of CARC, 9% of INTD and 14% of CARD (PCP vs. CARD; p < 0.01).",

Importantly, it is intimately associated with non-healthy lifestyles such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and heavy drinking. To define CKD direct measurement of GFR or estimation of GFR (eGFR) is required. Japan Society of Nephrology is asking nationwide project to create \"original\" equation without using ethnic factor to obtain eGFR. Early detection and early treatment are vital to prevent not only CKD progression but also cardiovascular events. A comprehensive health education campaign and screening of the general populace are needed in order to detect CKD early. The control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, obesity, are intervention strategies that retard or prevent progression of CKD. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can be beneficial, especially if proteinuria is present.",

Stopping two of those arterial hypotensive drugs, without any of the conventional treatments for diabetic macular edema, resulted in rapid improvement of visual acuity from counting fingers to 20/50 in the right eye, and from 20/80 to 20/25 in the left eye, and complete resolution of macular edema and improvement of retinopathy.

We found that 48.5% of the patients demonstrated initial improvements in LV function after initiation of medical therapy, and the improvements appear to be sustained (88% of patients) at 44 +/- 21 months follow-up. A nonischemic etiology and younger age were the only independent predictors of change of LV ejection fraction of 10 or more at a mean 8.4 +/- 3.4 months after optimal medical therapy.

Although garlic extract administration had no significant effect on serum glucose, it significantly strongly decreased the serum ACE activity. ACE activity was higher in diabetic than nondiabetic rats, but in diabetic animals treated with garlic extract, the elevation of ACE activity did not occur.

Pharmacologic agents, including the myocardial cell membrane receptor agonists adenosine, bradykinin/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, opioids and erythropoietin or the mixed cell membrane and intracellular agonists, glucose insulin potassium, and volatile anesthetics, either clinically or experimentally reduce the extent of myocardial injury when administered just prior to reperfusion. Agents that specifically target proteins, transcription factors or ion channels, including PKC agonists/antagonists, PPAR, Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase and the ATP-dependent potassium channel are also promising. However, no agent has been specifically approved to reduce reperfusion injury clinically. In this review, we will discuss the advantages and limitations of agents to combat reperfusion injury, their market development status and findings reported in both clinical and preclinical studies.

Quinaprilat application attenuated the amount of VEGF significantly and of flk-1 slightly but not that of flt-1. In contrast, IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) proteins were elevated in I/R hearts (3-/1.4-fold vs. C) and further increased in the presence of Q. These findings were accompanied by an elevation of laminin mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we observed an increase in collagen Type IV and chondroitin sulfate content in I/R (2.9-/1.4-fold) and Ang I (3.5-/1.5-fold) hearts. Quinaprilat significantly reduced laminin and chondroitin sulfate proteins.",

    "760": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1-receptor (AT1R) blockers has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. The question is no longer whether RAS inhibition helps, but rather how we can optimize inhibition to achieve optimal cardiovascular and renal protection. Indeed, numerous data have shown that the RAS is not blocked fully over 24 hours with current doses of RAS blockers because they trigger a counter-regulatory renin release that can offset pharmacologic inhibition of the RAS. This absence of full blockade may have clinical implications. Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and AT1R antagonists thus has been proposed to inhibit the biological effects of the reactive renin release triggered by single-site RAS inhibition. By using this approach, numerous experimental and clinical studies have suggested that this combination therapy has additive or synergistic effects on blood pressure and on the prevention of cardiovascular and renal lesions. Although similar intensity of RAS blockade can be achieved by either combination therapy or by using high doses of an AT1-receptor antagonist given alone, the ACE inhibitor present in the combination interferes with the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway and the N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro metabolism, which both may have additional biological effects.", 
    "761": "Renin inhibitors are now available in therapeutic doses and it is accepted that they decrease blood pressure as efficiently as the classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs). One major issue will be to know how, beyond the normalization of blood pressure, renin inhibitors (RIs) will compare with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs for their ability to protect the organs against the tissue damage associated with overactivation of the RAS. The mechanism(s) of tissue protection may involve the inhibition of a direct cellular effect of renin and prorenin mediated by the (pro)renin receptor ([P]RR). This review updates the recent findings on (P)RR; its role in hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy; and the effects of a putative (P)RR antagonist.", 
    "762": "Evidence that renin system blockade is useful in many patients with hypertension is overwhelming. Two recent lines of investigation have suggested that more complete blockade leads to improved clinical outcomes. One line of investigation involves the use of a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin-receptor blocker. The second line of investigation involves the use of very high dose angiotensin-receptor blocker. The interaction of renin with substrate is the rate-limiting step in the renin cascade; thus, the recent development of a powerful renin inhibitor also favors more complete blockade of the system. In many patients, this is likely to lead to improved treatment.",

While aspirin is accepted as standard therapy in these patients, recent trials demonstrate that a combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel is superior to aspirin monotherapy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers may also reduce recurrent stroke. The ongoing Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial is designed to evaluate whether extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel, and whether telmisartan in addition to usual care, in individuals after a stroke, will reduce the risk of further strokes. PRoFESS is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving 695 sites from 35 countries or regions. The primary outcome for the trial is recurrent stroke, using a time-to-event analysis. Safety is evaluated by assessing the risk of major hemorrhagic and other serious adverse events.

    "764": "The suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been proven in many studies to treat hypertension and reduce cardiovascular events; however, reducing angiotensin I receptor stimulation results in the loss of the negative-feedback signal, leading to increased plasma renin activity. Numerous direct renin inhibitors were synthesized, but abandoned owing to low potency, poor bioavailability and short half-life. Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor of a novel structural class, inhibits the activity of the renin produced and, thus, its capacity to form angiotensin I, as measured by plasma renin activity. Aliskiren has been recently shown to be efficacious in hypertensive patients at once-daily oral dosing with favorable pharmacokinetics and the potential to improve end-organ protection.",

We identified subjects aged under 35 on antihypertensive treatment, from the Health Surveys for England, 1998-2004. Pretreatment systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated by adjusting on-treatment blood pressures for the effects of treatment. Treatment effects were derived from meta-analysis. Subjects were classified as hypertensive if pretreatment blood pressure was >or=160/100 mm Hg, or was >or=140/90 mm Hg in conjunction with high cardiovascular risk. We then identified the proportion of treated subjects on antihypertensive treatment who were truly eligible for treatment. From the survey data we identified 65 adults (25 men and 40 women) under 35 on diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium blockers or other antihypertensives. Average pretreatment blood pressure was 164/100 mm Hg in those eligible for treatment, and 136/79 mm Hg in those not eligible. The analysis indicated that 29.2% of adults aged 16-34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.6-41.8%) were truly eligible for antihypertensive treatment: 32.0% (95% CI: 14.9-53.5%) of men and 25.0% (95% CI: 12.7-41.2%) of women.

Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase endogenous levels of Ang-(1-7), we addressed the involvement of Ang-(1-7) in the hypotensive effect induced by captopril in SAD rats. Wistar rats 7 days after SAD or sham operation (SO) were anaesthetized and the carotid artery was cannulated for monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP). A needle was inserted into the anterior hypothalamus for drug administration.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) induced an increase in MAP in both groups being the effect greater in SAD rats (DeltaMAP=15.8+/-1.4 mm Hg) than in SO rats (DeltaMAP=9.6+/-1.0 mm Hg). Ang-(1-7) partially abolished the pressor response caused by Ang II in SAD rats. Whilst the captopril intrahypothalamic injection did not affect MAP in SO animals, it significantly reduced MAP in SAD rats (DeltaMAP=-13.3+/-1.9 mm Hg). Either [D-Ala(7)]-Ang-(1-7) or an anti-Ang-(1-7) polyclonal antibody partially blocked the MAP reduction caused by captopril. In conclusion, whilst Ang-(1-7) does not contribute to hypothalamic blood pressure regulation in SO normotensive animals, in SAD rats the heptapeptide induces a reduction of blood pressure mediated by Mas receptor activation. Although Ang-(1-7) is not formed in enough amount in the AHA of SAD animals to exert cardiovascular effects in normal conditions, our results suggest that enhancement of hypothalamic Ang-(1-7) levels by administration of captopril is partially involved in the hypotensive effect of the ACE inhibitor.", 
    "781": "The aims of the present study were to investigate the distribution of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in breast cancer patients and the association between ACE genotypes and clinicopathologic features, as well as their effects on prognosis. We assessed the I/D polymophism of the ACE gene by using polymerase chain reaction from peripheral blood in breast cancer and healthy age-matched women. The clinicopathologic parameters of breast cancer patients were obtained from medical records. Of the 57 patients, 31 (54.4%) had DD, 24 (42.1%) had ID, and 2 (3.5%) had II genotypes. In control subjects, 33 (63.5%) had DD, 12 (23.1%) had ID, and 7 (13.4%) had II genotypes. The ID genotype was seen more commonly in breast cancer patients (p = .03). When the combination of ID and II genotypes was used as a reference group, the DD genotype was associated with negative hormone receptor status (p = .003), tumor size (p = .054), and lymph node involvement (p = .07) but not histologic high grade and c-erb B2 overexpression. These results suggest that the DD genotype may accompany poor prognostic factors and influence the tumor course.", 
    "782": "Previous investigations into the pathophysiology of amoebic gill disease (AGD) have suggested that there are probable cardiovascular effects associated with this disease. In the present study Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., were experimentally infected by cohabitation with diseased individuals. Two commonly used vasodilators, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and captopril, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were used as tools to investigate possible vasoconstriction and/or renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysfunction in AGD-affected animals. Within the SNP trial, results showed that AGD-affected fish exhibited lowered cardiac output (Q), lowered cardiac stroke volume (V(S)) and a significantly elevated systemic vascular resistance (R(S)) compared with non-affected na\u00efve counterparts. These effects were totally abolished following SNP administration (40 microg kg(-1)), however significant cardiovascular effects associated with SNP were not observed. Within the captopril trial, where AGD-affected fish were more diseased compared with the SNP trial, a significant hypertension was observed in AGD-affected fish. Captopril administration (10(-4) mol L(-1) at 1 mL kg(-1)) resulted in a significant drop in dorsal aortic pressure (P(DA)) for both AGD-affected and na\u00efve control fish. In terms of peak individual responses, captopril administration effectively lowered P(DA) in both AGD-affected and na\u00efve control groups equally. The drop in P(DA) following SNP administration however was significantly greater in AGD-affected fish potentially suggesting disease-related vasoconstriction. The lack of significant cardiovascular effects directly associated with both SNP and captopril administrations possibly relate to the 6 h recovery period following surgical procedures. However, while variable, these results do suggest that there are significant cardiovascular effects including vasoconstriction and hypertension associated with AGD.",

Compliance with medication prescriptions, including aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs, and smoking cessation counseling for eligible patients was analyzed. Medically appropriate exclusions and contraindications were included in the analysis. After adjusting for 14 clinical variables, CABG patients were less likely to receive most secondary prevention measures relative to percutaneous catheter intervention patients. In contrast, CABG patients were more likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocker, and smoking cessation counseling than neither intervention patients. Composite adherence and defect-free rates were highest for percutaneous catheter intervention patients and lowest for neither intervention patients after adjustment.",

Aspirin use remained high (by approximately 95% of patients after AMI) during all periods examined. The percentage of hospital survivors treated with all 4 cardiac medications increased from 23% in 2000 to 58% during 2005. Advancing age (>/= 65 years), female sex, medical history of heart failure or stroke, and development of atrial fibrillation during hospitalization were associated with underuse of combination medical therapy.

    "796": "Historically, blood pressure control in Hispanics has been considerably less than that of non-Hispanic whites and blacks. We compared determinants of blood pressure control among Hispanic white, Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black participants (N=32 642) during follow-up in a randomized, practice-based, active-controlled trial. Hispanic blacks and whites represented 3% and 16% of the cohort, respectively; 33% were non-Hispanic black and 48% were non-Hispanic white. Hispanics were less likely to be controlled (<140/90 mm Hg) at enrollment, but within 6 to 12 months of follow-up, Hispanics had a greater proportion <140/90 mm Hg compared with non-Hispanics. At 4 years of follow-up, blood pressure was controlled in 72% of Hispanic whites, 69% of Hispanic blacks, 67% of non-Hispanic whites, and 59% of non-Hispanic blacks. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites had a 20% greater odds of achieving BP control by 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.31) after controlling for demographic variables and comorbidities, Hispanic blacks had a similar odds of achieving BP control (odds ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.25), and non-Hispanic blacks had a 27% lower odds (odds ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.78). We conclude that in all patients high levels of blood pressure control can be achieved with commonly available medications and that Hispanic ethnicity is not associated with inferior control in the setting of a clinical trial in which hypertensive patients had equal access to medical care, and medication was provided at no cost.", 
    "797": "We showed recently that deletion of a strong enhancer located 2.7 kb upstream of the renin gene in mice produces a strain with mild hypotension and salt-sensitivity. Here we set out to compare responses in renin expression in kidney and extrarenal tissues in these \"REKO\" mice. REKO and wild-type mice were placed on a low NaCl/enalapril regimen for 1 week, and then Ren-1(c) mRNA and renin enzyme activities were measured in tissues and plasma. In untreated REKO mice, renin and Ren-1(c) mRNA were reduced significantly in kidney, submandibular gland, adrenal, heart, and brain. In situ hybridization indicated a marked reduction in Ren-1(c) mRNA in juxtaglomerular cells and granular ducts of submandibular gland. After the chronic stimulus response in renal Ren-1(c) mRNA in REKO mice was blunted by 54% compared with wild-type mice, and was accompanied by almost complete exhaustion of renin stores. Response in plasma renin was blunted by 47%, this being mirrored in heart (54% decline), in which renin is derived mostly from the bloodstream. In adrenal a 55% reduction was seen. These data are consistent with inability of REKO mice to adequately replenish renal renin stores during chronic stimulation of renin secretion. In conclusion, the renin enhancer is critical for replenishment of renin stores and response in renin to a chronic in vivo stimulus.", 
    "798": "ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) slow the progression of renal disease in non-transplant patients. A systematic review of randomized trials (n = 21 trials with 1549 patients) was conducted to determine the effect of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use following kidney transplantation. With a median follow-up of 27 months, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use was associated with a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (-5.8 mL/min; 95% CI -10.6 to -0.99). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use resulted in a lower hematocrit (-3.5%; 95% CI -6.1 to -0.95), reduction in proteinuria (-0.47 gm/d; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.08) but no change in the serum potassium (0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.40). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use results in clinically important reductions in proteinuria, hematocrit and glomerular filtration rate in renal transplant recipients, but there are insufficient data to determine the effect on patient or graft survival. Randomized trials of sufficient power and duration that examine these hard outcomes should be conducted. Until such trials are completed, this study provides quantitative estimates of the risks and benefits of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use that can be used by clinicians considering prescribing these medications to kidney transplant recipients or to researchers designing future trials.", 
    "799": "The endothelium is a dynamic organ that plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Alteration in endothelial function precedes the development of atherosclerosis and contributes to its initiation, perpetuation and clinical manifestations. It has been suggested that the assessment of endothelial function could represent a barometer of vascular health that could be used to gauge cardiovascular risk. This review summarises the various methods used to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and their potential prognostic implications. In addition, the techniques used to evaluate arterial stiffness are discussed. The latter is to some extent controlled by the endothelium and has been the subject of considerable research in recent years. This paper also discusses the effects of lipid lowering treatment on both endothelial function and arterial stiffness.", 
    "800": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) differ in their actions on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II, although angiotensin II may still be generated by alternative pathways. However, ACE inhibitors interrupt bradykinin breakdown, which in turn potentially enhances nitric oxide and prostacyclin mechanisms. In contrast, ARBs selectively prevent the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor while leaving the potentially beneficial effects of the AT(2) receptor unaffected. The supposition is that dual blockade of the RAAS effectively overcomes the harmful effects of angiotensin II mediated by the AT(1) receptor while offering the additional effects of the ACE inhibitor. This concept was first evaluated clinically more than a decade ago in small-scale studies that were not sufficiently powered to conclusively demonstrate benefits from dual blockade. Subsequently, larger-scale trials have been conducted to determine the effects of a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in combating the effects of angiotensin II at different stages of cardiovascular and renal disease. This review explores these data in areas, such as hypertension, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease, and draws on this preliminary evidence to support the rationale for the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program, which aims to fully explore the clinical end points and effects of dual RAAS blockade in patients at high risk for cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "801": "Cardiovascular disease represents a continuum that starts with risk factors, such as hypertension, and progresses to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately leads to heart failure or stroke. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Both classes of agent can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Such a reduction has been shown with ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, but no such data are currently available for ARBs. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce damage in target organs, such as the heart and kidney, and to decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and the Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND), that compare telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination in high-risk patients with vascular end-organ damage, should provide important new insights into the benefits of intervention with RAS blockade along the cardiorenovascular continuum.", 
    "802": "The clinical benefits of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) extend beyond blood pressure reduction to encompass tissue-protective effects in target organs, such as the heart, vasculature, and kidneys, that underlie the reductions in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity seen in large outcome trials. However, these effects are achieved by different mechanisms. ACE inhibitors reduce circulating and tissue angiotensin II levels and potentiate the beneficial effects of bradykinin, including generation of nitric oxide (NO). By contrast, the protective effects of ARBs are owing to the blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors and possibly also to the stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors, again resulting in NO release. In addition, some ARBs, such as telmisartan, are selective activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), thereby increasing insulin sensitivity. In contrast to other PPAR-gamma ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones, activation of this receptor by telmisartan does not result in weight gain. The complementary mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors and ARBs create a rationale for combination therapy in high-risk patients. The benefits of this approach with telmisartan are being investigated in clinical trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET).", 
    "803": "Despite the substantial evidence of the benefits of lowering blood pressure, conventional treatment does not normalize the burden of major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Data now suggest that the nature of the antihypertensive agent used may have an important impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke. Optimal treatment should provide powerful 24-hour blood pressure control, including during the early morning hours when the risk of stroke is highest. In addition, antihypertensive therapies selected should have positive blood pressure-independent effects on stroke risk. In contrast to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) provide consistent benefits in stroke protection beyond blood pressure lowering. The ARB telmisartan has a particularly interesting profile for stroke management. Selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade and 24-hour blood pressure control with telmisartan provide the potential for improved stroke prevention. This will be investigated in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PROFESS) study.", 
    "804": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker is a key therapeutic strategy in slowing progression of diabetic nephropathy.

However, it is not known whether drugs in this class also reduce the structural and functional manifestations of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "806": "Both perindopril and aliskiren reduced blood pressure, albuminuria and structural injury in experimental diabetic nephropathy, although not to the same extent. Aliskiren, at the dose used, did not reduce systemic blood pressure as much as perindopril, but both compounds were equally effective in reducing albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic animals. The magnitude of interstitial fibrosis was attenuated to a greater degree by aliskiren than by perindopril.",

    "813": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plays an important role not only as an antihypertensive drug but also for prevention of various complications related to geriatric syndrome. Pneumonia in the disabled elderly is mostly due to silent aspiration of oropharyngeal bacterial pathogens to the lower respiratory tract. Aspiration is related to the dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons by cerebrovascular disease, resulting in impairments in both the swallowing and cough reflexes. ACE inhibitor can increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex particularly in older post-menopausal women, and improvement of the swallowing reflex. In a 2-year follow-up study in stroke patients, patients who did not receive ACE inhibitors had a higher risk of mortality due to pneumonia than in stroke patients who were treated with ACE inhibitor. Moreover, the mortality of pneumonia was significantly lower in older hypertensive patients given ACE inhibitors than in those treated with other antihypertensive drugs. On the other hand, we found a new benefit of ACE inhibitor on the central nervous system. The mortality in Alzheimer's disease patients who received brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor was lower than in those who received other antihypertensive drugs. In a 1-year follow-up study, cognitive decline was lower in patients receiving brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors than in patients receiving a non-brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker. Brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors may slow cognitive decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. ACE inhibitor might be effective for the disabled elderly, resulting in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia and Alzheimer's disease for the elderly.",

    "815": "In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the mechanisms behind the increased mortality related to glucose levels (GL) are poorly understood. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between baseline glucose and left ventricular enlargement (LVE). We analyzed 52 patients with a first ST-elevation AMI <24 h of evolution. Glucose levels were obtained upon admission (median time, 3 h after the beginning of chest pain). The median GL was 123.5 mg/dl, and patients above this limit were considered hyperglycemic (n=26). Left ventricular enlargement was analyzed comparing two radionuclide ventriculographies, the first obtained within 4 days post-AMI (median, 55 h) and the second 6 months later (median, 188.5 days), taking into account the difference in the obtained end-systolic volumes. Myocardial reperfusion was evaluated comparing ST resolution between a first ECG done immediately upon hospital arrival with a second ECG performed 2 h after treatment. By univariate analysis, LVE correlated significantly with baseline hyperglycemia (P<.001), failed reperfusion by ECG criteria (P<.001), and no use of ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers (P=.046) and aspirin (P=.046). A history of previous diabetes did not correlate significantly with LVE at 6 months. In the adjusted model, basal hyperglycemia (P<.001) and failed reperfusion (P=.001) were the only variables independently correlated with LVE. In conclusion, baseline glucose is a powerful and independent predictor of LVE after AMI, which reinforces the importance of a tight glucose control during the initial phase of the disease.",

The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase C8 column with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium formate-methanol (3:97, v/v). The protonated analyte was quantitated in positive ionization by multiple reaction monitoring with a mass spectrometer.

In contrast to effects evoked by bradykinin, such effects caused by ramiprilat were not attenuated by HOE 140, a bradykinin-receptor antagonist. These effects were also not attenuated in the presence of l-nitro-arginine, used to mimic bradykinin-dependent signalling. In cardiomyocytes, bradykinin but not ramiprilat activated AP-1.

Six-week-old SHR were divided into three groups: control, group receiving captopril (50 mg/kg/day) or enalapril (50 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. At the end of experiment, systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 41 % in controls. Both captopril and enalapril prevented blood pressure increase, however, SBP in the captopril group (121+/-5 mmHg) was significantly lower than that in the enalapril group (140+/-5 mmHg). Concentration of conjugated dienes in the aorta was significantly lower in the captopril group compared to the enalapril group. Captopril and enalapril increased NO synthase activity in the heart and aorta to the similar level. Neither captopril nor enalapril was, however, able to increase the expression of eNOS. Both ACE inhibitors increased the level of cGMP. However, cGMP level was significantly higher in the aorta of captopril group. We conclude that captopril, beside inhibition of ACE, prevented hypertension by increasing NO synthase activity and by simultaneous decrease of oxidative stress which resulted in increase of cGMP concentration.", 
    "826": "We aimed to compare the effects of chronic and acute administration of structurally different antihypertensives, diuretics - indapamide and hydrochlorothiazide, ACE inhibitor - captopril and indapamide+captopril combination on endothelium-dependent relaxation of femoral artery isolated from nitric oxide (NO)-deficient rats. In the chronic experiment, femoral artery was isolated from Wistar rats receiving L-NAME (40 mg/kg/day) solely or with indapamide (1 mg/kg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg/day), captopril (10 mg/kg/day), and indapamide+captopril combination for seven weeks. In the acute in vitro experiment, the incubation medium with femoral artery isolated from L-NAME-hypertensive rats was supplemented with investigated antihypertensives in the same concentration 10(-4) mol/l. Interestingly, chronic L-NAME treatment did not cause a reduction of vasorelaxation. Indapamide+captopril elevated relaxation above the control level and completely prevented blood pressure increase induced by L-NAME. Acute incubation with captopril only or indapamide+captopril improved relaxation of femoral artery isolated from L-NAME-hypertensive rats, while the incubation with all antihypertensives increased vasorelaxation of femoral artery isolated from control Wistar rats. In conclusion, NO might be involved in the indapamide- and hydrochlorothiazide-induced improvement of vasorelaxation, while different vasorelaxing factors (prostacyclin, EDHF) contribute to the captopril-induced improvement of vasorelaxation. During the chronic treatment additive and synergic effects of indapamide and captopril may contribute to the prevention of hypertension and increase of vasorelaxation.", 
    "827": "A 50-year-old woman presented with combined systolic and diastolic heart failure and Raynaud's phenomenon with painful necrotic lesions around several nail beds. Several clinical criteria and the specific biochemical findings lead to the diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) which is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral fibrosis and widespread vascular pathology.After treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitor) and beta blockers the heart failure symptoms disappeared and the ejection fraction improved. The severe pain in the hands due to Raynaud's phenomenon diminished only after treatment with calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Adalat, 10 mg, PO, Bayer HealthCare, Germany) without affecting the cardiovascular status. Cardiac involvement in connective tissue disease is not uncommon, but to our knowledge we present here the first case of MCTD with a combined systolic and diastolic heart failure as primary manifestation.", 
    "828": "The efficacy of ACE-inhibitors and beta blockers is well documented in the therapy of heart failure. As pharmacological mechanisms of ATI-receptor-antagonists differ, an additional positive effect can be expected when combining these drugs.", 
    "829": "Eighty patients (67.9 +/- 9.9 years) with severe chronic heart failure receiving long-term medication with diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and partially beta blockers (72.5%), were randomized after clinical recompensation to eprosartan (477.5 +/- 143.7 mg/d), telmisartan (65.9 +/- 17.7 mg), candesartan (11.9 +/- 4.0 mg) or no sartan, according to a prospective study. Haemodynamic measurements by impedance cardiography were performed (mean observation time 15.8 days).", 
    "830": "Additional sartan treatment resulted in an improvement of cardiac output from 2.32 +/- 0.69 to 3.12 +/- 1.24 l/min (P = 0.003) in the eprosartan group, from 2.24 +/- 0.59 to 2.76 +/- 0.91 l/min (P = 0.001) in the telmisartan group and from 2.76 +/- 0.84 to 3.11 +/- 0.94 l/min (P = 0.02) in the candesartan group. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the total peripheral resistance was measured under eprosartan (23%; P = 0.002), telmisartan (18%; P = 0.002) and candesartan treatment (11.5%; P = 0.049); in the subgroup of combined therapy with beta blockers, ACE-inhibitors and ATI-antagonists a significant increase in cardiac output was also observed. No change was observed in the control group without additional sartan treatment concerning cardiac output and resistance reduction.", 
    "831": "The additional treatment with different ATI-receptor-antagonists resulted in an increase of the cardiac output and a decrease of the peripheral resistance. This beneficial effect may be due to the additional property of sartans to block the interaction of locally and not-ACE-generated angiotensin II with their vascular and myocardial ATI-receptors.", 
    "832": "Pharmacological and genetic interference with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) seems to alter voluntary ethanol consumption. However, understanding the influence of the RAS on ethanol dependence and its treatment requires modeling the neuroadaptations that occur with prolonged exposure to ethanol. Increased ethanol consumption was induced in rats through repeated cycles of intoxication and withdrawal. Expression of angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the angiotensin II receptor, AT1a, was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Increased ethanol consumption after a history of dependence was associated with increased angiotensinogen expression in medial prefrontal cortex but not in nucleus accumbens or amygdala. Increased angiotensinogen expression also demonstrates that the astroglia is an integral part of the plasticity underlying the development of dependence. The effects of low central RAS activity on increased ethanol consumption were investigated using either spirapril, a blood-brain barrier-penetrating inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, or transgenic rats (TGR(ASrAOGEN)680) with reduced central angiotensinogen expression. Spirapril reduced ethanol intake in dependent rats compared to controls. After induction of dependence, TGR(ASrAOGEN)680 rats had increased ethanol consumption but to a lesser degree than Wistar rats with the same history of dependence. These data suggest that the central RAS is sensitized in its modulatory control of ethanol consumption in the dependent state, but pharmacological or genetic blockade of the system appears to be insufficient to halt the progression of dependence.", 
    "833": "Aristolochic Acid (AA) is a component of Chinese herbs that has been found to be toxic to multiple organs in adults. Its toxicity to developing embryos has not been reported. Here, we describe that AA specifically causes heart defects in developing zebrafish embryos in a dosage-dependent manner. The treated embryos are able to develop their hearts normally up to 24 h postfertilization, when cardiac contraction initiates, but begin to show deformation and reduction of the hearts followed by gradual contractility loss and eventually lethality, suggesting that AA is primarily affecting cardiac physiology rather than cardiogenesis. Histological analyses reveal that the AA-treated hearts develop hypertrophy and disorganization of cardiomyocytes and loss of endocardium. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed broken and disorganized cardiac fibers in the AA-treated hearts. AA induces the expression of proinflammation genes, including cox-2, IL-1beta, and others. The AA-induced cardiac defects can be attenuated by the cox-2 antagonist NS398 via reducing the expression of the inflammatory genes. This attenuation could be further enhanced by known heart failure drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, the heart defects are enhanced by a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. In summary, AA causes profound toxicity to zebrafish embryos that exhibit pathophysiological and pharmacological features resembling those of heart failure in humans and other model organisms, and thus, zebrafish could be a new model for studies on heart failure.", 
    "834": "On-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery triggers an inflammatory response (IR) which may impair revascularization. The study aimed at (1) characterizing the temporal profile of the IR by assaying appropriate markers in both systemic and coronary blood, and (2) determining whether (and which doses of) cardiovascular drugs known to have antiinflammatory properties, namely statins and ACE-inhibitors (ACEI), inhibit the response.", 
    "835": "Patients scheduled for CABG (n=22) were randomized to statin/ACEI combination treatment at standard doses (STD, ramipril 2.5/simvastatin 20 mg, or atorvastatin 10 mg), or at high doses (HiDo, ramipril 10 mg, or enalapril 20 mg/simvastatin 80 mg, or atorvastatin 40 mg). Plasma levels of interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, E-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and sVCAM-1 were serially assayed (ELISA) before, during, and after CABG. Blood was drawn from an artery, a systemic vein, and the coronary sinus. Myocardial perfusion scans were obtained before and 2 months after surgery in 19 out of 22 subjects. In the STD group both IL-6 and TNF displayed striking increases which were similar at all sites and peaked 10 to 60 minutes after aortic declamping. Such increases were drastically attenuated in the HiDo group. Instead, only modest increases in venous E-selectin, vWF, and sVCAM-1 were observed. Scintigraphic ischemia scores were entirely normalized after versus before CABG in the HiDo but not in the STD treatment group.",

    "837": "The present study investigated the hypoglycemic action of des-aspartate-angiotensin I (DAA-I), a metabolite of angiotensin I, in two animal models of type 2 diabetes. The rationale was based on our earlier studies demonstrating that DAA-I acts on the angiotensin AT(1) receptor and exerts responses opposing those of angiotensin II and on recent reports that curtailment of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and blockade of the AT(1) receptor attenuate hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetics and diabetic animals. Diabetic KKAy mice and GK rats were administered orally (by gavage) one of the following doses of DAA-I: 400, 600, or 800 nmol/kg.d for 4 and 6 wk, respectively. Control diabetic animals were similarly administered water. Blood glucose of each animal was determined fortnightly by oral glucose tolerance test and blood insulin on the last day of treatment. Animals were killed, and the levels of plasma membrane glucose transporter-4 and cytosolic tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 in hind limb skeletal muscles were determined by Western blot in insulin-challenged and nonchallenged animals. Orally administered DAA-I had no effect on blood insulin level but exerted dose-dependent hypoglycemic action in KKAy mice and GK rats after 4 and 6 wk of treatment, respectively. At the maximal effective dose of 600 nmol/kg, insulin induced a significant increase in plasma membrane glucose transporter-4 and cytosolic tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1. These findings show that DAA-I is not an insulin secretagogue and exerts hypoglycemic action by attenuating insulin resistance, the first such demonstration indicating that the nonapeptide is involved in glycemic regulation.", 
    "838": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors usually cause severe coughing and intolerance while antagonists for angiotensin AT(1) receptor do not stimulate the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO has been shown to regulate arterial hypertension and insulin resistance. Hence, new hybrids of antagonist for angiotensin AT(1) receptor and a NO donor may have potent anti-hypertensive effect and regulate glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Herein, the effects of [6-(nitrooxymethyl)pyridin-2-yl] methyl 4'-[1-(1,7'-dimethyl-2'-propyl-1H,3'H-2,5'-bibenzo[d]imidazol-3'-yl)ethyl] biphenyl-2-carboxylate (WB1106), a novel NO-releasing derivative of telmisartan newly synthesized, on the vasocontraction, hypertension and diet-induced insulin resistance were examined in vitro using rat aortic strips and in normotensive and spontaneous hypertension rats (SHR rats). Apparently, WB1106 induced the vasorelaxation of contracted rat aortic strips in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which depended on the activity of guanylate cyclase, a characteristic of NO-related function. Furthermore, WB1106 reduced the contractile and blood pressure responses to angiotensin II, which relied on the release of telmisartan. Moreover, treatment with WB1106 significantly reduced the blood pressure with similar potency to telmitarsan and increased the contents of cGMP in SHR rats. Therefore, WB1106 possesses both the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist activity of telmisartan and the NO-releasing property of a 'slow NO donor'. Importantly, in contrast to equimolar telmisartan, treatment with WB1106 significantly attenuated body weight gains and improved glucose tolerance in high-fat and carbohydrate-fed rats, reflecting a synergistic effect of NO and telmisartan. Potentially, WB1106 may be a potent anti-hypertensive drug for treatment of hypertension and diabetes-related cardiovascular diseases in the clinic.", 
    "839": "The maximal endothelial dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings to cumulative doses of acetylcholine was significantly decreased in the Cyclosporine-A (CSA, 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) treated animals compared to olive oil (CSA vehicle) treated control. Administration of antihypertensive drugs like diltiazem, enalapril or propranolol to CSA treated animals augmented the endothelial damage induced by CSA. These drugs also increased the bioavailability of CSA. However, administration of losartan to CSA treated animals produced a significant increase in endothelial dependent relaxation as compared to CSA treated control but did not affect the bioavailability of CSA significantly. The results suggest that losartan is safer compared to other antihypertensives for the treatment of CSA induced hypertension.", 
    "840": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, but evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to reduce that risk is lacking. The Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) study enrolled 6105 participants with cerebrovascular disease and randomly allocated them to perindopril-based blood pressure-lowering therapy or placebo. Individuals with CKD were at approximately 1.5-fold greater risk of major vascular events, stroke, and coronary heart disease, and were more than twice as likely to die (all P< or =0.002). Perindopril-based treatment reduced the risk of major vascular events by 30% and stroke by 35% among subjects with CKD, and the absolute effects of treatment were 1.7-fold greater for those with CKD than for those without. Considering patients with CKD and a history of cerebrovascular disease, perindopril prevented one stroke or other cardiovascular event among every 11 patients treated over five years. In conclusion, kidney function should be considered when determining the need for blood pressure lowering therapy in patients with cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "841": "With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of opportunistic infections has declined substantially, and cardiovascular, liver, and renal diseases have emerged as major causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Acute renal failure is common in HIV-infected patients and is associated with acute infection and medication-related nephrotoxicity. HIV-associated nephropathy is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-positive African American populations and may respond to HAART. Other important HIV-associated renal diseases include HIV immune complex kidney diseases and thrombotic microangiopathy. The increasing importance of non-HIV-associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and vascular disease, to the burden of chronic kidney disease has been recognized, focusing attention on prevention and control of these diseases in HIV-positive individuals. HIV-positive individuals who experience progression to end-stage renal disease and who have undetectable HIV-1 viral loads while receiving HAART should be evaluated for renal transplant. Emerging evidence suggests that HIV-positive individuals may have graft and patient survival comparable to HIV-negative individuals. Several studies suggest that HIV-1 can potentially infect renal cells, and HIV transgenic mice have clarified the roles of a number of HIV proteins in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal disease. Host factors may modify disease expression at the level of cytokine networks and the renal microvasculature and contribute to the pathogenic effects of HIV-1 infection on the kidney.", 
    "842": "Excessive aldosterone secretion is detrimental to the heart, vessels and kidneys, contributing to hypertension and the signs and progression of heart failure. Aldosterone secretion, abnormally elevated in heart failure and hypertension, can be blunted with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Amlodipine, used to treat hypertension and heart failure, was hypothesized to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). A study was conducted with six normal adult male beagle dogs. Each dog received amlodipine (0.57 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 6 days, followed by amlodipine (0.57 mg/kg b.i.d.) and enalapril (0.57 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 4 days. Blood pressure, heart rate, serum chemistries and urinary aldosterone excretion, as a measure of RAAS activation, were compared with baseline values. Blood pressure fell by approximately 7% with amlodipine (P = 0.05) and a further 7% with the combination of amlodipine and enalapril (P < 0.01). Blood urea nitrogen increased with the combination (P < 0.05) but only one dog became mildly azotemic. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, based on 24 h urinary aldosterone excretion and by aldosterone:creatinine ratio was increased by approximately threefold (P < 0.05) with amlodipine administration. This effect was blunted by enalapril, such that aldosterone excretion was no longer different from that observed under control conditions, although values for 24-h aldosterone excretion did not return to pretreament levels.",

The PAN model was induced by jugular vein injection of PAN at a dose of 5 mg/100 g body weight. Quantities of 24 h urinary protein excretion were examined on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30. All rats were sacrificed on day 31 for blood biochemistry, kidney histology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis.",

Dipeptides, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and a beta-lactum antibiotic strongly inhibited the transport of glycylsarcosine indicating the functional presence of oligopeptide transport (OPT) system on the RPE. Dipeptide prodrugs (valine-valine-GCV, glycine-valine-GCV, and tyrosine-valine-GCV), and valine-GCV demonstrate a high enzymatic stability and affinity toward the retinal OPT system. The transport of the prodrugs was significantly inhibited ( approximately 50%) in the presence of glycylsarcosine. The rank order of scleral permeability was Gly-Val-GCV approximately GCV>Val-GCV>Tyr-Val-GCV approximately Val-Val-GCV. The RCS permeability values of Val-GCV (3.29 +/- 0.09 x 10(6)cm/s), Val-Val-GCV (4.14 +/- 0.33 x 10(6)cm/s), Gly-Val-GCV (3.40 +/- 0.47 x 10(6)cm/s) and Tyr-Val-GCV (3.08 +/- 0.29 x 10(6)cm/s) were two-fold higher than that of GCV (1.61 +/- 0.06 x 10(6)cm/s).",

The QOL was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire. Functional capacity was assessed by the 6-minute walk test. Continuous variables were compared with the Student t-test (paired or unpaired).",

    "859": "A large body of clinical evidence supports aggressive cardiovascular risk management in combination with glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Glycaemic management in a patient with HbA1c that is at or near goal should include an assessment of postprandial glycaemia. Insulin sensitisers have glycaemic and non-glycaemic benefits and warrant consideration even if the HbA1c is not significantly elevated. Oral agents should always be combined with lifestyle modification, including regular exercise and attention to both individual food choices and overall calorie intake to further optimise glycaemic control. For cardiovascular risk reduction, LDL cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol and triglycerides should be treated appropriately through lifestyle changes. Often pharmacotherapy with at least one lipid-lowering agent is required. Blood pressure control often requires the use of 3 or more antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes. Clinical data support use of an ACE-inhibitor as first-line therapy for the prevention of micro-albuminuria in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Urine should be tested for micro-albumin at least annually. Low-dose (81 mg) aspirin is appropriate for patients over age 45 years for primary prevention of coronary heart disease. Multifactorial intervention has been shown in large studies such as the Diabetes Prevention Programme and Steno-2 to have significant cardiovascular benefit among patients at risk of developing diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes and micro-albuminuria. Evidence-based treatments and therapeutic goals can build a practical framework for comprehensive outpatient management of patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.

The magnitude of such a change is generally small, but in certain instances it can be extreme enough to produce a clinically significant degree of anemia. The mechanistic basis for antihypertensive medication-related changes in hemoglobin concentration include hemodilution, hemolytic anemia, and suppression of red blood cell production, as this occurs most commonly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. A reduction in hemoglobin concentration in a patient who is receiving treatment for hypertension and does not have an obvious source of blood loss should account for potential antihypertensive therapy involvement.", 
    "862": "Antihypertensive treatment regimen persistence and compliance were measured using a retrospective cohort study of pharmacy claims data. Newly treated patients receiving monotherapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers (BBs), or diuretics were followed for 1 year (N=242,882). A higher proportion of ARB patients (51.9%) were persistent in taking prescribed medication compared with those in the ACEI (48.0%), BB (40.3%), CCB (38.3%), and diuretic groups (29.9%). Compared with patients receiving diuretics, those receiving ARBs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.593; P<.0001), ACEIs (HR, 0.640; P<.0001), CCBs (HR, 0.859; P<.0001), and BBs (HR, 0.819; P<.0001) were all less likely to discontinue therapy. Compliance was similar in ACEI and ARB patients, but patients receiving ARBs and ACEIs had better compliance than those receiving BBs, CCBs, or diuretics. The lesser degree of compliance and persistence observed in patients receiving diuretics compared with other antihypertensive medications may have public health as well as cost implications.", 
    "863": "Unsatisfactory blood pressure (BP) control in the treated hypertensive patient is largely related to poor compliance with antihypertensive drug regimens. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the rate of persistence on treatment and the extent of BP control in 301 elderly, uncomplicated grade I or II hypertensive patients randomly allocated to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, angiotensin II receptors (ARBs), or diuretics according to an open-label single-blind study design. After 24 months, the percentage of patients continuing their initial therapy was higher in those treated with ARBs (68.5%) and ACE inhibitors (64.5%) and lower in patients taking diuretics (34.4%; P<.01). The logistic regression model using ARBs as reference term showed that patients treated with ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.99) or CCBs (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54-0.85) were more likely to continue their initial antihypertensive therapy when compared with those treated with beta-blockers (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79) or diuretics (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.84). The average systolic and diastolic BP decrease was greater in patients treated with ARBs (-11.2+/-4/-5.8+/-2 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (-10.5+/-4/-5.1+/-2 mm Hg), and CCBs (-8.5+/-3/-4.6+/-2 mm Hg) and lesser in those treated with diuretics (-2.3+/-4/-2.1+/-3 mm Hg, P<.05) and beta-blockers (-4.0+/-2/-2.3+/-2 mm Hg; P<.05). The study confirms the importance of persistence with treatment for the effective management of hypertension in clinical practice.", 
    "864": "Mitochondria are energy-producing organelles that conduct other key cellular tasks. Thus, mitochondrial damage may impair various aspects of tissue functioning. Mitochondria generate oxygen- and nitrogen-derived oxidants, being themselves major oxidation targets. Dysfunctional mitochondria seem to contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension, cardiac failure, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, atherosclerosis, and aging. Mitochondrial proteins and metabolic intermediates participate in various cellular processes, apart from their well-known roles in energy metabolism. This emphasizes the participation of dysfunctional mitochondria in disease, notwithstanding that most evidences supporting this concept come from animal and cultured-cell studies. Mitochondrial oxidant production is altered by several factors related to vascular pathophysiology. Among these, angiotensin-II stimulates mitochondrial oxidant release leading to energy metabolism depression. By lowering mitochondrial oxidant production, angiotensin-II inhibition enhances energy production and protects mitochondrial structure. This seems to be one of the mechanisms underlying the benefits of angiotensin-II inhibition in hypertension, diabetes, and aging rodent models. If some of these findings can be reproduced in humans, they would provide a new perspective on the implications that RAS-blockade can offer as a therapeutic strategy. This review intends to present available information pointing to mitochondria as targets for therapeutic Ang-II blockade in human renal and CV disease.", 
    "865": "The mechanisms of hypertensive nephrosclerosis are not fully understood. In experimental models of the disease, inflammatory reactions such as macrophage infiltration play an important role. In human hypertensive nephrosclerosis, however, there have been few studies examining the role of inflammation histologically. We investigated whether the number of infiltrating macrophages was increased in human hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and evaluated the effects of a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on clinical and histological findings. We examined macrophage infiltration using immunohistochemistry in renal biopsy specimens obtained from 16 patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, 5 patients with IgA nephropathy, 5 patients with membranous nephropathy, and 5 patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The number of infiltrating macrophages in glomeruli was significantly larger in the patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis than in those with minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis were divided into groups based on their use of antihypertensive agents at the time of renal biopsy. We investigated the effects of antihypertensive agents on clinical findings, macrophage infiltration, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression. There was no difference in clinical findings between the hypertensive groups. The numbers of infiltrating macrophages and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-positive cells in glomeruli were significantly smaller in patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, whereas calcium channel blockers had no influence on histological findings. In conclusion, inflammation is involved in the progression of human hypertensive nephrosclerosis and the inflammatory process is inhibited by blocking the renin-angiotensin system.",

Circulating cholesterol could mitigate the beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy. We assessed whether cholesterol affected the remission of urinary albumin in patients with type 2 diabetes of white, Caucasian and non-white origin. We studied 100 patients (African and Asian: n=57 and Caucasian: n=43) with type 2 diabetes and newly diagnosed microalbuminuria who received intensified and structured care for a median (IQ range) of 41 (32-48) months. Microalbuminuria remitted in 20% and progressed in 12% of patients. In those with uncontrolled systolic hypertension (>140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure fell by a mean (95% CI) of -9.4 (-3.8 to -15.11)mmHg; p=0.002. The change in urinary albumin excretion with time varied inversely with baseline systolic blood pressure (r=-0.25; p=0.04). At 3 years follow-up the decrement in blood pressure was significant for those patients in the regression group (-19.6[16.8]mmHg; p=0.005). In patients of African origin, systolic blood pressure was higher than in the other groups and correlated with cholesterol concentrations (r=0.44; p=0.04).

    "879": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a physiologically important modulator of both vasomotor tone and platelet aggregability. These effects of NO are predominantly mediated by cyclic guanosine-3,'5'-monophosphate (cGMP) via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. However, in patients with ischemic heart disease, platelets and coronary/peripheral arteries are hyporesponsive to the antiaggregatory and vasodilator effects of NO donors. NO resistance is also associated with a number of coronary risk factors and presents in different disease states. It correlates with conventional measures of \"endothelial dysfunction,\" and represents a multifaceted disorder, in which smooth muscle and platelet NO resistance are equally important, as sites of abnormal NO-driven physiology. NO resistance results largely from a combination of \"scavenging\" of NO by superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) and of (reversible) inactivation of soluble guanylate cyclase. It constitutes an impaired physiological response to endogenous NO (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, EDRF) and, as such, may contribute to the increased risk of ischemic events. Impairment in responsiveness to NO in ischemic patients implies a potential problem that those patients, in greatest need of nitrate therapy, may be least likely to respond. The prognostic impact of NO resistance at vascular and platelet levels has been demonstrated in patients with ischemic heart disease, and it has been shown that a number of agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, perhexiline, insulin, and possibly statins) ameliorate this anomaly. The current review examines different aspects of the \"NO resistance\" phenomenon and discusses some related methodological issues.",

It induces hepatic stellate cell proliferation and up-regulates transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) expression. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. Fibrosis, a consequence of most chronic liver diseases, may be the result of a disturbed balance between fibrogenesis and fibrolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of enalapril on liver fibrogenesis induced in rats by bile-duct ligation. Forty-seven rats were divided into two groups: bile-duct ligated (BDL) (n = 24) and BDL + enalapril (n = 23). Fibrosis was evaluated by the Knodell scoring system, and TGF-beta1 and MMP-2 were assessed with immunohistochemistry at the second, fourth and sixth weeks after bile-duct ligation. In the BDL group, TGF-beta1 increased by the second week and this increase continued through weeks 4 and 6. In the BDL + enalapril group, TGF-beta1 was significantly lower than the other group (P < 0.05). MMP-2 progressively decreased after week 2 in the BDL group. In the BDL + enalapril group, MMP-2 was significantly higher than the BDL group at the fourth and sixth weeks.

In this review, the role of angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) and the impact of ACE inhibition on vascular remodeling processes during vascular injury and restenosis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and aneurysm formation are discussed. The role of ACE and angiotensin II (Ang II) in neointimal thickening has been firmly established by animal studies and is mediated by Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor signaling events via monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and NAD(P)H oxidase. ACE and Ang II are involved in the remodeling of large and resistance arteries during hypertension; here, cell proliferation and matrix remodeling are also regulated by signaling events downstream of the AT(1) receptor. In atherosclerosis, Ang II is involved in the inflammatory and tissue response, mediated by various signaling pathways downstream of the AT(1) receptor. Although ACE inhibition has been shown to inhibit atherosclerotic processes in experimental animal models, results of large clinical trials with ACE inhibitors were not conclusive. Remodeling of vessel dimensions and structure during aneurysm formation is counteracted by ACE inhibition. Here, a direct effect of ACE inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase activity has to be considered as part of the working mechanism. The role of ACE2 in vascular remodeling has yet to be established; however, ACE2 has been shown to be associated with vascular changes in hypertension and atherosclerosis.",

Unfortunately, they persist as the only major therapy in HF that has not been subjected to a large randomized clinical trial, precisely because no comparable therapy exists that can so easily, efficiently, and inexpensively treat fluid overload. Nonetheless, diuretics have many potential drawbacks, including electrolyte abnormalities, neurohormonal activation, hypovolemia, renal dysfunction, and direct myocardial effects. Until definitive answers about mortality are settled, the lowest dose of a diuretic that can produce euvolemia should be employed and these agents should be discontinued when possible. Many outpatients with HF can be managed quite well without diuretics once adequate neurohormonal blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers has been achieved.",

New avenues of treatment under investigation include agents that could improve blood flow to the eye and neuroprotective drugs. The major components of the renin-angiotensin system have been identified in ocular tissue. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used to treat systemic hypertension. ACE inhibitors are inhibitors of kininase II and thus prevent breakdown of bradykinin. Bradykinin displays protective actions against glutamate neurotoxicity through bradykinin-B(2) receptors in cultured retinal neurons. ACE inhibitors blocked the liberation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I. Lower angiotensin II levels may have beneficial effects on outcomes by lowering vascular superoxide anion production.

In the last decades, the most successful strategy to control the RAS has been the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting these steps have been widely used clinically. However, complete inhibition of the RAS is not achievable by blocking the ACE or the AT(1) because of the compensatory rise in plasma renin activity, which limits the efficacy of many RAS drugs. Direct inhibition of renin, the first and rate-limiting step in the RAS cascade, is the preferred strategy for controlling the RAS, and much progress has been made in the research and development of renin inhibitors.

In this study a novel procedure has been developed, based on recombinant DNA technologies, for the production of highly purified fractions of three polypeptides derived from bovine beta-casein active as ACE inhibitors in vitro. The procedure includes peptide expression in Escherichia coli cells as recombinant fusion proteins, purification by affinity chromatography, cleavage by proteinase from a selected strain of Lactobacillus helveticus and isolation of bioactive peptides (BPs). The reported concentration of inhibitor needed to reduce at 50% ACE activity (IC(50)) values for single BP calculated in inhibiting the ACE enzyme gave results in agreement with the same parameters available in literature for other milk-derived BPs. This procedure could be used to obtain quantities of pure peptides to determine their interactions with ACE, with the aim of designing peptides that have stronger inhibitory properties and exhibit new pharmacological profiles. Moreover, its scale up would be of commercial interest for the production of functional foods, e.g., milk beverages with blood pressure-lowering effects.",

We employed a 24-month, matched-cohort study employing propensity score matching. The setting involved Medicare + Choice recipients residing in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. There were 610 intervention group members over the age of 65 matched to a control group of members over the age of 65. The DM diabetes program employed a structured, evidence-based, telephonic nursing intervention designed to provide patient education, counseling, and monitoring services. Measurements consisted of Medical service utilization, including hospitalizations, emergency department visits, physician evaluation and management visits, skilled nursing facility days, drug utilization, and selected clinical indicators. Among the results, the intervention group had considerably and significantly lower rates of acute service utilization compared to the control group, including a 17.5% reduction in hospitalizations, 22.4% reduction in bed days, 12.3% increase in physician evaluation and management visits, 23.7% increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use, 13.3% increase in blood glucose regulator use, 11.8% increase in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) tests, 10.3% increase in lipid panels, 26.0% increase in eye exams, and 35.5% increase in microalbumin tests. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that a commercially delivered diabetes DM program significantly reduces hospitalizations and bed-days while increasing the use of ACE inhibitors and blood glucose regulators along with selected clinical procedures such as HbA1c tests, lipid panels, eye exams, and microalbumin tests.", 
    "929": "Interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has become a leading therapeutic strategy in the treatment of chronic heart and kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers do not, however, uniformly suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma aldosterone levels are elevated in a subset of patients despite therapy. This phenomenon, known as 'aldosterone escape' or 'aldosterone breakthrough', has only been directly examined in small numbers of patients. The key questions of how often breakthrough occurs and whether breakthrough leads to worse outcomes have yet to be definitively answered. In this Review, we summarize the reported data on the incidence and clinical implications of aldosterone breakthrough, and highlight areas of uncertainty that have yet to be adequately addressed in the literature. Although the available evidence is not strong enough to support widespread screening for aldosterone breakthrough, our findings should prompt physicians to consider the phenomenon in select patients as well as guide future research efforts.", 
    "930": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two natural substrates and two catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin I and one inactivating bradykinin. The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative binding affinity of ACE inhibitors for the two binding sites of human endothelial ACE. In vitro binding assays were performed to test the ability of bradykinin, angiotensin I, or various ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, perindoprilat, quinaprilat, ramiprilat, and trandolaprilat) to displace a saturating concentration of [(125)I]351A, a radiolabeled lisinopril analogue, from ACE binding sites. The calculated IC(50) values for the ACE inhibitors were in the nanomolar range, while those for the natural substrates were in the micromolar range. The bradykinin/angiotensin I selectivity ratios calculated from double displacement experiments were: perindoprilat, 1.44; ramiprilat, 1.16; quinaprilat, 1.09; trandolaprilat, 1.08; enalaprilat, 1.00. The ACE inhibitors generally had higher affinity for the bradykinin than the angiotensin I binding sites, supporting the idea that these agents are primarily inhibitors of bradykinin degradation, and secondarily inhibitors of angiotensin II production. Perindoprilat had the highest selectivity for bradykinin versus angiotensin I binding sites, and enalaprilat has the lowest. These results indicate that there are differences in the affinity of ACE inhibitors toward sites for bradykinin degradation, which could lead to differences in efficacy in cardiovascular disease.",

    "936": "Recent studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in liver fibrosis. An intrahepatic RAS is expressed in chronically damaged livers, and angiotensin-II (AT-II) reportedly stimulates contraction and proliferation of the activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC), and increases the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression through angiotensin type-I receptors (AT1-R). Some studies have demonstrated that the clinically used angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I), and AT1-R blockers (ARB) significantly attenuated experimental liver fibrosis along with suppression of the Ac-HSC and hepatic TGF-beta expression. Angiotensin-II also stimulates the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner via protein kinase-C as an intracellular signaling cascade in the Ac-HSC, and these effects are completely suppressed by ARB. Combination treatment with low-dose interferon (IFN) and ACE-I exerts a stronger inhibitory effect than either single agent on its own. In humans it has been reported that ARB markedly improved the liver fibrosis score and TGF-beta expression in patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Serum fibrosis markers also significantly improved by treatment with low-dose IFN and ACE-I in patients with chronic hepatitis C, refractory to IFN monotherapy. Collectively, these data suggest that the interaction between AT-II and AT1-R plays a pivotal role in liver fibrosis development. Because both ACE-I and ARB are widely used in clinical practice without serious side-effects, these drugs in combination with IFN may provide a new strategy for antifibrosis therapy.",

The study population comprised 932 moderately to severely disabled community-resident women aged 65 years or older who were participants in the Women's Health and Aging Study I. A scale based on pharmacodynamic principles was developed and utilized as a measure of drug burden. This was related to measures of physical and cognitive function. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, anticholinergic drug burden was independently associated with greater difficulty in four physical function domains with adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 4.9 (2.0-12.0) for balance difficulty; 3.2 (1.5-6.9) for mobility difficulty; 3.6 (1.6-8.0) for slow gait; 4.2 (2.0-8.7) for chair stands difficulty; 2.4 (1.1-5.3) for weak grip strength; 2.7 (1.3-5.4) for upper extremity limitations; 3.4 (1.7-6.9) for difficulty in activities of daily living; and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) for poor performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Sedative burden was associated only with impaired grip strength (3.3 (1.5-7.3)) and mobility difficulty (2.4 (1.1-5.3)). The burden of multiple drugs can be quantified by incorporating the recommended dose regimen and the actual dose and frequency of drug taken. Anticholinergic drug burden is strongly associated with limitations in physical and cognitive function. Sedative burden is associated with impaired functioning in more limited domains. The risk associated with exposure of vulnerable older women to drugs with anticholinergic properties, and to a lesser extent those with sedative properties, implies that such drugs should not be used in this patient group without compelling clinical indication.",

Although they reduce prescribing errors, computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems do not prevent administration errors or timing discrepancies. This study determined the degree to which CPOE medication orders matched actual dose administration times. METHODS At a 658-bed academic hospital with CPOE but lacking electronic medication administration charting, authors randomly selected adult patients with eligible medication orders from historical 1999-2003 CPOE log files. Retrospective manual chart audits compared expected (from CPOE) and actual timing of medication administrations. Outcomes included: dose omissions, median lag times between ordered and charted administrations, unauthorized doses, wrong dose errors, and the rate of nurses' medication schedule shifting. RESULTS Dose omissions occurred in 756 of 6019 (12.6%) audited administration opportunities; only 313 of the omissions (5.2% of opportunities) were unexplained. Wrong doses and unexpected doses occurred for 0.1% and 0.7% of opportunities, respectively. Median lag from expected first dose to actual charted administration time was 27 minutes (IQR 0-127). Nursing staff shifted from ordered to alternate administration schedules for 10.7% of regularly scheduled recurring medication orders. Chart review identified reasons for dose omissions, delays, and dose shifting. CONCLUSION Inpatient CPOE orders are legible and conveyed electronically to nurses and the pharmacy. Nonetheless, ward-based medication administrations do not consistently occur as ordered. Medication administration discrepancies are likely to persist even after implementing CPOE and bar-coded medication administration unless recommended interventions are made to address issues such as determining the true urgency of medication administration, avoiding overlapping duplicative medication orders, and developing a safe means for shifting dosing schedules.",
