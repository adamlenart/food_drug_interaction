ACEI impairs the conversion of ANG I to ANG II, a dipsogenic hormone, and impairs the degradation of bradykinin. The goal of this study was to examine the role of bradykinin in the polydipsia and polyuria associated with ACEI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received captopril (CPT; 20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) in ground chow for 48 h. Water intake, food intake, and urine output were monitored and compared with control rats (CTL), rats receiving captopril treatment with limited water intake (CPT-LIM), and rats receiving captopril treatment with ad libitum water intake plus 24-h treatment with the bradykinin antagonist B-9430 (CPT-BK1). CPT rats consumed significantly more water and produced more urine vs. CTL. Urine osmolality was significantly decreased in CPT rats vs. CTL. Inner medullary aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein abundance was also markedly decreased in CPT rats vs. CTL. These findings were reversed in CPT-LIM rats, suggesting captopril-induced primary polydipsia. CPT-BKI rats demonstrated parameters no different from CTL despite ad libitum water intake. Mean arterial pressure and 24-h creatinine clearance did not differ among groups. We conclude that ACEI with captopril induces primary polydipsia despite impaired production of the dipsogen ANG II and that this primary increase in water intake is likely the cause of the decreased protein abundance of inner medullary AQP2. Furthermore, this dipsogenic effect was reversed by antagonism of bradykinin, thus implicating this hormone in thirst regulation in the rat.", 
    "1": "A number of neurohormones and cytokines are activated in heart failure and their activity is related to the progression of heart failure. Inhibiting the deleterious effects of the activated sympathetic and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems with b-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone blockers has been remarkably successful in improving the survival of patients with heart failure. However, inhibition of the other neurohormones and cytokines has not provided the expected incremental benefit, and in some cases has been deleterious, suggesting a ceiling effect of further neurohormonal blockade. This article reviews some of these studies and analyzes the possible causes of these observations.", 
    "2": "With the advent of the 21st century, heart failure has emerged as a major component of the massive public health problem of cardiovascular disease. Currently over 5 million Americans suffer from the syndrome of heart failure with significant direct treatment costs estimated to be in excess of $22 billion per year. Unfortunately, assuming present demographic and medical trends continue, these bleak statistics are expected to worsen substantially over the next two decades. Epidemiologic studies have furthered our mechanistic understanding of heart failure pathophysiology by demonstrating that many patients with this syndrome have preserved systolic function by standard indices. In a positive turn, major advances have occurred in the treatment of heart failure based on the development of clinically effective pharmacologic antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. These agents are capable of substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. However, the importance of enhanced physician and public awareness of heart failure remains critical in the future.", 
    "3": "Despite increasing pharmacological and mechanical treatment options, ischemic heart disease continues to be associated with considerable patient mortality and morbidity. The estimates of the direct and indirect costs associated with chronic stable angina amount to billions of dollars. Given the epidemiological and economic magnitude of the problem, the need for more effective therapies is self-evident. Based on current guidelines, the management of ischemic heart disease has progressively broadened to include risk factor modification, patient education, and pharmacological therapy. The latter includes i) classic antianginal agents such as beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and nitrates, and ii) drugs for secondary prevention, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Tailoring therapy to individual needs has become even more challenging because of the marked changes in the clinical profile of patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Compared with the past, today's patients tend to be older, to have undergone revascularization procedures, and to frequently have associated illnesses, including heart failure and diabetes. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the role of cardiac energy metabolism in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. A better understanding of metabolic derangements associated with ischemia and reperfusion is translating into innovative therapeutic approaches. Optimization of cardiac energy metabolism is based on promoting cardiac glucose oxidation. This has been proved to enhance cardiac function and protect myocardial tissue against ischemia-reperfusion injury. A new class of metabolic agents, known as the 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase inhibitors (trimetazidine), is able to elicit an increase in glucose and lactate combustion secondary to partial inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, producing clinical benefits in patients with ischemic heart disease.",

Co-prescription of drugs with potential for interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was not uncommon (16.7%). Of the 353 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, only 64 (18.1%) were receiving ACE inhibitors. The dosages used were lower than recommended for this indication. A significantly higher proportion of elderly patients with heart failure were prescribed hypnotic drugs (14.7% versus 8.3%; p<0.001) and had the co-existence of insomnia (11.8% versus 6.9%; p<0.001) compared to patients without heart failure.",

    "9": "Antihypertensive treatment has improved renal prognosis and survival in diabetic nephropathy. The present review summarizes the current status of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetic nephropathy. Since the current treatment strategies reduce, but do not prevent, the progression of kidney disease, the research focus is directed towards the potential renoprotective effects of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system using both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.", 
    "10": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are now a first-line therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, whereas in patients with type 2 diabetes, angiotensin II receptor blockers have been shown to protect the kidney. The optimal doses of both types of drug remain to be determined, and the efficacy of each medication needs to be compared both in patients with type 1 diabetes and in those with type 2 diabetes. Experimental studies suggests that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may offer additive beneficial effects relative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. In agreement with this, short-term studies of patients with diabetes have suggested that further renal and cardiovascular protection is achieved using dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Long-term trials will finally define the role of this new treatment concept in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "11": "All diabetic patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion need blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. In addition, albuminuria and elevated blood pressure should be treated aggressively with a view to achieving blood pressure readings below 130/80 mmHg and albuminuria values of less than 300 mg/24 h; this often necessitates multi-pharmacy. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may be helpful in reaching these goals in treatment-resistant patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

Understanding the mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is essential in establishing novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention or arrest of progressive kidney diseases. The present review focuses on a newly proposed mechanism of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, one that emphasizes the roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular activation.", 
    "13": "Among the cells that accumulate in the renal interstitium, fibroblasts are the principal effectors mediating tubulointerstitial fibrosis. By contrast, the phagocytosis of extracellular matrix and apoptotic cells by macrophages may actually exert a beneficial effect. Interstitial fibroblasts are more heterogeneous than expected, and during renal fibrosis new fibroblasts are derived mainly through epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The intracellular signaling pathways leading to initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition remain largely unknown, though recent studies have identified beta-catenin and Smad3 activation of lymphoid enhancer factor, integrin-linked kinase, and small GTPases and mitogen-activated protein kinases as key components. Transforming growth factor-beta is believed to be a critical fibrogenic factor, but recent studies have also focused on transforming growth factor-beta independent pathways as mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. As the mechanisms underlying tubulointerstitial fibrosis leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition have been identified, so have cytokines that efficiently antagonize renal fibrosis, particularly bone morphogenic protein-7 and hepatocyte growth factor.",

    "15": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta adrenergic blockers, and nesiritide are pharmacologic agents for heart failure with both short- and long-term neurohormonal and hemodynamic effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure. Higher doses may result in better outcomes than lower doses, but concern about hemodynamic tolerance is a major barrier to the initiation and up-titration of these agents. Nesiritide is a newer neurohormonal agent with proven efficacy and safety for use in decompensated heart failure, but appropriate patient selection has been challenging for clinicians. Like vasodilators, nesiritide may be underutilized in heart failure treatment. Impedance cardiography is a newer, noninvasive monitoring technology that can accurately measure hemodynamic parameters. Impedance cardiography is being used with increasing frequency by clinicians to guide therapy in patients with heart failure and has been proposed in heart failure treatment algorithms. Three case reports are presented to illustrate how hemodynamic data using impedance cardiography can be utilized in the initiation and titration of neurohormonal agents.", 
    "16": "In elderly patients with systolic hypertension resistant to treatment with conventional therapy, increased aortic pulse wave reflection and a high augmentation index are often present. These findings are indicative of endothelial dysfunction and deficient generation of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator in the arterial tree. In such patients, treatment with the nitric oxide donor extended-release isosorbide mononitrate characteristically produces prompt and sustained falls in both pulse wave reflection and systolic blood pressure. The adjunct use of this nitrate produces useful additional decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 10 to 45 mm Hg, often achieving target blood pressure goals in isolated systolic hypertension. By combining this endothelium-independent nitric oxide donor with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, the potential exists to address both the nitric oxide deficiency and endothelial dysfunction of the vascular endothelium in these patients. Other possibilities for synergism with this combination include complementary hemodynamic, circadian, and metabolic actions together with prevention of nitrate tolerance. Isosorbide mononitrate may also be used successfully with calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and diuretics.", 
    "17": "Approximately 40% of Japanese patients with essential hypertension, including low-renin hypertension, are inadequately managed. Low-renin hypertension generally responds poorly to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, but may respond more optimally to diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and aldosterone blockers. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone in 193 Japanese patients with essential hypertension. Although not a study inclusion criterion, baseline active plasma renin levels were consistently low (5.7-10.1 mU/L); most patients met the criteria for low-renin hypertension (< or =42.5 mU/L; normal range, 7-76 mU/L). Patients received placebo or eplerenone 50, 100, or 200 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly (-6.8 to -10.6 mm Hg vs. -2.1 mm Hg; p< or =0.0022 vs. placebo). Eplerenone offers significant blood pressure reduction with good tolerability in Japanese patients with hypertension, including those with low-renin hypertension.", 
    "18": "Heart failure affects 3% of African Americans. The etiology of disease and prognosis for these patients differs substantially from those for non-African Americans. A history of hypertension is associated with development of heart failure more often in African Americans than in non-African Americans and it also appears that target organ involvement is more severe in African Americans with hypertension than in other patient subgroups. Reviewing the results from large-scale clinical end point studies suggests that optimal treatment for heart failure in African Americans may differ from that of their non-African American counterparts. More importantly, concomitant use of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be as effective in African Americans as in non-African Americans. Utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone may not represent ideal therapy. Of the drugs studied, especially among the beta blockers, carvedilol may be the most effective to use for this population.", 
    "19": "The antihypertrophic action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the heart results partly from local potentiation of bradykinin. We have demonstrated that the antihypertrophic action of bradykinin is mediated by the release of nitric oxide from endothelium and elevation of cardiomyocyte cGMP. Whether other paracrine factors derived from the coronary endothelium, such as prostacyclin (PGI2), may act to prevent hypertrophy has not been explored. In the vasculature, activation by PGI2 of IP and EP1 prostanoid receptors elicits vasodilatation (via cAMP-dependent signaling) and vasoconstriction, respectively. The present objective was to determine whether IP prostanoid receptor activation has antihypertrophic actions in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCM). The selective IP agonist cicaprost (1 microM) virtually abolished the increase in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation (a marker of hypertrophy) induced either by endothelin-1 (ET-1; 60 nM, n = 10, P < 0.005) or by angiotensin II (1 microM, n = 6, P < 0.005). Cicaprost also inhibited ET-1 induction of c-fos mRNA expression, an additional marker of hypertrophy in ARCM (n = 5, P < 0.005). In the absence of hypertrophic stimuli, cicaprost alone did not significantly influence either marker. The antihypertrophic actions of cicaprost were mimicked by the dual IP/EP1 agonist iloprost (1 microM) in the presence of the EP1 antagonist AH-6809 (3 microM). Furthermore, cicaprost modestly but significantly increased cardiomyocyte cAMP content by 13 +/- 6% (P < 0.05, n = 4), and the antihypertrophic effect of cicaprost was lost in the presence of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-89 (1 microM, n = 5, P < 0.05). However, ET-1 also induced increases in the activity of the intracellular growth signals ERK1 (by 3-fold) and ERK2 (by 5-fold) in ARCM, and these were not inhibited by cicaprost (P < 0.01, n = 5). Activation of IP receptors thus represents a novel approach to prevention of hypertrophy, and this effect is linked to cAMP-dependent signaling.", 
    "20": "Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) stimulate UCP-3 expression in skeletal muscle. We examined whether thyroid hormone-induced changes in uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 mRNA expression are related to directs effects of T3 or reflect secondary effects of the hormone through stimulation of renin-angiotensin or beta-adrenergic systems. Hyperthyroidism was produced by three injections of 100 microg T3/100 g body weight on alternate days with or without concomitant treatment with either captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor), propranolol (a beta-blocker) or clenbuterol (a beta2-agonist). The relative abundance of UCP-3 mRNA was measured in ventricular myocardium and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus). T3 resulted in a significant increase in the relative abundance of UCP-3 in heart and skeletal muscle (p < 0.05), and the effect was not altered by captopril or propanolol; the inhibitors alone had no effect of UCP-3 mRNA content. There was no synergistic or additive effect of T3 and clenbuterol on UCP-3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. Increased UCP-3 mRNA levels were associated with increased UCP-3 protein expression in skeletal muscle. We conclude that the effect of T3 on UCP-3 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle is not dependent on either angiotensin II or the beta-adrenergic system and probably reflects a direct action of the hormone on UCP-3 gene expression.",

The dosages of which were adapted accordingly to the plasma concentration of N-terminal-pro-brain-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).

The use of thiazide diuretics was also associated with an increased risk of LEA when compared to the use of any non-thiazide antihypertensive drug (adjusted OR: 7.04 [1.10-45.30]). The increased risk of LEA associated with the use of thiazides compared to the use of non-thiazides depended on the duration of use (adjusted OR(< or = 365 days), 4.82 [0.61-38.34] and adjusted OR(>365 days), 26.16 [1.02-674.02], p-trend = 0.01).",

After a 4-week run-in placebo period, 80 patients (37 male and 43 female), aged 41-65 years, were randomly allocated to an 8-week treatment with delapril 30 mg once daily or irbesartan 150 mg once daily. Thereafter, manidipine l0 mg once daily was added to delapril treatment and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to irbesartan treatment for a further 8 weeks. Blood pressure (BP), plasma t-PA and PAI-l activities were evaluated at the end of the run-in period, after 4-week monotherapy treatments, and at the end of the combination treatment periods. Both combination treatments, delapril-manidipine and irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, produced a greater reduction in systolic BP/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) values (-27.6/21.8 mmHg and -26.4/20.2 mmHg, respectively) than the respective monotherapies (-15.2/11.7 mmHg with delapril and -16.3/11.3 mmHg with irbesartan). Delapril monotherapy significantly decreased plasma PAI-l activity (-10.4 IU/mI; P<0.05). The addition of manidipine produced a significant increase in t-PA activity (+0.27 IU/mI); P<0.05). Irbesartan monotherapy did not significantly affect the fibrinolytic balance, whereas the addition of hydrochlorothiazide worsened it, producing a significant increase in PAI-l activity (+9.5 IU/ml; P<0.05). In hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus, the combination delapril-manidipine may determine a greater improvement of the fibrinolytic function than the respective monotherapy, while the association irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide may worsen it.",

Enalaprilat concentrations, plasma activity of ACE, and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were determined. Basal activity of ACE and the maximum ACE inhibition were significantly smaller in women. No significant differences in the drug concentration required to produce 50% of Emax were observed.

    "28": "We evaluated the possibility that endogenous angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] could participate in the potentiation of bradykinin (BK) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in conscious Wistar rats. Catheters were introduced into descending aorta (through the left carotid artery) for BK injection, femoral artery for arterial pressure measurement, and both femoral veins for BK injection and vehicle or Ang-(1-7) antagonist, A-779 infusion. Infusion of vehicle or A-779 started 40 to 45 minutes after captopril administration. Sequential BK dose-response curves were made before, 10 minutes after captopril, and within 10 minutes of infusion of vehicle or A-779. To evaluate angiotensin I conversion, dose-response curves for angiotensin I and angiotensin II were made following the same protocol used for BK. Captopril treatment markedly increased the BK hypotensive effect and significantly decreased angiotensin I conversion. Infusion of A-779 did not modify the angiotensin II pressor effect or the effect of captopril on angiotensin I conversion. However, A-779 significantly reduced the potentiating effect of captopril on the hypotensive effect of BK administered intravenously or intra-arterially. These results suggest that endogenous Ang-(1-7) and/ or an Ang-(1-7)-related peptide plays an important role in the BK potentiation by ACEI through a mechanism not dependent upon inhibition of ACE hydrolytic activity.", 
    "29": "T he Dual Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator (DAVID) trial randomized 506 patients and tested the hypothesis that the dual-chamber pacing mode would produce improved hemodynamics and would in turn reduce congestive heart failure, heart failure hospitalizations, heart failure deaths, atrial fibrillation, strokes, ventricular arrhythmias, and total mortality compared to backup ventricular pacing in patients indicated for implantable defibrillator therapy. Patients had either primary prevention indications (47%) or secondary prevention indications (53%) for implantable defibrillator therapy but had no indications for bradycardia pacemaker support. All the patients had moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less (mean = 27%) and were consistently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (86%) and beta adrenergic blocking agents (85%). The primary combined endpoint of hospitalization for congestive heart failure or death was paradoxically increased and statistically significant ( p = 0.03) at one year in the patients paced in the dual chamber mode (22.6%) compared to patients randomized to ventricular backup pacing (13.3%). Both heart failure hospitalization and mortality contributed outcome. Another perspective would consider this a randomized controlled study of presence or absence of pacemaker therapy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and indications for implantable defibrillator therapy. Ventricular backup pacing produced less than 3% ventricular and no atrial pacing, while dual chamber pacing produced approximately 60% atrial and ventricular paced heart beats. The poor outcome in the dual chamber paced group correlated with the percentage of right ventricular pacing and suggests that right ventricular pacing caused ventricular dyssynchrony. The poor outcome associated with right ventricular pacing compared to intrinsic activation in the control group of the DAVID trial is reminiscent of the poor outcome associated with prolonged intraventricular conduction activation in the control groups compared to biventricular pacing in the intervention groups of the cardiac resynchronization trials. The direct conclusion from these results are that patients with indications for implantable defibrillators and no indication for pacing should not be paced in the dual chamber pacing mode. It is not appropriate to conclude that only single chamber implantable defibrillators should be implanted. There are other potential advantages to having an implanted atrial lead including improved secondary outcomes. However the DAVID trial results suggest that the dual chamber paced mode was not associated with improved quality of life or decreased frequency of hospitalization, inappropriate shocks from the defibrillator or atrial fibrillation. The more important question is what is the optimal pacing mode in these patients? The AAIR mode is under investigation in the DAVID II study in an attempt to identify a pacing mode that preserves atrio-ventricular synchrony, normal atrio-ventricular timing, prevents bradycardia and also prevents right ventricular stimulation. Caution should be taken to not directly apply these results to patients with either an indication for pacemaker therapy or to patients with an indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy since patients from neither population were included. However, considering the large magnitude of the deleterious effects associated with dual chamber pacing in the DAVID trial future studies should explore the possibility that left ventricular stimulation may be the only pacing mode capable of preventing bradycardia without increasing death and congestive heart failure.", 
    "30": "Several randomized clinical trials have been designed to evaluate the usefulness of prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In 2 trials, CAT and AMIOVIRT, no survival benefit was reported for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and prophylactic ICD therapy. The major limitation of both trials is the small sample size of 104 patients in CAT and 103 patients in AMIOVIRT. Another limitation of both trials is the lack of a run-in phase on optimized medical therapy. Since LV function may improve considerably on optimized medical therapy, LV function should be reevaluated 3 to 4 months after initiation of ACE inhibitors, ss-blockers and aldosterone antagonists before prophylactic ICD therapy is considered. Two additional trials, DEFINITE and SCD-HEFT, are still ongoing. Particularly SCD-HEFT will follow a sufficient number of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy to give a more definitive answer with regard to the clinical usefulness of prophylactic ICDs in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Recently, the Marburg Cardiomyopathy study (MACAS) was finished. The results of MACAS strongly suggest that reduced LV ejection fraction is the most important arrhythmia risk predictor in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability and T wave alternans do not appear to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. In addition, MACAS showed that total mortality in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction <30% is only about 5% per year on optimized medical therapy after exclusion of patients with end stage heart failure and after exclusion of patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, any future study designed to demonstrate a mortality benefit by prophylactic ICD therapy with an 80% power in this patient population needs to enroll more than 1000 patients.",

All patients received standard oral medical therapy for heart failure including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Patients were randomized to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) versus no ICD. Patients were followed for 2 to 3 years. The primary endpoint was total mortality. Quality of life and pharmacoeconomics analysis was also performed. A registry tracked patients who met basic inclusion criteria but were not randomized. We estimated an annual total mortality of 15% at 2 years in the treatment arm that did not receive an ICD. The ICD was expected to reduce mortality by 50%. Approximately 229 patients were required in each treatment group. Forty-five centers were included in this trial that was designed to last an estimated 4 years.

    "32": "Intrauterine programming of hypertension is associated with evidence of increased renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether arterial baroreflex and blood pressure variability are altered in a model of in utero programming of hypertension secondary to isocaloric protein deprivation and whether activation of the RAS plays a role in this alteration. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed a normal-protein (18%) or low-protein (9%) diet during gestation, which had no effect on litter size, birth weight, or pup survival. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP; 126 +/- 3 mm Hg 9% versus 108 +/- 4 mm Hg 18%; p < 0.05) and blood pressure variability were significantly greater in the adult offspring of the 9% protein-fed mothers. Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate, generated by graded i.v. infusion of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, was significantly shifted toward higher pressure; i.v. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor normalized MABP and shifted the arterial baroreflex curve of the 9% offspring toward lower pressure without affecting the 18% offspring. For examining whether brain RAS is also involved in programming of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and losartan (specific AT(1) receptor antagonist) were administered intracerebroventricularly; both significantly reduced MABP of the 9% but not the 18% offspring. Autoradiographic receptor binding studies demonstrated an increase in brain AT(1) expression in the subfornical organ and the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis in the 9% offspring. These data demonstrate a major tonic role of brain and peripheral RAS on hypertension associated with antenatal nutrient deprivation.", 
    "33": "Pharmaceutical expenditure is a challenge to the financial compatibility of health systems because it is growing faster (+11% per year in the last 5 years in Italy) than any other health sector. In order to curb public pharmaceutical expenditure 2 interventions are commonly used: delisting (de-reimbursement) and reference price, with the difference being paid by patients. The Italian Ministry of Health implemented a set of interventions with the general aim of pharmaceutical governance based on the following criteria: (a) to assure a complete coverage of all clinically and epidemiologically relevant diseases; (b) to provide health professionals with a range of different active drugs with the same therapeutic indications within the same therapeutic class; and (c) to identify a reimbursement threshold in order to save public money by narrowing the (wide) price differentials among drugs with comparable efficacy and safety. In this context, interventions have been undertaken at several levels including drug price reduction, generic drug promotion, delisting of drugs reimbursed, and direct distribution of medicines (by hospital services). Furthermore, a new National Pharmaceutical Formulary has been implemented. Medicines have been classified into homogeneous categories (ie, medicines with the same main indication(s) and with similar clinical efficacy and safety profile). Within each homogeneous category, a reimbursement level (cutoff) was then identified and, accordingly, pharmaceutical companies were asked to adjust their price. This adjustment was based on price per daily drug dose (DDD), cumulative expenditure (at least 50%), and cumulative utilization (at least 60%). This readjustment, at no cost for patients, is expected to save more than Euro 280 million of public money. Seventy-seven percent of this saving will be due to price readjustment of antiulcers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and some antibiotics (mainly cephalosporins). The Italian system was able to cover all relevant diseases and ensured citizens and health professionals a choice among a wide range of valid pharmacological therapies. At the same time it was able to save public money by narrowing wide price differentials among drugs with comparable clinical properties. The set of interventions yielded a new national formulary that was able to have a significant influence on the trend of drug expenditure in Italy. This experience can be a useful reference for other European and non-European states.",

An average of 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.3 DRPs per patient were found in the departments of cardiology, geriatrics, respiratory medicine, and rheumatology, respectively. Significant differences in the type of DRPs between the patient groups were found. The most frequent DRPs and the patient group in which they most often occurred were nonoptimal dose (cardiology, respiratory, geriatric) and need for additional drug (rheumatology).", 
    "38": "DRPs occurred in the majority of the patients in all departments. The type of DRP differed markedly between the patient groups. Knowledge of these differences is clinically valuable by enabling us to guide efforts toward prevention of DRPs. Antithrombotic agents, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillins, antiinflammatory drugs, and opioid analgesics commonly caused DRPs, even in departments where knowledge of these drugs is assumed to be extensive.",

    "44": "The first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were introduced in 1981. They are used in the management of a variety of cardiovascular disorders and their role in hypertension, heart failure, managing asymptomatic and symptomatic left-ventricular dysfunction, post-myocardial infarction, stroke prevention, and diabetes is now well established. This is recognised in the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (Department of Health, 2000) and the guidelines from the British Hypertension Society (Ramsay et al, 1999).

    "46": "118 patients attending an HF center were tested for circulating levels of norepinephrine (NE), T cells and the inflammation-associated cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Levels of the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) produced by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured in culture supernatants following T cell stimulation in vitro.", 
    "47": "NE levels were significantly lower in patients receiving ACE inhibitors (p = 0.0263), with a trend toward lower NE in patients receiving beta-blockers. All patients exhibited relatively normal levels of T cells, and there was a trend toward higher levels of total (CD3+) and helper (CD4+) T cells (p = 0.0578 and 0.0932, respectively) in patients receiving either type of medication. The ratios of Th1 (IFNgamma) to Th2 (IL-10) cytokines were lower in patients receiving a combination of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy (p = 0.0373). NYHA class was a significant predictor of serum IL-6 (p < 0.0001). There was a trend toward lower levels of serum IL-6 in patients receiving both types of medications (p = 0.0606). TNFalpha production by CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMC was significantly lower in patients receiving ACE inhibitor medications (p = 0.0223).",

    "49": "Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the categories of drugs most frequently used by elderly people, and maybe the most self-prescribed drugs. Both coronary events, and stroke, can be prevented by daily aspirin assumption. Other NSAIDs, except selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), seem to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, but a definitive judgement is yet impossible. Moreover, these drugs cause more than 100,000 serious gastric adverse events each year in the US, and the risk increases exponentially in the elderly. Coxibs cause less gastric damage, but their cost is very high. Moreover, NSAIDs inhibit renal function and reduce the efficacy of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, often used by elderly patients. Recent studies show that even COX-2 is important in the renal physiology, so that even coxibs appear not to be avoided of renal toxicity. Both gastric and renal toxicity induced by traditional NSAIDs and coxibs seem to be related to the fact that these drugs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), but not those of leukotrienes (LTs), important mediators of inflammation and of many other physiopatological events. Newly developed anti-inflammatory drugs block both COX and the 5-LOX metabolic pathways, inhibiting the formation of PGs, thromboxanes (TXs) and LTs. The inhibition of the LT synthesis increases the anti-inflammatory efficacy (especially in pneumological and rheumatological diseases), reducing the risk of gastric damage. Even if preliminary data seem to be very interesting, further clinical safety data on these drugs obtained from elderly oriented trials need to be available before to give a final evaluation.", 
    "50": "Hypertension and high levels of proteinuria are independent risk factors for accelerated progression of renal failure. There is increasing evidence that strict control of both blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria are beneficial in slowing the rate of progression of chronic renal disease in diabetic as well as non-diabetic nephropathy. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARB) have clearly demonstrated their beneficial effect on both reduction of BP and proteinuria. The calcium channel blockers (CCB) have individual pharmacological and therapeutic properties that may vary, but as a group they are effective antihypertensive agents in patients with renal disease. Their effects on the kidney may extend beyond BP reduction alone. Current studies suggest that CCB do not worsen the progression of renal disease but may rather provide benefit when systemic BP has been tightly normalised. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP), diltiazem and verapamil, slow the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy with overt proteinuria almost to a similar extent as observed with ACE-I. The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP) have a variable effect on proteinuria. Pharmaceutical compounds, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), remain the drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension and/or proteinuria in chronic nephropathy. However, a combination of two or more drugs is almost always required to attain sufficient BP reduction. CCB may have an advantage in combination with ACE-I and/or ARB.", 
    "51": "Five patients with severe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) were followed for 10-18 years. Because of proteinuria, arterial hypertension, and reduced glomerular filtration rates, they received either captopril (n=2) or enalapril (n=3), or both (n=1) for 8-15 years. Blood pressure was normalized and proteinuria reduced in all; glomerular filtration improved in three patients and fell moderately in two. Four of the five patients have reached adult age with body weight and height, blood pressure, and serum creatinine levels within the normal range. At the last evaluation, median proteinuria was 220 mg/24 h (range 0-310) and glomerular filtration rate 56 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)(range 40-127). This long-term study indicates a renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with sequelae after HUS.", 
    "52": "The present study was performed in order to gain new insights into the existence of a brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in teleost fish. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of centrally administered angiotensin (ANG) I ([Asn(1),Val(5),Asn(9)]ANG I) and ANG II ([Asn(1),Val(5)]ANG II) on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in the unanesthetized trout. The animals were studied before and after treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Trout were equipped with two subcutaneous electrocardiographic electrodes and with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannula inserted within the third ventricle of the brain. The i.c.v. injection of vehicle had no effect on the recorded parameters. The i.c.v. injections of ANG I and ANG II at doses of 5 and 50 pmol had a marked effect on HR and HRV. At a dose of 50 pmol, ANG I and ANG II produced a progressive and significant increase in HR (+36% and+45%, respectively) but elicited a profound decrease in HRV (-88% and-92%, respectively). I.c.v. injection of captopril (10 microg) had no effect on HR or HRV. However, this ACE inhibitor prevented the tachycardia and abolished the decrease in HRV mediated by 50 pmol of ANG I. In contrast, captopril had no effect upon the cardiac actions of 50 pmol of ANG II. These results give the first support for the existence of functional important ACE-like activity in the brain of a teleost fish and suggest that the brain RAS in this class of vertebrate may be involved in the control of cardiac chronotropic activity.", 
    "53": "Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Strategies that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system have been shown to reduce the ensuing threatening risk factors. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of subchronic administration of enalapril on the aortic reactivity of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. For this purpose, STZ-diabetic rats received enalapril (10 and 20 mg/kg ip) daily for 2 months. Contractile responses to phenylephrine (PE) and relaxation responses to acetylcholine (Ach) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISD) were obtained from aortic rings. Concentration-response curves from enalapril-treated diabetic (ED) rats to PE were attenuated as compared to vehicle-treated diabetics (VD), especially at a dose of 20 mg/kg for enalapril. In addition, endothelium-dependent relaxation responses induced by Ach was significantly higher in ED rats as compared to diabetic ones. The endothelium-independent relaxation responses for ISD were also found not to be significantly different among the groups. Therefore, subchronic treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril in a dose-dependent manner could prevent the functional changes in vascular reactivity in diabetic rats.", 
    "54": "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a mediator with a likely role in chronic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. In the present study, mouse tracheal segments were cultured for 1, 4 or 8 days in the absence and presence of TNF-alpha. Contractile response of cultured segments to des-Arg9-bradykinin and bradykinin was assessed in myographs and mRNA for bradykinin B1 and B2 receptors was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both contraction to des-Arg9-bradykinin and bradykinin, mediated via bradykinin B1 and B2 receptors, respectively, and mRNA levels for these receptors were up-regulated following culture. These responses were markedly increased in segments treated with TNF-alpha. Experiments with SP600125 (anthrax(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one) and PD98059 (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) demonstrated that both intracellular c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways were implicated in this process. Thus, TNF-alpha causes an increase of bradykinin contractility in mouse trachea, which at least partly is due to a transcriptional increase of bradykinin receptors.", 
    "55": "We have investigated the effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan, and the angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, on catecholamine release from the anaesthetized dog's adrenal gland. These drugs were given systemically in low and high doses. The gland was stimulated electrically (0.5-12 Hz) and by angiotensin II infusion (40 ng/kg/min). Electrical stimulation resulted in frequency-dependent increases in catecholamine release. Candesartan (0.8, 4.0 mg/kg) and ramipril (0.125, 0.625 mg/kg) increased basal catecholamine release along with decreases in blood pressure. Both drugs diminished direct nerve stimulation-induced catecholamine release. When both drugs were combined, their inhibitory effect was slightly enhanced. Candesartan blocked catecholamine release induced by angiotensin II. Ramipril was not tested in this respect. The percentage of noradrenaline released during electrical stimulation of the gland remained constant and ranged from 14% to 22%. Both drugs appear to act by blocking local modulation of catecholamine release by the chromaffin cells.", 
    "56": "Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring has shown that BP typically declines by 10% to 20% during sleep and increases fairly rapidly in the early morning period. Because the early morning period has been associated with both loss of hypertension control and increased rates of myocardial infarction and stroke, there has been interest in evaluating the effects of antihypertensive therapy at this particular time of the day. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a long half-life (telmisartan, 24 h) versus intermediate half-life (valsartan, 6 to 9 h) on early morning BP in two scenarios: after an active dose and after a missed dose of each agent.", 
    "57": "The study was a double-blind, randomized trial that compared telmisartan (40 to 80 mg once daily) versus valsartan (80 to 160 mg once daily) on early morning BP in 490 patients with hypertension. Ambulatory BP recordings were performed at baseline after a placebo period and again after 6 and 8 weeks of double-blind therapy in a randomized cross-over design. The monitoring patients received either an active dose or a placebo dose (to mimic a \"missed\" dose). The primary study end point was reduction in the BP in the early morning period (last 6 h of the dosing period).", 
    "58": "After the active dose, telmisartan reduced the BP during the last 6 h of the dosing period by -11/-7.6 +/- 0.8/0.6 mm Hg compared to -8.7/-5.8 +/- 0.8/0.6 mm Hg on valsartan (P = .02 for systolic BP and.01 for diastolic BP). On the day of the missed dose, telmisartan reduced the early morning BP by -9.0/-6.3 +/- 0.7/0.6 mm Hg versus -7.4/-5.1 +/- 0.7/0.4 mm Hg on valsartan (P = .09 for systolic BP and.06 for diastolic BP). On the day of the missed dose, reductions in 24-h average BP for the two antihypertensive agents were -10.3/-6.9 mm Hg for telmisartan versus -8.7/-5.9 mm Hg for valsartan (P = .06 for systolic BP and.056 for diastolic BP).", 
    "59": "On a day of active therapy, telmisartan lowered both systolic and diastolic BP to a greater extent than valsartan for the last 6 h of the dosing interval. On a day in which a dose was missed, there was a notable trend for greater BP reduction during the latter part of the dosing interval on telmisartan versus valsartan. These results demonstrate that telmisartan achieved a greater effect than valsartan on BP during the early morning period in patients with hypertension.", 
    "60": "Drug-induced airway disease is a significant problem and must be considered in the differential diagnosis. A history of drug intake with a temporal association should raise the physician's suspicion toward a drug-induced cause. Because most of the conditions are amenable to withdrawal of the offending agent, an early diagnosis is essential. Conditions like obliterative bronchiolitis, are usually irreversible, but timely stoppage of the provoking agent can prevent further progression of the disease. Most of the drug reactions are nonallergic and the physician and the patient should be aware of this fact. In view of the constantly-evolving therapies, an active policy to identify and report adverse effects is essential to develop management strategies and treatment recommendations.", 
    "61": "The objective of this study was to compare the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker on the development of renal changes in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin in normotensive Wistar rats. Treatment was commenced immediately in 1 set of rats with 4 treatment arms: nitrendipine (250 mg/kg fodder), enalapril (35 mg/L drinking water), both treatments in combination, or placebo. Treatment was continued for 9 weeks. Another set of rats was left with untreated diabetes for 3 months followed by 7 weeks treatment as above. When starting treatment right after induction of diabetes, nitrendipine significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion (UAE) to the nondiabetic level (P < .05) without reducing blood pressure (BP), whereas enalapril failed to significantly reduce UAE despite a reduction in BP. Combining the two treatments showed no further reduction in UAE compared to monotherapy with nitrendipine, despite a lower BP. When leaving diabetic rats untreated for 3 months, only the coadministration of nitrendipine and enalapril showed a significant reduction in UAE compared to monotherapy and placebo treatment, but showed no significant effect on BP.", 
    "62": "Cardiac rehabilitation is accepted as an important component in the management of heart disease. Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease frequently associated to ischemic heart disease and both disease require continuing medical care, aggressive treatment of other risk factors, educational programs for self management of disease to prevent acute complication. The scientific community should offer standard of care for management of diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, and should design new strategies to promote prevention in this high risk patients. The need to define characteristics and peculiar problems of diabetics patients with ischemic heart disease encouraged the Board of the Italian Group of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention (GICR) to set up a working group composed of cardiologists and diabetologists chosen on the basis of their proven specific experience. The document is subdivided in six parts. In the first section is described the cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes and the importance of post-prandial hyperglycemia and glycemic variability. We analyse also the difference in prevalence of ischemic heart disease in Italian diabetic patients compared with other countries. In the second section we described clinical presentation of ischemic heart disease in diabetic patients such as acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, and the revascularization procedures (balloon angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery). We analysed the differences between the procedures and the evidence-based results. In patients with myocardial infarction we analysed the evidence-based therapy and specific advantages of aspirin, beta-blockers and ace-inhibitor in diabetic patients. In this section we also posed particular attention to the clinical course of patients who underwent bypass grafting and to the impact of diabetes on short and long-term results and on main intervention-related complications including deep infections, mediastinitis, neurological problems, renal failure. In the third section we evaluated the factors responsible of atherosclerosis progression and their treatment, and we underlined that cardiac rehabilitation is less effective for patients with diabetes mellitus. Suggestions proposed in this paper about risk factors are in line with the recommendations of standards guidelines of American Diabetics Association. In patients with concomitant diabetes and ischemic heart disease we suggest blood pressure <130/80, LDL-cholesterol <100 mg/dl, triglycerides <150 mg/dl and daily physical activity. In the fourth section we analysed therapeutic regimens and management of diabetes. We posed particular attention on insulin therapy in acute phase of myocardial infarction and in recent coronary bypass grafting, and chronic use of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin. In the fifth section we provided some recommendations on the organization of educational programs and physical activity in these patients. In the last section we provided some information on diagnosis of coronary artery disease in diabetes, aim of screening and in which patients is need to perform diagnostic tests. We described the available diagnostic tests with the differences in each method.",

They will need aggressive secondary prophylaxis, including modification of lifestyle risk factors. Most of these patients should be treated with statins. As clinical events often are manifestations of thrombotic complications, this patient group should be treated with platelet inhibition, anticoagulation, or both. After a myocardial infarction patients should be considered for anticoagulant treatment, for acetylsalicylic acid, or both. After coronary revascularisation acetylsalicylic acid should be considered primarily. If acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated, clopidogrel is an alternative. After coronary stenting acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel should be prescribed combined, for up to one year afterwards. If indicated, anticoagulant treatment can be added to platelet inhibition. After bypass surgery, anticoagulation is equally effective as acetylsalicylic acid against graft occlusion and can be given alone if indicated. International Normalized Ratio can be aimed at 3.0 when anticoagulation is given alone, at 2.0-2.5 when combined with platelet inhibition. After a myocardial infarction patients should be given a beta-blocker if this is not strongly contraindicated and they also should be considered for ACE inhibitor treatment.

Besides, uninephrectomized rats without STZ injection were assigned as control group. Each group consisted of 6 rats. Twenty weeks later, they were sacrificed and left kidney of each rat was harvested respectively. The mRNA expression of angiotensinogen (Ao), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), preproendothelin-1 and endothelin A receptor (ETaR), and the protein expression of AngII, AT1R, ET-1 and ETaR in kidney tissue were semi-quantitatively detected with reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining respectively.",

After single i.v. dosing, concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat, its active metabolite, were measured. Two weeks later, enalapril was administered by nasogastric tube. Potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), enalapril, and enalaprilat concentrations and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured in serum. In addition, heart rate, blood pressure, digital venous blood gases, and lactate were measured. Two weeks later, enalapril was again administered by nasogastric tube. To mimic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, angiotensin I (0.5 microg/kg) was administered at fixed intervals, followed by blood-pressure and heart-rate measurement. The elimination half lives of enalapril and enalaprilat were 0.59 and 1.25 hours, respectively, after i.v. administration. After PO administration, enalapril and enalaprilat were not detectable in serum. There was a tendency (P = .0625) toward a decrease in ACE activity 45-120 minutes after enalapril administration, but ACE activity suppression was never > 16%. There was a tendency (P = .0625) toward a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) 6-8 hours after enalapril administration. Serum concentrations of potassium, creatinine, and BUN and digital venous blood gases and lactate concentrations did not change.

    "81": "Application of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers in asthmatic patients increases broncho-constriction, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may induce cough. In either case life quality of asthmatics may deteriorate. Increased sympathetic activity plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of arterial hypertension. Recently imidazoline receptor agonists have been used in the treatment of hypertension. The action of these drugs results in modification of the vegetative nervous system due to a decreased activity of the adrenergic system. Such modification could be disadvantageous in asthmatic patients in whom an increased parasympathetic tonus is an important mechanism of bronchoconstriction. The aim of the paper was to assess the autonomic nervous system during spontaneous overnight sleep in 10 mild or moderate asthmatic women in a stable stage of the disease; they were all treated for mild or moderate arterial hypertension with Tenaxum 1 mg daily. The examination consisted in spectral analysis of the heart rate variability of 10 min. periods repeated every five minutes. The following parameters of the spectral power were studied: high frequency components (HF) reflecting parasympathetic activity, low frequency components (LF) representing sympathetic activity, as well as the LF/HF ratio. The investigations, including spirometry, were performed before and on the 3rd and 21st day of treatment. Arterial tension was brought to normal in 7 out of 10 patients. Spirometric parameters (VC, FEV1, MEF50%FVC, MEF25%FVC) did not undergo any significant changes, however a significantly increased parasympathetic activity (HF) in the studied patients was found on day 21. The results of our investigations indicate that Tenaxum can be a safe therapeutic agent in the treatment of mild or moderate arterial hypertension in asthmatics.",

Typical chest pain (78.7%) and tachycardia (34.1%) were the most prevalent symptom and sign respectively. A history of previous angina was present in 18% of the patients. The most common presenting electrocardiographic finding was ST segment elevation (45.5%). Critical coronary lesions were present in 78.7%, mainly in the left anterior descending (LAD) (54.5%). Single-vessel disease was more frequent than multi-vessel disease (57.6% vs. 18.2%). Coronary arteries were angiographically normal in 9.1%. Left ventricular dysfunction assessed by echocardiography was present in 63.6%. Recurrent angina was the most common complication (24.2%). No fatal cases were recorded. Acute reperfusion therapy was indicated in fifteen patients: direct angioplasty in six, thrombolysis in six and none in three. Elective revascularization was performed in seventeen patients (angioplasty in ten and coronary artery bypass graft in seven). Secondary prevention included platelet antiaggregants in 100%, beta-blockers in 81.5%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in 42.2%, and statins in 42.2%.

All the vinegars showed radical-scavenging activity, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) inhibition in vitro. The radical-scavenging activity of the vinegar produced from sweet potato-shochu post-distillation slurry was higher than that of other two kinds of vinegar on the organic matter basis. The ACE inhibitory activities of all the vinegars were higher than that of each post-distillation slurry. The main components that showed ACE inhibitory activity would be peptides, and their content increased during acetic acid fermentation. Regarding AGE inhibition, only rice-shochu post-distillation slurry did not show such activity, but the other two post-distillation slurries and all the vinegars showed clear inhibitory activity. The activity appeared to depend on the concentration of amino groups except for sweet potato-shochu post-distillation slurry and the vinegar produced from it.",

Lesions were assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) before and immediately after stenting and in the follow-up phase. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) could only be performed on 20 lesions in group A and 16 lesions in group Q throughout the follow-up period. We analyzed each lesion at 5 sites.

Although it significantly improved a pre-specified primary endpoint, it did not improve the endpoint of all-cause mortality. Valsartan administered to patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) at baseline reduced the endpoint of all-cause mortality by 33% and the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity by 44%, compared with placebo. Based on these findings, valsartan became the first ARB to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of New York Heart Association class II-IV HF in patients who are intolerant of ACEIs.

    "103": "Hemodialysis as a therapeutic procedure in patients being in the end-stage of renal failure has been used since the sixties of the 20th century. Generally speaking, the conservative drug therapy in patients treated by hemodialysis is complex, and economically it consummes as great proportion of financial expenses. The aim of the study was to perform an economic analysis of 101 patients, both sexes (37 females and 64 males, aged from 22 to 81 years) treated by hemodialysis, in respect of drug treatment costs. The total average cost of treatment medication represented 161,589 SKK/patient/year. Eighty one percent of total expenses were linked with the consumption on antianemic drugs (102,298.40 SKK/patient/year). The second most expensive drug group (9% of the total cost) were medications used in coincidence with hemodialysis complications (14,981 SKK/patient/year). Diuretic--furosemid was the most frequently used drug out of the category of antihypertensive medications (68% of patients), followed by beta-blockers (preparation Concor), calcium channel blockers (preparations Norvasc and Plendil) and angiotensin converting enzyme tritace inhibitors (ACEI, preparations Trirace, Enap, Prestarium), respectively. Only 27% of patients were treated by hypolipidemic drugs mostly by the preparations of Gevilon and Innogen. In the majority of patients (93%) preparations for the correction of calcium and phosphorus metabolisms such as Vitacalcin and Rocaltrol were administered, the latter being most expensive. Antianemic drugs have been used in all patients. In this category of preparations, those composing acid folate and erythropoetin were used most frequently. Alkaline supplementation of NaHCO, (bicarbonate) was used in 88% of patients. In order to prevent the development of thrombosis and other vascular complications, the drugs with antiaggregative effects were used (Ibustrin, Curantyl, Anopyrin). To prevent the manifestation of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, the administration of H2-antagonists have been preferred (Famosan, Quamtel). The group of \"Other drugs\" was represented by vitamins and drugs with anti-uratic effects (ascorbic acid--preparation Celaskon, tocopherol--preparation E-vitamin and Milurit). When summed together, the costs of therapy in patients treated by hemodialysis are three times higher compared with those in the pre-dialysis phase. In addition to the latter hemodialysis is associated with a large number of medical, psychic and social complications. In the presented pilot study the authors analysed the financial expenses coinciding with drug costs (direct loads) which are significant, but represent only a part of the pharmacoeconomic complexity. In the future it is necessary to perform a more complex pharmacoeconomic analysis in order to evaluate also other factors, such as the costs of hospitalization, dialysate solutions, technologys, salaries of the staff, etc. (Tab. 6, Ref. 37.).", 
    "104": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of chronic exercise training and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) expression in fat and skeletal muscle in fructose-fed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were fed a fructose-rich diet over 16 weeks of either exercise training (Ex group: 20 m/min, 0% grade, 60 min/day, 5 days/week), ACE inhibitor administration (TM group: temocapril, 10 mg/kg/day), or a combination of both treatments (TM+Ex group). The systolic blood pressure was reduced exclusively in the temocapril-treated groups. Serum leptin level was positively correlated with the ratio of epididymal fat weight to body weight (p<0.001). Exercise training significantly upregulated the PPARgamma expression in all tissues, which was attenuated by temocapril. PPARgamma expression was significantly upregulated in skeletal muscles in the Ex group, and temocapril administration attenuated this effect in the Ex+TM group. The level of PPARgamma protein was significantly higher in the extensor digitorum longus muscle than in the soleus muscle. Both TM and Ex prevented the fructose diet-induced transitions of fiber type. These data suggested that PPARgamma expression is tissue-specific, and that alterations in PPARgamma expression in the skeletal muscle induced by either or both treatments may have contributed to reducing the fat mass via the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. Changes in muscle morphology were independent of PPARgamma expression, and the higher proportion of type I fiber might also explain some of the beneficial impact of exercise and ACE inhibition on energy metabolism.", 
    "105": "Cardiovascular events occur most frequently in the morning. To study the effects of the long-acting lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril on morning blood pressure (BP), we performed ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) before and after administration of trandolapril just before going to bed (bedtime-administered group: n=17) or in the morning (morning-administered group: n=20) in 37 hypertensive patients. Both sets of ABPM data were available in 30 patients. The 24-h systolic BP (SBP) levels were significantly decreased by 7.2 mmHg in the morning-administered group (p=0.02) and by 5.2 mmHg in the bedtime-administered group (p=0.04). In the bedtime-administered group, prewaking SBP (the average of the 2-h SBP values just before waking) and morning SBP (the average of the 2-h SBP values just after waking) were significantly decreased by 11 mmHg (p=0.005) and by 8.4 mmHg (p=0.03), respectively. On the other hand, in the morning-administered group, the reduction of prewaking SBP (3.9 mmHg, n.s.) and morning SBP (6.6 mmHg, n.s.) did not reach the level of statistical significance. However, the differences in the reductions of prewaking and morning SBPs between the two groups were not statistically significant. There was no additional reduction of the nighttime lowest BP in either administration group. In conclusion, bedtime administration of the long-acting ACE inhibitor trandolapril seems to be a safe and effective means of controlling morning BP in hypertensive patients without an excessive fall in nocturnal BP.", 
    "106": "Although blocking or pairing before randomization is a basic principle of experimental design, the principle is almost invariably applied to at most one or two blocking variables. Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate matching prior to randomization to improve covariate balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects, are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a single group of 2n subjects into n pairs to minimize covariate differences within pairs-the so-called nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132 patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment, we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was substantially better balanced when randomization was performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates, matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy being equivalent to, on average, a 7% increase in sample size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect, matched randomizations using the signed rank test had substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched randomizations experienced rare disasters which were consistently avoided by matched randomizations.", 
    "107": "1. We investigated whether chronic suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, which is known to be associated with reductions in microvascular density and vasodilator responsiveness of skeletal muscle, could affect exercise capacity in normotensive rats. 2. Rats were placed on normal rat chow, normal rat chow with captopril (100 mg/kg per day) or a high-salt diet (HS; 4%) for 4 weeks. Following these interventions, rats with indwelling carotid artery catheters were submitted to stepwise increasing exercise on a motor treadmill at a speed of 10, 20 and 30 m/min for 4 min while blood lactate was measured. 3. Blood lactate after exercise at a speed of 20 m/min was significantly higher and the duration during which rats were able to run at a speed of 30 m/min was significantly shorter in captopril-treated rats and rats fed an HS diet compared with control rats. 4. We conclude that chronic treatment with captopril or HS diet could reduce the exercise capacity in inactive normotensive rats, probably through chronic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "108": "Sunflower protein isolates and the proteases pepsin and pancreatin were used for the production of protein hydrolysates that inhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE). Hydrolysates obtained after 3 h of incubation with pepsin and 3 h with pancreatin were studied. An ACE inhibitory peptide with the sequence Phe-Val-Asn-Pro-Gln-Ala-Gly-Ser was obtained by G-50 gel filtration chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography C18 reverse phase chromatography. This peptide corresponds to a fragment of helianthinin, the 11S globulin from sunflower seeds, which is the main storage protein in sunflower. These results show that sunflower seed proteins are a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides when hydrolyzed with pepsin and pancreatin.",

    "114": "The present work investigates the involvement of kinins in the effects of taurine in fructose-fed hypertensive rats. The effects of taurine on blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, and the insulin sensitivity index were determined. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and nitrite content in plasma, plasma and tissue kallikrein activity, and taurine content were also investigated. The blood pressure changes in response to the coadministration of inhibitors of the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins (PGs), or a kinin receptor blocker along with taurine was also evaluated. Fructose-fed rats had higher blood pressure and elevated plasma levels of glucose and insulin. Kallikrein activity, taurine, and nitrite contents were significantly lower in fructose-fed rats as compared with controls. The increases in systolic blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia were controlled by taurine administration in fructose-fed rats. ACE activity was lower, while nitrite and taurine content and kallikrein activity were higher, in taurine-supplemented rats as compared with fructose-fed rats. A significant increase in blood pressure was observed in rats cotreated with the inhibitors Hoe 140 (a kinin receptor blocker), L-NAME (a NO synthase inhibitor), or indomethacin (a PG synthesis inhibitor) with taurine for 1 week as compared with taurine-treated fructose-fed rats. This suggests that the antihypertensive effect of taurine in fructose-fed rats was blocked by the inhibitors. Augmented kallikrein activity and, hence, increased kinin availability may be implicated in the effects of taurine in fructose-fed hypertensive rats.",

The mechanisms by which ACEIs may protect against left-ventricular (LV) volume overload are not well understood, and clinical trials performed until now have yielded conflicting results. This study was therefore performed to assess the effectiveness of two different doses of the ACEI captopril in a rat model of chronic AR. We compared the effects of a 6-month low-dose (LD) (25 mg/kg) or higher dose (HD) (75 mg/kg) treatment with captopril on LV function and hypertrophy in Wistar rats with severe AR. Untreated animals developed LV eccentric hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. LD treatment did not prevent hypertrophy and provided modest protection against systolic dysfunction. HD treatment preserved LV systolic function and dimensions and tended to slow hypertrophy. The cardiac index remained high and similar among all AR groups, treated or not. Tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) analysis revealed that ACE activity was increased in the LVs of AR animals and that only HD treatment significantly decreased angiotensin II receptor mRNA levels. Fibronectin expression was increased in the LV or AR animals, but HD treatment almost completely reversed this increase. The ACE inhibitor captopril was effective at high doses in this model of severe AR. These effects might be related to the modulation of tissue RAS and the control of fibrosis.",

    "120": "Achievement of recommended levels of blood pressure as prescribed by guidelines (i.e., systolic blood pressure of < 130 mmHg in people with nephropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes) generally requires three or more different antihypertensive agents that have complementary modes of action. This systolic goal blood pressure, recommended by generally all international guideline committees, was derived from largely observational studies demonstrating a greater reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function at these levels. Commonly used antihypertensive combinations include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which have compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease and/or diabetes, combined with a diuretic, generally a thiazide-type agent. If additional therapy is required, either a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive \"cocktail.\" Beta-blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive (i.e., high pulse rates) to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies, their benefits on kidney function, both by reducing macroalbuminuria and slowing the decline of kidney function, make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. With all these potential benefits of achieving blood pressure goals, it is unfortunate that only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease achieve the blood pressure goal of < 130 mmHg, likely contributing to the climbing incidence of people starting dialysis. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines.",

M100240 and MDL 100,173 were evaluated in an in vitro cytochrome P450 human hepatocyte model for enzyme induction. Although a dose-dependent CYP3A induction was observed between 10 and 100 microM, at 1 microM-which approaches clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans-there was no evidence of CYP3A induction. An in vitro reporter gene assay also demonstrated the CYP3A isozyme induction potential of M100240 and MDL 100,173 with an EC(50) approximately 1.5 microM. The present study evaluated the potential for CYP3A enzyme induction in healthy volunteers. In an open-label, single-sequence, replicate-design study using midazolam as a CYP3A probe in 13 healthy volunteers, we found no evidence of clinically relevant CYP3A induction after multiple-dose administration of 50 mg M100240 orally once daily for 15 days. Single and multiple doses of M100240 increased the midazolam AUC(0-24 h) about 1.6-fold compared to baseline, suggesting weak CYP3A inhibition. Concomitant administration of midazolam and M100240 was generally safe and well tolerated.

In fact, radiocontrast nephropathy is currently the third leading cause of hospital-acquired renal failure. Understanding that CN has been associated with increased length of hospitalization and mortality, determining the best prevention strategy is of utmost importance. Patients at the greatest risk for developing acute renal failure are patients with diabetes and underlying renal insufficiency. Several therapies have been investigated for the prevention of CN; unfortunately, very few have shown a consistent benefit. Therapies that have been studied include saline hydration, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), theophylline, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, dopamine, endothelin receptor antagonists, atrial natriuretic peptide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and prostaglandin E-1. Using adequate hydration, using low-osmolar dyes, and minimizing the dose of contrast have all been shown to be effective in reducing CN and are considered the standard of care. While trials with many pharmacologic agents have produced conflicting results, intervention with NAC has also been promising.

However, it remains unclear whether activation of MMPs precedes or is secondary to LV remodeling, and an effect of ACE inhibition on MMPs is unknown.", 
    "124": "Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt diet from 8 weeks served as the hypertensive heart failure (HF) model. LV echo, histological study, measurement of mRNA levels, and gelatin zymography were performed before (at 23 weeks) and after (at 26 weeks) the development of LV dilatation and pulmonary edema. The same procedures were conducted in the HF model rats treated with a subdepressor dose of ACE inhibitor (enalapril 5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) from 9 weeks. Rats fed on normal chow served as age-matched controls. In the untreated HF model rats, gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and tissue gelatinase activity were elevated at 23 weeks without LV dilatation. LV dilatation, LV systolic dysfunction, and pulmonary edema occurred at 26 weeks, with further enhancement of the expression and activity of MMPs. ACE inhibition prevented such geometrical and functional deterioration. The gene expression and activity of MMPs were suppressed by ACE inhibition at 23 weeks without a decrease in blood pressure, and the suppressive effects continued at 26 weeks.",

    "126": "We have previously reported that microinjection of angiotensin II into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) produces a pressor response in rats and that the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, similarly injected causes a depressor response in hypertensive rats. In this study, we examined whether endogenous angiotensins are involved in activation of neurons in the AHA. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized and artificially ventilated. Extracellular potentials were recorded from single neurons in the AHA. Pressure-ejected application of angiotensin II and glutamate onto some neurons in the AHA increased their firing rate. The increase of unit firing induced by angiotensin II but not by glutamate was inhibited by losartan. Application of losartan alone inhibited the basal firing rate of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of the angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123319, did not affect the increase of unit firing induced by angiotensin II and the basal firing rate of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons. Pressure application of angiotensin I onto angiotensin II-sensitive neurons also increased firing rate and the increase of unit firing by angiotensin I was inhibited by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Captopril alone inhibited the basal firing rate of angitensin II-sensitive neurons. Acetylcholine did not affect unit firing of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons, whereas it increased the firing rate of some angiotensin II-insensitive neurons in the AHA. Increases of blood pressure by intravenous phenylephrine completely inhibited the basal firing rate of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons. These findings suggest that some neurons in the AHA are tonically activated by endogenous angiotensins. It seems likely that newly synthesized angiotensins are used for the angiotensinergic transmission in the AHA.", 
    "127": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT-1 receptor blockers (ARB) are two types of drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and can attenuate the progression to cardiac and/or renal functional impairment, secondary to diverse pathologies. Some of the beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB occur independently of the ability of these drugs to reduce arterial blood pressure. Both, in animals, and in humans, we observed an enhancement of antioxidant defenses that occurred after treatment with ACEi. Based on these results, we postulate that some of the beneficial health effects associated to RAS inhibition can be ascribed to the prevention of oxidant-mediated damage. Furthermore, considering that: (i). RAS inhibition attenuates certain age-associated degenerative changes; (ii). aging was postulated to result from the accumulation of oxidant-mediated damage; and (iii). mitochondria are a major source of oxidants, we studied potential associations among RAS inhibition, mitochondrial function and production of oxidants and nitric oxide, and aging. The results obtained suggest, that RAS inhibitors, i.e. enalapril and losartan, can protect against the effects of aging by attenuating oxidant damage to mitochondria, and in consequence, they preserve mitochondrial function. The mechanism(s) explaining such attenuation of oxidant damage can relay on a reduction of the ANG-II-dependent generation of superoxide and/or an increased detoxification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species by recomposition of antioxidant defense levels.", 
    "128": "Beta blockers improve left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction but patient responses are heterogenous. We investigated the role of contractile reserve (CR) in predicting beta-blocker response in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Resting and low-dose dobutamine echocardiograms were recorded in 32 patients with heart failure (LV ejection fraction <or=35%), 18 with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC), and 14 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). A segment was defined as CR positive (CR+) or negative (CR-) based on response to dobutamine. Patients were then classified as CR+ or CR- based on number of improved segments (IC group) or ejection fraction improvement (IDC group) in response to dobutamine. During follow-up (2, 6, and 14 months after beta-blocker initiation), response was measured by the percent of segments showing improved contractility from baseline, ejection fraction, and wall motion score index. In the IC group, the percent of improved segments was greater at 2 and 6 months in CR+ versus CR- (70% vs 15% and 39% vs 17%, p <0.05), whereas it was greater at all periods in the patients with IDC (36% vs 9% at 2 months, 50% vs 19% at 6 months, and 63% vs 42% at 14 months, p <0.05). Findings for ejection fraction and wall motion score index were similar. Therefore, time course and magnitude of improvement in LV function in patients with heart failure receiving beta blockers are related to CR status. CR predicts a greater early response in IC, whereas it predicts a greater response at all time periods in IDC. However, even patients without CR showed improvement in LV function at 14 months.",

Antiatherosclerotic effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blocker and epalrestat were studied with an in vitro guinea-pig basilar artery smooth muscle cell (GBa-SM3) culture system over 3 days incubated with 0 to 10% of fetal bovine serum. Results demonstrated that simvastatin (0.1 mM), fluvastatin (0.3 mM), amlodipine (0.2 mM) and epalrestat (1 mM) elicited significant (p < 0.05 or 0.01) antiproliferative effects, whereas losartan (1 mM), valsartan (1 mM), enalapril (0.1 mM), captopril (1 mM), trandolapril (0.01 mM), pravastatin (0.7 mM) did not.

    "134": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are the main drugs used in the treatment of essential hypertension and congestive heart failure in adults. Recently, we have demonstrated the antithrombotic effect of captopril (CAP) and enalapril (ENA) in venous thrombosis model in adult rats. One might also suggest the beneficial effect of those drugs on hemostasis in young individuals. Two months old male Wistar rats were used in the study. Acute administration of CAP at a dose of 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced the venous thrombus weight. Dose-dependent reduction in the thrombus weight was also observed in ENA (3, 10, 30 mg kg(-1))-treated rats. Strong reduction in the thrombus weight was also seen after chronic administration of CAP (2 x 25 mg kg(-1)) and ENA (1 x 15 mg kg(-1)). Both drugs given chronically reduced the frequency of thrombi. Systolic blood pressure was reduced to similar extent after acute and chronic application of the drugs. CAP shortened euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) when given acutely (100 mg kg(-1)) and chronically (2 x 25 mg kg(-1)). ENA decreased ECLT only when given at multiple doses (1 x 15 mg kg(-1)). None of the drugs changed prothrombin time or activated partial tromboplastin time. We conclude that CAP and ENA possess antithrombotic effect in young individuals. Activation of the fibrinolytic pathway seems to play an important role in the mechanism of their antithrombotic action.", 
    "135": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the endocrine pancreas. Although angiotensin II has significant effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, the contribution of the RAS to changes in islet structure and function associated with type 2 diabetes is yet to be defined. This study examined the specific effects of RAS blockade on islet structure and function in diabetes. Thirty-six male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, 10 weeks of age, were randomized to receive the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (8 mg/l in drinking water; n = 12), irbesartan (15 mg/kg via gavage; n = 12), or no treatment (n = 12) for 10 weeks. Results were compared with lean littermates (ZL) (n = 12) studied concurrently. ZDF rats had increased intra-islet expression of components of the RAS correlating with increased intraislet fibrosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Disordered islet architecture, seen in ZDF rats, was attenuated after treatment with perindopril or irbesartan. Islet fibrogenesis was also diminished, as measured by picrosirius staining and expression of collagens I and IV. Gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 was increased in the ZDF pancreas (ZL, 1.0 +/- 0.1; ZDF, 2.0 +/- 0.3; P < 0.05) and reduced after blockade of the RAS (ZDF + P, 1.3 +/- 0.2; ZDF + I, 1.5 +/- 0.1; vs. ZDF, both P < 0.05). Improvements in structural parameters were also associated with functional improvements in first-phase insulin secretion. These findings provide a possible mechanism for the reduced incidence of new-onset diabetes that has been observed in clinical trials of RAS blockade.",

Our primary objective was to determine whether a sustained antibody titre to Ang I (angiotensin I) can be achieved in hypertensive patients. The secondary objective was to determine whether the antibodies block the renin system. Patients (n=27) with essential hypertension responsive to an ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or ARB (angiotensin blocker) were randomly assigned to receive three or four injections of the Ang I vaccine PMD3117 or aluminium hydroxide (Alhydrogel trade mark ) over a 6 week period. Antibody titre was measured prior to each injection and every 30 days until disappearance. Indices of renin blockade were changes in renin and aldosterone (blood and urine) and a within-patient comparison of the pre- and post-vaccination rise in 24 h ambulatory blood pressure after 2 weeks of withdrawal of ACEi or ARB. The anti-(Ang I) antibody titre rose from the second injection in both regimes and peaked on day 64. Median half-life was 85 (95% CI, 44 and 153) days (where CI is confidence interval). Vaccination did not influence blood pressure, but significantly blunted the fall in plasma renin following withdrawal of ACEi or ARB. At 42 days after the first injection, aldosterone excretion was decreased by PMD3117 to 6 (95% CI, 1 and 31)% of values in patients receiving Alhydrogel trade mark (P=0.012). In patients with essential hypertension, PMD3117 generated a prolonged antibody response to Ang I. Biochemical measurements show evidence of blockade of the renin system, but higher titres will be required to achieve a decrease in blood pressure.",

Incidence of this serious disease is three times more frequent in diabetics than in non-diabetics. After ictus, the prognosis is worse and repeated cerebral strokes more frequent. From the risk factors, diabetics usually suffer from hypertension which is part of a complex of metabolic syndrome X. There are more frequent carotid stenoses and impaired tiny arteries in diabetics compared to non-diabetic population. Recently, it has been pointed at an importance of early detection of hyperglycaemia in ischemic brain accidents, because hyperglycaemia seriously affects ischemic brain tissue. Apart from other things, it leads to impairment of motor functions. A specialist providing care to diabetics must consider and start treatment of all the risk factors.

Although spectral analysis showed a close coupling between fluctuations of BP and SNA at the stimulating frequencies, only the fluctuations of SNA in frequencies of 0.25 to approximately 0.4 Hz were proportional to BP fluctuations over the course of time. The results suggest that fluctuations transmitted from SNA to BP were uniform without shifting due to the nature of vasculature or the lagging of sympathetic action in frequencies of 0.25 to approximately 0.4 Hz, and support the possibility of using low-frequency variabilities of BP to quantitatively estimate fluctuations of SNA at time domain.",

Five-day mortality significantly improved from 7.7% to 6.1% (P < 0.03) and 1-year survival was also less in the most recent period (15% versus 19%, P < 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that the period of inclusion (2000 versus 1995) was an independent predictor of both short- and long-term mortality. In analyses restricted to the patients who were alive by day 5, initial treatment with statins was associated with a 38% decrease in the risk of death at 1 year. Likewise, in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35%, the early prescription of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of 1-year mortality. Thus, in the real world setting, a continued decline in 1-year mortality is observed in patients admitted to intensive care units for recent acute myocardial infarction.

    "171": "N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is a ubiquitous tetrapeptide hydrolyzed almost exclusively by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Chronic treatment with Ac-SDKP decreases cardiac and renal fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in hypertensive rats. However, very little is known about endogenous synthesis of Ac-SDKP, except that thymosin-beta4 may be the most likely precursor. Two enzymes are potentially able to release Ac-SDKP from thymosin-beta4: prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) and endoproteinase asp-N. POP is widely present and active in several tissues and biological fluids, whereas endoproteinase asp-N appears to be lacking in mammals. Therefore, we hypothesized that POP is the main enzyme involved in synthesizing the antifibrotic peptide Ac-SDKP. We investigated in vitro and in vivo production of Ac-SDKP. Using kidney cortex homogenates, we observed that Ac-SDKP was generated in a time-dependent manner in the presence of exogenous thymosin-beta4, and this generation was significantly inhibited by several POP inhibitors (POPi), Z-prolyl-prolinal, Fmoc-prolyl-pyrrolidine-2-nitrile, and S17092. Long-term administration of S17092 in rats significantly decreased endogenous levels of Ac-SDKP in the plasma (from 1.76+/-0.2 to 1.01+/-0.1 nM), heart (from 2.31+/-0.21 to 0.83+/-0.09 pmol/mg protein), and kidneys (from 5.62+/-0.34 to 2.86+/-0.76 pmol/mg protein). As expected, ACE inhibitors significantly increased endogenous levels of Ac-SDKP in the plasma, heart, and kidney, whereas coadministration of POPi prevented this increase. We concluded that POP is the main enzyme responsible for synthesis of the antifibrotic peptide Ac-SDKP.", 
    "172": "The objectives of this study were to determine the association between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and left ventricular (LV) geometry, and to clarify independent effects of ACE genotype on mortality after commencing dialysis in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A total of 106 diabetic patients, 71 men and 35 women, 11 type 1 and 95 type 2 diabetic, 57 +/- 12 (mean +/- standard deviation (S.D.)) years of age, who started dialysis were studied. Patients with cardiac diseases and those treated with ACE inhibitors were excluded because of potential effects on LV performance. Echocardiographic examination was performed within +/-2 months of the start of dialysis. Relation between ACE genotype and LV mass index (LVMI) or relative wall thickness (RWT) at onset of dialysis, and impact of ACE genotype on survival after commencing dialysis were evaluated. There were no significant differences in LVMI or RWT in the three ACE genotype groups at onset of dialysis. However, mortality of patients with the ACE-DD genotype was significantly higher than patients with the DI and II genotypes (hazard ratio, 2.318; P=0.043), based on a survival analysis with a mean follow-up duration of 60 months. The higher mortality in patients with the DD genotype was confirmed to be independent of LV hypertrophy and increases in RWT. In diabetic patients with ESRD, ACE genotype has no association with LV mass or RWT at the start of dialysis, but does have an independent impact on patient survival thereafter.",

The ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (FURO, 10 mg/kg) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 5 mg/kg), and extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using intracerebral microdialysis techniques. The intake of 0.3 M NaCl and water significantly enhanced the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the LPBN area. The combined treatment with FURO and CAP elicited significant decreases in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in the LPBN area under the condition that 0.3 M NaCl and water are not available for drinking. These results suggest that the serotonergic system in the LPBN area may play an important role in the modulation of sodium appetite and thirst.",

New Zealand rabbits underwent left coronary artery ligation. Four groups were analyzed: sham (G1; n = 13), MI (G2; n = 13), sham + Los (G3; n = 13) and MI + Los (G4; n = 13). Los (12.5 mg/kg/d) was administered 3 hours post-MI during 35 days when the animals were sacrificed. The hearts were isolated and perfused using Langendorff's technique to determine systolic and diastolic pressure-volume (P/V) curves. Hearts were weighed, fixed in formaline, cut from apex to base, and stained with Masson's trichrome and pricrosirius red. The heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW) ratio was used as an index of hypertrophy. Infarct size (IS; %), septum (SeT, mm) and scar thickness (ST, mm) were measured using morphometric analysis. Results were expressed as mean +/- SEM. IS was G2 = 25.38 +/- 5.31; G4 = 21.85 +/- 4.13 (NS). HW/BW was 3.45 +/- 0.16; 3.23 +/- 0.25; 2.87 +/- 0.16; 3.23 +/- 0.18 in G1, G2, G3 and G4, respectively. Los shifted the diastolic P/V relationship to the right in sham and MI (p < 0.05 vs sham), and did not modify the systolic relationship. Scar collagen concentration was lower in G4 (p < 0.05 vs G2). SeT was lower in G3 and G4 (p < 0.05 vs G2). In conclusion, the early administration of Los unfavorably modified post-MI-VR, increasing ventricular dilation and reducing scar collagen concentration and thickness.",

The main pathological findings in atherosclerosis include abnormal reactions of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes/ macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells, and the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial wall. Therefore, investigating the effects of these drugs on the arterial wall may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. Here, based on recent studies including our own, we describe the relationships between risk factors for atherosclerosis, especially hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and the molecular mechanisms that govern lipid metabolism in the arteries.", 
    "195": "Increasing evidence has revealed that endothelial cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of development and progression of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction induces disruption of the balance between vasoconstrictive factors and vasodilatory factors secreted from endothelial cells. Among these factors, NO and angiotensin II are especially important factors, and have been shown to exert various direct effects on the endothelial functions that are closely related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction induces decreased NO bioactivity and increased angiotensin II expression, which increase oxidative stress and expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. These conditions mediate inflammation, proliferation, and thrombogenesis in vessel wall and promote atherosclerotic lesions. On the other hand, therapies that improve endothelial dysfunction, such as administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or angiotensin converting inhibitors, have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events and strokes. In this article, we focus on NO and angiotensin II and describe their roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.", 
    "196": "There are a number of licensed databases that assign biological activities to druglike compounds. The MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), compiled from the patent literature, is a popular example. It contains several hundred distinct activities, some of which are therapeutic areas (e.g., Antihypertensive) and some of which are related to specific enzymes or receptors (e.g., ACE inhibitor). There are several data mining applications where it would be useful to calculate a similarity between any two activities. Two distinct activity labels can have a significant similarity for a number of reasons: two activities can be nearly synonymous (e.g., CCK B antagonist vs Gastrin antagonist), one activity may be a subset of another (e.g., Dopamine (D2) agonist vs Dopamine agonist), or an activity can be the mechanism by which another activity works (e.g., ACE inhibitor vs Antihypertensive), etc. In an ideal world, similarities for two activities could be calculated simply by comparing the compounds they have in common, but in hand-curated databases such as the MDDR the assignment of activities to compounds are inevitably inconsistent and incomplete. We propose a number of methods of calculating activity-activity similarities that hopefully compensate for errors in hand-curation. Two of these, TIMI and trend vector, show promise. Soft clustering of the activities using a union of similarity methods shows a reasonable association of therapeutic areas with their mechanisms.", 
    "197": "It is generally believed that in hypertensive patients both beta adrenoreceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers can be continued up to the day of surgery without provoking problems with cardiovascular stability intra- and postoperatively. The same, however, has not been definitively established for angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). A patient who was taking the ACAI enalapril for hypertension underwent two similar operations--right total hip replacement and three years later left--both with spinal anaesthesia. In the initial case, she received her enalapril on the morning of surgery, while for the second procedure, enalapril was stopped 48 hours earlier. Hypotension occurred which required more than 5 times the dose of etilefrin to maintain suitable blood pressure during the first instance as compared to that when enalapril had been discontinued 48 hours earlier. Spinal anaesthesia in conjunction with an ACEI may result in severe hypotension as seen in this patient. In view of this, it is suggested that in contrast to other antihypertenisve drugs, ACEIs should be withdrawn well in advance of spinal anaesthesia.",

    "210": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is emerging as a new health pandemic. Underlying the global rise in CKD is an increase in diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors leading to progressive renal dysfunction. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that achieving target blood pressure goals via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system confers significant renal and cardioprotection for patients with CKD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) lower blood pressure, reduce proteinuria and reduce both the progression of CKD and adverse cardiovascular events. The role of aldosterone inhibition and combination therapy, such as ACEI/ARB, in CKD are under investigation. As our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying CKD progression advances, novel therapies targeting post-translational endothelial and mesangial messengers downstream from angiotensin II and aldosterone may become available for clinical use.", 
    "211": "Essential hypertension is a very heterogeneous disease and different pressor mechanisms might interact to increase blood pressure. It is therefore not surprising that antihypertensive drugs, given as monotherapy, normalize blood pressure in only a fraction of hypertensive patients. This is, for instance, the case for diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists administered as single agents. The rationale for combining antihypertensive agents relates in part to the concept that the blood pressure-lowering effect may be enhanced when two classes are coadministered. Also, combination therapy serves to counteract counter-regulatory mechanisms that are triggered whenever pharmacologic intervention is initiated and that act to limit the efficacy of the antihypertensive medication. For example, the compensatory rise in renin secretion induced by sodium depletion may become the predominant factor sustaining high blood pressure. Simultaneous blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, with either an ACE inhibitor or an AT1-receptor blocker, makes this compensatory hyper-reninemia ineffective and allows maximum benefit from sodium depletion. The combination of a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system and a low dose of a diuretic increases the effectiveness, but not at the expense of tolerability compared with the individual components administered alone. Fixed-dose combinations containing an ACE inhibitor or an AT1-receptor blocker and a diuretic are therefore likely to become increasingly used not only as second-line therapy but also as first-line treatment.", 
    "212": "The optimal first-line treatment of hypertension has been a contentious issue. Despite the probable advantage of diuretics, which was demonstrated in early clinical trials, concern about their metabolic effects meant that therapy was often commenced with drugs of other types. The results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), which compared agents of three groups of new antihypertensive drugs with a diuretic, demonstrated the equivalence between these drugs and chlorthalidone (Tenoretic AstraZeneca) in the prevention of incident fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The diuretic was superior to other drugs in preventing some major secondary end-points, such as cerebrovascular disease and heart failure. These findings, together with other very practical reasons, such as easy administration, few side effects and low cost, demonstrate that diuretics are the first option for drug management of hypertension.", 
    "213": "Although arrhythmic death is a common cause of death in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), numerous trials involving prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug treatment have yielded few gains. To date, only beta-blockers have shown a distinct mortality-reducing effect and despite the antiarrythmic effect of gamma-blockers, results point towards causes other than the antiarrhythmic effect in obtaining this beneficial effect. Atrial fibrillation is an often-encountered arrhythmia in patients with CHF and recent trials have cast doubt on the present treatment strategy of persistently striving to obtain sinus rhythm. This paper outlines the results of the large clinical trials dealing with antiarrhythmic drug treatment in CHF patients with or without atrial fibrillation and certain subgroup analysis and future treatment possibilities are discussed.", 
    "214": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs with the exception of the rare occurrence of angioedema. These drugs have demonstrated additional cardiovascular protective effects to their blood pressure lowering and their combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide potentiates their antihypertensive effectiveness. Moexipril (Univasc, Bayer) is a long-acting ACE inhibitor suitable for once-daily administration and, like enalapril, is a prodrug and needs to be hydrolyzed in the liver into its active carboxylic metabolite, moexiprilat, in order to become effective. Moexipril alone and in combination with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in lowering blood pressure and to be well-tolerated and safe given in single daily doses. In this review, the pharmacological profile of this drug and its clinical usefulness will be discussed.", 
    "215": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Monotherapy of hypertension is often ineffective, since it controls approximately 50% of the blood pressure of hypertensive patients. For lowering blood pressure to less than 140/90 mmHg (or <130/80 mmHg among people with diabetes or chronic renal disease) according to JNC-7 guidelines, combination therapy of two or more drugs is often necessary. The combination of a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is effective and provides the additional benefit of blocking the effects of angiotensin II, which is responsible for cardiovascular remodeling and its complications. ARBs may have an advantage over the ACEIs because they block the action of all angiotensin II directly, whereas ACEIs are ineffective in blocking angiotensin II generated by nonclassical ACE pathways. Valsartan (Diovan, Novartis) is one of the seven currently approved ARBs in the USA for the treatment of hypertension, and it has been shown to be very effective in controlling blood pressure given once-daily in doses of 80-160 or 320 mg. Its fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is even more effective in controlling blood pressure in 70% of the cases. The most commonly used combinations are valsartan/HCT (Diovan/HCT), 80/12.5 and 160/12.5 mg given once-daily.", 
    "216": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of several commercial fermented milks was evaluated. Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but a few exceptions were detected. The high ACE-inhibitory activity found in some cases could be related to the origin of the milk. Two of these products were subjected to an enzymatic hydrolysis process, which simulates physiological digestion, to study the influence of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The activity did not significantly change or increase during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The peptides generated from one selected product during simulated digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. Most peptides found at the end of the simulated digestion were released after 30 min of incubation with the pancreatic extract. This suggests that physiological digestion promotes the formation of active peptides from the proteins present in these fermented products. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of the identified peptides is discussed with regard to their amino acid sequences.",

Substantial technical progress simplified the treatment of existing calculi; thus, it was more convenient to treat a new stone than to prevent its recurrence. But times change! In these days of financial squeeze in the medical system, prevention becomes more attractive. Nevertheless, strategies for kidney stone prevention developed. Established concepts for dietary advice were rejected due to the results of new randomized studies. Moreover, new pharmacological substances were introduced for metaphyalxis. The new concepts are feasible for the daily routine. For some treatment modalities in stone prevention, there is valid evidence from the literature, which should encourage us to adopt these modalities in the future. A number of drugs are used as \"good common practice\" without any proof from a randomized trial. Often prospective and valid studies are not available. The present paper intends to describe the status quo of nephrolithiasis prevention in Germany, focussing on confirmed data and unsolved problems.", 
    "218": "Pharmacologic management of chronic heart failure rests on appropriate volume management followed by neurohormonal antagonism. Despite the rationale for neurohormonal antagonists, their use remains low. Definitive studies establish that neurohormonal antagonists are effective across the spectrum of disease, from the early Stage A patient at risk of developing structural heart disease and symptomatic heart failure to the Stage D patient with symptoms at rest. Although many investigators and clinicians seem focused on the next new scientific breakthrough, published studies delineate strategies that will reduce death and disability for those at risk and those with symptomatic chronic heart failure. In essence, the broad use of neurohormonal antagonists, consistent with the reports of large-scale trials that have been reported, will markedly reduce the risk of disease progression and death. Overall prognosis however remains poor. We review the data from these trials to encourage clinicians to use these proven neurohormonal antagonists in optimizing therapeutic strategy.",

All patients were subjected to echocardiography and 40 to perfusion myocardial scintigraphy with (99m)TC-Technetril. Myocardial viability was defined as presence of perfusion reserve in dysfunctional segments during test with nitroglycerin. Dysfunctional myocardium was found to be viable in 62.5% of patients. Fifty six patients completed 3 months follow up and were restudied. By the time of the second study 28 patients continued captopril (37.5-150 mg, average dose 72+/-34.2 mg/day) and 28 - eprosartan (300-600 mg, average dose 471+/-151 mg/day). Captopril was stopped or its dose corrected in 28% of patients. In eprosartan group there were no side effects which required withdrawal of the drug. Similar increases of ejection fraction occurred on both groups (from 38+/-2.1 to 49+/-6.7%, p<0.001 and from 39+/-4 to 51+/-6.5%, p<0.001, in eprosartan and captopril groups, respectively). Magnitude of left ventricular ejection fraction change did not depend on the presence of viable myocardium. However in both treatment groups improvement of myocardial perfusion and decrease of left atrial dimensions were found only in patients with viable myocardium at initial study.",

This difference has been explained by the existence of a distinct diabetic cardiomyopathy characterized by morphologic and structural changes to the myocardium and coronary vasculature. Despite diabetic cardiomyopathy, the pharmacologic treatment of heart failure in diabetic patients is similar to that in patients without diabetes, and in general, the clinical response of diabetic patients to drug therapies for heart failure is similar, if not superior, to that of nondiabetic patients. Subgroup analyses from large clinical studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors not only reduce mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure, but also reduce the incidence of heart failure in at-risk diabetic patients. B-Blockers remain underused in the diabetic population despite overwhelming evidence of their efficacy in treating heart failure in patients with diabetes.",

    "237": "Besides cyclooxygenase and NO-synthase, another distinct endothelial pathway, endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDHF), is involved in the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cells. EDHF has been demonstrated unequivocally in various blood vessels from different species, including human, and is likely to play an important role in cardiovascular physiology. This alternative pathway involves the activation of two populations of endothelial potassium channels, the small conductance and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK(Ca) and IK(Ca), respectively). EDHF-mediated responses are clearly altered in various pathological conditions (ageing, hypertension, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion, angioplasty, eclampsia, diabetes, sepsis). Therapeutic or adjutant interventions (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, antagonist of the angiotensin receptor, estrogen, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenol derivatives, potassium and/or calcium intake) can restore these responses, suggesting that the improvement of the EDHF pathway contributes to the observed beneficial effect of these various substances. However, the improvement or restoration of EDHF responses has not been, yet, the direct purpose of any pharmaceutical effort. Activating endothelial IK(Ca) and/or SK(Ca) or increasing their expression as well as improving myo-endothelial communication, for instance by increasing the expression of connexin(s), could become interesting therapeutic targets.", 
    "238": "Hypertension in combination with clinically overt diabetes mellitus is recognized as a particularly powerful combination of risk factors that greatly increases cardiovascular vulnerability. There is also evidence that presumed pre-diabetic conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and compensatory hyperglycaemia may amplify overall cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, especially when encountered as part of the condition known as metabolic syndrome X (Reaven's syndrome). The long-term benefits of antihypertensive therapy may be compromised if these drugs exert adverse effects on metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity, or if they promote a transition from pre-diabetes to overt diabetes. Class differences in the effects of antihypertensives on metabolic indices may therefore be an important consideration when choosing treatment for patients who exhibit these characteristics. Experience from clinical trials suggests that drugs that target the renin-angiotensin system may have metabolic advantages over drugs such as beta-blockers and diuretics, but this conclusion has not been proved definitively. Moxonidine, which selectively targets imidazoline type-1 receptors in the sympathetic vasomotor centres of the rostral-ventrolateral medulla, is an effective antihypertensive and has been reported to exert favourable metabolic effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The MARRIAGE study (Moxonidine And Ramipril Regarding Insulin And Glucose Evaluation) will extend these preliminary observations by comparing the effects of moxonidine and the ACE inhibitor ramipril--and the combination of both drugs--on metabolic and haemodynamic parameters in patients with hypertension and impaired fasting glycaemia. A description is provided of the design and conduct of MARRIAGE.", 
    "239": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), and given that treating this condition is a considerable economic burden, the prevention of ESRD is a major public health goal. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is aberrantly activated in patients with diabetes. Angiotensin II (AII), a downstream effector of the RAS, has haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic effects that contribute to the development and progression of nephropathy. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension, an AII receptor blocker (AIIRB) is recommended as the first drug that should be used. This review will focus on the rationale for the use of losartan as a treatment for nephropathy associated with T2DM. In animal models of diabetes, losartan reduced proteinuria and conferred renal protection. In RENAAL (Reduction in Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan), the first major randomised trial that investigated the benefit of losartan in patients with T2DM and nephropathy, losartan significantly reduced the risk of a doubling of serum creatinine and progression to ESRD, significantly lowered the levels of proteinuria and slowed the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. This review also discusses other clinical trials of losartan and other AIIRBs in T2DM, and considers alternative mechanisms by which losartan may be exerting its effects. The collective experience in treatment trials highlighted in this review indicate that losartan and other AIIRBs can reduce blood pressure and the progression of proteinuria in diabetic renal disease. However, losartan is thus far the only AIIRB that has been shown to reduce significantly the risk of ESRD and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. Its use in hypertensive patients with T2DM and nephropathy may play an important role in reducing the burden of ERSD.",

    "250": "Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital admissions in North America. Approximately half of patients with symptoms of heart failure have normal or minimally impaired systolic function and are therefore diagnosed, by exclusion, with diastolic dysfunction. The therapy of diastolic dysfunction to date is largely unsatisfactory. There have been few outcome-based clinical trials to guide clinicians, and most treatments have been empirically derived from the data from systolic heart failure studies. In general, acute management consists of central volume reduction with loop diuretics and long-acting nitrates. In some cases improvement in left ventricular filling can be achieved by reducing heart rate, usually with either beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The role of digoxin is unclear and it should be used with caution. Theoretically, it has the capacity to further impair ventricular function, but one of the few trials in diastolic heart failure suggested that it improves symptoms and reduces hospitalization. Renin-angiotensin system blockade is a very attractive therapeutic avenue; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers effectively reduce afterload, induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in excess of their blood pressure-lowering effect, and confer survival benefits to patients at high risk for cardiovascular death. Although the results of a recent trial using an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with primarily diastolic heart failure were unimpressive, renin-angiotensin system blockade should still be considered because of its aforementioned benefits. The long-term management of these patients includes a careful assessment for and treatment of myocardial ischemia, treatment of hypertension, and reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy. For the treatment of ischemia, long-acting nitrates and calcium channel blockers may be particularly useful. The results of new trials in this area are expected soon, and hopefully therapy that directly targets the pathophysiologic pathways of this important disease is on the horizon.",

    "260": "Heart failure affects nearly 5 million Americans and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is now recognized that activation of multiple neurohormonal systems is intrinsic in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at high risk for heart failure, and some of the complications of diabetes (e.g., insulin resistance) contribute to the development and progression of heart failure, partly because of their effects on neurohormonal systems. Pharmacologic intervention directed toward these systems (i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibition, use of aldosterone antagonists, and beta-adrenergic blockade) has been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Despite this knowledge, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are grossly underused, and deaths and hospitalizations due to heart failure have steadily increased. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease. Aldosterone antagonists are recommended in severe heart failure, and recent data also support their use in mild to moderate heart failure. Concerns about the increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity with beta-blocker use may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for patients with diabetes with heart failure. Although evidence from earlier clinical trials justifies some of these concerns, newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol) have been shown to have a neutral or positive effect on dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. beta-Blockade in conjunction with ACE inhibition should be standard therapy for all patients with diabetes who have heart failure. Furthermore, early in-hospital initiation of neurohormonal intervention can provide earlier benefit to these patients.", 
    "261": "Heart failure affects nearly 5 million people in the United States and is a major contributor to mortality, hospitalization, and medical costs. Approximately 40% of patients with heart failure have preserved left ventricular systolic function, thus exhibiting diastolic heart failure. More common in women and the elderly, this condition is associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and/or atrial fibrillation. With the exception of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) and the Candesartin in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved trials, no completed large randomized clinical trial has addressed the management of such patients. Symptomatic treatment involves administration of diuretics and nitrates, but long-term management with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers targets the underlying disorders. Recent studies found that diabetes mellitus produces functional, biochemical, and morphologic myocardial abnormalities independent of coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension. These abnormalities may result in impaired left ventricular diastolic function, contributing importantly to heart failure with normal systolic function. Although tight glycemic control decreases the risk of heart failure in patients with diabetes, the effects of different diabetic treatment regimens on heart failure with normal systolic function are unknown and remain subject to future investigation.", 
    "262": "The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its association with cardiovascular disease have become serious public health issues. Although diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) may have different clinical manifestations, their atherosclerotic burden and prognosis are quite similar. However, patients with diabetes who have underlying CAD have a different, more complex pathophysiology and a worse prognosis. Optimal management of these patients requires a comprehensive multifactorial approach to prevent microvascular and macrovascular events. In the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), immediate management should focus on limiting infarct size. This can be achieved by using fibrinolytic agents, primary percutaneous intervention (in ST-segment elevation MI), or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors followed by coronary angiography within 24 to 48 hours and, when appropriate, by coronary intervention (in non-ST-segment elevation MI). Drug-eluting stents may have an important role in patients with diabetes, who have a higher rate of postintervention coronary restenosis than do nondiabetic individuals. In addition, all patients with an acute MI (ST- and non-ST-segment elevation) should be given aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The long-term pharmacologic management after MI is similar in all patients, regardless of the initial presentation. Antiplatelet agents (aspirin and/or clopidogrel), ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and glycemic control have all been shown to be effective in decreasing long-term mortality. Despite advances in the management of MI, the mortality rates of patients with diabetes remain 1.5- to 2-fold greater than those of persons without diabetes. Maximizing the use of lifesaving therapies proved effective in large randomized clinical trials and tight metabolic control can further decrease mortality rates. However, many of these lifesaving therapies are underused in patients with diabetes because of the misconception that potential adverse effects may outweigh their benefits. New programs aimed at improving postinfarction quality of care in patients with diabetes, based on guidelines and expert recommendations, have shown promise. However, more effort must be devoted to the improvement of outcomes related to these public health problems.", 
    "263": "In individuals with diabetes mellitus, higher risk for renal and cardiovascular disease is seen with blood pressure levels >130/80 mm Hg. Findings of several studies, as well as new guidelines, indicate that individuals with diabetes will benefit from more aggressive treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents in type 2 diabetes. Moreover, combinations of these agents are frequently required to reach the target blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg and reduce risk for renal and cardiovascular events. All of these agents have demonstrated benefits in treating patients. Clinical evidence also indicates that the new vasodilating beta-blockers offer advantages beyond blood pressure control, including cardiovascular risk reduction without exacerbating metabolic parameters. With increased awareness of the need for aggressive treatment of hypertension, clinicians can provide significant benefit to their patients with diabetes. The new beta-blockers may play an important role in achieving blood pressure goals.",

There is no consensus that antihypertensive drugs improve maternal or fetal outcome in mild to moderate hypertension. Evidence exists that antihypertensive drugs may halve the risk of severe hypertension in pregnancy. No proof exists that antihypertensive drugs reduce perinatal mortality or development of preeclampsia, and such drugs have not been associated with improved fetal growth. Clinical trials indicate non-consistent data concerning antihypertensive treatment on antenatal rate of hospitalization, proteinuria at delivery and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Hydralazine has for many years been regarded as the first drug of choice for treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Recent findings indicate that the calcium antagonist nifedipine might be a better alternative. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be discontinued due to fetotoxicity. The beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol in the first trimester is associated with low birth weight.",

    "272": "Reducing the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) slows nephropathy progression in patients with or without diabetes. These drug classes have proven therapeutic benefits, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency (ie, serum creatinine level 133-265 micromol/L [1.5-3.0 mg/dL]). This class of drugs could also provide renoprotective effects that are nonblood pressure-dependent when used as part of combination antihypertensive therapy in patients with more advanced renal disease. Although many studies demonstrate the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs to delay the decline in renal function and reduce proteinuria, many physicians fail to use these drug classes in patients with renal insufficiency for fear that either serum creatinine or potassium levels will rise. Thus, because of these issues, patients are deprived of known strategies that delay progression of renal disease. A strong association exists between acute increases in serum creatinine of up to 30% to 35% after initiating ACE inhibitor therapy and long-term preservation of renal function. This association is predominantly present in people with a baseline serum creatinine of up to 3 mg/dL and usually stablizes within 2 to 3 months of therapy given blood pressure is reduced to goal. Moreover, the appropriate use of diuretics mitigates against profound increases in serum potassium. Thus, withdrawal of an ACE inhibitor in such patients should occur only when the rise in creatinine exceeds this threshold over a shorter period of time or hyperkalemia develops, ie, serum potassium level of 5.6 mmol/L or greater.", 
    "273": "Angiotensin II (A II), the main effector of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), plays a central role in the hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms of chronic renal disease and is currently the main target of interventions aimed to prevent the onset and progression of chronic nephropathies to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, to ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration and size selectivity, reduce protein traffic and prevent glomerular and tubulointerstitial toxicity of ultrafiltered proteins, RAS inhibitors also limit the direct nephrotoxic effects of A II. Thus, both angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) and A II antagonists (ATA) exert a specific nephroprotective effect in both experimental and human chronic renal disease. This effect is time-dependent and is observed across degrees of renal insufficiency. Forced ACEi or ATA uptitration above doses recommended to control arterial hypertension and combined treatment with both agents allow optimization of A II inhibition and maximization of renoprotection. Multifactorial interventions combining RAS inhibition to treatments targeted also to non-RAS mechanisms could even achieve regression of glomerulosclerosis and chronic tubulointerstitial injury. Studies are needed to assess whether renal damage can be reverted to such a point that renal function could be fully prevented from worsening, and possibly improvement. The economic impact of even a partial improvement would be enormous. Moreover, chronic renal insufficiency is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and effective nephroprotection could also decrease the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with chronic nephropathies. In patients with renal insufficiency, ACEi are even more cardioprotective than in those without and are well tolerated. Thus, RAS inhibitor therapy should be offered to all renal patients without specific contraindications, including those closer to renal replacement therapy.", 
    "274": "Risk factors of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction, if left untreated, will increase the risk of the development of chronic heart failure. Much is known about the pathophysiology and effective treatments of chronic heart failure from left ventricular systolic dysfunction; however, little clinical trial evidence exists concerning benefits of treating patients with chronic heart failure and preserved systolic function, also known as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Rather, an understanding of the pathophysiology and patient signs and symptoms has usually dictated choice of treatments. With the results of ongoing trials, as well as the Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved and the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trials, clinical evidence is accumulating to support effective treatments in patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The focus of this review is to discuss the risks of, identification of, and rationale for therapeutic choices being employed for treating left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and implications from studies that may support these choices.",

With the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as treatment, outcomes have improved significantly, though 39% to 50% of SSc patients who develop SRC continue to have poor outcomes, including permanent dialysis and death. Early recognition and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are important in the effective management of SRC, though given the continuing morbidity and mortality caused by SRC, they are clearly not sufficient. Newer therapies based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and perpetuation of SRC are needed. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, and treatment of SRC, with an emphasis on recent insights and developments.", 
    "276": "Nephropathy is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes and, in adults, persistent microalbuminuria is the best marker of the consequent risk for its development. In the pediatric population, puberty represents the most important risk factor for the development of microangiopathic complications, although it is not necessarily associated with the progression to frank proteinuria. As many as 50% of subjects may revert to normoalbuminuria. Hypertension is a further risk factor and may accelerate the progression of micro- and macrovascular complications. There is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce renal damage by one or more mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects--hence they represent the drug of choice for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. However, as angiotensin II receptor antagonists are more specific, they may become the obvious treatment choice in the near future. There is no consensus as to who should be treated and when treatment with renoprotective drugs should begin in the pediatric population, due to the lack of a clear definition of the natural history of microalbuminuria in this age group. In this review some models and controversial aspects of this issue are presented and discussed.",

    "281": "Numerous trials and meta-analyses have been conducted over the last five years to identify an ideal anti-hypertensive drug. These reports, and the JNC 7 and European hypertension guidelines, have generated some controversy and confusion. A review of the comparative anti-hypertensive drug trials shows that the differences between drugs are minor and not consistently demonstrated by different studies. However, much data have now accumulated on the safety and value of diuretics, beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in reducing blood pressure and preventing clinical disease. The importance of tight blood pressure control in reducing adverse events has been clearly shown, and clinicians should concentrate on achieving target blood pressure levels, which often requires a combination of anti-hypertensive drugs. The choice of anti-hypertensive drug should be guided by the presence of concomitant clinical disease, as evidence has accumulated on the special efficacy of certain drugs in reducing damage to particular organ systems. In the absence of any associated clinical disease, it is good to initiate anti-hypertensive therapy with diuretics, provided the metabolic parameters are regularly reviewed.", 
    "282": "In clinical heart failure (HF) the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important component of neurohormonal activation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be of great clinical benefit in reducing the production of angiotensin II. However, they do not fully suppress angiotensin II production in HF because there are other pathways through which angiotensin II can be produced. Theoretically, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have great potential because of their ability to directly block angiotensin II produced through any pathway. A large body of literature has accumulated examining the effects of ARBs in HF. The earlier, smaller studies examined outcomes such as symptoms, neurohormonal concentrations and cardiac function. More recent, larger studies have examined the effects of ARBs on mortality and morbidity. This paper reviews the data defining the role of ARBs in the treatment of HF patients, focusing more on the large randomised clinical outcome trials.", 
    "283": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly effective antihypertensive agents with excellent safety profiles. ARBs have been shown to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy. For this later class of patients, the American Diabetes Association recommends ARBs as the primary treatment option. The ARBs function by blocking the binding of angiotensin-II (A-II) to its receptor, thereby inhibiting the action of A-II. Unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the production of A-II through the ACE pathway, the ARBs effectively inhibit A-II regardless of whether it is produced through ACE or some alternate enzyme pathway. This difference in action offers a distinct advantage of ARBs over ACE inhibitors. Olmesartan medoxomil, the latest addition to the ARB class, is a long-acting, safe and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug. The combination of olmesartan medoxomil with a low-dose diuretic, potentiates the blood pressure lowering effect of either agent alone and is highly effective in achieving the recommended blood pressure goals in the majority of patients treated.", 
    "284": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quinapril, valsartan, and amlodipin on glucose tolerance in cyclosporine (CsA)-toxic rats. Among 40 male Wistar rats 32 were administered cyclosporine (CsA) (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 6 weeks. Quinapril (10 mg/kg per day) (group Q), valsartan (40 mg/kg per day) (group V), and amlodipine (10mg/kg per day) (group A) were administered to individual sets of eight CsA-treated animals via the drinking water with the remaining untreated hosts followed as a control group (group C) and 8 healthy controls (group H). A Glucose-tolerance test was performed by administering oral glucose (2 g/kg) followed by blood samples obtained from the tail vein at baseline as well as 30,60,90, and 120 minutes after the glucose load. Glucose area under the curve (AUC) was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule. CsA levels were determined using an immunofluorescence method. Kruskal Wallis ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. Median CsA levels were 1968 ng/mL, 1982 ng/mL, 1580 ng/mL, 1600 ng/mL; and glucose AUC, 232.4 +/- 130 mg/min per dL, 63.1 +/- 25 mg/min per dL, 115.0 +/- 90 mg/min per dL, 47.4 +/- 34 mg/min per dL 53.4 +/- 38 mg/min per dL for groups C,Q,V,A and H, respectively. Quinapril-treated and amilodipine-treated rats displayed a lower glucose AUC than group C (P <.01), which had higher glucose levels than healthy controls (P <.001). In summary, CsA treated rats show impaired glucose tolerance, which is improved by quinapril or amlodipine treatment. Angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors and calcium channel blockers affect beta cell function rather than insulin sensitivity.", 
    "285": "Posttransplantation erythrocytosis (PE) is a frequent problem in renal transplant patients. The pathogenesis and mechanisms of both the problem and therapy strategy are unknown. Since ACE and angiotensin 2 receptor inhibitors have been used to successfully manage PE, we speculated a relation between gene polymorphisms and this complication. Ninety-six ( 30 women, 66 men, age 34.4 +/- 11.0 years) renal transplant patients evaluated retrospectively, for gene polymorphisms of ACE, angiotensinogen, angiotensin 1 and 2 receptors (ATR1 and ATR2), as well as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS). They were divided into two groups; patients with versus without PE, which was defined as >15 g/dL hemoglobin levels during the first year after renal transplantation. PE was found to be significantly more prevalent among D/D than I/I gene polymorphism of ACE genes (P <.04). The distribution of D/D, I/D, and I/I polymorphisms were 39.1%, 45.9%, and 7.6%, respectively. There was no difference between D/D and I/D polymorphisms. Comparing the I/D and I/I polymorphisms showed PE to be statistically more prevalent in the I/D polymorphism (P <.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that D/D and I/D polymorphisms were significant risk factors for PE (P <.05, RR = 7.714 and P <.03, RR = 10.199, respectively). While previous studies revealed a relation between angiotensin II and PE, our study discovered the contribution of ACE gene polymorphism.", 
    "286": "Although posttransplant nephrotic syndrome is frequent, its structural basis and prognosis have not been clearly defined. The biopsy findings of 54 patients with this disorder posttransplant, among 375 total renal transplant recipients engrafted during a 10-year period, were correlated with clinical follow-up data. The mean patient age was 41.7 +/- 12.3 years, female/male ratio 22/32, and cadaveric/living-related donor ratio 37/17. The nephrotic syndrome developed 3 to 91 months posttransplant. At the onset the mean values of serum creatinine was 2.9 +/- 1.8 mg/dL and proteinuria 4.5 +/- 0.8 g/d. The index biopsy findings showed chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) in 33; de novo glomerulonephritis (GN) in 6, recurrent GN in 9, and undetermined GN in 6 who had an unknown primary renal disease. Among 21 follow-up biopsies during a mean of 44.3 +/- 28 months the CAN progressed but the GN remained the same. The treatment included augmented steroids alone (n = 1) or in combination with cyclophosphamide (n = 2) and with plasmapheresis (n = 1); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) along (n = 5); calcium channel blockers (CCB) alone (n = 24); or the two types of drugs together (n = 22). Complete or partial remission was achieved in 8 and 5, respectively, but nephrotic syndrome recurred in 3 of these patients at 45.1 +/- 18 months later. Sustained remission was more likely in cases of GN (minimal change disease and IgA nephropathy) and ACEI-ARB treatment (P <.01). Graft failure, which occurred in 35 patients, correlated strongly with serum creatinine at onset, being significantly greater in patients with CAN (P <.005). Both remission of the nephrotic syndrome and graft survival were greater among patients with GN as compared to those with CAN.", 
    "287": "The aim of our study was to investigate bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) expression in a rat model of chronic cyclosporine (CsA) toxicity compare with healthy controls, as well as the influence of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) quinapril. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into groups of eight animals treated with CsA (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 8 weeks (CsA group) without or with quinapril (10 mg/kg per day in the drinking water: CsA group + Q) for comparison with healthy controls (H group). The renal tissues were examined by light microscopy for CsA toxicity; specifically, tubulointerstitial damage and afferent arteriolopathy as well as BMP-7 expression were semiquantitatively scored by immunohistochemical staining. Mean CsA levels were 1982 ng/mL and 1968 ng/mL for the CsA and CsA + Q groups, respectively. At the end of the study period, the mean serum creatinine levels were 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/dL, 1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dL, and 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL for the H, CsA, and CsA + Q groups, respectively. Interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and afferent arteriolar hyalinization were present in the CsA group and, to a lesser degree, in the CsA + Q group, compared with the H group. CsA-treated rats displayed significantly decreased BMP-7 expression compared with healthy controls (P <.0005). BMP-7 expression was higher among the CsA + Q group than the the group CsA group. In a rat model histologic changes characteristic of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity are associated with decreased expression of BMP-7, which seems to be at least partially restored by ACE inhibition.", 
    "288": "Erythrocytes are potential biocompatible vectors for different bioactive substances, including drugs. These can be used successfully as biological carriers of drugs, enzymes and peptides. There are currently diverse methods that permit drug encapsulation in erythrocytes with an appropriate yield. The methods most commonly employed are based on a high-haematocrit dialysis procedure, mainly hypo-osmotic dialysis. Erythrocytes loaded with drugs and other substances allow for different release rates to be obtained. Encapsulation in erythrocytes significantly changes the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in both animals and humans, enhancing liver and spleen uptake and targeting the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Amongst other applications, erythrocytes have been used for drug-targeting the RES with aminoglycoside antibiotics; the selective transport to certain organs and tissues of certain antineoplastic drugs, such as methotrexate, doxorubicine, etoposide, carboplatin, etc.; the encapsulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, the encapsulation of new prodrugs with increased duration of action, etc. Erythrocytes are also attractive systems in the sense of their potential ability to deliver proteins and therapeutic peptides. Thus, erythrocytes have been used for the transport of enzymes destined for the correction of metabolic alterations as l-asparaginase, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (AlDH) among others. Erythrocytes have been used successfully as carriers of anti-HIV peptides, such as AZT, nucleoside analogues, antisense oligonucleotides, antineoplastic peptides, erythropoietin, interleukin 3, etc. Amongst other applications, mention may be made of paramagnetic erythrocytes, encapsulation of MRI contrast agents or the study of the metabolism of the red cell. Although erythrocytes have been applied with different uses in human medicine, their deployment is still very limited due to difficulties involving storage, its exposure to contamination and the absence of a validated industrial procedure for its preparation.", 
    "289": "The American Heart Association meeting reported the results of several clinical trials of particular interest to those who care for patients with heart failure. Omega-3 fatty acids were associated with a trend to increased recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias but not mortality in patients with an implantable debrillator. The ACTIV in CHF study provides more evidence of a therapeutic role for arginine vasopressin antagonists in the treatment of heart failure. The VALIANT study provides further evidence to suggest that a combination of angiotensin receptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor does not reduce mortality but may reduce morbidity in post-MI patients with heart failure or major LV systolic dysfunction. A study of autologous bone marrow cell transplantation into myocardial scar give gave encouraging results. SPORTIF V showed ximelagation to be as effective as warfarin but with improved safety. ORBIT and PAD showed public access defibrillators saved lives but questioned their cost effectiveness.

    "290": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with oxidative stress. Platelet responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO) donors, are impaired in patients with angina pectoris, possibly by increasing oxidative stress. We investigated the occurrence of platelet resistance to NO in patients, with ischaemic or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy compared with normal subjects. Anti-aggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), oxidative stress and whole blood superoxide anion content were determined, with correlates of responsiveness to SNP. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by SNP was 65.4+/-3.55% in controls and 59.3+/-4.1% in CHF (P=ns) despite increased oxidative stress and post-aggregation O2- in CHF patients. However, subsets of CHF patients have NO-resistant platelets: this is associated with increasing age and/or increased oxidative stress (both p<0.05).", 
    "291": "There is evidence to suggest that antiplatelet aggregation and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme will attenuate the progression of renal disease. In the present study, dipyridamole (DPM; 30 mg/kg per day, p.o.) or fosinopril (FOS; 20 mg/kg per day, p.o.) was given to rats for 5 weeks starting immediately after renal mass reduction (right uninephrectomy and ligation of approximately two-thirds of the blood supply to the left kidney). Renal mass reduction caused increased mean arterial blood pressure, reduced effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), azotemia and proteinuria. Neither proteinuria nor hypertension was affected by DPM, although renal function improved markedly. Rats receiving FOS showed normalization of blood pressure with a significant increase in both ERPF and GFR, along with a lower degree of proteinuria. A histological examination of the remnant kidney detected the presence of vasodilation with a lower degree of podocyte swelling in both treatment groups, with a remarkable effect in the FOS group. These data indicate that both FOS and DPM attenuate the progression of glomerular disease associated with renal mass reduction in rats. However, FOS was more beneficial than DPM because it reduced proteinuria and lowered blood pressure.", 
    "292": "This study has investigated the microtubular cytoskeleton in rat glomerular and proximal tubule cells in experimental diabetes. The effect of treatment with ramipril on the relationship between microtubule organization and albuminuria in diabetes has also been examined. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.v.). Rats were treated with or without ramipril in their drinking water for 12 weeks. Diabetes was characterized by an increase in blood glucose level, glomerular filtration rate, and albumin excretion rate. Treatment of diabetic rats with ramipril did not affect glycaemic control, but reduced systolic blood pressure and prevented the rise in albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate. Immunohistochemistry was performed by using the ARK Peroxidase method with alpha-tubulin antibody. The regular, grainy staining pattern of the microtubules present in the renal proximal tubules from control kidneys was altered in diabetic animals, and appeared fragmented and striated. This was prevented by treatment with ramipril. Quantitative morphometric analysis revealed an increase in the percent proportional staining for alpha-tubulin in the proximal tubules of untreated diabetic rats (33.3 +/- 3.3%, n = 8, P < 0.05 vs control) compared with control rats (11.7 +/- 1.7%, n = 6), which was reduced by ramipril treatment (26.7 +/- 2.1%, n = 6, P < 0.05 vs untreated diabetic). Staining for alpha-tubulin in glomerular cells was unchanged in all groups. There was no significant difference in renal alpha-tubulin expression among all groups, as determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These results raise the possibility that diabetes-induced changes in microtubules in the renal proximal tubules may contribute, in part, to the increase in albuminuria observed in diabetes.", 
    "293": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality in dialysis patients. Aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce CVD mortality in the general population, as may angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and usage rates of cardioprotective agents in end-stage renal failure are unknown. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of dialysis patients was performed to compare: (i) prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking); (ii) use of cardioprotective agents; and (iii) prevalence of cardiovascular disease between the time-points: 1996 (n = 262) versus 2001 (n = 369). We found an increase in the risk factors of age (53.6 +/- 14.9 years in 1996 vs 58.4 +/- 14.3 in 2001; P < 0.001) and hyperlipidaemia (45 vs 51.8%; P < 0.001) between the two time-points, with a reduction in the prevalence of smoking (14.5 vs 8.1%; P = 0.016). There was no difference in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (37.4 vs 40.7%; P = 0.44). Cardioprotective agents were underutilized, with improvement in prescribing practice between 1996 and in 2001, especially in the usage of statins (21.4 vs 38.7% in 2001; P = 0.019). In conclusion, CVD is the primary cause of mortality in our dialysis patients. Although traditional cardiovascular risk factors affect the majority of the dialysis population, underutilization of cardioprotective agents is common. Proof of efficacy of these agents in this population of enormous risk is urgently required.",

It is easily measured and, unfortunately, frequently overlooked as a screening tool in clinical medicine. If present, it identifies patients at risk for early cardiovascular death and progressive renal disease. Microalbuminuria also identifies patients who need more rigorous cardiovascular risk management, especially more intensive blood pressure control, preferably below 130/80 mm Hg, and strict attention to glycemic control and lipid levels. Therapeutic strategies to facilitate better blood pressure control and reduce microalbuminuria likely will prove to be the most effective way to retard not only the progression of renal disease but also cardiovascular disease. Consequently, the identification and normalization of urine microalbumin excretion should be an important consideration in patients with diabetes.",

In renal medulla and cortex, AMI was associated with 2.2- and 1.8-fold increase in AQP2 mRNA expression when compared with Sham-operated rats (medulla: 23.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 52.3 +/- 8.7%; P<0.001; cortex: 19.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 35.5 +/- 7.1%; P<0.05). All the treatment regimens were able to normalize AQP2 transcription in the renal medulla (Fos, 19.9 +/- 4.9%; Val, 22.8 +/- 4.9%; Fos + Val, 20.1 +/- 5.1%; P=NS vs. Sham) and in the cortex (Fos, 21.2 +/- 6.7%; Val, 20.4 +/- 6.0%; Fos + Val, 18.9 +/- 7.5%; P=NS vs. Sham). Similarly, the AQP2 protein expression increased by 2.1-fold after CHF (P<0.05), and was normalized by the treatment regimens (Sham, 0.57 +/- 0.19%; CHF, 1.22 +/- 0.45%; Fos, 0.39 +/- 0.36%; Val, 0.46 +/- 0.34%; Fos + Val, 0.36 +/- 0.15%; all P<0.05 vs. CHF). These treatment regimens also prevented the increase in body weight as found in untreated CHF rats (analysis of variance P<0.05). The renal and cardiac AQP1 gene and protein expressions were unaltered in CHF or by medical therapy. There was no observed cardiac AQP2 expression in all the study groups. Treatment with Fos, Val, or combination therapy was effective in preventing the upregulation of renal AQP2 gene and protein expressions in CHF rats caused by AMI.",

In this review, we describe newly recognized physiologic actions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). These include the role of local versus systemic ACE in maintaining blood pressure, the physiology of bradykinin accumulation during ACE inactivation, and the role of alternate \"non-angiotensin\" substrates and potential non-enzymatic properties of ACE.", 
    "304": "Diabetes is associated with an inordinate burden of cardiovascular and renal disease, which is expected to accelerate during the next few decades. The relationship between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and diabetic macrovascular and microvascular disease is well established. The contribution of the tissue RAS in disease pathogenesis has recently been the focus of much interest, and has prompted investigators to explore the use of high-dose RAS inhibition with monotherapy or combination therapy to provide a more complete blockade of the actions of angiotensin II, beyond lowering blood pressure. There is now evidence to support this approach to maximize cardiovascular and renal protection. Optimal dosing strategies remain uncertain, but tissue specificity does not appear to be important if the doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme-I and angiotensin-receptor binders are high enough. The purpose of this review is to highlight our current understanding of the role of the tissue RAS in the pathogenesis of diabetic end-organ damage and ongoing strategies to interfere pharmacologically.",

We hypothesized that continuous combined transdermal HRT may have benefits on CHD risk markers without the potential adverse effects seen with certain other HRT regimens. Sixty apparently healthy postmenopausal women, aged 40-65 years, entered a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial; 55 women completed the 6-month study. Women received either transdermal oestradiol 17beta 0.05 mg and norethisterone acetate 0.125 mg daily, or identical placebo. Circulating markers of vascular function and remodelling, forearm blood flow, lipids and lipoproteins, glucose and insulin, and haemostatic safety parameters were measured at baseline and after treatment. Compared with placebo after 6 months, HRT administration resulted in decreased E-selectin (P < 0.01), and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE; P = 0.05). Cholesterol (P < 0.05), low-density lipoproteins (LDL; P < 0.05), high-density lipoprotein3 (HDL3; P < 0.05) and apolipoproteins AII (P < 0.05) and B (P < 0.05), and fasting insulin (P < 0.05) also decreased in the HRT group. Factor VII coagulation activity decreased (P < 0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and fibrin D-dimer increased (P < 0.05) in the HRT group, whilst prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (P < 0.05) decreased, more so in the placebo group. There were no changes in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, or in LDL particle size. This transdermal HRT had beneficial effects on vascular function and CHD risk markers.", 
    "307": "IgA nephropathy is quite a common disease with an annual incidence around 25 per 10(6) inhabitants. It occurs in young adults and its progression is rather indolent, leading to a 20-30% incidence of end stage renal failure within 20 years of evolution. Gross hematuria is classic but far less frequent than microscopic hematuria or proteinuria. Therefore, routine screening remains essential. It is still very difficult to establish the eventual outcome and patients must remain under medical control for a lifetime. The amount of proteinuria, arterial hypertension and pathological damage are the major prognostic factors. The control of first two should be a permanent goal of the treatment, in which ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists play a central role. High-risk patients will benefit from steroid and immunosuppressive therapy.",

Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group I--12 pts all medicated with beta-blockers; Group II--14 pts all medicated with calcium channel blockers; Group III--15 pts all medicated with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (n = 8) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (n = 7). We evaluated casual BP and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), left ventricular ejection duration (LVED), augmentation pressure (delta P) and augmentation index (AI%) in the aorta (a measure of aortic wave reflection), derived using radial and carotid applantation tonometry, were measured.

    "313": "To clarify the renal protection conferred by angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor(ACEI), we compared an ACEI group and a conventional therapy (control) group with matched propensity scores. The propensity score is used to control imbalances in the conditional probability of a subject receiving a particular exposure given a set of defined confounders. To calculate the propensity score, the confounders are used in a logistic regression to predict the exposure of interest, without including the outcome. We used a database of the characteristics and clinical data for 1,309 renal insufficiency cases who visited our out-patient clinic between 1986 and 2001. The major contributing factors in the patient characteristics were primary disease, blood pressure, renal function(serum creatinine levels; sCr), urinary protein excretion (UP), and gender. The primary end-point was the doubling of the baseline sCr noted at the time of enrollment or endstage renal failure. The major characteristics of the two groups were not statistically different. An incidence of 90% was obtained at 95 months in the control group and at 183 months in the ACEI group. Using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the survival rates of the two groups were found to be significantly different (p < 0.001 by log-rank test), with ACEI having a beneficial effect on the survival rate and renal function. Using a sub-analysis, neither the starting point of ACEI treatment, based on an sCr above or below 2 mg/dl, nor the amount of UP, more or less than 1 g/day, affected the superiority of ACEI in the prevention of renal failure progression. The ACEI treatment was superior to conventional therapy in patients with renal insufficiency, and this superiority was independent of blood pressure, renal function and the amount of UP, based on the analysis of an observational database of renal insufficiency cases with matched propensity scores.", 
    "314": "The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of anemia in stable pediatric renal transplant recipients and to examine the association of anemia with renal function, immunosuppressants, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and growth, as well as iron, vitamin B(12), and folate stores. This is a cross-sectional study of the 50 renal transplant recipients currently followed at our center. Patient data were collected regarding hematological parameters, growth, medications, renal function, underlying renal disease, delayed graft function, episodes of rejection, and iron or erythropoietin therapy post transplantation. The mean hemoglobin level (Hb) was 110 g/l and the overall prevalence of anemia was 60%, including 30% who were severely anemic (Hb<100 g/l). There was a high rate of iron deficiency (34%) and serum iron was the parameter of iron metabolism most closely associated with anemia. Hb in patients with low serum iron was 90.7 g/l versus 114.4 g/l in those with normal serum iron ( P<0.01). Both univariate and multiple linear regression determined tacrolimus dose and creatinine clearance to be significant factors associated with anemia. Tacrolimus dose correlated with a 10 g/l reduction in Hb for every increase of tacrolimus dose of 0.054 mg/kg per day ( P=0.001). The dose of mycophenolate was positively correlated with Hb, but this was likely to be confounded by our practice of dose reduction in the setting of anemia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor use was not associated with anemia. Severely anemic patients tended to be shorter, with a mean Z-score for height of -1.8 compared with -0.9 for those with normal Hb ( P=0.02). Anemia is a significant and common problem in pediatric renal transplant patients. Deteriorating renal function is an important cause, but other factors like iron deficiency and immunosuppression are involved. Definition of iron deficiency is difficult and serum iron may be a valuable indicator. Medication doses, nutritional status, need for erythropoietin and iron, as well as poor graft function and growth require systematic scrutiny in the care of the anemic renal transplant recipient.", 
    "315": "Around one third of patients with myocardial infarction are diabetic. More vigorous control of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension is likely to be of crucial importance for risk reduction. Although the effect of intensive glycemic control appears to be only minor in terms of prevention of cardiac events in diabetic patients, it has a major beneficial impact during acute myocardial infarction and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Lipid-lowering treatment is as effective in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease as in nondiabetic patients. In patients with coronary artery disease, there is strong evidence in favor of the use of b-blockers soon after myocardial infarction as well as in the long term. The metabolic treatment may also be considered as a rational approach for patients with stable angina. The long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor trials in patients with left ventricle dysfunction soon after myocardial infarction demonstrated a substantial benefit in the subgroup of diabetic patients. Current evidence leads us to recommend revascularization surgery as the first choice in diabetic patients. The management of risk factors should be more intensive in diabetic patients. In diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, most of the medical strategies are as effective as in nondiabetic patients.",

This study characterises some of the mechanisms and mediators involved in the orofacial nociception triggered by injection of formalin into the upper lip of the rat, by assessing the influence of various treatments on behavioural nociceptive responses (duration of facial rubbing) elicited either by a low subthreshold (i.e. non-nociceptive; 0.63%) or a higher concentration of the algogen (2.5%). 2. The kininase II inhibitor captopril (5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) and prostaglandin(PG) E(2) (100 ng lip(-1)) potentiated both phases of the response to 0.63% formalin, whereas tumour necrosis factor (TNF alpha; 5 pg lip(-1)), interleukin(IL)-1 beta (0.5 pg lip(-1)), IL-6 (2 ng lip(-1)) and IL-8 (200 pg lip(-1)), or the indirectly acting sympathomimetic drug tyramine (200 microg lip(-1)), each augmented only the second phase of nociception. 3. Conversely, both phases of nociception induced by 2.5% formalin were inhibited by the bradykinin (BK) B(2) receptor antagonist HOE140 (5 microg lip(-1)) or the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (100 microg lip(-1)). However, the BK B(1) receptor antagonist des-Arg(9)-Leu(8)-BK (1 and 2 microg lip(-1)), antibody and/or antiserum against each of the cytokines, the adrenergic neurone blocker guanethidine (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1), s.c., for 3 days) and the cyclooxygenase(COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib (50 and 200 microg lip(-1), s.c.; or 1 and 3 mg kg(-1), i.p.) reduced only the second phase of the response. The nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin and the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor MK886 did not change formalin-induced nociception. 4. Our results indicate that BK, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, sympathetic amines and PGs (but not leukotrienes) contribute significantly to formalin-induced orofacial nociception in the rat and the response seems to be more susceptible to inhibition by B(2) receptor antagonist and selective COX-2 inhibitor than by B(1) receptor antagonist or nonselective COX inhibitor.",

The IHCIS is a fully de-identified, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant database and includes complete medical histories for more than 17 million managed-care lives; data from more than 30 US health plans, covering seven census regions; and patient demographics, including morbidity, age and gender. A total of 12 825 ED patients and an equal number of male patients without ED were included in the retrospective cohort study. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the adjusted risk of PVD that accounted for age at ED diagnosis, smoking, obesity and medications including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers and statins. The cohort of men with ED were observed to have a 75% increase in risk for PVD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 2.90) after adjusting for age at ED diagnosis, smoking, obesity and use of ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and statins. Some evidence of a possible trend towards increased risk was detected by age group. After controlling for the aforementioned covariates and compared to men aged 30-39 years, it was noted that patients aged 40-44 years were 2.1 times more likely to develop PVD (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.89, 4.81), 45-49-year-old men were also more than twice as likely to have PVD (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.03, 5.22), and 50-55-year-old patients had a three-fold increased risk of developing PVD (OR = 3.00, 95% CI = 1.40, 6.43). The results of this study indicate that ED may serve as a marker for PVD. The risk becomes more pronounced with increasing age, indicating the need for cardiologists and internists to monitor ED patients who may not necessarily present with cardiovascular symptoms.",

We attempted to determine whether or not combined treatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has an additive inhibitory effect on balloon-injury-elicited neointima formation in the carotid artery. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with an ARB (valsartan: 3 mg/kg/day) and/or an ACEI (benazepril: 0.3 mg/kg/day) from 1 week before until 2 weeks after balloon injury. Experiments were also conducted with one-third of the dose combination used in the original experiments. Both ARB and ACEI inhibited neointima formation without any blood pressure changes. The full-dose combination lowered blood pressure and suppressed neointima formation significantly compared with the levels in the groups treated with either ACEI or ARB alone. The low-dose combination without blood pressure reduction also inhibited neointima formation to a similar extent as the full-dose combination. We measured 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a marker of oxidative stress, and nitrite and nitrate (NOx), an index of nitric monoxide production, in media conditioned by the injured artery. NOx production was lower and 8-iso-PGF2alpha was higher in the media of the injured artery, compared with those in the normal artery. ACEI restored NOx production more dramatically than ARB, and ARB suppressed 8-iso-PGF2alpha markedly compared with ACEI. These results suggest that the combination of an ARB and an ACEI exerts an additive inhibitory effect, presumably through an increase in production and bioavailability of NO from the endothelium.",

We compared the effects of omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) to fosinopril (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) on flow-induced vascular remodeling in New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rats. Both drugs equally reduced blood pressure (BP) initially, but systolic BP and pulse pressure were reduced more by omapatrilat after 1 week. Carotid remodeling was induced by partial ligation of the left common carotid artery (LCA). There was little remodeling in untreated GH rats - measured as outer diameter to body weight (OD/BW vs. before ligation): 97 +/- 1% of initial LCA (low flow) and 107 +/- 3% of initial right common carotid artery (RCA, high flow). In contrast, OD/BW increased to 118 +/- 5% (p < 0.05) of initial RCA after omapatrilat versus 108 +/- 2% (p = 0.96) after fosinopril. The major change was increased RCA lumen area which was significantly larger in omapatrilat-treated animals (127% vs. control) than fosinopril-treated animals (103% vs. control). The increase in outward remodeling after omapatrilat treatment correlated weakly with vascular cGMP levels and decreased systolic BP. The results suggest that dual inhibition of NEP/ACE may have greater effects than ACE inhibition alone on vessel remodeling in hypertension.",

A sequential hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure (insulin infusion rates: 3 and 30 mU/kg BW/min) was employed in 15 high-fructose-fed rats and 10 normal chow-fed rats under the awake condition. Five of the high-fructose-fed and five of the normal chow-fed rats, respectively, were continuously given imidapril (5 mg/kg BW/min) or saline during the two-step euglycemic clamp study. Furthermore, both imidapril and L-NMMA were infused in another 5 high-fructose-fed rats during the low-dose insulin clamp. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) was regarded as an index of the whole-body insulin action. In the low-dose insulin infusion, the high-fructose feeding resulted in a marked decrease in GIR (p<0.05). Imidapril infusion significantly raised the GIRs in the high-fructose-fed rats (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in GIRs between the chow-fed rats and the imidapril-infused rats with high-fructose diet. In the high-fructose-fed rats, L-NMMA abolished the increase in GIR induced by imidapril (p<0.05). Imidapril did not significantly change the GIRs in the chow-fed rats. In the high-dose insulin infusion, no significant difference in GIR was found among the chow-fed rats, the chow-fed rats given imidapril, the high-fructose-fed rats, and the high-fructose-fed rats given imidapril. These results suggest that, in insulin-resistant rats induced by the high-fructose feeding, an ACE inhibitor, such as imidapril, can improve the whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal and that this effect of imidapril is essentially linked to increased activation of NO-pathway.",

These beneficial effects of ramipril might be related to the downregulation of TGF-beta and its downstream signals in OLETF rats. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting the potential effect of ramipril on the prevention of islet destruction by fibrosis in the animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Two hundred forty-four subjects (85 males) aged 17-84 years with a mean duration of DM of 7.9 years and who regularly attended the clinic for diabetes at least monthly for no less than 6 months were involved. Eleven percent, 13 of the 115 treated hypertensives, had BP controlled to levels below 140/90 mm Hg. Nifedipine was the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive (44.30%), followed by alpha-methyldopa (15.7%) and then the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) captopril and lisinopril (11.3%). Thiazides (9.7%) or thiazide-based fixed combination tablets were prescribed in about 25% of the patients. Eighteen percent were on more than one antihypertensive concurrently and dosages were often at threshold. The majority of the hypertensives with BP below 140/90 mm Hg were on thiazide-based medications. In 152 participants, the presence of hypertension did not affect glycemic control (chi2 = 4.41, df = 2, P = .1) observed and 60% of the entire population had FBC < or = 7.9 mmol/L. Lack of access to care does not explain these findings and suggests an area for improvement. Fortunately, the data also show that thiazides were associated with better control of BP at a cost that was affordable without jeopardizing diabetic control.",

Population-based studies suggest that more than 50% of people over the age of 65 years may have chronic hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) > or = 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension, especially systolic hypertension, is the most common, powerful, however treatable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Large randomised trials have demonstrated that treating elderly and even very old persons (age > 80 years) is highly efficacious. A recent meta-analysis, comparing active treatment with placebo in isolated systolic hypertension demonstrated highly significant benefits: stroke was reduced by 30%, coronary heart disease events by 23%, all cardiovascular events by 26%, and cardiovascular deaths by 13%. The classic strategy of an initial thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic therapy has been verified by the most recent trials. Furthermore it is not appropriate to limit the choice of initial drugs for hypertensive older individuals to a single class of agents, since so many older people have other medical problems that affect this decision and reaching the target blood pressure is the determinant factor for cardiovascular risk reduction. Therefore single drug therapy with long-acting (dihydropyridine-type) calcium-antagonists, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor-blockers is justified with respect to individual efficacy and comorbidity. If a combination of antihypertensive drugs is needed to reach blood pressure goal, thiazides remain the cornerstone. First line therapy with an alpha-blocker is no longer recommended, even for men with hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Today, recommended blood pressure goals are the same for younger individuals and the elderly.", 
    "351": "In the last decade the number of patients with congestive heart failure has increased noticeably and today heart failure is one of the major problems in civilized countries. While in earlier decades arterial hypertension was the main reason for developing heart failure, today coronary artery disease has become the focus of attention. However, arterial hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are also main risk factors for developing coronary artery disease. In addition to non-pharmacological management with reduced fluid intake and periodical exercise training particularly in stable heart failure, in the last decade some special drug compounds have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality in great double blind randomized trials. ACE-inhibitors and betablockers are essential components in treating congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-II-receptorblockers are indicated if ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers are not tolerated. The combined use of all three compounds was shown to result in a further reduction of mortality in the recently presented CHARM study. In progressive heart failure the use of diuretics is necessary and effective especially when fluid overload exists. Not treating heart failure is followed by high mortality, as we know, and so adequate and uncompromising treatment of hypertension is the most important approach to prevent the further development of heart failure.",

The Joint National Committee (JNC) VI recommends BP <130/85 mmHg, or <125/75 mmHg if urinary protein excretion exceeds 1 g/d. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are considered as first-line agents. The current study is a survey of the degree of goal achievement and prescription patterns of antihypertensive (AHT) medication according to the JNC guidelines in clinical nephrology practice. All patients with CRF, not on renal replacement therapy, treated by nephrologists at the University Hospital of North-Norway were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Data on protein:creatinine ratio (PC ratio), BP and AHT drugs prescribed were extracted from the hospital's databases and medical records. A total of 144 patients were included. The patients' age was 62+/-16 years and the serum creatinine value was 210+/-92 micromol/l (mean+/-s.d.). In all, 74 patients (51%) had PC ratio < or =1, 36 (25%) >1, and for 34 (24%) PC ratio had not been measured; 23 (31%) of the patients with PC ratio < or =1 had BP < or =130/85 (139+/-21/78+/-12), and 5 (14%) of those with PC ratio >1 had BP < or =125/75 (145+/-22/85+/-14). Failure to achieve the goal was most commonly due to elevated SBP. In all, 55 % of the patients were prescribed ACE-I or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In conclusion, the recommended BP goals may be difficult to achieve for a high proportion of patients in clinical practice due to difficulty in lowering SBP. There is a potential for improved treatment of hypertension in CRF patients, including increased prescription of ACE-I and ARB.", 
    "354": "The aims of the present study were to determine the effects and mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II) on leukocyte-endothelium interactions and the role of Ang II in a novel model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the mouse colon. Ang II dose-dependently increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion in colonic venules. Importantly, Ang II-induced leukocyte rolling was completely inhibited by immunoneutralization of P-selectin, and leukocyte adhesion was abolished in lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1)-deficient mice. The P-selectin-dependent rolling was found to be a precondition for the subsequent LFA-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion. Moreover, Ang II-induced leukocyte responses involved generation of reactive oxygen species and up-regulation of CXC chemokines. Notably, CXC chemokines, but not Ang II, stimulated leukocyte chemotaxis in vitro. I/R increased gene expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the colon and plasma concentrations of Ang II. Inhibition of ACE and the type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptor significantly decreased the I/R-induced leukocyte adhesion. Taken together, these novel findings demonstrate that Ang II exerts potent pro-inflammatory effects in the colonic microcirculation and that inhibition of Ang II expression or function protects against I/R-induced leukocyte responses in the colon. Thus, it is suggested that Ang II is a major target to control pathological inflammation in the colon.",

Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variations were comparable for the two groups (-7.2 v -8.3 mm Hg, NS).

At 6 weeks of age, male Ren-2 rats were randomized to receive no treatment (N = 10), the ACE inhibitor fosinopril 10 mg/kg/day (N = 10), or omapatrilat 10 mg/kg/day (N = 10) or 40 mg/kg/day (N = 10) by daily gavage for 24 weeks. Various cardiorenal functional and structural parameters were assessed. Compared to controls, all treatment groups reduced hypertension in control Ren-2 rats, with both doses of omapatrilat reducing systolic blood pressure significantly more than fosinopril (control, 178 +/- 3 mmHg; fosinopril 10 mg/kg/day, 130 +/- 4 mmHg; omapatrilat 10 mg/kg/day, 110 +/- 3 mmHg; omapatrilat 40 mg/kg/day, 91 +/- 3 mmHg). Omapatrilat dose-dependently reduced cardiac hypertrophy, caused a greater inhibition of renal ACE than fosinopril, and was the only treatment to inhibit renal NEP. Attenuation of albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and cardiorenal fibrosis occurred to a similar degree with omapatrilat and fosinopril. Omapatrilat confers cardiorenal protection in the hypertensive Ren-2 rat. Although inhibition of tissue NEP may contribute to the superior blood pressure reduction by omapatrilat, overall, the results are consistent with the central role that angiotensin II plays in renal and cardiac fibrosis in this model of hypertension.",

Other atherosclerotic vascular disorders, especially coronary artery disease (CAD), may coexist with PAD. Elderly persons with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from CAD. Modifiable risk factors should be treated in persons with PAD such as cessation of cigarette smoking and control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Statins have been shown to reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and to improve treadmill exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in persons with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel, especially clopidogrel, should be administered to all persons with PAD. Persons with PAD should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and also with beta blockers if CAD is present. Cilostazol should be given to persons with intermittent claudication to improve exercise capacity unless heart failure is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs improve exercise time until claudication. Indications for lower extremity angioplasty, preferably with stenting, or bypass surgery are 1) incapacitating claudication in persons interfering with work or lifestyle; 2) limb salvage in persons with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, and/or infection or gangrene; and 3) vasculogenic impotence.

Pharmacological blockade of the RAAS offers potential for the therapeutic management of these pathologies. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor blockers have been shown to exhibit effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension. AII receptor blockers have a renal protective effect owing to their ability to reduce systemic blood and intraglomerular pressures. Eprosartan is a chemically distinct AII blocker, which displays a dual mode of action whereby it blocks both pre- and postsynaptic AT(1) receptors, potentially benefiting patients with hypertension and renal disease. In addition, evidence suggests that eprosartan is well tolerated by both healthy subjects and patients with varying degree of renal impairment, such that the dose does not need to be modified in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Results from preliminary studies demonstrates that eprosartan doses will below those required for blood pressure control have a pronounced effect on the kidney and do not compromise renal autoregulatory mechanisms. Therefore, eprosartan may have a benefit in the prevention or delay of renal damage in hypertensive patients with renal impairment, although this remains to be determined in a clinical setting.",

Thus, human glioblastoma cells produce renin and AGT and secrete AGT. Human glioblastoma and glioblastoma cells expressed renin, AGT, renin receptor, AT(2) and/or AT(1) mRNAs and proteins determined by RT-PCR and/or Western blotting, respectively. The function of the RAS in glioblastoma was studied using human glioblastoma cells in culture. Angiotensinogen, des(Ang I)AGT, tetradecapaptide renin substrate (AGT1-14), Ang I, Ang II or Ang III, added to glioblastoma cells in culture, did not modulate their proliferation, survival or death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors did not diminish glioblastoma cell proliferation. However, the addition of selective synthetic renin inhibitors to glioblastoma cells decreased DNA synthesis and viable tumour cell number, and induced apoptosis. This effect was not counterbalanced by concomitant addition of Ang II. In conclusion, the complete RAS is expressed by human glioblastomas and glioblastoma cells in culture. Inhibition of renin in glioblastoma cells may be a potential approach to control glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival, and glioblastoma progression in combination therapy.",

Also IVCYC had a higher frequency of side effects including infections (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.001-2.47), and gastrointestinal side effects (RR = 14.6; 95% CI, 2.15-99.68). We concluded that IVCYC was effective in mild and moderate PH associated with SLE. Further research is needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy.", 
    "394": "First experimental data regarding potential effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and their usefulness in clinical management of cardiovascular diseases have been reported more than 30 years ago. The two principals pharmacologic innovations are represented by the solid established angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers, lately introduced and not enough tested in well-conducted trials; in particular, it's very interesting the hypothesis of their impact in clinical practice not only in case of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors intolerance but as first choice or associated therapy in the treatment of heart failure, a very complex physiopathologic condition in which renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role and so its both enzymatic and receptorial inhibition could be particularly useful. With this review we present an up to date of knowledges, completed trials results and ongoing trials perspectives, to redefine actual indications and to profile main future develops of this drugs.", 
    "395": "Deep ultra-violet circular dichroism is fast becoming an important technique in structural biology. The exponential increase in the number of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank together with programs that extract protein secondary structure from atomic coordinates and the advancement of the software to analyse circular dichroic spectra, have revolutionised the technique. In addition, the extended short wavelength data afforded by synchrotron radiation is set to have a major impact on the development of the area. We have selected three diverse areas of research and development in the biomedical sciences to illustrate the ubiquity of the technique for future applications in the area of biomedical research. For example, the high flux of synchrotron radiation has provided a gold standard for the assay of the lipoprotein HDL in serum which has been proven to reverse the effects of coronary heart disease. In a second example, the high flux of synchrotron radiation enables the recording of millisecond data during the conformational changes in proteins over their spectrum, mapping out changes to protein secondary structure and thus providing absolute structural measurements in the millisecond time regime. In the third example, subtle conformational changes are interpreted from the extended CD spectra on protein drug binding, distinguishing between induced binding effects and the conformational changes in the target protein. The strengths and weaknesses of extended ultra-violet circular dichroism using synchrotron radiation are discussed using these examples as a template.",

    "400": "The hemorphins are a family of opioid receptor-binding peptides originating from the beta-chain of hemoglobin and have been found at high levels within the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition to opioid receptor binding, hemorphins have been shown to have a number of effects on the renin-angiotensin system, including inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin IV receptor binding. However, relatively few studies have examined the role of hemorphins in neurological diseases. Here we report the first study of hemorphins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Quantitative MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was employed to assess levels of LVV and VV hemorphin-6 and -7 in 10 control and 10 AD brain tissue samples. LVV hemorphin-6 and total hemorphin levels were elevated in AD temporal neocortex but not in hippocampus, occipital lobe, or frontal lobe. The elevation of hemorphins is probably indicative of a vascular abnormality resulting from cerebral amyloid angiopathy associated with both neurodegenerative disease and aging.", 
    "401": "The distinction between primary and secondary prevention has been abandoned in favor of cardiovascular prevention, mandating individual risk assessment. First, the individual cardiovascular risk of a person is determined by index diseases like myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or other, or, if absent, by a score consisting of a number of conventional risk factors. According to current guidelines, cardiovascular prevention is indicated, as soon as the risk for fatal cardiovascular disease is > or = 5 %, equivalent to a risk for a major cardiovascular event of > or = 20 %. Non-pharmaceutical approaches are: refraining from smoking, mediterranean diet with fatty fish, physical activity and normal body weight. Blood pressure and diabetes mellitus are optimized. In addition, the following agents are used: platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, statins and omega-3 fatty acids. A number of structural problems add to individual factors impeding optimal implementation of cardiovascular prevention in Germany.",

However, during the first year of treatment, the rate of change in LVESWS was greater in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (-8.59 v 1.85 g/cm(2); P =.033) and this difference was maintained over the study period, resulting in a 9% reduction in estimated LVESWS by year 5 in the enalapril group. Six of seven patients removed from random assignment to treatment because of cardiac deterioration were initially treated with placebo (P =.11), and one has died as a result of heart failure. Side effects from enalapril included dizziness or hypotension (22% v 3% in the placebo group; P =.0003) and fatigue (10% v 0%; P =.013).", 
    "405": "Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year; this reduction was maintained over the study period.

    "406": "Observational studies conducted among Asian populations suggest that the risk of pneumonia is substantially reduced among users of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but not other blood pressure-lowering agents. We conducted analyses of the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on pneumonia in 6,105 patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack enrolled in a randomized trial conducted in Australasia, Europe, and Asia. Patients were randomly assigned perindopril-based active treatment or placebo. The effects of ACE inhibitors on pneumonia (fatal or nonfatal) were determined from Cox models fitted according to the principle of intention to treat. During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 261 patients developed pneumonia. Overall, active treatment was associated with a nonsignificant 19% lower risk of pneumonia (95% confidence interval, -3 to 37; p = 0.09) compared with placebo. Active treatment significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia among participants of Asian ethnicity (47%, 14-67%; p = 0.01), with no significant effect among non-Asian participants (5%, -27 to 29%; p = 0.7) (p for homogeneity = 0.04). These findings substantially add to the body of evidence about the effects of these drugs on pneumonia but do not provide the definitive information required to inform clinical decisions about the prevention of pneumonia with ACE inhibitors.",

We describe a newborn with severe hypertension and proteinuria secondary to unilateral renal artery stenosis.

Although renin was not measured, we speculate that proteinuria might have been induced by a high renin state, and was controlled by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "408": "The present work reports for the first time a simple and rapid method for the spectrofluorimetric determination of lisinopril (LSP) in pharmaceutical formulations using sequential injection analysis (SIA). The method is based on reaction of LSP with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (borate buffer medium, pH=10.6). The emission of the derivative is monitored at 455 nm upon excitation at 346 nm. The various chemical and physical conditions that affected the reaction were studied. The calibration curve was linear in the range 0.3-10.0 mg L(-1) LSP, at a sampling rate of 60 injections h(-1). Consumption of OPA reagent was significantly reduced compared with conventional flow injection (FI) systems, because only 50 microL of OPA was consumed per run. The method was found to be adequately precise ( s(r)=2% at 5 mg L(-1) LSP, n=10) and the 3 sigma detection limit was 0.1 mg L(-1). The method was successfully applied to the analysis of two pharmaceutical formulations containing LSP. The results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained by use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), because the mean relative error, e(r), was <1.8%.", 
    "409": "Aldosterone is well recognized as a cause of sodium reabsorption, water retention, and potassium and magnesium loss; however, it also produces a variety of other actions that lead to progressive target organ damage in the heart, vasculature, and kidneys. Aldosterone interacts with mineralocorticoid receptors to promote endothelial dysfunction, facilitate thrombosis, reduce vascular compliance, impair baroreceptor function, and cause myocardial and vascular fibrosis. Although angiotensin II has been considered the major mediator of cardiovascular damage, increasing evidence suggests that aldosterone may mediate and exacerbate the damaging effects of angiotensin II. While angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers reduce plasma aldosterone levels initially, aldosterone rebound, or 'escape' may occur during long-term therapy. Therefore, aldosterone blockade is required to reduce the risk of progressive target organ damage in patients with hypertension and heart failure. This may be achieved nonselectively with spironolactone or with use of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone. While both agents have been demonstrated to be effective antihypertensive agents, eplerenone may produce improved target organ protection as witnessed in a variety of clinical settings, without the antiandrogenic and progestational effects commonly observed with spironolactone.", 
    "410": "Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease secreted from mast cells. Mammalian chymases are classified into two subgroups (alpha and beta) according to structure and substrate specificity; human chymase is an alpha-chymase. An important action of chymase is the ACE-independent conversion of Ang I to Ang II, but chymase also degrades the extracellular matrix, activates TGF-beta1 and IL-1beta, forms 31-amino acid endothelins and is involved in lipid metabolism. Under physiological conditions, the role of chymase in blood vessels is uncertain. In pathological situations, however, chymase may be important. In animal models of hypertension and atherosclerosis, chymase may be involved in lipid deposition and intimal and smooth muscle hyperplasia, at least in some vessels. In addition, chymase has pro-angiogenic properties. In human diseased blood vessels (e.g. atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aorta; remodeled pulmonary blood vessels), there are increases in chymase-containing mast cells and/or in chymase-dependent conversion of Ang I to Ang II. These findings have raised the possibility that inhibition of chymase may have a role in the therapy of vascular disease. The effects of chymase can theoretically be attenuated either by reducing availability of the enzyme, with a mast cell stabiliser, or alternatively with specific chymase inhibitors. The mast cell stabiliser, tranilast, was shown to be beneficial in animal models of atherosclerosis, where a prevention protocol was used, but was not effective in clinical trials where it was administered after angioplasty. Chymase inhibitors could have the advantage of being effective even if used after injury. Several orally active inhibitors, including SUN-C8257, BCEAB, NK3201 and TEI-E548, are now available. These have yet to be tested in humans, but promising results have been obtained in animal models of atherosclerosis and angiogenesis. It is concluded that orally active inhibitors of chymase may have a place in the treatment of vascular diseases where injury-induced mast cell degranulation contributes to the pathology.",

    "432": "Recent evidence points to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as one of the systems involved in the etiology of micro- and macrovascular disease in diabetic patients. To help elucidate this possibility, the effect of daily treatment with enalapril (25 mg/kg/d) was evaluated in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats at 2 weeks following the induction of diabetes. Untreated diabetic rats and non-diabetic rats that were age-matched were used for comparison. Vascular studies included the determination of aortic ring responses to norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and acetylcholine (Ach). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), cardiac output (CO) indices, plasmatic and vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and thickness of the aortic wall were also assessed. Enalapril improved Ach-induced relaxation by increasing the maximal relaxation from 54.3 +/- 4.3% in untreated diabetic rats to 89.8 +/- 6.2% (n=9, p<0.05) and by decreasing the EC50 value from 32.6 +/- 9.9 nmol/l in untreated diabetic animals to 17.9 +/- 5.1 nmol/l (n=8, p<0.05). In addition, enalapril normalized the high responses to NE found in diabetic rats without inducing changes in the EC50 value. A significant reduction in SBP (from 158 +/- 4 mm Hg to 123 +/- 1 mm Hg, p<0.05), combined with an improved CO index (from 40 +/- 2 ml/min x 100 g BW to 50 +/- 1 ml/min x 100 g BW), was observed in the enalapril-treated diabetic group. A significant regression of the media thickness was also observed in the aorta of diabetic rats after treatment. ACE activity in the aorta of diabetic rats, that was doubled compared to controls (p<0.05), decreased after enalapril treatment. These results point to the vascular RAS as one of the key systems in the etiology of vascular alterations at early stages of diabetes. Therefore, ACE inhibitors, as well as other pharmacological approaches targeting the vascular RAS, should be considered in the treatment of diabetic patients from the very early stages of the condition.", 
    "433": "We have studied the effect of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. A sequential euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure was used (insulin infusion rates: 3 and 30 mU/kg BW/min) in 30 diabetic rats. The rats were divided in 6 groups: a control group, a control group with N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 1 mg/kg/min, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) infusion, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic group, a diabetic group with L-NMMA infusion, a diabetic group involving imidapril infusion (5 microg/kg/min), and a diabetic group involving simultaneous imidapril and L-NMMA infusion. Glucose concentrations were maintained around 140 mg/dl during the clamp studies. Plasma insulin levels during the 3 and 30 mU/kg BW/min insulin infusions were 30 and 400 microU/ml, respectively. Glucose infusion rates (GIR) in STZ-induced diabetic rats showed a significant decrease compared to controls. At both insulin infusion rates, imidapril-infused diabetic rats showed an increased GIR, compared with the saline infused ones. There was no significant difference in GIR between L-NMMA and saline infusion in diabetic rats. Simultaneous infusion of imidapril and L-NMMA did not significantly decrease GIR with low-dose insulin infusion, but the increase in GIR induced by imidapril with high-dose insulin infusion was impaired by 100 % by L-NMMA infusion in diabetic rats. These results suggest that imidapril may improve insulin action, in part, via nitric oxide.", 
    "434": "It has been shown that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its main inhibitor (PAI-I) have predictive value for therapy success in advanced breast cancer. Levels of the complex between uPA and PAI-I, formed when both molecules are in their active form, might have superior predictive power. Here, we investigate the association between levels of uPA:PAI-I complex and rate of response to first-line systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer. Tumor tissues of 170 patients with advanced breast cancer were analyzed for uPA:PAI-I complex concentrations using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The patients received either endocrine therapy (n=96) or chemotherapy (n=74) as first-line treatment after diagnosis of advanced disease. Of the endocrine treated patients, those with high levels of uPA:PAI-I complex showed a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with lower uPA:PAI-I complex levels (P=0.035). Furthermore, in the multivariate regression analysis a significant lower rate of response to first-line endocrine therapy was found in patients with high uPA:PAI-I complex levels compared to patients with low uPA:PAI-I complex levels (odds ratio (OR)=0.27, 95% CI, 0.09-0.59, P=0.018), in addition to the predictive impact of the steroid hormone receptor (ER/PgR) status (OR=2.68, 95% CI, 1.08-6.63, P=0.033). Complex levels did not predict efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. The results show that the plasminogen activation system affects the response to endocrine therapy independent of steroid hormone receptor status and may be of help to further refine the indication for this treatment in individual patients. Further studies are warranted to explain this underlying resistance to endocrine therapy when uPA:PAI-I levels are high.",

    "436": "Prevalence of isolated left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction has been reported to be as high as one-third of all heart failure (HF) cases, with an increasing prevalence in the elderly population. However, there is a paucity of prospective data about the prevalence and prognosis of isolated LV diastolic dysfunction in an unselected population of patients hospitalized with HF. Therefore, we prospectively evaluated 179 consecutive patients discharged from our hospital with HF to assess the prevalence of systolic versus diastolic LV dysfunction among patients hospitalized with HF and to compare their demographics, clinical features, self-perceived quality of life (QOL), and 6-month readmission rate and mortality. Among them, 133 (59% men, median age 74 years) showed in sinus rhythm and had no significant primary valvular disease. LV diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed on the basis of the European Study Group on Diastolic HF echocardiographic criteria. QOL was assessed at hospital discharge and 6-month follow-up visit using the Minnesota Living with HF questionnaire. Survival of patients with HF was compared with that of age- and sex-matched general population. In all, 29 patients (22%) had isolated LV diastolic dysfunction and 102 (78%) had prevalent LV systolic dysfunction (ie, LV ejection fraction </= 45%). There was no difference in age, sex, or New York Heart Association functional class between patients with LV diastolic or systolic dysfunction. QOL scores were similar between the 2 patient groups with HF both at discharge (39.4 and 34) and at 6-month visit (10.4 and 10.4). Both 6-month readmission rate (48% and 48%) and median inhospital length-of-stay during readmissions (10 days and 10 days) were similar between the 2 patient groups with HF. Finally, 6-month survival, adjusted for age and sex, was similar between patients with LV diastolic or systolic dysfunction (hazard ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.20-2.35). Using standardized echocardiographic criteria, isolated LV diastolic dysfunction among unselected patients hospitalized with HF was less than previously reported. Patients with HF and isolated diastolic dysfunction showed similar clinical symptoms, self-perceived QOL, readmission rate, and 6-month mortality to patients with prevalent LV systolic dysfunction.", 
    "437": "Much evidence indicates increased sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) in renal disease. Renal ischemia is probably a primary event leading to increased SNA. Increased SNA often occurs in association with hypertension. However, the deleterious effect of increased SNA on the diseased kidney is not only caused by hypertension. Another characteristic of renal disease is unbalanced nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin (Ang) activity. Increased SNA in renal disease may be sustained because a state of NO-Ang II unbalance is also present in the hypothalamus. Very few studies have directly compared the efficacy of adrenergic blockade with other renoprotective measures. Third-generation beta-blockers seem to have more protective effects than traditional beta-blockers, possibly via stimulation of NO release. Although it has been extensively documented that muscle SNA is increased in chronic renal failure, data on renal SNA and cardiac SNA are not available for these patients before end-stage renal disease. It is also unknown whether additional treatment with third-generation beta-blockers can delay the progression of renal injury and prevent cardiac injury in chronic renal failure more efficiently than conventional treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors only.", 
    "438": "A new method for determination of first-order elimination constants for dipeptides is presented. The peptides are hydrolysed by plasma enzymes into amino acids, and ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) is used to react with free primary amino groups. The concentration of free amino groups can, thus, be followed using simple spectrophotometry. A mathematical model for the concentration of free primary amino groups with time is presented through which the elimination constant, and thus the half life, can be determined by curve fitting. The method is applied to inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme derived from the primary structure of milk proteins. The results show that these dipeptides have in vitro half lives ranging from 4.3-64 min, when incubated with 50% rat plasma. This explains why these casokinins in vivo only cause a very moderate and short-lasting inhibition. The model for calculation of elimination constant is limited to dipeptides that do not contain a C-terminal proline. The derivatization method can be applied to longer peptides as a crude indicator of peptide hydrolysis, but does not allow calculation of their elimination constants per se.", 
    "439": "The use of statins has been associated with substantial reductions in vascular morbidity and mortality.

PPP revealed a highly significant relative risk reduction in total mortality, and demonstrated that pravastatin has a similar incidence of muscle-related side effects as placebo. It has been speculated that treatment with statins in combination with other cardiovascular drugs may have a synergistic effect on reduction of cardiovascular complications. However, for ethical reasons, evidence can only ever be sought from sub-group analyses or meta-analyses of existing studies. Recent studies have focused on statins plus acetyl- salicylic acid (ASA, aspirin). Evidence suggests that a combination of statins with ASA provides a cardiovascular risk reduction that is superior to the respective monotherapy. Thus, statins effectively reduce further cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as total mortality in patients with manifest coronary artery disease (CAD) or at high risk, also they act in synergy with ASA and they are safe.",

A single 20 mg oral dose of lisinopril was administrated and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared. Lisinopril plasma concentrations were measured by a fully validated LC-MS method. The parametric 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean values of the test/reference ratios were 95.38% to 105.94% (point estimate: 100.52%) for AUC(0-last), 94.01% to 103.47% (point estimate: 98.63%) for AUC(0-infinity) and 92.34% to 103.97% (point estimate: 97.98%) for Cmax, being within the acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (80%-125%). T(1/2), k(el) and Tmax values were also tested and the difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, it is concluded that the test and the reference lisinopril formulations are bioequivalent both in the extent and the rate of absorption.", 
    "441": "Sympathetic hyperactivity plays an important and distinct role in hypertension associated with chronic renal failure (CRF). Renal ischemia, elevated angiotensin II, and suppressed brain nitric oxide (NO) all stimulate sympathetic activity. Evidence is accumulating for a role of sympathetic hyperactivity in renal and cardiac damage in patients with CRF. Decreased NO availability and increased oxidative stress, characteristic in CRF patients, seem to sensitize target organs for damaging actions of sympathetic hyperactivity. Fortunately, sympatholytic agents can slow down progression of renal and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists suppress sympathetic activity, but complete elimination of the effect of sympathetic hyperactivity can be obtained only with specific adrenergic blockers. However, this important therapeutic option is grossly neglected, painfully illustrated by the unwillingness to treat CRF patients with beta-blockers, even if they have had a myocardial infarction. After discussion of mechanisms and effects of the sympathetic hyperactivity, a case is made for increased application of specific adrenergic blockers in patients with CRF.", 
    "442": "This review focuses on the association between mild renal insufficiency (stage 2 and 3 of chronic kidney disease) and cardiovascular disease and discusses therapeutic options. Although the association of chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular risk was first shown in patients with end-stage renal disease, even minor renal dysfunction is now established as an independent risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The association has been established in patients with a high cardiovascular risk but also in the general population. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency. Coronary revascularization improves the prognosis in patients with minor renal dysfunction, but there is still an underutilization of coronary revascularization procedures in people with renal insufficiency. The use of coronary stenting has now reduced the incidence of restenosis in these patients, and there is hope that the development of new devices will improve the prognosis in patients with renal insufficiency as well. Nevertheless, people with cardiovascular disease and renal insufficiency die significantly more often than people without renal insufficiency independent of prior successful treatment. Further investigations should focus on the causes of and possible preventive interventions for the staggering cardiovascular risk in the ever-increasing number of people with minor renal dysfunction.", 
    "443": "Our earlier studies showed that bleomycin-induced apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) requires the autocrine synthesis and proteolytic processing of angiotensinogen into ANG II and that inhibitors of ANG-converting enzyme (ACEis) block bleomycin-induced apoptosis (Li X, Zhang H, Soledad-Conrad V, Zhuang J, and Uhal BD. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 284: L501-L507, 2003). Given the documented role of cathepsin D (CatD) in apoptosis of other cell types, we hypothesized that CatD might be the AEC enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensinogen into ANG I, the substrate for ACE. Primary cultures of rat type II AECs challenged with bleomycin in vitro showed upregulation and secretion of CatD enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein but no increases in CatD mRNA. The aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, which completely blocked CatD enzymatic activity, inhibited bleomycin-induced nuclear fragmentation by 76% and reduced bleomycin-induced caspase-3 activation by 47%. Antisense oligonucleotides against CatD mRNA reduced CatD-immunoreactive protein and inhibited bleomycin-induced nuclear fragmentation by 48%. A purified fragment of angiotensinogen (F1-14) containing the CatD and ACE cleavage sites, when applied to unchallenged AEC in vitro, yielded mature ANG II peptide and induced apoptosis. The apoptosis induced by F1-14 was inhibited 96% by pepstatin A and 77% by neutralizing antibodies specific for CatD (both P < 0.001). These data indicate a critical role for CatD in bleomycin-induced apoptosis of cultured AEC and suggest that the role(s) of CatD in AEC apoptosis include the conversion of newly synthesized angiotensinogen to ANG II.", 
    "444": "More than 186,000 strokes occur every year in Italy, responsible for 10-12% of total mortality. Despite the reduction in mortality and disability, the incidence of stroke is persistently high and mortality within the first month is about 30%; furthermore, the severe residual disability is about 40% in survivors. Large clinical outcome trials have defined the strict correlation between stroke and systolic and diastolic hypertension, and several meta-analyses and intervention studies showed that reduction of blood pressure, independently of the drug used (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), decreases significantly (> or = 30%) stroke mortality and morbidity in hypertensives. Despite numerous and effective antihypertensive drugs, stroke mortality and morbidity in hypertensive subjects remain persistently higher than in normotensive ones. Two recent clinical studies confirmed the great efficacy of angiotensin II antagonists in reducing stroke relative risk in hypertensive patients at elevated cardiovascular risk. The LIFE study demonstrated that an active treatment is superior to another one in reducing the prefixed endpoint. This important result has conferred great expectancy on angiotensin II antagonists and on their possible \"class effect\". Considering the recent intervention trials and the correct interpretation of the evidence-based medicine, we should not consider all principles as belonging to the same category, equally effective in the prevention of cardiovascular risk. The concept of \"class effect\" has not a real scientific value and cannot replace the experimental results of clinical studies which represent the only bench test for the efficacy of a drug.",

Coronary artery vasospasm is the pathogenetic mechanism hypothesized in most cases, but mechanisms other than myocardial ischemia had been advocated in some patients. The approach to the patient with persistent chest pain, despite therapy and persistent ST-segment elevation mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, has not been well addressed, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways have not yet been defined. We present our experience regarding 2 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil and referred to our coronary care unit because of prolonged chest pain (in one case with clinical evidence of hemodynamic impairment) and persistent ST-segment elevation, in whom an acute myocardial infarction was suspected. One patient was treated with systemic fibrinolysis, and coronary angiography was performed 6 days later; the other was submitted to urgent coronary angiography shortly after admission. In both cases the ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities were transient and normalized within a few days, the serum markers of myocardial necrosis were persistently in the normal range and the coronary artery trees were normal.

Four episodes were associated with ACE-inhibitor cough. There was a trend towards HMGCoA reductase inhibitor (statin) use being associated with a delayed onset of vitreous haemorrhage: 21.4 years until vitreous haemorrhage (treatment group) vs 16.2 years (nontreatment group) (P = 0.09, two-tailed, unpaired t-test, not statistically significant). During follow-up 56 recurrences occurred, making a total of 110 episodes of vitreous haemorrhage in 79 eyes of 54 patients.

Age, gender, diabetes type (I or II) or control, presence of hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia, and macrovascular complications were not associated with a significant effect on the 1-year recurrence rate. Aspirin (and other antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents) and ACE- inhibitors appeared to neither increase nor decrease the 1-year recurrence rate. However, statin use was significantly associated with a reduction in recurrence (Fisher exact P < 0.05; two-tailed) with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.25 (0.1-0.95).",

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the way of proliferative retinopathy (PDR) and macular oedema (ME) is the commonest cause of new cases of legal blindness in Europe as in North America in the age group 30 to 70-74 years. DR is due to microangiopathy affecting the retinal precapillary arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Detection of the earliest signs of DR is an essential requirement of diabetics care leading to early preventive and treatment strategies which can arrest progression of this serious consequence of diabetes. Glycemic control and stricter control of hypertension have a clear effect on the development of the microvascular complications of diabetes like DR, while treatment options of severe non proliferative and proliferative forms of DR are limited to laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy. Photocoagulation has proven efficacy in slowing down the progression of DR and vitrectomy can prevent vision loss in case of advanced DR.

Animal studies have used, generally, the rat as a model species to illustrate the association between maternal nutrient intake and blood pressure in the resulting adult offspring. No study to date has shown programming of adult cardiovascular function in the sheep through maternal dietary intervention. We therefore fed pregnant sheep to either 100% recommended intake from day 0 of gestation to term [ approximately 147 days gestational age (dGA); controls n = 8] or to 50% recommended intake from day 0 to 95 dGA and thereafter to 100% intake (NR; n = 9). Sheep lambed naturally, offspring were weaned at 16 wk, and the male offspring were reared on pasture until 3 yr of age. At this time, cardiovascular catheters were inserted under halothane anesthesia and sheep were allowed 2-4 days recovery. Basal cardiovascular status and pressor responses to infusion of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and captopril were then assessed alongside basal plasma concentrations of glucose, cortisol, and leptin. NR sheep were of similar birth weight to controls but at 3 yr of age had higher blood pressure before, but not after, feeding. Peripheral sensitivity to vasoconstrictor infusion was similar between dietary groups, although a reflex bradycardia was not apparent in NR sheep during norepinephrine infusion. Circulating leptin correlated well with fat mass and increased more after vasoconstrictor infusion in NR sheep. In conclusion, early NR has been shown to program aspects of cardiovascular control and adipocyte function in adult sheep.",

Unilateral and bilateral renal artery stenosis may be responsible for secondary hypertension. Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis are of a great importance. Revascularization of ischemic kidney may correct blood pressure control and preserve renal function. Much data suggest close pathophysiological relation between renal artery stenosis, ischemic nephropathy and development of hypertension. However, it should be stressed that not every renal artery stenosis leads to hypertension and ischemic nephropathy. Therefore diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in hypertensive patient is not always equivalent with renovascular hypertension. The true prevalence of renal artery stenosis is unknown. In unselected population it accounts for less than 1% of hypertensive patients. Renovascular etiology of hypertension may be suggested by abrupt onset of hypertension, resistant and malignant hypertension or recurrent pulmonary edema of unknown etiology. Physical examination may reveal bruits over major vessels, including the abdominal aorta and renal arteries. The principle aim of the renal artery stenosis investigation is to confirm presence and size of vessel obstruction and its association with hypertension. Typical evaluation is based on imaging techniques and physiological studies. Former include: doppler duplex ultrasonography, conventional angiography, intraarterial and intravenous digital subtraction angiography, computed axial tomography, magnetic resonance angiography and intravascular ultrasonography. Functional studies are occasionally used. These are renal scintigraphy, evaluation of plasma renin activity in renal veins and evaluation of plasma rennin activity after ACE inhibition. Treatment of patients with renal artery stenosis and hypertension should restore vessel patency and inhibit its occlusion. Revascularization should elicit an improvement in or normalization of blood pressure control and renal function. Therapeutic approach include percutaneous renal artery angioplasty (PTRA), with or without stenting, revascularization by surgery and pharmacotherapy. PTRA is currently the first choice option. In general, it is simpler and similarly effective as surgical reconstruction. In some cases PTRA is completed with stent placement. It prevents immediate recoil but does not completely eliminate restenosis of revascularized artery. Surgical bypass is currently reserved for patients in whom PTRA and stenting fail and in patients with extensive atherosclerotic lesions. Patients with renal artery stenosis and hypertension should be provided with pharmacological treatment according to current recommendations. Specific procedures to limit associated risk factors of atherosclerosis should also be introduced.",

In addition, few preliminary experiments showed that the contractile effects of pepstatin A were inhibited by the pretreatment with losartan, an antagonist of AT1 angiotensin receptors. Pepstatin A-induced contractile effects on isolated rat aorta were inhibited with high potency by captopril, chymostatin and amastatin and were totally blocked by captopril + amastatin and captopril + chymostatin. Finally, we concluded that the pepstatin A-induced contractile effects on isolated rat aorta rings are dependent on an angiotensinogen vascular pool, compulsory involve an angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) mediated pathway and one or more non-classical pathways for the generation of angiotensin peptides. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms associated to pepstatin A-induced effects.",

Basing on the cytokine's concentrations, the level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in the patient's blood and their changes in time we can predict the progression of the disease. Known medical references emphasise the fact that the pharmacological modification of inflammatory markers (interleukins, TNF-alfa, CRP) can have significant clinical consequences and in some cases can even cause regression of pathological symptoms. CRP plays an important role in the development and progression CHF and can be the clinical predictor not only in the cases of coronary disease but also can be useful in the group of patients with CHF.

This multicentre, double-blind, parallel study included 97 hypertensive patients (office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-109 mmHg and daytime DBP > 85 mmHg). After a 2- to 3-week period of single-blind placebo, they were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with E/N (n = 48) or L/H (n = 49) for a 4-week period. The primary outcome measure was the difference in 24-h DBP reduction between treatments from randomization to the end of the double-blind period. Secondary efficacy variables included differences in 24-h systolic (S) BP reduction, daytime, night-time and office SBP and DBP reduction, proportion of responders and controlled patients, trough-to-peak ratio and smoothness indexes. Safety was assessed by the proportion of patients with adverse events and the detection of laboratory abnormalities. No significant differences were observed in the primary outcome measure. The group receiving E/N tended to show greater reductions in most measures (24 h, daytime and office SBP and DBP) and higher BP control rates, but only the difference in the rate of office SBP control (< 140 mmHg) reached statistical significance (42.2 vs 22.4%; P = 0.048). The trough-to-peak ratios and smoothness indexes were similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events related to the treatment was 27.1% (95% CI 14.5-39.6%) in E/N-treated patients and 14.3% (95% CI 4.5-45.8%) in the L/H group, but differences were not significant. The kind of event more frequently observed were flushing and headache in E/N, and dizziness and asthenia in L/H; all observed adverse events were mild. We conclude that E/N and L/H have a similar antihypertensive efficacy, assessed by office or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. E/N achieved a significantly higher office SBP control rate, but this was accompanied by an apparently higher proportion of mild adverse events.",

Since yohimbine blocks alpha 2-adrenoceptors and prazosin blocks alpha 1-adrenoceptors and alpha 2B-adrenoceptors, the stress-induced renal sodium reabsorption mainly could be attributed to alpha 2B-adrenoceptors. The present results indicate that beta-adrenoceptors do not participate in this response and, Ang II only reverses the antidiuresis and shows a slight participation in antinatriuresis. The increment in sodium and water reabsorption caused by IMO occurred without changes in the glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "485": "Since a few case reports have demonstrated some beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in migraine prevention, we were interested in studying the impact of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (Ang II) on the consumption of specific abortive migraine drugs and, therefore, indirectly on the frequency of migraine attacks.", 
    "486": "Data from a large prescription database involving 95 patients initiating a specific abortive migraine drug (ergotamine or a triptan) and subsequently treated with either an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist (index group: ACE/Ang II) or diuretic (reference group) were analysed. The effects of ACE/Ang II inhibition as well as diuretic therapy on reducing the frequency of migraine attacks were assessed by measuring the mean consumption of abortive migraine drug use, in DDDs per month ('therapeutic intensity'), before, during and after ACE/Ang II or diuretic therapy. A 'therapeutic fluctuation intensity estimate' of abortive migraine drug use for all patients was likewise calculated.", 
    "487": "On an individual level, the therapeutic intensity (TI) fluctuation estimate, 'during' relative to 'before' ACE diuretic therapy, was significantly larger for the ACE/Ang II group (62% reduction) than for the diuretic group (24% reduction) (p = 0.02). For patients who continued abortive migraine drug use during and after ACE/Ang II or diuretic therapy, a significantly larger reduction in this estimate was observed during ACE/Ang II inhibition (68.9%) compared to during diuretic therapy (10.5% increase) (p = 0.004). The TI fluctuation estimate, after relative to 'during', had increased by 50.3% after ACE/Ang II inhibition and had reduced by 22.2% after diuretic treatment (p = 0.1).", 
    "488": "A clear reduction in the TI of abortive migraine drug use during the use of ACE inhibitors as compared to diuretic treatment was observed. Our findings may indirectly support a positive effect of ACE/Ang II inhibition on the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, as observed in other studies and reports.", 
    "489": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates renal vasomotor activity, maintains optimal salt and water homeostasis, and controls tissue growth in the kidney. However, pathologic consequences can result from overactivity of this cascade, involving it in the pathophysiology of kidney disease. An activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system promotes both systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension, which can induce hemodynamic injury to the vascular endothelium and glomerulus. In addition, direct profibrotic and proinflammatory actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone may also promote kidney damage. The majority of the untoward effects associated with angiotensin II appear to be mediated through its binding to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Aldosterone can also induce renal injury by binding to its receptor in the kidney. An understanding of this system is important to appreciate that inhibitors of this cascade can reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease in proteinuric disease states. Pharmacologic agents that can interfere with this cascade include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists. This paper will provide an overview of the renin-angiotensin system, review its role in kidney disease, examine the renal effects of inhibition of this cascade in experimental animal models, and review clinical studies utilizing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies.", 
    "490": "A novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide (RMLGQTPTK; 9mer) from porcine skeletal troponin C was investigated for its inhibitory profile. This peptide was noncompetitive and as hydrophobic as the known ACE inhibitory peptides. Aminopeptidase M quickly hydrolyzed 9mer, resulting in production of MLGQTPTK and LGQTPTK with inhibitory activities similar to those of 9mer. The main hydrolysis product of 9mer with carboxypeptidase A and B was RMLGQTPT showing very weak activity. Most products derived from 9mer hydrolysis by ACE, aminopeptidase, or carboxypeptidase showed weak but definite ACE inhibitory activities. Thus, 9mer was estimated to be a wholly efficient inhibitor with these fragment peptides.", 
    "491": "Cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death in the Western world, results mainly from atherosclerotic remodeling of the arterial system. Atherosclerosis defines a disease in which the arterial wall becomes thickened and loses elasticity. This is clearly not a static condition. Instead, atherogenesis reflects a continuous development over time, ranging from macroscopically intact arteries to ruptured sclerotic plaques. Different stages at different sites can be present simultaneously within one individual. The pathophysiology of atherogenesis comprises various important steps, including enhanced endothelial permeability, expression of adhesion molecules, monocyte adhesion and immigration, foam cell formation, fatty streaks, smooth muscle cell migration and plaque formation, and, finally, plaque rupture and thrombus formation. In recent years, atherosclerosis is more and more being recognized as a chronic inflammatory process. The hypothesis of a chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis is supported by the following findings: atherosclerosis is associated with enhanced serum levels of inflammation parameters, including in particular C-reactive protein (CRP, Table 1); the atherosclerotic artery produces different hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and growth factors as seen in chronic inflammation; cells found in early atherosclerotic lesions are typically inflammatory cells (monocytes/ macrophages and T-lymphocytes); and, there is convincing clinical and experimental evidence that formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is augmented during this chronic inflammatory process due to an imbalance between synthesis of ROS and neutralizing antioxidative defense mechanisms. Studies in the general population could clearly show that markers of inflammation, in particular CRP, predict the cardiovascular risk. It is the aim of this review to discuss the role of inflammatory processes for the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Pro-inflammatory substances contributing to oxidative stress are listed in Table 2, and particular emphasis is placed on pathophysiologic effects induced by oxidized LDL and angiotensin II. Figure 1 summarizes important reaction steps of oxidative stress reactions, based on formation of superoxide anion (O(2)(-)). Finally, therapeutic options are presented, although it has to be emphasized that treatment with antibiotics proved to be essentially ineffective, and treatment options with antioxidants are not sufficiently evaluated to allow a final statement. Meanwhile, however, there is accumulating evidence that established treatment regimens with statins or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors possess profound anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties which may support their beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease.",

Of the three drugs recommended for secondary prevention, overall utilization rates for beta-blockers were highest in Nova Scotia, lowest in British Columbia, and similar in Quebec and Ontario. Rates for ACE inhibitors were highest in Ontario and similar in Quebec, Nova Scotia and British Columbia. Rates for statins were slightly higher in Quebec and British Columbia than in Ontario and Nova Scotia. The proportion of patients without a prescription for any of the recommended drugs was highest in British Columbia (20%), lowest in Nova Scotia (8%), and similar in Quebec and Ontario (Ontario: 12%; Quebec: 13%). There was marked regional variation in utilization rates within the four provinces.",

Four weeks after myocardial infarction, B(2)-/- mice and B(2)+/+ mice were started on vehicle, ACEi (ramipril, 2.5 mg/kg/d), NEPi (candoxatril, 20 mg/kg/d) or VPi (omapatrilat, 50 mg/kg/d), which was continued for 20 weeks.

Furthermore, the beneficial cardiac effects of ACEi, NEPi, and VPi were significantly attenuated in B(2)-/- mice. We concluded that dual inhibition of ACE and NEP with VPi provides better cardioprotection than ACEi or NEPi alone in mice with congestive heart failure induced by myocardial infarction, and these effects are mediated at least in part via kinins.", 
    "510": "Spironolactone, a nonselective aldosterone blocker, has a cardioprotective effect; however, significant endocrine side effects limit its use. Eplerenone is a new selective aldosterone blocker. We investigated whether eplerenone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves function in a mouse model of heart failure and whether coadministration of eplerenone and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) provides better cardioprotection than either agent alone.",

Two weeks later, the mice were either left untreated or treated with (1) eplerenone, (2) ACEi, or (3) eplerenone plus ACEi for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured and echocardiography performed before MI and weekly thereafter. At the end of the study, interstitial collagen fraction (ICF) and myocyte cross-sectional area (MCSA) were examined histologically. We found that (1) eplerenone significantly improved ejection fraction and cardiac output and decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic area, LV weight, ICF, and MCSA independently of changes in SBP compared with untreated animals; (2) ACEi had similar beneficial effects, accompanied by a significant reduction in SBP; and (3) combined treatment offered limited additional benefit beyond monotherapy.",

    "513": "Until recently elevated blood pressure was considered as a hemodynamic entity representing an increase in workload for the heart and the arterial tree. Control of hypertension meant hemodynamic unloading, through inhibition of vasoconstrictor pathways, principally renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic system. In recent years however a new pharmacological approach has evolved as a result of (i) the dissociation of endothelial dysfunction and vascular pathology from increased blood pressure; (ii) the recognition that endothelial dysfunction regards not only the vascular reactivity, but also promotes atherosclerosis and thrombosis; and (iii) an improved understanding of the complexity of local-tissue renin angiotensin system and of the vasodilatory and cytoprotective role of natriuretic peptides. This has led to a reconsideration of existing medicines in terms of specification on endothelial function, more rationalized application of drugs and search for new compounds targeting both vasodilatory and anti-proliferative pathways. Examples include beta1-adrenergic antagonists, such as Nebivolol and Carvedilol, and vasopeptidase inhibitors, such as Omapatrilat, that inhibit simultaneously the angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. Furthermore the identification of genetic polymorphisms in the effectors involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension or in the response to anti-hypertensive drugs, such as the p22phox subunit of NADPH oxidase, alpha-adducin or adrenergic receptors, has promoted the prospective of both better understanding of hypertension and individualized strategies for its treatment.", 
    "514": "Several clinical and experimental observations suggest that an intact and activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be an important determinant of erythropoiesis in a variety of clinical conditions, including hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency or failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure. Accordingly, RAS inactivation may confer susceptibility to the hematocrit-lowering effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Indeed, a dose-dependent decrease in hematocrit is observed within the first month of such therapy. In the majority of patients with hypertension decreases in hematocrit values after RAS inactivation are small and not clinically important. In extreme conditions, however, such as erythrocytosis after successful renal transplantation, secondary polycythemia of chronically hypoxemic COPD patients, erythrocytosis associated with renovascular hypertension, severe cardiac or renal failure, the hematocrit-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker may be profound and even lead to or worsen anemia. Hematocrit reaches its nadir value within three months, and then it remains stable during long-term observations. After discontinuation of RAS blockade, hematocrit values rise gradually over the next three to four months towards the pretreatment levels. The mechanism(s) related to this phenomenon is not yet fully understood, but angiotensin II seems to be responsible for inappropriately sustaining secretion of erythropoietin despite hematocrit elevation and capable to directly stimulate the erythroid progenitors in bone marrow to produce erythrocytes.", 
    "515": "The development of drugs which block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been proven a major advance in cardiovascular medicine. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of angiotensin II from the inactive angiotensin I, are widely used as first line treatment in hypertension, heart failure and diabetic nephropathy. More recently, selective antagonists of the angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) have become available for clinical use. Accumulating evidence suggests that AT1R antagonists have similar effects to ACE inhibitors in hypertension, heart failure and diabetic nephropathy. Although ACE inhibitors and AT1R antagonists block the same system, experimental evidence suggest that their mechanisms of action differ in several respects, such as increased bradykinin and angiotensin 1-7 levels with ACE inhibitors and AT2R activation with AT1R antagonists. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of these differences remains largely unknown and, in practice, the only clear advantage of AT1R antagonists over ACE inhibitors is the absence of cough as a side effect. Recent clinical data suggest that combined ACE inhibition and AT1R antagonism offer additive effects in reducing blood pressure in hypertension, in reducing proteinuria in nephropathy and in improving prognosis in heart failure. Further evidence suggests that some hypertensive patients may have a good antihypertensive response with ACE inhibition but not with AT1R antagonism, or the reverse. These data suggest that these two drug classes have important similarities, because they act on the same system, but they also appear to have important differences, which are not only of theoretical but also of clinical importance.", 
    "516": "Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme (ACE) is a Zinc Metallopeptidase of which the three-dimensional structure was unknown until recently, when the X-ray structure of testis isoform (C-terminal domain of somatic) was determined. ACE plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure due to its action in the frame of the Renin-Angiotensin System. Efforts for the specific inhibition of the catalytic function of this enzyme have been made on the basis of the X-ray structures of other enzymes with analogous efficacy in the hydrolytic cleavage of peptide substrate terminal fragments. Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme bears the sequence and topology characteristics of the well-known gluzincins, a sub-family of zincins metallopeptidases and these similarities are exploited in order to reveal common structural elements among these enzymes. 3D homology models are also built using the X-ray structure of Thermolysin as template and peptide models that represent the amino acid sequence of the ACE's two catalytic, zinc-containing sites are designed and synthesized. Conformational analysis of the zinc-free and zinc-bound peptides through high resolution 1H NMR Spectroscopy provides new insights into the solution structure of ACE catalytic centers. Structural properties of these peptides could provide valuable information towards the design and preparation of new potent ACE inhibitors.", 
    "517": "Possible mechanisms of influence of the angiotensinconverting enzyme in the calcigistia dynamics in the aorta and liver and lipid spectrum of the rat blood upon the long-live stress exposure were investigated. It is shown, that the blockade of the angiotensinconverting enzyme leads to the one-type changes of the calcium contents in organs studied, but with different quantity indicators. The contents of general cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins is intimately connected with the calcium contents in liver. Apparently, the results obtained mirror the most optimal mode of the cell survival in a long-term stress conditions, which are directly connected to a calcium homeostasis and its support by extra- and intracellular reserves.", 
    "518": "A 61-year-old patient who had been treated with lisinopril in the past without any problems was commenced on ramipril for left ventricular dysfunction. He developed a painful symmetrical purpuric eruption over both feet after three days. A full vasculitis screen was negative. Ramipril was stopped and he required a course of steroids after which the rash improved slowly. The ACE inhibitors can cause various skin side effects; however, it rarely causes cutaneous vasculitis. Ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis is particularly rare and our case was atypical because the patient had tolerated lisinopril before. Previous successful treatment with one ACE inhibitor does not rule out the vasculitis caused by the drug from the same group. Here we report ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis in a patient who required steroid therapy to control it.", 
    "519": "There are many different glomerular disorders, including glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. However, once glomerular damage reaches a certain threshold, the progression of renal disease is consistent and irreversible. Recent studies emphasized the crucial role of tubulointerstitial injury as a mediator of progression of kidney disease. One common mechanism that leads to renal failure via tubulointerstitial injury is massive proteinuria. Accumulating evidence suggests critical effects of filtered macromolecules on tubular cells, including lysosomal rupture, energy depletion, and tubular injury directly induced by specific components such as complement components. Another common mechanism is chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium. Tubulointerstitial damage results in the loss of peritubular capillaries, impairing blood flow delivery. Interstitial fibrosis also impairs oxygen diffusion and supply to tubular cells. This induces chronic hypoxia in this compartment, rendering a vicious cycle. Development of novel therapeutic approaches against these final common pathways will enable us to target any types of renal disease.",

MMF 15 mg/kg was used in combination with low-dose corticosteroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "522": "During 24 weeks of MMF therapy, no significant changes were detected in mean serum creatinine, albumin and proteinuria. Severe leukopenia was seen in 1 patient. Additional adverse effects, including nausea and diarrhea, were observed in another patient when the dosage was increased to 20 mg/kg per day. During MMF treatment proteinuria decreased slightly without remission in 6 of 10 patients.",

After the addition of internal standard, solid phase extraction was used as a cleaning step. To separate lisinopril and enalapril from interfering endogenous plasma substances, the analysis was performed using column switching valve. The quantitative determination was performed using selected ion monitoring (+)-electrospray LC-MS. A combination of an acidic mobile phase and a reverse phase column was used. A precision in the linear range from 10 to 500.0 ng/mL plasma, absolute recovery of 91.69% for lisinopril and 90.26% for enalapril, stability for 3.5 months at -20 degrees C have been achieved.

    "525": "The reductive decomposition of both SNAP and SNOCap by ascorbate in aqueous solution (in the presence of EDTA) was thoroughly investigated. Nitric oxide (NO) release from the reaction occurs in an ascorbate concentration and pH dependent manner. Rates and hence NO release increased drastically with increasing pH, signifying that the most highly ionized form of ascorbate is the more reactive species. The experiments were monitored spectrophotometrically, and second-order rate constants calculated at 37 degrees C for the reduction of SNAP are k(b)=9.81+/-1.39 x 10(-3) M(-1) s(-1) and k(c)=662+/-38 M(-1) s(-1) and for SNOCap are k(b)=2.57+/-1.29 x 10(-2) M(-1) s(-1) and k(c)=49.7+/-1.3 M(-1) s(-1). k(b) and k(c) are the second-order rate constants via the ascorbate monoanion (HA-) and dianion (A2-) pathways, respectively. Activation parameters were also calculated and are DeltaHb++ =93+/-7 kJ mol(-1), DeltaSb++ =15+/-2 J K(-1) mol(-1) and DeltaHc++ =51+/-5 kJ mol(-1), DeltaSc++ =-28+/-3 J K(-1) mol(-1) with respect to the reactions involving SNAP. Those for the reaction between SNOCap and ascorbate were calculated to be DeltaHb++ =63+/-11 kJ mol(-1), DeltaSb++ =-71+/-20 J K(-1) mol(-1) and DeltaHc++ =103+/-7 kJ mol(-1), DeltaSc++ =118+/-8 J K(-1) mol(-1). The effect of Cu2+/Cu+ ions on the reductive decompositions of these S-nitrosothiols was also investigated in absence of EDTA. SNOCap exhibits relatively high stability at near physiological conditions (37 degrees C and pH 7.55) even in the presence of micromolar concentrations of Cu2+, with decomposition rate constant being 0.011 M(-1) s(-1) in comparison to SNAP which is known to be more susceptible to catalytic decomposition by Cu2+ (second-order rate constant of 20 M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C). It was also observed that the reductive decomposition of SNAP is not catalyzed by alkali metal ions, however, there was an increase in rate as the ionic strength increases from 0.2 to 0.5 mol dm(-3) NaCl.", 
    "526": "A sponsor of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) must have information to show that the proposed generic product and the innovator product are both pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, and therefore, therapeutically equivalent. Many pharmaceutical solids exist in several crystalline forms and thus exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphism may result in differences in the physico-chemical properties of the active ingredient and variations in these properties may render a generic drug product to be bioinequivalent to the innovator brand. For this reason, in ANDAs, careful attention is paid to the effect of polymorphism in the context of generic drug product equivalency. This review discusses the impact of polymorphism on drug product manufacturability, quality, and performance. Conclusions from this analysis demonstrate that pharmaceutical solid polymorphism has no relevance to the determination of drug substance \"sameness\" in ANDAs. Three decision trees for solid oral dosage forms or liquid suspensions are provided for evaluating when and how polymorphs of drug substances should be monitored and controlled in ANDA submissions. Case studies from ANDAs are provided which demonstrate the irrelevance of polymorphism to the determination of drug substance \"sameness\". These case studies also illustrate the conceptual framework from these decision trees and illustrate how their general principles are sufficient to assure both the quality and the therapeutic equivalence of marketed generic drug products.", 
    "527": "Postinfarction hypertrophied hearts have been shown to display a lower capillary density and reduced mechanical efficiency amplified by tachycardia.

    "528": "Effects on in vivo heart rate were measured in conscious unrestrained rats, while in vitro heart rate effects were evaluated in isolated perfused hearts. Compared to sham-rats, MI-rats manifested a significant in vivo as well as in vitro tachycardia (increase 9% and 20% vs. sham, respectively). Whereas aspirin, methylprednisolone and moxonidine significantly reduced postinfarction in vivo tachycardia, captopril rather increased in vivo heart rate. In vitro tachycardia of MI-hearts was reduced to sham-values with aspirin and methylprednisolone (P<0.05), but not with moxonidine and captopril. Capillary density defined as the number of Lectin stained capillaries per tissue area, which significantly decreased in MI-hearts (decrease 42% vs. sham), was restored by all treatments (P<0.05). Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy after MI, defined as increased cross-sectional area of transversally cut Gomori stained myocytes, was indicated by almost double myocyte size (P<0.05), while capillary to myocyte ratio remained unchanged. Methylprednisolone, moxonidine and captopril, but not aspirin, prevented hypertrophy (P<0.05). However, treatment with aspirin and methylprednisolone, but not moxonidine and captopril, increased capillary to myocyte ratio (P<0.05) up to twice the values of non-treated MI hearts, indicating newly formed capillaries.",

Varying reports in the literature have suggested that African Americans respond less well to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but careful reanalysis of major clinical trials in heart failure, especially the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), demonstrates a similar mortality benefit for African Americans as for whites. Morbidity, measured as hospitalizations, may not be as favorably impacted. African Americans do respond to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as a preemptive strategy to prevent heart failure, but the incidence of heart failure is still higher in this population. Mechanisms for these potential nuances in the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not yet clear. The exaggerated benefit of nitrates and hydralazine implicates alterations in nitric oxide homeostasis. Race is an inadequate model to explain the observed differences. Careful translational research focusing on genetic patterns of disease may help resolve these outstanding questions.",

Perindopril reduced the primary end points of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest by 20% (p=0.0003). Moreover, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor reduced the rate of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 24% (p=0.001).

In contrast, hemodialysis was associated with decreased aortic PWV independent of renal failure and the other factors. Further analyses in the combined uremic patients again indicated the favorable impact of hemodialysis on aortic PWV independent of the classical risk factors, use of antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, hematocrit, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone levels, and the use of calcium carbonate.

Captopril treatment also retarded disease progression when given to lupus mice that had early disease, and even reversed severe proteinuria in at least some older animals with advanced disease. It reduced chronic renal lesions, but had no effect on autoantibody production. The improvement in renal disease correlated with reduced TGF-beta expression, particularly of the TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 isoforms, in the kidneys. Interestingly, in vivo or in vitro exposure to captopril reduced splenic levels of type 2 cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, suggesting a possible role of the immune system in captopril-mediated disease modulation.",

By contrast, Bcl-xL (apoptosis protector) was up-regulated in WKY + subtotal nephrectomy rats but not in spontaneously hypertensive rats + subtotal nephrectomy. The administration of appropriate doses of quinapril, losartan, or triple therapy to spontaneously hypertensive rats + subtotal nephrectomy normalized systolic blood pressure, partially prevented proteinuria, renal lesions and apoptosis, and decreased Bax, but no changes were noted in Bcl-xL.

The authors, and many of our colleagues, still believe that most patients clearly benefit from the judicious use of calcium antagonists. Reports of several large, powered prospective, randomized outcome studies including ALLHAT commend the use of long-acting calcium antagonists that, by virtue of their ability to attain more gradual and sustained plasma levels, do not evoke reactive sympathetic activation and consequently are safe. Concomitantly, such formulations should promote increased patient compliance and thereby favorably influence hypertension-related morbidity and mortality.", 
    "562": "Structural homogeneity of cardiac tissue is governed by mechanical and humoral factors that regulate cell growth, apoptosis, phenotype, and extracellular matrix turnover. ANGII has endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine properties that influence the behavior of cardiac cells and matrix by AT1 receptor binding. Various paradigms have been suggested, including ANGII-mediated up-regulation of collagen types I and III formation and deposition in cardiac conditions, such as HHD. A growing body of evidence, however, deals with the potential role of aldosterone, either local or systemic, in inducing cardiac fibrosis. Aldosterone might also mediate the profibrotic actions of ANGII. To reduce the risk of heart failure that accompanies HHD, its adverse structural remodeling (eg, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis) must be targeted for pharmacologic intervention. Cardioprotective agents must reverse not only the exaggerated growth of cardiac cells, but also regress existing abnormalities in fibrillar collagen. Available experimental and clinical data suggest that agents interfering with ACE, the AT1 receptor, or the mineralocorticoid receptor may provide such a cardioprotective effect.", 
    "563": "The RAAS is a powerful regulator of vascular tone and intravascular volume and of tissue architecture and a variety of other functions. The recent appreciation of the immunoregulatory role of angiotensin II and its possible involvement in the genesis of atherosclerosis and in plaque rupture all speak to the wide-ranging physiologic and pathophysiologic activities of the peptide. So do its actions in fat cell differentiation and in neuromodulation. The system exists in the circulation, and RAASs, whole or partial, exist in many tissues. These systems are regulated at many levels ranging from the synthesis of renin to the dimerization of angiotensin receptors. Regulation occurs in multiple tissues and, as a result, tissue concentrations of angiotensin II and the concentration of other RAS components and their active metabolites can vary independently of the circulating system in these tissues. An RAS seems also to function within certain cells. Therapeutic interventions involving ACEIs and ARBs seem likely to provide benefit at least in part through the interruption of local systems. It is to be expected that with enhanced understanding of the biology of the multiple RASs, new suggestions for therapeutic interventions will be forthcoming.", 
    "564": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. The angiotensin type-1 blocking and cardioprotective properties of perindopril and enalapril were studied in a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy after autoimmune myocarditis. Enalapril at 20 mg/kg showed the same angiotensin type-1 blocking action as perindopril at 2 mg/kg in rats with heart failure. Twenty-eight days after immunization, surviving Lewis rats (90/120 = 75%) were divided into six groups and administered perindopril at 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg per day (Groups P0.02, P0.2 and P2), enalapril at 2 and 20 mg/kg per day (Groups E2 and E20) or vehicle alone (Group V, all groups n = 15). After oral administration for 1 month, four of 15 (27%) rats in Group V, and two (13%) in Groups P0.02 and E2 died. None of the animals in Groups P0.2, P2 and E20, or normal rats (Group N) died. Although both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improved ventricular function in a dose-dependent manner, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and area of myocardial fibrosis were lower, and +/- dP/dt was higher in Group P2 (4.9 +/- 0.6 mmHg, 7.5 +/- 1.4% and +2651 +/- 254/-2622 +/- 189 mmHg/s, respectively) than in Group V (16.7 +/- 1.3, 36 +/- 2.6 and +2659 +/- 176/-2516 +/- 205, respectively) and Group E20 (7.5 +/- 2.5, 15.6 +/- 2.0 and +2018 +/- 110/-2097 +/- 102, respectively). Although the expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 and collagen-III mRNA in Group V (36.3 +/- 5.7 and 157.6 +/- 12.7%) were significantly higher than those in Group N (19.6 +/- 3.0 and 65.2 +/- 1.5%, both p < 0.01), they were reduced in Group P2 (21.4 +/- 5.9 and 75.2 +/- 9.3%, both p < 0.01). These results suggest that although enalapril can block increases in blood pressure caused by circulating angiotensin type-1, perindopril at 2 mg/kg may confer greater protection than enalapril at 20 mg/kg against injury from the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure.", 
    "565": "We examined the involvement of the oxidative stress in high glucose-induced suppression of human aortic endothelial cell proliferation. Chronic glucose treatment for 72 h concentration-dependently (5.6-22.2 mol/l) inhibited human coronary endothelial cell proliferation. Temocaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, at 10 nmol/l to 1 micromol/l inhibited high glucose (22.2 mmol/l)-mediated suppression of human aortic endothelial cell proliferation. Temocaprilat at 1 micromol/l inhibited high glucose-induced membrane-bound protein kinase C activity in human aortic endothelial cells. The protein kinase C inhibitors calphostin C 100 nmol/l or chelerythrine 1 micromol/l inhibited high glucose-mediated suppression of human aortic endothelial cell proliferation. Chronic high glucose treatment for 72 h increased intracellular oxidative stress, directly measured by flow cytometry using carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate bis-acetoxymethyl ester, and this increase was significantly suppressed by temocaprilat 10 nmol/l to 1 micromol/l. Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant 100 nmol/l significantly reduced the action of temocaprilat; whereas bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9-Leu8-bradykinin 100 nmol/l had no effect. These findings suggest that high glucose inhibits human aortic endothelial cell proliferation and that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocaprilat inhibits high glucose-mediated suppression of human aortic endothelial cell proliferation, possibly through suppression of protein kinase C, bradykinin B2 receptors and oxidative stress.", 
    "566": "Although recent clinical studies have indicated that angiotensin II receptor blocker is as effective in treating heart failure as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, it is unknown whether their effects are different. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan from 11 weeks old. We examined cardiac geometry and function by echocardiography, and histology and gene expression by high-density oligonucleotide arrays using Affymetrix U34 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.). Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high salt diet showed a marked increase in blood pressure and developed concentric hypertrophy at 11 weeks, followed by left ventricle dilation and congestive heart failure by 20 weeks after birth. Although both medications had only a mild antihypertensive effect, they strongly suppressed the development of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and heart failure to the same extent. Gene expression pattern examined by Affymetrix GeneChip (Affymetrix) is quite different between the two drug groups, indicating that angiotensin II receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prevent heart failure by different mechanisms.", 
    "567": "Heart failure is a common and costly medical condition. Ischemic heart disease and hypertension account for most cases of heart failure in developed countries. Estimates of the one-year mortality rates for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III, and IV are 10%, 20%, and 40%, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality of heart failure patients by approximately 25% (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 0.88). Larger doses of ACE inhibitors are more effective in preventing hospitalization than are lower doses. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of their side effects (e.g., cough). Evidence for benefits of using combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is encouraging, but requires further study. For patients who cannot tolerate either ACE inhibitors or ARBs, vasodilator therapy with hydralazine and nitrates will probably provide benefit. (Diuretic therapy, while a mainstay of heart failure treatment, is primarily used for symptom relief.) There is also evidence that spironolactone reduces mortality (relative risk reduction 30%, 95% CI 18 40%) for patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure. When administering spironolactone to heart failure patients, monitoring for hyperkalemia is essential. After two centuries of use, randomized controlled trials have finally demonstrated that digoxin is effective in preventing hospitalizations (relative risk reduction 28%, 95% CI 21 34%). There is now overwhelming evidence that beta-blockers are safe for heart failure patients but that they reduce the risk of death for these patients by approximately 30%. In addition to these medical interventions, heart failure patients may also benefit from a number of non-pharmacological interventions.",

Cigarette smoking exacerbates renal injury in type 2 diabetes despite BP control and ACEI, but its cessation in those with microalbuminuria ameliorates the progressive renal injury caused by continued smoking.", 
    "572": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition on microvascular plasma leakage (extravasation) was evaluated in a rat model. Progressive inhibition of ACE using captopril caused increased extravasation when lung ACE was inhibited by >55%. In contrast, the selective inhibition of renal NEP by >90% using ecadotril did not increase extravasation. In NEP-inhibited rats, extravasation produced by the ACE inhibitors captopril and lisinopril was markedly enhanced. The dual ACE and NEP inhibitor omapatrilat, at oral doses of 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg, selectively inhibited lung ACE by 19, 61, and 76%, respectively, and did not cause significant extravasation. Doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg omapatrilat, which produced >90% inhibition of ACE and also inhibited renal NEP by 54 and 78%, respectively, significantly increased extravasation. In this model, bradykinin and substance P produced extravasation that could be abolished by the bradykinin 2 (B2) receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (icatibant) or the neurokinin1 (NK1) antagonist CP99994 [(+)-(2S,3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine], respectively. Bradykinin induced extravasation was also partially ( approximately 40%) inhibited by CP99994, indicating that a portion of the response involves B2 receptor-mediated release of substance P. In conclusion, this study is the first to relate the degree of ACE and/or NEP inhibition to extravasation liability in the rat model. Our data clearly demonstrate that ACE inhibitor-induced plasma extravasation is enhanced by concomitant inhibition of NEP. In addition, this study provides further evidence for the role for B2 and NK1 receptors in mediating plasma extravasation in the rat.", 
    "573": "There is uncertainty about the contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II formation, with recent studies suggesting that non-ACE enzymes may be the predominant pathway of angiotensin II formation in kidney, heart, and lung. To investigate the role of ACE in angiotensin II formation, we measured angiotensin I and II levels in blood, kidney, and heart of 2 mouse genetic models (ACE.1 and ACE.4) of reduced somatic ACE gene expression and in blood, kidney, heart, lung, adrenal, and brain of mice administered the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. We also measured the levels of bradykinin (1-9) and its ACE metabolite bradykinin (1-7). Reduced ACE gene expression and ACE inhibition had similar effects on angiotensin and bradykinin peptide levels. Angiotensin II levels were reduced by 70% to 97% in blood, 92% to 99% in kidney, 93% to 99% in heart, 97% in lung, and 85% in adrenal and brain. The marked reductions in angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio indicated that ACE was responsible for at least 90% of angiotensin I conversion to angiotensin II in blood, kidney, heart, lung, and brain, and at least 77% in adrenal. Blood bradykinin (1-9) levels were increased 6.4-fold to 8.4-fold. Heart bradykinin (1-9) levels were increased in ACE.4 mice and the bradykinin (1-7)/bradykinin (1-9) ratio was reduced in kidney and heart of ACE.4 mice and heart of lisinopril-treated mice. These studies demonstrate that ACE is the predominant pathway of angiotensin II formation in blood and tissues of mice and plays a major role in bradykinin (1-9) metabolism in blood and, to a lesser extent, in kidney and heart.", 
    "574": "Although the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced bradykinin enhances nitric oxide (NO) release, bradykinin may also stimulate the production of an additional vasodilator, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). This study examined the role of EDHF in mediating the NO-independent action of ACE inhibitors in canine renal microcirculation in vivo. We used intravital CCD camera videomicroscopy that allowed direct visualization of renal microcirculation in superficial and juxtamedullary nephrons in an in vivo, in situ, and relatively intact setting. In the presence of E4177 (an angiotensin receptor blocker), cilazaprilat (30 microg/kg) had no effect on diameter of superficial afferent arterioles (Aff), but it increased renal contents of bradykinin and nitrate plus nitrite, and it elicited dilation of juxtamedullary Aff (from 24.0+/-0.2 to 28.2+/-0.8 microm), juxtamedullary efferent arterioles (Eff) (from 24.2+/-0.2 to 28.0+/-0.8 microm), and superficial Eff (from 18.2+/-0.2 to 19.7+/-0.2 microm). These changes in diameters were prevented by N(alpha)-adamantaneacetyl-d-Arg-[Hyp(3),Thi(5,8),D-Phe(7)]bradykinin, a bradykinin receptor antagonist. The pretreatment with nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-NAME) plus E4177 eliminated the dilator response of juxtamedullary/superficial Eff and the increase in renal nitrate plus nitrite levels induced by cilazaprilat. In contrast, in the presence of E4177+l-NAME, cilazaprilat still caused 8%+/-3% dilation of juxtamedullary Aff, which was completely eliminated by proadifen, a cytochrome-P450 and K(Ca) channel blocker. Collectively, the ACE inhibitor exerts multiple vasodilator mechanisms, including the inhibition of angiotensin II formation; blockade of angiotensin II activity appears to be a dominant mechanism in superficial Aff, whereas the bradykinin-induced NO acts on superficial Eff and juxtamedullary Aff/Eff. Furthermore, a putative EDHF is an additional mechanism for the ACE inhibitor-induced vasodilation of juxtamedullary Aff in vivo.",

    "576": "We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 754 patients with heart failure who had ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and weight measured at baseline. Median age was 69 years, and 43% had an ejection fraction > or =35%. By the Cockcroft-Gault equation, 118 patients (16%) had creatinine clearances < or =30 mL/min and 301 (40%) had creatinine clearances between 30 and 59 mL/min. During follow-up (median 926 days), 385 patients (37%) died. Even after adjustment for all other prognostic factors, survival was significantly associated with renal function (P=0.002) in patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction; patients exhibited a 1% increase in mortality for each 1-mL/min decrease in creatinine clearance. The associations with 1-year mortality reductions were similar for ACE inhibitors (OR 0.46 [95% CI 0.26 to 0.82] versus OR 0.28 [95% CI 0.11 to 0.70]) and beta-blockers (OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.70] versus OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.19 to 0.85]) in patients with creatinine clearances <60 mL/min versus > or =60 mL/min, although these drugs were used less frequently in patients with renal insufficiency.", 
    "577": "Renal insufficiency is more prevalent in patients with heart failure than previously reported and is an independent prognostic factor in diastolic and systolic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers were associated with similar reductions in mortality in patients with and without renal insufficiency.",

    "579": "A literature search (MEDLINE 1966 to 2002) was performed using the key words \"diabetic nephropathy,\" and relevant book chapters were also reviewed, to identify well-controlled, prospective landmark studies and expert review articles on diabetic nephropathy (DN). Data and conclusions from the selected articles that provided solid evidence regarding the optimal management of DN were extracted and interpreted in light of clinical and research experience with Chinese patients.", 
    "580": "DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. High blood pressure, dyslipidemia, long duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control and central obesity are important risk factors. Microalbuminuria is a practical marker to predict the development of overt nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. Risk factor modification, renal function monitoring and combined therapies are the current integrated approaches to manage patients with diabetic kidney disease. Optimal glycemic control is a fundamental goal, but effective antihypertensive and possibly lipid-lowering therapy delay the progression of DN. Recent large clinical trials support the earlier experimental data that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have important renoprotective actions independent of their blood pressure lowering actions.", 
    "581": "Screening for microalbuminuria and monitoring renal function will identify patients with DN at an early stage and allow for intervention. Tight glycemic control and aggressive antihypertensive treatment as well as the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should substantially delay the progression of nephropathy.",

Both patients were suffering from angioedema and were taking an angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI). A provisional diagnosis of ACEI-induced angioedema was made. An intramuscular injection of chlorpheniramine maleate was given to both patients and they were immediately transferred to the local accident and emergency department. These cases illustrate the potential role of the general dental practitioner in the early recognition and management of this potentially life-threatening condition.",

    "584": "The transport capacity of any membrane depends on its surface area and permeability. In addition, peritoneal capillaries are probably barriers to solute transport. Although no decisive use of antihypertensive drugs has been reported in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with hypertension, those drugs are known to have various effects on vessels. In the present study, we used a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera in renovascular hypertensive dogs with mild renal insufficiency to investigate the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on the peritoneal capillaries. Renovascular hypertension was induced in the dogs by placing silver clips on both renal arteries to create 90% occlusion. After confirmation of elevation of blood pressure (usually 20 days after the operation), each dog's abdomen was opened while the animal was under general anesthesia. Using a CCD camera, the diameters of the small arteries of the peritoneum were measured after 3 days' oral administration of a placebo (n = 5); or of 8 mg CS866, a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (n = 5); or of 10 mg benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 5); or of 10 mg amlodipine, a calcium antagonist (n = 5). In dogs receiving CS866, blood pressure decreased to 128 +/- 6 mmHg from 160 +/- 6 mmHg (p < 0.01). A similar decrease in blood pressure was observed with the use of the other drugs. The diameter of the small vessels increased by 28% +/- 6% in dogs receiving CS866 and by 24% +/- 5% in dogs receiving benazepril, as compared with 3% +/- 3% in dogs receiving the calcium antagonist. These data clearly demonstrate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system produces an increase in solute clearance in hypertensive dogs with mild renal insufficiency and that such blockade may be applicable as therapy for hypertensive patients on CAPD.",

Parameters of exposure and reported outcomes as well as information on potentially confounding variables were systematically abstracted from this series by a single physician. Because exposure to ACE inhibitors after the first trimester of pregnancy had been associated with adverse outcomes in the existing literature, we divided the cases into those exposed in the first trimester only (considered as the baseline group) and cases exposed beyond or after this time. Frequency of reported adverse outcomes in the second group was compared with those in the baseline group; odds ratios were computed, taking account of potentially confounding variables by logistic regression where appropriate.", 
    "588": "Exposure to enalapril after the first trimester of pregnancy was strongly associated with oligohydramnios and specific adverse outcomes thought to be secondary to reduced amniotic fluid volume (limb deformities, cranial ossification deficits, lung hypoplasia), as well as with neonatal renal failure. The relationship did not change after taking numerous potential confounders into account, including duration of exposure, concomitant drug use, maternal age, concurrent disease, neonatal gender, and gestational age at birth. Such a pattern of abnormalities is considered to be a consequence of the effect of ACE inhibition on fetal renal function that develops after the first trimester.",

    "590": "A great many cardiovascular drugs (CVDs) have the potential to induce adverse reactions in the mouth. The prevalence of such reactions is not known, however, since many are asymptomatic and therefore are believed to go unreported. As more drugs are marketed and the population includes an increasing number of elderly, the number of drug prescriptions is also expected to increase. Accordingly, it can be predicted that the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including the oral ones (ODRs), will continue to increase. ODRs affect the oral mucous membrane, saliva production, and taste. The pathogenesis of these reactions, especially the mucosal ones, is largely unknown and appears to involve complex interactions among the drug in question, other medications, the patient's underlying disease, genetics, and life-style factors. Along this line, there is a growing interest in the association between pharmacogenetic polymorphism and ADRs. Research focusing on polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 system (CYPs) has become increasingly important and has highlighted the intra- and inter-individual responses to drug exposure. This system has recently been suggested to be an underlying candidate regarding the pathogenesis of ADRs in the oral mucous membrane. This review focuses on those CVDs reported to induce ODRs. In addition, it will provide data on specific drugs or drug classes, and outline and discuss recent research on possible mechanisms linking ADRs to drug metabolism patterns.

    "592": "A wide range of pharmacological approaches are being developed in the laboratory that could greatly expand the ability to treat acute and chronic radiation injuries. However, there are currently a variety of practical and legal barriers that would prevent the actual clinical use of most of the approaches. There are also the potential weaknesses in most of the current programmes for dealing with the consequences of radiation accidents or nuclear terrorism, including the absence of widespread radiation biodosimetry capabilities and the resulting inability to triage. If a major radiation accident or terrorist event occurs, the lack of biodosimetry and treatment capabilities will be compounded by widespread public fear of 'radiation'.",

    "594": "Male wistar rats weighting about 250g were treated with perindopril (2mg/kg, daily gavage), except for model group and control group. After 4, 6 weeks, morphological examination was based on microscopy. RT-PCR was utilized to detect gene expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) in the liver. Meanwhile, the protein expressions of AT1 receptor, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in liver tissue were examined by Western blot. The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was assessed by zymography. Serum laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured using radio-immunity technique.",

The aim of the French nationwide PREVENIR survey was to improve knowledge on the management of cardiovascular risk factors, especially during cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome. The purpose of this study was to specify the characteristics of patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation.", 
    "598": "The survey was performed in 77 of 501 (15.4%) public or private French coronary care units. All French regions were involved. All the patients admitted to the hospital during January 1998 who survived an acute coronary syndrome were included in the survey. Data on rehabilitation practice were collected from patient medical records, either during an outpatient consultation or from the patient and the general practitioner during the 6-month follow-up period.", 
    "599": "Of the 1394 patients included in the study (779 with myocardial infarction and 615 with unstable angina), only 310 (22%) underwent cardiac rehabilitation. Significant differences in patient characteristics were found between the cardiac rehabilitation and non-cardiac rehabilitation groups, respectively, in terms of gender (82% male vs 68%; P <.001), age younger than 65 years (56% vs 39%; P <.001), type of acute coronary syndrome (75% myocardial infarction vs 50%; P <.001), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% (6% vs 13%; P <.0004), and prevalence of percutaneous intervention (54% vs 46%; P <.02). Two risk factors were more common in the rehabilitated group: dyslipidemia (52% vs 44%; P <.02) and current smoking (51% vs 37%; P <.0001). In the multivariate analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.87) and older age (>75 years vs. <65 years; OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7) predicted decreased cardiac rehabilitation prescription. Conversely, previous history of dyslipidemia (OR,1.4; 95% CI, 1.04-1.8), post-myocardial infarction (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.13-3.89), and a percutaneous intervention (OR,1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.7) predicted increased cardiac rehabilitation prescription. Severe left ventricular impairment (< or =35% vs >50%) was not an independent factor for cardiac rehabilitation prescription. At 6-month follow-up assessment, rehabilitation patients had a lower rate of hypertension (18% vs 27%), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54% vs 62%), and continued smoking (34% vs 50%).", 
    "600": "The results of the PREVENIR survey underscore the low level of cardiac rehabilitation prescription in France, and the relative exclusion of women and elderly people. Among the risk factors, dyslipidemia and current smoking are more frequent among rehabilitated patients. These findings may help to modify the strategy for using cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome, although it is an effective intervention for secondary prevention.", 
    "601": "We have shown that Protease N treated Royal Jelly (ProRJ) and peptides from ProRJ (Ile-Tyr (IY), Val-Tyr (VY), Ile-Val-Tyr (IVY)) inhibited angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and they have an antihypertensive effect in repeated oral administration for 28 d on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We investigated the contributive ratio of these peptides in ProRJ for antihypertensive effect in single oral administration on SHR. In single oral administration of each peptide and peptides mixture (MIX; IY, VY and IVY) at doses of 0.5, 1 and 10 mg/kg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR was reduced dose-dependently. This antihypertensive effect was held for 8 h. These results suggest that peptides contributed to the antihypertensive effect of ProRJ. And the contributive ratio of MIX in ProRJ for antihypertensive effect was computed to be about 38%. Therefore it is considered that intake of peptides, as a functional food would be beneficial for improving blood pressure in people with hypertension.", 
    "602": "On average, whites and blacks differ in their response to specific antihypertensive drugs. These differences are often highlighted in reviews and practice guidelines. However, there is wide variation in drug-associated changes in blood pressure within each race. The goal of this meta-analysis is to quantitate how often whites and blacks have similar responses to specific antihypertensive drugs. Computerized searches of MEDLINE (1983 to March 2003) and manual searches of references listed in identified articles were performed. Studies were included if they provided race-specific changes in blood pressure. Fifteen studies with a total of 9307 white subjects and 2902 black subjects were analyzed. For drug-associated changes in diastolic blood pressure, the mean difference between whites and blacks ranged from 0.6 to 3.0 mm Hg while the standard deviation within each race ranged from 5.0 to 10.1 mm Hg. The percentage of whites and blacks with similar drug-associated changes in diastolic blood pressure was 90% (95% confidence interval: 81 to 99) for diuretics, 90% (95% CI: 83 to 97) for beta-blockers, 95% (95% CI: 92 to 98) for calcium channel blockers, and 81% (95% CI: 76 to 86) for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The percentage of whites and blacks with similar drug-associated changes in systolic blood pressure ranged from 83% to 93%. In conclusion, the majority of whites and blacks have similar responses to commonly used antihypertensive drugs. Clinical decisions to use a specific drug should be based on other considerations such as efficacy in individual patients, compelling indications, and cost.", 
    "603": "Diastolic heart failure (DHF) has become a social burden; however, evidences leading to its therapeutic strategy are lacking. This study investigated effects of addition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) at advanced stage of DHF in hypertensive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 8% NaCl diet from age 7 weeks served as DHF model, and those fed a normal chow served as control. The DHF model rats were arbitrarily assigned to 3 treatment regimens at age 17 weeks: ACEI (temocapril 0.4 mg/kg per day), combination of ACEI (temocapril 0.2 mg/kg per day) with ARB (olmesartan 0.3 mg/kg per day), or placebo. At age 17 weeks, this model represents progressive ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, relaxation abnormality, and myocardial stiffening. Data were collected at age 20 weeks. As compared with the monotherapy with ACEI, the addition of ARB induced more prominent suppression of ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, leading to suppression of myocardial stiffening, improvement of relaxation, and inhibition of hemodynamic deterioration. Such benefits were associated with greater decreases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, macrophage infiltration, and gene expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) and interleukin (IL)-1beta, but not with changes in gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Thus, ARB added to ACEI provides more benefits as compared with ACEI alone in DHF when initiated at an advanced stage. The additive effects are likely provided through more prominent suppression of ROS generation and inflammatory changes without effects on expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha.", 
    "604": "We have shown previously that the concentration of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) in the heart is inversely correlated with the degree of fibrosis in a number of experimental models of early myocardial fibrosis. Vasopeptidase inhibition and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition both decrease myocardial fibrosis. In this study, we sought to determine whether this myocardial protective effect might reflect increased VIP concentrations in the heart. We compared the effects of 4 weeks treatment of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the degree of fibrosis and the concentration of VIP in the heart in salt sensitive hypertension induced by treatment with L-nitro-omega-methylarginine (L-NAME). Systolic blood pressure decreased in both treatment groups compared with control (omapatrilat P<0.005; enalapril P<0.001). Myocardial fibrosis was less for omapatrilat than control (P<0.0005) and enalapril (P<0.0005) groups. Myocardial VIP was greater in omapatrilat than in controls (P<0.005) and enalapril-treated rats (P<0.05). We conclude that vasopeptidase inhibition exerts a greater myocardial protective effect than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Further, this myocardial protective effect is associated with increased VIP in the heart suggesting a pathogenetic role for VIP depletion in the development of fibrosis in the heart.", 
    "605": "The knowledge of the structure and function of the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is rapidly increasing. The classic pathway of angiotensin (Ang) II generation includes a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). We actually discuss the alternative pathways for the generation of Ang-II and other angiotensin peptides (Ang III, Ang IV, Ang (1-9), Ang (1-7), des-Asp-Ang I) and the responsible enzymes (tonins, cathepsins, chymases, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, neutral endopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, ACE2 etc.). The development of novel enzyme inhibitors (e.g., nafamostat, sampatrilat) for more efficacious suppression of RAS activity is also considered.", 
    "606": "Chronic cough is a common problem in patients who visit physicians. The three most common causes of persistence cough in nonsmokers who were not taking an ACE inhibitor and who had a normal or stable chest radiograph are: postnasal drip, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux. After a viral upper respiratory infection, it takes sometimes seven weeks for bronchial airway hyperreactivity to return to normal. By using a standard protocol, 95 percent of patients with chronic cough can be managed successfully but in some cases it may take even five months or more to determine a diagnosis and effective treatment.", 
    "607": "Among patients who are hospitalized with heart failure (HF), worsening renal function (WRF) is associated with worse outcomes. Whether treatment for HF contributes to WRF is unknown. In this study, we sought to assess whether acute treatment for patients who were hospitalized with HF contributes to WRF.", 
    "608": "Data were collected in a nested case-control study on 382 subjects who were hospitalized with HF (191 patients with WRF, defined as a rise in serum creatinine level >26.5 micromol/L [0.3 mg/dL], and 191 control subjects). The association of medications, fluid intake/output, and weight with WRF was assessed.", 
    "609": "Calcium channel blocker (CCB) use and loop diuretic doses were higher in patients on the day before WRF (25% vs 10% for CCB; 199 +/- 195 mg vs 143 +/- 119 mg for loop diuretics; both P <.05). There were no significant differences in the fluid intake/output or weight changes in the 2 groups. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use was not associated with WRF. Other predictors of WRF included elevated creatinine level at admission, uncontrolled hypertension, and history of HF or diabetes mellitus. Higher hematocrit levels were associated with a lower risk. Vasodilator use was higher among patients on the day before WRF (46% vs 35%, P <.05), but was not an independent predictor in the multivariable analysis.", 
    "610": "Several medical strategies, including the use of CCBs and a higher dose of loop diuretics, but not ACE inhibitors, were associated with a higher risk of WRF. Although assessment of inhospital diuresis was limited, WRF could not be explained by greater fluid loss in these patients. Determining whether these interventions are responsible for WRF or are markers of higher risk requires further investigation.", 
    "611": "Milk protein-derived peptides with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. The lactokinin Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALPMHIR) is an ACE-inhibitory peptide released by tryptic digestion from the milk protein beta-lactoglobulin. Its ACE-inhibitory activity is 100 times lower than that of captopril. The latter is known to inhibit the release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) by endothelial cells. The effects of ALPMHIR on the endothelium are currently unknown. In this study, the influence of ALPMHIR on release of ET-1 by endothelial cells was investigated. The basal ET-1 release of the cells was reduced by 29% (p<0.01) in the presence of 1 mM ALPMHIR, compared to 42% (p<0.01) for 0.1 mM captopril. Addition of 10 U/ml thrombin to the incubation medium increased the release of ET-1 by 66% (p<0.01). Co-incubation of 10 U/ml thrombin with 1 microM captopril or with 0.1 mM ALPMHIR inhibited the stimulated ET-1 release by 45% (p<0.01) and by 32% (p<0.01), respectively. These data indicate that dietary peptides, such as ALPMHIR, can modulate ET-1 release by endothelial cells. These effects, among other mechanisms, may play a role in the anti-hypertensive effect of milk protein-derived peptides.", 
    "612": "Data clearly indicate that treatment with antihypertensive drugs reduces the incidence of all strokes in men (by 34%), women (by 38%), elderly persons (by 36%), including those older than 80 years (by 34%), younger persons, those with systolic and diastolic hypertension, persons with isolated systolic hypertension, and in those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (by 28%). Blood pressure should be reduced to less than 140/90 mm Hg. The overall data also suggest that reduction of stroke in persons with hypertension is related more to a reduction in blood pressure than to the type of antihypertensive drugs used.", 
    "613": "The presence, implications, and approach to mitral valvular disease in the setting of a cardiomyopathy has recently become a focal issue for discussion. Although recent evidence suggests that mitral regurgitation confers a poor prognosis in heart failure, the true prevalence of mitral regurgitation as well as its pathogenic contribution to prognosis in heart failure remains uncertain. Whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have not been demonstrated to favorably alter mitral regurgitation, treatment with b-blockers or cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to induce regression of ventricular dilation, with consequent decrease in mitral regurgitation. Surgical valve reconstruction by undersized ring annuloplasty appears promising, but optimal results require skilled surgical expertise. Even in highly experienced hands, intermediate outcomes appear to be inferior to those of cardiac transplantation. Percutaneous mitral valve repair remains an investigational procedure that warrants further clinical research.", 
    "614": "The objective of this study was to identify differences in disposition and esterase hydrolysis of ramipril between male and female volunteers. Plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve until the last measured concentration (AUCt) data of ramipril and its active metabolite ramiprilat (-diacid) were obtained from a randomised, cross-over bioequivalence study in 36 subjects (18 females and 18 males). Participants received a single 5-mg oral dose of two different formulations of ramipril (Formulation I and II). Plasma ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations were determined according to validated methods involving liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total number of 2 x 34 available plasma concentration-time curves of both the parent drug and the metabolite could be analysed, and variations (50-100% coefficient of variation [CV]) in plasma concentrations of both parent drug and metabolite were found. With both the formulations, the mean plasma concentrations-time curves of males and females were identical. The groups of female and male volunteers showed similar yields (AUCt = microg x h/L) of the metabolite ramiprilat (p = 0.37); however, females showed a higher AUCt/kg than males (p = 0.046). This difference was solely attributed to the difference in body weight between males and females (p = 0.00049). In both male and female groups, a subject-dependent yield of active metabolite ramiprilat was demonstrated, which was independent of the formulation. There is a large variation in the ramiprilat t1/2beta (50-60% CV). There is a group of subjects who showed a t1/2beta of approximately 80 h (15% CV), and two apparent groups with a longer t1/2beta for each formulation (124 h, 22.5% CV; 166 h, 21.6% CV, respectively, p = 0.0013). This variation in the terminal half-life of ramiprilat is not sex related. In all three groups of half-lives, the corresponding Cmax values (mean +/- SD) of ramiprilat in males and females were identical. Thus, with identical Cmax and half-lives, the difference found in the AUCt/kg of ramiprilat must be due to the difference in dose, as the consequence of the difference in body weight, following a standard dose of 5 mg in both males and females. This study showed clearly that despite subject-dependent hydrolysis of ramipril to the active metabolite ramiprilat, the variability in the rate of hydrolysis between males and females is similar. With a fixed dose (5 mg), females received a higher dose/kg than males and consequently showed a higher AUCt/kg of the active metabolite ramiprilat.", 
    "615": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related carboxypeptidase, ACE2, is a type I integral membrane protein of 805 amino acids that contains one HEXXH + E zinc-binding consensus sequence. ACE2 has been implicated in the regulation of heart function and also as a functional receptor for the coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To gain further insights into this enzyme, the first crystal structures of the native and inhibitor-bound forms of the ACE2 extracellular domains were solved to 2.2- and 3.0-A resolution, respectively. Comparison of these structures revealed a large inhibitor-dependent hinge-bending movement of one catalytic subdomain relative to the other ( approximately 16 degrees ) that brings important residues into position for catalysis. The potent inhibitor MLN-4760 ((S,S)-2-[1-carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-dichlorobenzyl)-3H-imidazol4-yl]-ethylamino]-4-methylpentanoic acid) makes key binding interactions within the active site and offers insights regarding the action of residues involved in catalysis and substrate specificity. A few active site residue substitutions in ACE2 relative to ACE appear to eliminate the S(2)' substrate-binding subsite and account for the observed reactivity change from the peptidyl dipeptidase activity of ACE to the carboxypeptidase activity of ACE2.",

We report a case of pemphigus foliaceus in a 66-year-old male treated with lisinopril for hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction. The drug-induced variant of pemphigus is caused by a wide variety of drugs and is most frequently associated with captopril and penicillamine. It has not previously been reported in this commonly used drug.", 
    "617": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The arrhythmia can be initiated and/or maintained by rapidly firing foci, single- and multiple-circuit reentry. Once initiated, AF alters atrial electrical and structural properties (atrial remodeling) in a way that promotes its own maintenance and recurrence and may alter the response to antiarrhythmic drugs. Thus, initial episodes of paroxysmal (self-terminating) AF lengthens to the point where the arrhythmia becomes persistent (requires cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm) and permanent. AF usually requires a trigger for initiation and a favorable electrophysiological and/or anatomical substrate for maintenance. The substrate includes both cardiovascular (coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy) and non cardiovascular diseases (thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary diseases). Accordingly, the initial step in patients with AF requires a careful assessment of symptoms and identification of underlying reversible triggers and potentially modifiable underlying structural substrate and treat them aggressively. In contrast to other cardiac arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic drugs (ADs) are the mainstay of therapy. Long-term treatment of AF is directed to restore and maintain the sinus rhythm with class I and III ADs (rhythm-control) or to allow AF to persist and ensure that the ventricular rate is controlled (rate-control) with atrioventricular nodal blocking drugs (digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, diltiazem) and prevent thromboembolic complications with anticoagulants. However, the long-term efficacy of ADs for preventing AF recurrence is far from ideal, because of limited efficacy (AF recurs in at least one-half of the patients) and potential side effects, particularly proarrhythmia. Thus, the choice of the appropriate AD will depend on the temporal pattern of the arrhythmia, the presence of associated diseases, easy of administration and adverse effects profile, particularly the risk of proarrhythmia. The recent finding that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers reduce the incidence of AF in patients post myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction confirmed the importance of targeting the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying AF and the mechanism of action and the efficacy and safety profile of the ADs used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The advantages and disadvantages of rhythm and rate control, the role pill in a pocket concept and the role of the new ADs are dicussed.",

At present, controversial data exist in medical literature regarding the specific role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors concerning angiogenesis in different tissues. The present study was designed to determine the possible beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor perindopril on myocardial angiogenesis in an animal model of obesity, hypertension, and NIDDM, such as the obese Zucker rat (OZR) and control lean Zucker rats (LZR).",

For 6 months, G2 received a daily dose of 3 mg/kg of perindopril, by gavage, and G1 and G3 received an equal volume of vehicle throughout the experiment. After 6 months of treatment, all rats were killed, hearts were harvested for pathology studies, including immunohistochemistry, using monoclonal antibodies against rat endothelial cell (RECA-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. At the end of the study, OZR treated with perindopril presented: 1) lower blood pressure (BP) (127 +/- 3.2 v 152.4 +/- 3 mm Hg, P <.01) and 2) lower heart weight/100 g body weight (0.22 +/- 0.02 v 0.36 +/- 0.04 g, P <.01) than OZR untreated. Moreover, OZR that received perindopril showed higher: 1) myocyte density (2044 +/- 67 v 847 +/- 91 myocytes/mm(2), P <.01) and 2) capillary density (1348 +/- 118 v 436 +/- 78 capillaries/mm(2), P <.01); higher amount of: 1) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the myocardium (P <.01) and higher percentage of capillaries with positive immunostaining for eNOS (P <.01), compared with untreated OZR. There was a correlation between both the amount of VEGF in myocardium and the number of capillaries (r = 0.88; P <.01) and VEGF and eNOS expression in myocardial capillaries (r = 0.93; P <.01) in OZR treated with perindopril. Finally, OZR that received P showed an improvement in insulin/glucose ratio (P <.01) when compared with untreated OZR.",

    "626": "Central aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) is an important determinant of cardiac workload and cardiac hypertrophy. The relationship of central aortic systolic BP and brachial BP varies depending on the stiffness of blood vessels. It is not certain whether the different drug classes affect the brachial and aortic systolic BP in a similar manner. In a double-blind crossover study, we measured the effects of the four major drug classes compared with placebo on central aortic pressure. Central aortic pressure and various indices were determined using the Sphygmo Cor apparatus. The study was undertaken in patients aged 65 to 85 years with systolic BP >150 mm Hg at study entry. Results are reported for 32 patients who had satisfactory applanation tonometry in all five periods. Calcium channel blockers and diuretics caused a greater fall in brachial artery systolic BP than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blocking drugs. On placebo, central aorta augmentation pressure and index were 23 mm Hg and 33.3%; on ACE inhibitors the values were 18 mm Hg and 30%; on beta-blockers, 26 mm Hg and 38.5%; on calcium channel blockers, 16 mm Hg and 28%; and on diuretics, 17 mm Hg and 28.8%. The augmentation pressure on beta-blocking drugs was greater than on the other three drug classes (P <.05), and augmentation pressures on ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were less than on placebo (P <.05). The lowest central aortic pressures were achieved with calcium blocking drugs and diuretics. Therapy based on brachial artery recordings may thus overestimate the effect of beta-blocking drugs on central aortic systolic BP and underestimate the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and calcium blocking drugs. The clinical importance of this discrepancy needs to be evaluated.",

Omapatrilat, an agent under development, has been shown to have significantly greater antihypertensive efficacy than existing agents, but may also carry increased risk of angioedema.

Subjects randomized to omapatrilat were more likely to reach BP target, regardless of demographics or comorbid conditions and whether omapatrilat was used as initial therapy, replacement for existing therapy, or in addition to existing therapy. Angioedema was more frequent with omapatrilat than enalapril (2.17% v 0.68%). Two omapatrilat-treated subjects experienced angioedema with airway compromise, which was successfully treated.",

However, because of unwanted effects associated with such therapy, some patients cannot be treated with these drugs at all or may be administered only very small doses. To find an optimal nephroprotective strategy for these patients, we compared antiproteinuric effects of combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist in very small doses with treatment with either agent alone at greater, but not maximal, doses.

The renoprotective effect of losartan corresponded to an average delay of 2 years in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation.",

Patients were randomly assigned perindopril 8 mg once daily (n = 6110) or matching placebo (n = 6108). After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, a relative risk reduction of 20% (95% CI 9-29, p = 0.0003) was observed in the combined primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest) in the group treated with perindopril as compared to placebo. About 50 patients needed to be treated for a period of 4 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. This benefit was consistent in all predefined subgroups. According to these results, treatment with perindopril, on top of other preventive medications, should be considered in all patients with stable coronary heart disease.",

Although there are several theoretical arguments favouring one particular type of drug over the other, prospective clinical trials have failed to show major differences between drug classes in terms of overall prognosis. A possible exception in this regard may be the development of diabetes mellitus which seems to occur less frequently with ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers and calcium entry blockers than with diuretics. The choice of the antihypertensive drug regimen should take certain patient characteristics into account, notably comorbid conditions. However, despite theoretical considerations concerning initial therapy many patients will end up using two or more medications.",

Enalapril did not induce any significant changes in any of the cognitive function test scores; valsartan significantly increased the word list memory score (+11.8%; P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs enalapril) and the word list recall score (+18.7%; P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs enalapril), but not those of the other tests.", 
    "649": "These findings indicate that, in elderly hypertensive patients, 16 weeks of treatment with valsartan 160 mg o.d. is more effective than enalapril 20 mg o.d. in reducing BP, and (unlike enalapril) improves some of the components of cognitive function, particularly episodic memory.", 
    "650": "There is a common belief in a class effect among angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This is unsubstantiated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because vascular tissue is a source of the endogenous fibrinolytic markers, and ACE inhibition in vascular tissue favorably influences the fibrinolytic system, the authors hypothesized that a high-tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor would provide a more favorable reduction in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and an increase in tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) after AMI compared to a low-tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor. In a randomized open-label trial, patients received the high-tissue-penetrating quinapril (n = 15) or low-tissue-penetrating enalapril (n = 15) immediately following an AMI. PAI-1 and t-PA antigen (ng/mL) were measured at baseline and through 14 days of treatment. There was no difference in baseline PAI-1 or t-PA antigen between treatments. PAI-1 antigen trended toward being lower with quinapril versus enalapril on day 1 (24.44 +/- 14.96 vs. 36.94 +/- 19.49, respectively, p = 0.059) and was significantly lower on day 3 (17.32 +/- 9.57 vs. 27.49 +/- 9.61, respectively, p = 0.009). Analysis of PAI-1 antigen over time by two-factor ANOVA with replication found significantly lower concentrations of PAI-1 antigen over the entire treatment period with quinapril versus enalapril (p < 0.003). This investigation of ACE inhibitor tissue-penetrating influence on markers of reinfarction risk suggests there may be a greater early reduction in PAI-1 with a more highly tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor.", 
    "651": "Ten pediatric patients with Alport syndrome received enalapril for 5 years. There were nine boys. Eight patients have the X-linked form of the disease and two the autosomal recessive form. The median age at the start of treatment was 10.25 years. Only one patient was hypertensive. The starting dose of enalapril was 0.05 mg/kg; the target dose was 0.5 mg/kg per day. The median dose given effectively was 0.24, 0.37, 0.45, 0.43, and 0.49 mg/kg per day at years of study 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The median urinary protein/creatinine ratio was 1.58 g/g (range 0.49-4.60) before treatment. This decreased to 0.98, 1.09, 1.35, 1.11, and 1.38 g/g after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. The median creatinine clearance at baseline was 100 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (range 82-133) and after 5 years 92 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (range 22-115). Three patients did not reach the target dose of enalapril because of orthostatic hypotension. One of them was the only patient to develop chronic renal failure within 5 years. The present study indicates that enalapril reduces urinary protein excretion and preserves glomerular filtration in Alport patients as a group. However, there was individual variation, as in most studies of patients with proteinuric nephropathies given inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "652": "Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70s including Hsp72 and Hsp73 are suggested to play an important role in the cardioprotection against stress-induced functional damage. Myocardial tolerance against ischemia/reperfusion injury is increased when myocardial Hsp72 is accumulated after an exposure of normal animals to heat shock. Post-ischemic contractile recovery is improved in the perfused heart of Hsp72-overexpressed mice. However, the role of Hsp72 and Hsp73 in the failing heart following acute myocardial infarction remains unclear. The present study was undertaken to determine whether Hsp72 and Hsp73 production may contribute to the protection of cardiac function in rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) following coronary artery ligation (CAL). The rats with CAL revealed the signs of CHF at the 8th week after the operation. The hearts isolated from rats with CHF were perfused and then subjected to heat shock (at 42 degrees C) for 15 min followed by 6-h perfusion (HS group). The cardiac function of the HS group was markedly decreased and the heat shock-induced increase in myocardial Hsp72 and Hsp73 was attenuated after 6-h perfusion. In the CAL rat treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril from the 2nd to the 8th week, induction of Hsp70s was preserved and heat stress-induced reduction in cardiac function was attenuated. The results suggest that a reduction in the production of Hsp70s may play a significant role in the decrease in contractile function during the development of heart failure.", 
    "653": "Chronic heart failure is a slowly progressive disease. Hemodynamic deterioration activates various neuro-humoral factors and increases stresses, such as catecholamine, angiotensin II (AII), cytokines, endothelin, wall stress, ischemia, tachycardia, and oxidative stress. These factors affect the myocardium to cause phenotype switching, leading to ventricular remodeling. We investigated the effects of pharmacological blocking for neuro-humoral factors in rats with dilated cardiomyopathy. Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was elicited in Lewis rats by immunization with cardiac myosin. After acute inflammation healed, rats were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), type 1 AII receptor blockers, and amiodarone. These agents had favorable effects on hemodynamics and myocardial contractility, prevented fibrosis, suppressed the expression of ANP, and reversed phenotypic change of cardiac myosin. AII receptor blockers were less effective than ACEI. In order to prevent ventricular remodeling in chronic heart failure, wide and complete blocking of neuro-humoral factors is important.", 
    "654": "The present study was undertaken to examine whether plasma fibrinogen persistently elevates in subtotal nephrectomized rats, an animal model with inflammatory renal changes. Eight weeks after the induction of 5/6 nephrectomy in male Wistar rats, plasma fibrinogen concentration was determined for the next 12 weeks in the animals received vehicle or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril (1 or 10 mg/kg per day) orally. In the vehicle-treated nephrectomized rats, plasma fibrinogen concentration significantly (P<0.001) increased (from 127.3 +/- 4.6 [S.E.M.] to 182.3 +/- 5.2 mg/dL) compared with that in the control rats (from 118.0 +/- 2.0 to 153.5 +/- 5.4 mg/dL). Cilazapril attenuated the increases in plasma fibrinogen concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Serum concentration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a key macrophage chemoattractant and activator, increased in the vehicle-treated nephrectomized rats, which was also reduced by cilazapril. These results suggest that plasma fibrinogen elevates persistently in the nephrectomized rats. Local inflammation may be involved in the hepatic fibrinogen synthesis in this model.", 
    "655": "Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduce kidney function. The study tests the hypothesis that these two classes of drugs have similar effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 24-hour blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Using a randomized crossover design, 25 black and Hispanic hypertensive participants (mean age 58+/-3 years) with osteoarthritis were studied. All participants received an ACE inhibitor at baseline. Once systolic blood pressure was <140 mm Hg, either celecoxib 200 mg/d or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started. After measurements were obtained, all participants underwent a 2-week washout period and crossed over to the other drug for 4 weeks. A significant difference in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure was noted between groups at 4 weeks (+4.1+/-1.1 mm Hg diclofenac versus +0.6+/-0.6 mm Hg celecoxib; P=0.01). However, because celecoxib has duration of action shorter than 24 hours, we compared ambulatory values at celecoxib trough and peak activities. At peak, no difference in systolic blood pressure was noted between agents (+3.6+/-0.04 mm Hg diclofenac versus +4.2+/-1.9 mm Hg celecoxib; P=0.67). GFR was also differentially affected at 24 hours (-9.9+/-2.4 mL/min diclofenac versus -0.4+/-1.2 mL/min celecoxib; P=0.01). We conclude that diclofenac and celecoxib increase systolic blood pressure at peak levels; however, these agents differ in their 24-hour effects. Differences observed in blood pressure response between COX inhibitors may not be related in their sensitivity but rather their dosing frequency.",

A substantial body of literature links low cholesterol level to aggressive behavior; statin randomized trials have not supported a connection, but they have not been designed to address this issue. A limited number of reports suggest a connection between reduced cholesterol level and reduced serotonin level, but more information is needed with serotonin measures that are practical for clinical use.

Treatment with enalapril induces smooth muscle cell apoptosis and regression of aortic hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), whereas combined blockade of angiotensin II AT(1) and AT(2) receptors does not. We postulated that vascular apoptosis with enalapril involves enhanced half-life of bradykinin (BK) and kinin B(2) receptor stimulation. 2. SHR, 11-weeks old, were treated for 4 weeks with enalapril (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), Hoe 140 (500 microg kg(-1) day(-1); B(2) receptor antagonist), alone or in combination. Controls received vehicle. 3. The half-life of hypotensive responses to intra-arterial bolus injections of BK were significantly increased in SHR anesthetized after 4 weeks of enalapril, an effect prevented by Hoe 140. The magnitude of BK-induced hypotension was significantly attenuated in all rats treated with Hoe 140. 4. As compared to placebo, enalapril treatment significantly reduced blood pressure (-34+/-2%), aortic hypertrophy (-20+/-3%), hyperplasia (-37+/-5%) and DNA synthesis (-61+/-8%), while it increased aortic DNA fragmentation by two-fold. Hoe 140 given alone or in combination with enalapril affected none of these parameters. 5. As a possible alternative mechanism, aortae isolated during the second week of enalapril treatment showed a transient upregulation of contractile responses to des-Arg(9)BK (EC(50)<1 nM), which were significantly reduced by [Leu(8)]des-Arg(9)BK (10 microM). Moreover, in vitro receptor autoradiography revealed an increase in expression of B(1) and B(2) receptor binding sites by 8-11 days of enalapril treatment. 6. Aortic apoptosis induction and hypertrophy regression with enalapril do not involve kinin B(2) receptors in SHR. Kinins acting via B(1) receptors remains a candidate mechanism.", 
    "665": "One of the most thoroughly studied systems in relation to its prognostic relevance in patients with breast cancer, is the plasminogen activation system. This system comprises of, among others, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its main inhibitor (PAI-1). In this study we investigated whether the uPA:PAI-1 complex is associated with the responsiveness of patients with primary breast cancer to adjuvant systemic therapy. Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess the levels of uPA, PAI-1, and uPA:PAI-1 complex in 1119 tumors of patients with primary invasive breast cancer. These patients were followed for a median follow-up time of 59 months (range, 2-267 months) after the primary diagnosis. Correlations with well-known clinicopathological factors, and univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed. High uPA:PAI-1 complex levels were correlated with an adverse histological grade, and inversely associated with negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status. High tumor levels of uPA:PAI-1 complex predicted an early relapse in the univariate relapse-free survival analysis (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that high uPA:PAI-1 complex levels were associated with a decreased relapse-free survival time (P = 0.033), independently of age, tumor size, number of lymph nodes affected, progesterone receptor status, uPA, adjuvant endocrine, and chemotherapy. More important, it was demonstrated that there is a larger benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with higher versus lower tumor levels of uPA:PAI-1 complex. The results of this study imply that the expression of uPA:PAI-1 complex independently predicts the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer.", 
    "666": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major health problem associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Defects in the action and/or secretion of insulin are the two major abnormalities leading to development of glucose intolerance. Any intervention in the impaired glucose tolerance phase that reduces resistance to insulin or protects the beta-cells, or both, should prevent or delay progression to diabetes. The natural history of type 2 diabetes includes a preceding period of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG) which provides an opportunity for targeted intervention within large communities. As the prevalence of this metabolic disorder is rapidly increasing and current treatment fails to stabilise the disease in most patients, prevention should be considered as a key objective in the near future. Lifestyle intervention studies have consistently shown that quite modest changes can reduce the progression from IGT to diabetes by 50-60%. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) randomised trial has shown that a combined program of weight loss, improvement of diet and increase of physical exercise lowers the risk for development of type 2 diabetes by 58% compared with placebo. It may, however, not be possible to translate these successful findings to larger cohorts or maintain the lifestyle changes longer term. This has lead to consideration of pharmacotherapy. Benefits have been found for metformin, acarbose and troglitazone. Treatment with metformin was less effective than lifestyle modifications, resulting in an average reduction of risk for development of type 2 diabetes by 31% compared with placebo. Similarly, acarbose in the STOP-NIDDM trial reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in patients with IGT by 25%. Remarkably, cardiovascular event rates, in particular myocardial infarction, were significantly reduced when acarbose was used instead of placebo in subjects with glucose intolerance. The ACE inhibitors captopril (CAPPP) or ramipril (HOPE) and the Angiotensin-II receptor antagonist losartan (LIFE) have been shown to reduce the appearance of diabetes by one third when given to patients with hypertension. Since many hypertensive patients are insulin-resistant and have an increased risk in developing type 2 diabetes, the protective effect of these classes of antihypertensive drugs might be explained by their antiinsulin-resistance effects.", 
    "667": "Dynamic capillary electrophoresis (DCE) and computer simulation of the elution profiles with the stochastic model has been applied to determine the isomerization barriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The separation of the rotational cis-trans isomeric drug has been performed in an aqueous 20 mM borate buffer at pH 9.3. Interconversion profiles featuring plateau formation and peak broadening were observed. To evaluate the rate constants k(cis-->trans) and k(trans-->cis) of the cis-trans isomerization from the experimental electropherograms obtained by dynamic capillary electrophoresis, elution profiles were analyzed by a simulation with iterative convergence to the experimental data using the ChromWin software which requires the total migration times of the individual isomers t(R), the electroosmotic break-through time t(0), the plateau height h(plateau), the peak widths at half height of the individual isomers w(h), as well as the peak ratio of the isomers as experimental data input. From temperature-dependent measurements between 0 degrees and 15 degrees C the thermodynamic parameters Delta G, Delta H and Delta S, the rate constants k(cis-->trans) and k(trans-->cis) and the kinetic activation parameters Delta G*, Delta H*, and Delta S* of the cis-trans isomerization of enalaprilat were obtained. From the activation parameters the isomerization barriers at 37 degrees C were calculated to be Delta G* (trans-->cis) = 87.2 kJ.mol(-1) and Delta G*(cis-->trans) = 91.9 kJ.mol(-1).",

The spectrophotometric method depends on measuring the formed yellow color at 470 nm after optimization of the reaction conditions. The HPLC method is based on measurement of the derivatized product using fluorescence detection at 540 nm (excitation at 470 nm). The separation of the derivatized drug, the excess reagent and the internal standard (bumetanide) was performed on a reversed-phase ODS column using isocratic elution with methanol-0.02 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 3.0 (55:45, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.

Normal control rats (n = 7) received saline rather than puromycin, and an untreated control group (n = 7) received puromycin but no treatment. After 12 weeks, stained sections of the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium were evaluated for injury. Immunohistochemistry staining measured extracellular matrix components, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), osteopontin, ED-1-positive cells, and alpha-actin. TGFbeta1 mRNA was assessed by in situ hybridization. Renin, ACE activity, angiotensin, and aldosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay or colorimetry. In the untreated rats, chronic renal injury progressed to marked fibrosis at 12 weeks. Astragalus and Angelica significantly reduced deterioration of renal function and histologic damage. Expressions of type III and IV collagen, fibronectin, and laminin also decreased significantly. This anti-fibrotic effect was similar to that of enalapril. The herbs had no effect on the renin-angiotensin system but did reduce the number of ED-1-positive, and alpha-actin positive cells and expression of osteopontin compared to untreated controls. The combination of Astragalus and Angelica retarded the progression of renal fibrosis and deterioration of renal function with comparable effects of enalapril. These effects were not caused by blocking the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, but associated with suppression of the overexpression of TGFbeta1 and osteopontin, reduction of infiltrating macrophages, and less activation of renal intrinsic cells [corrected].",

There were indeed concentration-dependent strain differences. Ang-(1-7) prevented Ang I- and Ang II-mediated changes in vascular resistance more potently in SHR-SP than in WKY by inhibiting ACE and by blocking AT1-receptors. Ang-(1-7) by itself had no influence on renal vascular tone in both strains. Ang-(1-7) inhibited Ang I-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release more potently than Ang II-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release.

The mechanism(s) for progression of anthracycline cardiotoxicity to late cardiomyopathy is unknown. Because angiotensin II has been implicated in the progression of other cardiomyopathies, this investigation was undertaken to determine whether treatment with an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, reduces the time-dependent effects of doxorubicin on cardiac gene expression and myocellular apoptosis. A single dose of saline (control) or doxorubicin (DOX treated; 2 mg/kg iv) was administered to rabbits. Control and DOX-treated groups were also subgrouped to receive lisinopril and designated as lisinopril or DOX + lisinopril, respectively (1 mg/kg/d oral), for 10 wk. Histopathology, as determined at the light and ultrastructural level, was consistent with a reduced number of cardiomyocytes relative to interstitial cells in the left ventricle (LV) of the DOX-treated group compared with control and DOX + lisinopril groups. Gene expression of the pro-atrial naturetic peptide (ANP), quantified by steady-state messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blotting, increased approx 12-fold (n = 10; p < 0.05) in the LV of DOX-treated groups compared to control and DOX + lisinopril groups. Increased ANP mRNA expression following doxorubicin dosing was localized predominantly in ventricular myocytes by in situ hybridization. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation, determined by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling), was increased in both DOX-treated and DOX + lisinopril groups compared to the control group. Lisinopril prevented both late-onset increased ventricular ANP expression and subsequent DOX-induced myocyte loss. The authors speculate that these protective effects of lisinopril are related to reduced ANP expression and myocyte loss, the latter possibly mediated by effects on myocellular apoptosis.",

The hamsters were randomized to oral treatment for 4 weeks with vehicle (n=11), NCX 899 (NCX, 25 mg/kg, n=10), or enalapril (25 mg/kg, n=10). In the vehicle group, fractional shortening by echocardiography decreased (-23.6+/-2.0%) and LV end-diastolic dimension) increased (+10.9+/-1.0%), whereas fractional shortening increased (+17.5+/-4.4%) in NCX and was unchanged in the enalapril group (both P<0.01 vs. vehicle). End-diastolic dimension decreased only in NCX. LV contractility (LVdP/dt max and Emax) was significantly greater in NCX than in enalapril or vehicle, while relaxation (Tau) was shortened in both NCX and enalapril vs. vehicle. ACE activity was inhibited equally by NCX and enalapril in the CM hamster, and plasma nitrate levels were increased only in NCX (P<0.05 vs. enalapril and vehicle). In aortic strips endothelium-independent relaxation occurred only with NCX. The superior effects of NO-releasing enalapril (NCX) vs. enalapril alone to enhance vascular effects, increase LV contractility and prevent unfavorable remodeling and are consistent with vascular delivery of exogenous NO.

Drugs which can modulate the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and attenuate inflammation stress, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, and cytokine antagonists may play active roles in the prevention and treatment of acute coronary syndrome when used in addition to conventional therapies (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, mechanical intervention strategies, etc).", 
    "714": "The aim of the present experiments was to determine angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in different parts of the porcine eye, and to examine whether an atherogenic diet influenced ACE activity. Female mini-pigs were fed a standard diet or a diet with high cholesterol to produce atherosclerosis. The animals were killed by an overdose of pentobarbital, and the eyes were enucleated and dissected into iris, ciliary body, retina, and choroid. Crude tissue homogenates were used for determination of ACE activity, which was done with a radioenzymatic assay. In pigs fed a normal diet, basal ACE activity was 18.1 +/- 1.6, 13.6 +/- 1.9, 4.4 +/- 0.6, and 44.7 +/- 8.5 units/mg for iris, ciliary body, retina, and choroid, respectively. The ACE activities in ocular tissues from the pigs that had been fed an atherogenic diet were not significantly different. Nor was the ACE activity in the abdominal aorta and serum significantly different between the two groups. In both groups, the ACE inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat, caused a significant inhibition of the ACE activity in the choroid and ciliary body, with enalaprilat being more potent. In the retina, ACE activity was inhibited significantly only in the group fed a normal diet, whereas ACE activity in the iris was not significantly inhibited in either group. We did not find any differences in ACE activity between pigs fed a normal diet and pigs fed an atherogenic diet, which is in disagreement with previous studies that showed an increased ACE activity in aorta from atherosclerotic mini-pigs. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but lower cholesterol levels are one possibility.",

As ROS appear to have a critical role in atherosclerosis, there has been considerable interest in identifying the enzyme systems involved and in developing strategies to reduce oxidative stress. Prospective clinical trials with vitamins and hormone replacement therapy have not fulfilled earlier promises, although there is still interest in other dietary supplements. Superoxide dismutase mimetics, thiols, xanthine oxidase and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors are currently receiving much interest, while animal studies using gene therapy show promise, but are still at an early stage. Of the drugs in common clinical use, there is evidence that ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and AT1 (angiotensin II type 1) receptor blockers have beneficial effects on oxidative stress above their antihypertensive properties, whereas statins, in addition to improving lipid profiles, may also lower oxidative stress.",

One of the markers that is closely correlated with the increased cardiovascular risk is microalbuminuria. A common mediator for the development of both, microalbuminuria and end organ damage seems to be Angiotensin II, the blockade of which apparently reduces microalbuminuria as well as end organ damage. Therefore we had a closer look into pathophysiology of microalbuminuria and the relevance for end organ damage and discuss current medical strategies to alleviate these diseases.",

However, despite the lack of financial data proving cost-effectiveness and against the background of a disorganized health care system in the US, some models of CKD care are being employed. At the present time, the most comprehensive models of care in the US are emerging in vertically integrated health care programs. Other models of care are developing in the setting of managed care health plans that employ CKD disease management programs, either developed internally or in partnership with renal disease management companies.", 
    "718": "The vascular hallmark of subjects with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis is increased aortic stiffness, a phenomenon independent of mean arterial blood pressure, wall stress, and standard cardiovascular risk factors such as plasma glucose, cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. These observations suggest that subtle links might associate arterial stiffness and kidney function in normotensive and hypertensive populations. Recently, aortic pulse wave velocity and creatinine clearance have been shown to be statistically associated in subjects with plasma creatinine < or =130 micromol/L, again independently of mean arterial blood pressure and classical cardiovascular risk factors. This association was even shown to predominate in subjects younger than age 55 years. In addition, acceleration of aortic pulse wave velocity with age was more important in these subjects than in untreated normotensive control individuals, and the phenomenon was consistently predicted by baseline plasma creatinine values. Among all antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors only were shown to exhibit a significant and independent effect on aortic stiffness. The use of these drugs was significantly associated with improvement of large aortic stiffness in subjects treated for hypertension. In conclusion, increased stiffness of central arteries is independently associated with reduced creatinine clearance in subjects with mild to severe renal insufficiency, indicating that kidney diseases may interact not only with small but also with large conduit arteries, independently of age, blood pressure level, and classical cardiovascular risk factors. Whether sodium, divalent ionic species (calcium, phosphates), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system play a role in such alterations remains to be elucidated.",

The brains of adult Fischer rats were irradiated stereotactically with 30 Gy using a single collimated beam. Six months after irradiation and 1.5 mg/kg day(-1) ramipril (started 2 weeks after irradiation), rats were assessed for optic nerve damage functionally, using visual evoked potential, and histologically. Results show that ramipril conferred significant modification of radiation injury, since rats receiving radiation alone showed a threefold lengthening in the mean peak latency in the visual evoked potential, whereas 75% of rats receiving radiation followed by ramipril had evoked potentials that resembled those of normal untreated control rats. The histology of irradiated and ramipril-treated optic nerves appeared nearly normal, while there was significant demyelination in both optic nerves of irradiated rats. The study represents the first demonstration of prophylaxis of radiation injury by a carboxyl-containing ACE inhibitor, providing a pharmacological strategy designed to reduce radiation-induced normal tissue damage.",

    "729": "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise in all ethnic groups. This is because of the increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, and the inadequate control of elevated blood pressure and other cardiovascular-renal risk factors, especially in ethnic minority populations. The implications of the aforementioned trends in risk factor prevalence and control are profound. Moreover, these trends negatively impact patient quality of life and place an enormous financial burden on the health care system for the provision of care to patients with CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thus, it is of utmost importance to devise strategies that prevent kidney disease and delay progressive loss of kidney function in persons with CKD. Proven strategies include pharmacological interventions that lower blood pressure to less than target levels (<130/80 mm Hg), attainment of optimal glycemic control (Hb A1c <7%), and reducing urinary protein excretion. It is also possible, although yet unproven, that correction of anemia and aggressive treatment of dyslipidemia may forestall the loss of kidney function. In general, ethnic minorities are underrepresented in most large trials. Recently, a few outcome clinical trials in blacks have reinforced the lessons of kidney function preservation already learned in nonblack populations. That is, the reversible risk factors for CKD appear to be virtually identical and, at least in nondiabetic CKD, pharmacological targeting of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers preserves kidney function better than non-RAAS blood pressure-lowering regimens, especially when significant proteinuria exists. Although more CKD studies in ethnic minorities are needed, until they become available, the best available evidence from the existing clinical trial database should be applied to minorities with CKD-even when specific data are not available for a specific racial or ethnic group. Why this approach? First, there are no known unique risk factors for kidney disease in any ethnic group. Second, poor control of reversible risk factors for CKD is universal, particularly in blacks and other ethnic minorities. Thus, it is logical to predict that more efficient use of strategies proven to forestall loss of kidney function will reduce the excess of CKD and ESRD in ethnic minorities relative to non-minority populations. However, medical-based strategies alone are probably not enough. The global epidemic of obesity will fuel the growing population of persons, especially among ethnic minorities, with diabetes, the main cause of CKD, ESRD, and CVD. The obesity and diabetes epidemics are unlikely to abate without innovative and ultimately effective public health approaches.", 
    "730": "The objective was to identify subgroups of patients with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who may benefit from immediate intervention. In the DRASTIC study, patients with hypertension, significant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, and a normal or mildly impaired renal function were randomized between immediate balloon angioplasty (PTRA; n=56) and drug therapy followed by angioplasty after 3 months, if needed (Med-PTRA; n=50). In this secondary analysis of the data, changes in the renal function and blood pressure after 1 year were studied by analysis of covariance in the following subgroups: patients with positive captopril-renin challenge test, abnormal captopril renogram, recently developed hypertension, bilateral stenosis, and severe stenosis. We found a benefit of immediate angioplasty only for patients with bilateral stenosis. Their creatinine clearance had decreased (mean+/-s.d.: -4.2+/-13.5 ml/min) in the Med-PTRA group, whereas it had improved substantially (+10.0+/-15.7 ml/min) in the PTRA group (P=0.02). For patients with unilateral stenosis, the change in creatinine clearance did not differ between PTRA and Med-PTRA (+4.3+/-15.5 and +1.3+/-12.5 ml/min, respectively). The patients with bilateral stenosis also seemed to benefit most from immediate intervention with regard to blood pressure control. None of the other subgroups had a clear benefit of immediate intervention regarding renal function or blood pressure control. In conclusion, intervention should not be postponed in patients with bilateral stenosis, even if renal function is normal. Other hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery disease could initially well be treated by aggressive multidrug therapy alone unless hypertension persists or renal function deteriorates.", 
    "731": "It is suggested that vasoconstriction mediated by angiotensin II cleaved from angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is counterbalanced by concomitant formation of vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Here, we tested this hypothesis using as a bioassay the isolated rat lung perfused with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution and ventilated with negative pressures. Addition of angiotensin I (100 nM) into the isolated lung resulted in an immediate increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (Delta PAP) which was not accompanied by a significant change in respiratory lung function or weight of the lung. The Delta PAP response induced by angiotensin I was abolished by an inhibitor of ACE, perindoprilate (1 microM), or by angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist (losartan, 1 microM) but not by angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonist (PD 123.319, 10 microM) suggesting the involvement of ACE and AT1 (but not AT2) receptors in this response. On the other hand, antagonist of bradykinin receptor B2 (icatibant, 100 nM) or an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase, thiorphan (1 microM and 10 microM) did not modify DeltaPAP response induced by angiotensin I. In summary, in the isolated rat lung perfused with KH solution, ACE has a dominant role in the pulmonary conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, while NEP-derived angiotensin 1-7 does not seem to constitute a major counterbalancing mechanism in the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by endogenously formed angiotensin II.",

Significant regression of LVH occurred with losartan versus atenolol in the LIFE study, as well as in the diabetes mellitus and ISH substudies. In the LIFE study, although BP reduction was similar for the two treatments, the risk of a cardiovascular event (the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction; primary endpoint), stroke, or new-onset diabetes mellitus was significantly lower with losartan than with atenolol. Losartan was generally well tolerated in patients with hypertension and LVH in the LIFE study. Significantly fewer losartan than atenolol recipients discontinued treatment because of adverse events, drug-related adverse events, or serious, drug-related adverse events.", 
    "740": "ACE inhibitors induce metabolic changes and exert cardioprotective and vasoprotective properties, some of which cannot be attributed to their antihypertensive effect per se. Moexipril is an ACE inhibitor with a lipophilicity in the same range as quinapril, benazepril or ramipril, and so can readily penetrate lipid membranes and thus target tissue ACE in addition to plasma ACE. Evidence from animal studies shows similar and significant (p < 0.05) reductions in tissue ACE activity for moexipril and quinapril. Moexipril may improve endothelial dysfunction; moexiprilat and ramiprilat have demonstrated greater activity than captopril, enalaprilat and quinaprilat in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response, mediated by activation of the bradykinin B(2) receptor. ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may exert neuroprotective effects. Moexipril promoted neuronal survival in vitro and it is thought that this neuroprotective effect is due to free radical scavenging properties of the drug. ACE inhibitors can also decrease progression of renal insufficiency in patients with various underlying renal diseases. Moexipril may also have a renoprotective effect as it increased the ultrafiltration coefficient and normalized urinary protein excretion in rat models. Preclinical studies indicate that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a role in the regulation of bone resorption and moexipril had no adverse effects on bone metabolism in animal models and the drug did not hamper the osteoprotective effects of estrogen. Reduction in left ventricular mass with moexipril in patients with hypertension was similar in magnitude to the effect of other ACE inhibitors. When investigated in hypertensive patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk, moexipril increased arterial distensibility and demonstrated antioxidative properties in addition to efficiently controlling blood pressure. Moexipril does not adversely affect serum levels of uric acid, lipids, blood glucose levels and plasma insulin levels and can be co-administered with hormone replacement therapy. Moreover, quality-of-life data suggest favorable effects of moexipril treatment in a patient population at high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "741": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well recognized for its importance in regulation of BP, electrolyte balance and vascular growth. Pharmacological suppression of the RAS, through ACE inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade, is a proven effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of a range of cardiovascular diseases. Renin is the enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of RAS, the cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (A-I). A-I is then further converted by ACE to the biologically active vasoconstrictor, A-II. Interruption of the generation of A-II by renin inhibitors at this highly specific initial step of the cascade would be expected to have similar but not identical effects to those of the already well established RAS antagonists. Due to the lack of effective alternative enzyme pathways, blockade of A-II production may be more effective with renin inhibition than with ACE inhibition, and because of the high specificity of renin for only one substrate, namely angiotensinogen, adverse effects would be expected to be less frequent. It is currently unclear whether blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)), leaving other A-II receptors unblocked, is preferable to the reduction in plasma and tissue A-II levels achieved with either ACE or renin inhibition. The development of early peptidic and peptidomimetic renin inhibitors was hampered by problems with oral bioavailability and high costs of synthesis. However recent work has led to the synthesis of a potent non-peptidic inhibitor of renin, aliskiren, which has acceptable oral bioavailability. This renin inhibitor has been shown to effectively reduce A-II levels in normal volunteers and to lower BP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. It appears likely that aliskiren is the first of a new class of agents that may prove useful in the management of patients with nephropathy, heart failure and atherosclerosis in addition to hypertension.", 
    "742": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) in children occurs mostly as a result of systolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle or of congenital defects leading to large left-to-right shunts and pulmonary overcirculation. The ensuing symptoms and signs are similar in both cases, and include respiratory distress, poor feeding and growth, and hepatic congestion. Grading the severity of the symptoms accurately and reproducibly is important for studying CHF and the response to therapy. The Ross classification for young children and the New York Heart Association classification for older children are frequently utilized for such grading. The standard therapy for CHF in children consists of diuretics, to reduce cardiac preload and improve symptoms, and the maximization of nutritional support. The role of digoxin in treating CHF in children is controversial, especially regarding those children with pulmonary overcirculation where the function of the systemic ventricle is usually well preserved. As the importance of neurohormonal changes in the pathogenesis of worsening CHF is elucidated, newer medications aimed at counteracting such changes are becoming more important in the medical therapy of CHF in children. ACE inhibitors improve function and survival in adults with CHF, and they probably do the same in children with systemic ventricular dysfunction. It is less clear how effective they are in pulmonary overcirculation, but patients with high flow and low pulmonary resistance are most likely to benefit. In infants receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors, it is necessary to monitor for renal insufficiency or renal failure. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade has also been established as an effective therapy for adults with CHF with beneficial effects on survival and left ventricular function. While data for the pediatric population are limited, early studies suggest that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) may work well in infants and children with CHF. Caution must be used by starting treatment with very low dosages of beta-blockers and gradually increasing to the desired goals with close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. It is clear that larger multicenter trials are crucial to our ability to provide the most appropriate treatment for children with CHF. The demand for effective medical treatment will increase as more patients with palliated single ventricles survive surgery and then develop CHF from dysfunction of a hypertrophic and dilated single ventricle.", 
    "743": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) have been associated with mortality in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). All 3 main mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis - reentry, trigger activity, and automatism - have been implicated. Arrhythmogenic substrates in IDCM favor these mechanisms and are often potentiated by electrolyte imbalance secondary to diuretic treatment, by antiarrhythmic drugs, or by bradycardia, leading to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Myocardial macroreentry is the mechanism most frequently responsible for monomorphic VT in IDCM; however, focal activation and His-Purkinje macroreentry are often responsible and, especially in the latter case, are frequently unrecognized. Clinical suspicion and final recognition by electrophysiologic testing have important therapeutic consequences, because both focal activation and His-Purkinje macroreentry can be treated effectively by catheter ablation. On the other hand, the frequent recurrences of myocardial macroreentrant VT after ablation require this therapy to be used in combination with drugs or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have a beneficial effect for primary prevention of VA in IDCM. Type III antiarrhythmics have a neutral effect on mortality and type I antiarrhythmics should be avoided. Treatment of nonsustained VT in IDCM is controversial because it often presents without symptoms and is linked more to overall mortality than to arrhythmic mortality. Empiric treatment with amiodarone or electrophysiologically guided sotalol are preferred to the use of other drugs for secondary prevention of sustained VA. ICDs should be implanted in patients who have been resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to VA, or in those with poorly tolerated VT and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Empiric treatment with amiodarone or electrophysiologically guided class III antiarrhythmics may also be alternatives for patients with IDCM and no severe left ventricular dysfunction, especially if VT is well tolerated.", 
    "744": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This condition leads to an increased risk of premature mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease and stroke. Many risk factors besides hyperglycemia in itself contribute to this increased risk, acting in a synergistic fashion. One of the most important risk factors is hypertension. Several recent clinical trials have shown the benefits of reducing high blood pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus to lower levels than have previously been recommended in clinical guidelines. In both the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study a significant trend for increased benefits associated with lower diastolic blood pressure levels was shown. Therefore, clinicians should be encouraged to do more to treat hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and increase the proportion of patients in whom acceptable blood pressure control is achieved. For example, in Sweden, acceptable blood pressure control is currently only achieved in about 20 to 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent evidence also points to the primary importance of a tight blood pressure control. This implies drug combination treatment for the majority of patients. Therefore, the clinician must be able to use a broad variety of antihypertensive drugs, and from these drugs choose alternative combinations with pharmacological synergism.", 
    "745": "Structural and functional properties of the arterial wall have been reported to be altered in hypertension, even at early stages of the disease. Morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension are primarily related to arterial damage that may affect one or several organs. Considering the potential implications of arterial assessment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, evaluation of the arterial effects of antihypertensive agents is recommended by numerous authorities. Among the noninvasive and simple methods to evaluate large arteries, pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement is widely used as an index of regional arterial stiffness. This method is related to the arterial geometry and wall function, simple and reproducible, and thus, can easily be applied in clinical trials. Several studies performed in various populations showed significant powerful interactions between PWV and cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, aortic PWV was shown to be a forceful marker and predictor of cardiovascular risk in normotensive individuals and patients with hypertension. Furthermore, aortic PWV was shown to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with essential hypertension. In comparison with placebo, clinical studies have shown that in short and long term trials, antihypertensive agents improved arterial stiffness (as evidenced by a reduction in PWV) independently of blood pressure reduction. The decrease of PWV was more pronounced with long term treatment than with short term treatment. Whether antihypertensive agents differ in their arterial effects independently of blood pressure changes remains unclear. Pharmacological studies, generally performed in small numbers of patients, indicate that the effects of long term treatment with ACE inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists and some beta-blockers on arterial stiffness are generally similar. The effectiveness of an antihypertensive agent in reducing arterial stiffness may also be influenced by the genetic background of the patient. Recently, the Complior Study has shown the feasibility to assess arterial stiffness in clinical trials involving large populations using an automatic device for measuring PWV. Long term treatment with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, was associated with a decrease in blood pressure and aortic PWV in patients with essential hypertension. In high risk patients with end-stage renal failure, ACE inhibitors effectively decreased arterial stiffness and had a favorable effect on survival which was independent of changes in blood pressure. The correlation between reversion of arterial stiffness and decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality needs to be confirmed in populations of patients with lower cardiovascular risk.", 
    "746": "ACE inhibitors have been used extensively in the management of patients with hypertension and heart failure. Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has emerged indicating that ACE inhibition also favorably affects the vasculature, and that these effects are associated with improved patient outcomes. Such evidence is provided by several sources: (i) experimental studies, which demonstrate that in addition to blood pressure lowering, ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function and have a host of other beneficial effects on the arterial wall; (ii) epidemiologic studies, which link the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to increased risk for myocardial infarction, and (iii) clinical trials, which demonstrate that treatment with these agents reduces the risk for acute ischemic events, improves the function of the arterial endothelium and can retard the progression of the anatomic extent of atherosclerosis.", 
    "747": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is associated with neurohormonal activation which contributes to progressive ventricular remodeling and worsening clinical heart failure. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems are activated, not only in patients with clinically overt heart failure, but also in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Activation of the angiotensin and adrenergic systems produces deleterious effects on systemic and coronary hemodynamics, promotes myocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast growth, and myocyte necrosis and apoptosis. Thus, therapy of heart failure should consist of pharmacologic agents not only to relieve symptoms but also to prevent and attenuate ventricular remodeling and progressive heart failure, thereby improving prognosis. In patients who are symptomatic, ACE inhibitors along with digitalis and diuretics as initial therapy (triple therapy) have the greater potential to improve exercise tolerance and decrease the incidence of treatment failure compared with diuretics alone or a combination of diuretics and digitalis. Diuretics alone should not be considered for long-term therapy as plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, norepinephrine and vasopressin levels may increase. ACE inhibitors decrease mortality in patients with heart failure resulting from left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The results of presently available studies indicate that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) do not provide any advantage over ACE inhibitors regarding survival benefit but may be better tolerated. Long-term adrenergic inhibition with the use of ss-adrenoceptor antagonists added to ACE inhibitors is associated with attenuation of ventricular remodeling, improvement in ventricular function and clinical class and survival of patients with symptomatic systolic left ventricular failure. Thus, initial pharmacotherapy for systolic heart failure should consist of: maximal tolerated dosages of ACE inhibitors;ARBs if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated because of intractable cough or angioedema;adequate dosages of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate if ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not tolerated; relatively low dosages of digoxin (serum concentrations of < or = 1.0 ng/dl) if not contraindicated; and diuretics to relieve congestive symptoms. Addition of spironolactone to ACE inhibitors can result in a significant reduction in the risk of sudden death in patients with symptomatic severe heart failure. Myocardial infarction resulting from ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of systolic left ventricular failure and the therapeutic modalities with potential to reduce the risks of myocardial infraction, such as risk factor modification, adequate control of diabetes and hypertension, antiplatelet agents and lipid-lowering agents, should also be included in the initial therapy.", 
    "748": "Patients with end-stage renal disease die from cardiovascular disease at a much younger age than people in the general population do. Here, we review the evidence linking early renal insufficiency (ERI) to an increased cardiovascular risk. A number of cardiovascular risk factors become prevalent with ERI, including night-time hypertension, increase in serum levels of lipoprotein (a), homocysteine and asymmetric dimethyl-arginine, and insulin resistance. Also, an epidemiologic association between coronary artery disease (CAD) and nephrosclerosis, a frequent cause of ERI in the elderly, is documented. In the middle-aged, general population ERI, found in 8% of women and 9% of men, was not associated with cardiovascular disease. However, in a representative sample of middle-aged British men the risk of stroke was 60% higher for the subgroup of individuals with ERI. In people at high cardiovascular risk (mostly CAD), the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study found a 2-fold (unadjusted) or 1.4-fold (adjusted) higher incidence of cardiovascular outcomes with ERI. The incidence of primary outcome increased with the level of serum creatinine. At least four studies have determined the cardiovascular risk associated with ERI in hypertension. In Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, as in HOPE, cardiovascular mortality increased with higher serum creatinine levels (5-fold difference in cardiovascular mortality between the lowest and the highest creatinine strata). In patients with hypertension with low risk, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment and a small Italian trial found about a doubling in cardiovascular outcomes in ERI. However, in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, not baseline serum creatinine level, but its increase on follow-up predicted future cardiovascular disease. These observational data suggest that ERI, independent of etiology, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, present in 10% of a population at low, and up to 30% at high, cardiovascular risk. No prospective therapeutic trials aimed at reducing the cardiovascular burden in individuals with ERI are available. Subgroup analyses of the HOPE study indicate that ACE inhibition with ramipril is beneficial without an increased risk of adverse effects like acute renal failure or hyperkalemia. Thus the frequent practice of withholding ACE inhibitors from patients with mild renal insufficiency is unwarranted, especially since this identifies a group at high risk who appears to benefit most from treatment. In addition, there is evidence that ACE inhibitors improve renal outcomes in renal insufficiency. Prospective studies should test the predictive power of ERI for cardiovascular disease and therapeutic options.", 
    "749": "Restenosis rates after coronary stent implantation in complex lesions are between 30 and 50%. Neointimal hyperplasia promoted by complex interaction between cellular and acellular elements, such as cytokines and growth factors, is thought to be the primary process responsible for restenosis. The risk of in-stent restenosis is increased in patients with a history of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, in long lesions, in total occlusions, in patients with diabetes mellitus, in small vessels, in the proximal parts of the left anterior descending coronary artery and in cases of stent oversizing. In-stent restenosis represents a serious economic burden on society because treatment strategies include expensive approaches such as cutting-balloon angioplasty, rotational atherectomy and brachytherapy. A number of pharmacological agents, including ACE inhibitors, have been unsuccessful in preventing restenosis. Alternative procedures such as brachytherapy, radioactive stents and drug-eluting stents are under evaluation. Although sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents have been associated with very low restenosis rates over durations of 6 to 12 months, the long-term efficacy and tolerability of this approach is currently being investigated. Although ACE inhibitors have failed in reducing restenosis rates, the selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist valsartan has shown encouraging results in the single-center Valsartan for Prevention of Restenosis after Stenting of Type B2/C lesions trial (ValPREST). The ValPREST trial is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study to have evaluated the effect of an angiotensin receptor antagonist on in-stent restenosis in a moderate number of patients. Compared with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers exert additional effects on the pathophysiological processes which lead to restenosis. Angiotensin receptor antagonists may affect several mechanisms involved in neointimal hyperplasia such as decreasing circulating cytokine and growth factor levels and reducing neutrophil activation, especially after stenting in acute coronary syndromes, but the results need to be confirmed in a large multicenter trial. The question whether long-term therapy, with an oral angiotensin receptor antagonist, is cost-effective and whether angiotensin receptor antagonists should be used as an add-on therapy to drug-eluting stents, requires clarification.", 
    "750": "Valsartan, an orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist with selectivity for the AII type I (AT(1)) receptor subtype, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with heart failure (New York Health Association class II-IV) who are intolerant of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Results from the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) showed that in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) [n = 5010], valsartan 160 mg twice daily, when used in combination with conventional therapy for heart failure, reduced the risk of the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity by 13.2% compared with placebo. However, there was no significant difference in overall mortality between the valsartan and placebo groups. Morbidity was defined as cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or administration of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator drugs for > or =4 hours without hospitalization. Among patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor, irrespective of concomitant beta-blocker use, valsartan reduced the risk of mortality and the combined endpoint by 33.1% and 44% compared with placebo; total hospitalizations for heart failure were also significantly lower in the valsartan group (27.6 vs 64.6%). In the subgroup of patients who were taking an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker at baseline (n = 1610), mortality was significantly higher in the valsartan group than in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the valsartan and placebo groups which led to discontinuation of treatment were dizziness, renal impairment (both of which occurred in significantly more valsartan recipients) and hypotension.", 
    "751": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common disease with high associated morbidity and mortality, and the outcome appears to be worse in black compared with white patients. There is currently no clear consensus for basing the pharmacological treatment of CHF on racial differences. Most studies that have investigated the potential effects of racial differences on pharmacological responses in heart failure have been based on African Americans and white participants. Using these data, this review will discuss the current understanding of the effects of racial differences in response to pharmacotherapy in heart failure, possible mechanisms for these observed differences, and how this may impact on patient management. Diuretics have favorable symptomatic benefits in both black and white patients with heart failure with evidence of fluid retention. ACE inhibitors seem to be less effective in the treatment of black patients with heart failure compared with white patients. This may be due to low pre-existing activity of the renin-angiotensin system in blacks. The role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of all patients with heart failure is incompletely defined and there are no clear trial data to show any difference in effect between black and white patients with heart failure. There is good evidence for the use of spironolactone in all patients with heart failure, but no evidence for a different effect in black patients. Similarly, there is no conclusive data to suggest a difference in effect of digoxin in different racial groups. The evidence available would suggest that certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (certainly carvedilol but not bucindolol) are effective in both black and white patients with CHF. The combination of hydralazine and nitrates would appear to be particularly effective in black patients with CHF though the African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) trial should provide clearer evidence for the potentially greater beneficial effects of these two drugs in the black population. It is important to accept that racial categorization acts as only a surrogate marker for genetic or other factors responsible for individual responses to drug therapy and that any identified differences will not apply to all members of each stratified group. Nonetheless, in managing a complex, common and often fatal condition such as heart failure, recognizing potential individual differences in drug responses should enable the responsible clinician to provide a tailored and evidence-based approach to patient treatment.", 
    "752": "Calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) may either be divided into the dihydropyridines (e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, lacidipine, nilvadipine, nifedipine, nicardipine etc.), the phenylalkylamines (e.g. verapamil) and the benzothiazepines (e.g. diltiazem) according to their chemical structure, or into first generation agents (nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem) and second generation agents (subsequently developed dihydropyridine-derivatives). Second generation CCAs are characterized by greater selectivity for calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells than the myocardium, a longer duration of action and a small trough-to-peak variation in plasma concentrations. Heart failure is characterized by decreased cardiac output resulting in inadequate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Although the accompanying neurohormonal activation, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, is initially beneficial in increasing tissue perfusion, prolonged activation is detrimental because it increases afterload and further reduces cardiac output. At the level of the myocyte, heart failure is associated with increased intracellular calcium levels which are thought to impair diastolic function. These changes indicate that the CCAs would be beneficial in patients with heart failure. There has been a strong interest and increasing experience in the use of CCAs in patients with heart failure. Despite potential beneficial effects in initial small trials, findings from larger trials suggest that CCA may have detrimental effects upon survival and cardiovascular events. However, this may not necessarily be a 'class b' effect of the CCAs as there is considerable heterogeneity in the chemical structure of individual agents. Clinical experience with different CCAs in patients with heart failure includes trials that evaluated their effects on hemodynamic parameters, exercise tolerance and on symptomatology. However, the most relevant results are those from randomized clinical trials that assessed mortality as the primary endpoint. First generation CCAs have direct negative inotropic effects and even sustained release formulations have not proved any beneficial effect upon survival. With second generation CCAs, some benefit on hemodynamic parameters has been observed but none on survival, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors. It is noteworthy that although amlodipine had a neutral effect on morbidity and mortality in large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with heart failure, the drug was well tolerated. There is no specific indication for CCAs (first or second generation) in patients with systolic heart failure, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors, but amlodipine may be a considered in the management of hypertension or coronary artery disease in patients with heart failure.", 
    "753": "Although systemic hypertension is a common clinical disorder, hypertensive emergencies are unusual in clinical practice. Situations that qualify as hypertensive emergencies include accelerated or malignant hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute left ventricular failure, acute aortic dissection, pheochromocytoma crisis, interaction between tyramine-containing foods or drugs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, eclampsia, drug-induced hypertension and possibly intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to recognize these conditions since immediate lowering of systemic blood pressure is indicated. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies depends on the clinical manifestations rather than on the absolute level of the blood pressure. Depending on the target organ that is affected, the manifestations of hypertensive emergencies can be quite expressive, yet variable. Thus, the physician has to make the clinical diagnosis urgently in order to render appropriate therapy. Several parenteral drugs can quickly and effectively lower the blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. Intravenous fenoldopam, a selective dopamine (DA1) receptor agonist, offers the advantage of improving renal blood flow and causing natriuresis. Intravenous nicardipine may be beneficial in reserving tissue perfusion in patients with ischemic disorders. Whereas trimethaphan camsilate is the drug of choice for managing acute aortic dissection, hydralazine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of eclampsia. The alpha-adrenoceptor, phentolamine, is useful in patients with pheochromocytoma crisis. Enalaprilat is the only ACE inhibitor available for parenteral use and may be particularly useful in treating hypertensive emergencies in patients with heart failure. However, ACE inhibitors may cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure in patients who are hypovolemic. Although useful as adjunctive therapy in hypertensive crises, diuretics should be used with caution in these patients because prior volume depletion may be present in some conditions such as malignant hypertension. The treating physician should be familiar with the pharmacological and clinical actions of drugs which are indicated for and useful in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Once the patient's situation has stabilized, the patient may be switched to an oral medication and the physician should discuss long term follow up plans. With appropriate clinical diagnosis, hypertensive emergencies can be successfully treated and the complications can be prevented with timely intervention.",

Earlier trials have shown that ACE inhibitors, when given to patients with low ejection fractions, have reduced the relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and other ischemic events by 14-23%. Subsequently, the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study has shown that, in patients who are not known to have low ejection fraction or heart failure but are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular events, ramipril reduced the incidence of stroke, MI and death due to cardiovascular disease. Results from the HOPE study, in which 9297 patients were randomized to receive either ramipril 10 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 4.5 years, indicate that ramipril reduced the relative risk of the composite outcome of MI, stroke and cardiovascular death by 22%. The incidence of the composite outcome was significantly lower in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (14.0% vs 17.8%). Patients who received ramipril, compared with placebo recipients, had a significantly decreased incidence of stroke, MI or death due to cardiovascular disease (3.4% vs 4.9%, 9.9% vs 12.3% and 6.1% vs 8.1%, respectively). The relative risk of death from any cause was reduced among patients who received ramipril. In addition, treatment with ramipril reduced as the incidence of revascularization procedures, and, among patients with diabetes mellitus, ramipril reduced the incidence of complications related to diabetes mellitus, including the development of overt nephropathy. Moreover, in patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, ramipril, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the development of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving ramipril had a reduced rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness.",

Therefore, in addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, ramipril should be an integral part of secondary prevention therapy in patients at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular events.",

In diabetic renal disease many trials have noted a protective role of ACE inhibitor-based therapy over non-ACE inhibitor-based therapy. This paper reviews recent clinical trials evaluating hypertension-related kidney disease including the interim results of the African-American Study of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension (AASK) Study, to date the largest prospective study of African-American patients with kidney disease due to hypertension. This trial reports a renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitor-based therapy over calcium-channel antagonist- based therapy. The renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitor-based therapy may, in part, be due to their antiproteinuric effect independent of blood pressure lowering.",

We therefore hypothesised that increased ET-1 production in Streptozotocin-induced Type 1 diabetes causes abnormalities of cardiac capillaries and the aorta. To this end we compared the effects of an ET receptor A blocker (ETA-RB) with that of an ACE-inhibitor (ACE-i) or their combination in rats with Streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes.",

Capillary length density was lower in untreated STZ diabetic rats (2932+/-128 mm/mm3) compared to non-diabetic control rats (3410+/-252 mm/mm3). Treatment with ACE-i (3568+/-431 mm/mm3), but not with ETA-RB (2893+/-192 mm/mm3), prevented the decrease in capillary supply. Volume density of the myocardial interstitium was higher in untreated STZ diabetic rats (0.86+/-0.04%) compared to non-diabetic control rats (0.36+/-0.06%). In all three intervention groups the values were lower (ACE-i: 0.53+/-0.05%, ETA-RB: 0.7+/-0.08% and combination: 0.69+/-0.1).",

    "761": "Changes in arterial stiffness and structure occur during cardiovascular diseases and can be modified by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In the present study we investigated the role of membrane-bound ACE (t-ACE) in the regulation of arterial structure and mechanics. Large and small arteries of t-ACE-/- mice were isolated to determine the passive pressure-diameter relationship. We observed that t-ACE-/- mice exhibit a reduced arterial distensibility compared to t-ACE+/+ mice. This reduced arterial distensibility was also observed after 9 weeks of captopril treatment (80 mg/kg/ day). We hypothesized that bradykinin type 2 receptor (BK(2)) stimulation might be involved in the regulation of arterial stiffness. t-ACE-/- and t-ACE+/+ mice were treated with Hoe 140 (1 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. After Hoe 140 treatment, both the structural and mechanical changes observed in the t-ACE-/- carotid artery were abolished. Although Hoe 140 administration increased blood pressure in both groups by approximately 10 mm Hg, the pressure difference between the two groups did not change. Thus, t-ACE is involved in the regulation of arterial distensibility. The changes observed in t-ACE-/- mice are not caused by an altered fetal development. Moreover, it is likely that the regulation of arterial distensibility by ACE involves stimulation of the BK(2) receptor.", 
    "762": "Vasoactive peptides with vasoconstrictor properties play an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions. The peptides act via specific receptors, most of them belonging to the group of seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. These receptors have become important targets for drugs developed to inhibit vasoconstrictor actions. Alternatively, compounds which inhibit enzymes generating vasoactive peptides have also been demonstrated to represent valuable therapeutic tools. This review will first describe the properties and distribution of two very potent vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II and endothelin. It will further focus on their receptors and on new drugs, which act as antagonists for these receptors. In addition, the properties of indirectly acting drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and--in analogy--endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be presented.", 
    "763": "The use of angiotensin-receptor blockers has already been outlined in cardiology and diabetology. In extending clinical indications of this drug class their pleiotropic actions might play a role: they are improving endothelial function, and their antiatherogenic effect is not related to antihypertensive action. It may also be important that while some antihypertensive agents are impairing sexual function, angiotensin-receptor blocking agents seem to improve sexual activity in hypertensive men. As there is alternative route for angiotensin II synthesis, there are patients in whom blockade of angiotensin II actions do need more aggressive treatment for proper therapeutic results. The discovery of angiotensin-receptor blocking agents made possible to produce this blockade in the tissues as well, and suggested combined administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for better clinical results. In patients with congestive heart failure data from an earlier pilot study (RESOLVD) suggested that combined use of these two drug classes would lead for a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with better clinical results, especially in those patients in the higher dose ranges. Recent results showed that using this drug combination cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization because of worsening heart failure could significantly be decreased (CHARM-Added study). More important data are expected from the ongoing ONTARGET program (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial).", 
    "764": "The most effective and safest option for the prevention of atrial fibrillation and its sequelae--cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, stroke)--is primary prophylaxis. Here, the management of arterial hypertension--the most common cause underlying atrial fibrillation--is of considerable importance. In addition to blood pressure reduction, substances with an action of the autonomic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ACE-inhibitors, AT1 antagonists, beta blockers) have a positive effect on the remodeling, so-called, of the atrial myocytes, and thus on the occurrence of atrial fibrillation with its associated stroke risk. For patients with elevated blood pressure, therefore, the therapeutic strategy should, in the individual case, give consideration to the possibility of exerting a positive effect on atrial fibrillation.", 
    "765": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which can result from myocardial damage or ventricular pressure or volume overload, has genomic, cellular, and interstitial components with associated changes in ventricular size, shape, wall thickness, and function. It is a process that is detectable and measurable clinically, generally progressive, and associated with adverse outcomes. However, it is amenable to intervention, prevention, or reversal. Following myocardial infarction (MI), LV remodeling is particularly likely in patients with transmural or anterior infarction and in those with failed reperfusion or LV failure. Infarct artery patency and neurohormonal blockade are key management considerations for prevention or reversal of LV remodeling. Combination treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and beta-blockade is of proven benefit following MI, improving LV remodeling and long-term outcomes.", 
    "766": "Ethnic disparities in hypertension-related outcomes may relate to differences in medical care. This study assessed primary care sites serving low-income patients to determine if differences in process and treatment indicators might contribute to disparities in outcomes. Eight sites were enrolled with 100,000 patients, collectively. Trained nurses abstracted a random sample of medical records for diagnoses, laboratory data, medications, and demographic variables. Data were obtained on 1250 white and 2786 African-American adults. African Americans were more likely (p<0.01) to be hypertensive (44% vs. 23%) and diabetic (16% vs. 8%) than whites. African Americans were more likely to have serum creatinine, potassium, lipid, and glycosylated hemoglobin values recorded in the medical record than whites (p<0.01). African-American hypertensives were more likely (p<0.05) than white hypertensives to receive calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and combination therapy. Thus, there appeared to be little difference in the level of care between the two groups. Based on the sites examined, ethnic variations in important process and treatment indicators do not explain racial differences in cardiovascular and renal outcomes.", 
    "767": "The authors evaluated, in a community-based open-label trial, the effectiveness and safety of perindopril in 13,220 US hypertensive patients and studied how physicians adhere to hypertension treatment guidelines. Patients received perindopril 4 mg q.d. for 6 weeks. Based on physicians perception of blood pressure response, the patient was either maintained on 4 mg or the dose was increased to 8 mg for an additional 6 weeks. From baseline to week 12, the mean sitting blood pressure significantly declined from 156.9/94.5 mm Hg to 139.2/84.0 mm Hg. Further dose titration resulted in a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure in all patients with inadequate response on 4 mg at week 6. Blood pressure control (<140/<90 mm Hg) was achieved at 12 weeks in 48.8% patients. The subpopulation analyses demonstrated that perindopril monotherapy was effective in both men and women, in patients of all ethnicities, and in patients <65 and > or =65 years of age. Perindopril was safe and well tolerated in all hypertensive subgroups including high-risk patients. Physicians were more attuned to controlling diastolic than systolic blood pressure, and their adherence to the treatment guidelines was found to be not optimal.", 
    "768": "Diastolic dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a cause of congestive heart failure. Meta-analyses of earlier studies of this disorder suggest that 40%-50% of patients with the congestive heart failure syndrome have preserved left ventricular systolic function, with current estimates ranging up to 74%. Among patients >or=65 years of age with congestive heart failure, 55% of all subjects and 67% of women had normal systolic function. Histopathologic evaluation reveals a maladaptive remodeling of the interstitium associated with aging, resulting in an increase in interstitial collagen content. The interstitium normally plays a critical role in the generation of early diastolic suction. When there is a significant enough increase in myocardial collagen volume fraction, with its increased viscoelastic burden, this normal early diastolic suction is compromised and diastolic pressures increase. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction ensues. Neurohumoral abnormalities associated with diastolic dysfunction include activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, including increased elaboration of myocardial aldosterone. This excess of aldosterone appears to play a major role in the development of myocardial fibrosis. Recent observations in animal models and humans have demonstrated regression of interstitial collagen volume fraction in response to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone inhibition, with improvement in diastolic function. Therapeutic implications of these observations suggest targeting the maladaptive remodeling of the interstitium via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "769": "Glomerular endothelial dysfunction is believed to be responsible for the proteinuria and nephronal damage, namely tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, observed in severe nephrosis such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A dysfunctioning glomerular endothelium is likely to be induced by oxidative stress and oxidized LDL as well as altered immunocirculatory balance with a defective anti-inflammatory pathway. A defective release of vasodilator inconjunction with enhanced production of angiotensin II induces hemodynamic maladjustment by preferential constriction at the efferent arteriole. Such a hemodynamic maladjustment exerts two significant hemodynamic impacts. Close to the efferent constriction, it induces intraglomerular hypertension and glomerulosclerosis. Far from the efferent constriction, it reduces peritubular capillary flow, which eventually leads to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Treatment with a vasodilator improves the hemodynamic maladjustment but does not completely suppress proteinuria. A successful suppression of proteinuria is accomplished by using Ganoderma lucidum and vitamins C and E. The beneficial effect of Ganoderma lucidum appears to be multifactorial, including the modulation of immunocirculatory balance, antilipid, vasodilator, antiplatelet and improved hemorheology. Together with vitamins C and E, this helps to neutralize oxidative stress and suppress the toxic effect to the glomerular endothelial function.",

The high personal, social and financial costs of managing end-stage renal failure and the other complications associated with diabetic nephropathy make a powerful case for screening and effective intervention programmes to prevent the condition or retard its progression. As major breakthroughs in finding genetic susceptibility factors remain elusive, screening efforts continue to be based on microalbuminuria testing, despite increasing recognition of its limitations as a positive predictor of nephropathy. Interventions have been extensively studied, but results remain conflicting. Economic evaluations of such screening and intervention programmes are essential for health planners, yet models of the cost/benefit ratio of such interventions often rely on a rather slim evidence base. Where economic models are developed, they are frequently based on those papers that propound the greatest clinical benefits of a given intervention, leading to a possible over-estimation of the advantages of the chosen approach. Furthermore, the benefits of even such generally accepted interventions as ACE inhibitor treatment are less firmly established than generally appreciated. Lifestyle interventions are instinctively attractive, but are by no means a low-cost option (as is often assumed by both medical professionals and politicians). This review critically assesses the evidence for clinical efficacy and economic benefit of microalbuminuria screening and interventions such as intensive glycaemic control, antihypertensive treatment, ACE inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade, dietary protein restriction and lipid-modifying therapy. The various costs associated with diabetic nephropathy are so great that even expensive interventions may have a favourable cost/benefit ratio, provided they are truly effective.",

Aspirin therapy is the best-documented treatment to avoid another stroke, both in the acute and the long-term perspective. Warfarin treatment is fairly well documented for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Heparin therapy increases the risk for serious haemorrhage. Blood-pressure-lowering with a combined ACE-inhibitor and diuretic regimen has been shown to reduce the recurrence rate in younger patients with hemorrhagic as well as ischemic stroke. Statin therapy could be offered to younger stroke patients with a history of coronary heart disease. The increased occurrence of malignant diseases during statin therapy in elderly patients in one study deserves further investigations.", 
    "777": "Insulin excess exacerbates hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). This study examined the relative contribution of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system in this phenomenon. In SHR, daily subcutaneous injections of insulin were initiated either before short-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril or after lifetime captopril treatment. Insulin treatment resulted in significant increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and captopril treatment lowered arterial pressure, but captopril did not lower arterial pressure more in the insulin-treated compared with control rats. To test the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to this form of hypertension, each rat was intravenously infused with either a ganglionic blocker (i.e., hexamethonium) or a centrally acting alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist (i.e., clonidine). Administration of either agent largely eliminated the differences in mean arterial pressure and heart rate between the insulin-treated and saline-treated SHR, irrespective of captopril treatment. These data indicate that in SHR, the ability of insulin to increase blood pressure is closely related to sympathoexcitation, which is unresponsive to blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "778": "Exposure of normotensive rats to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in early life causes hypertrophy of intrarenal arteries. Similar defects have been found in knockout mice lacking angiotensinogen, ACE, or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors. On the other hand, transient inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system from 2 weeks of age in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), either with ACE inhibitors or with AT1 receptor antagonists partially prevents the increase in blood pressure. However, permanent treatment of SHR from conception onwards with ACE inhibitors completely prevents hypertension. Although these studies demonstrated protection from hypertension-induced changes in the heart and large arteries, renal arteries were not studied and follow-up did not extend beyond 6 months of age. We postulated that while brief exposure to ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists in young SHR would temporarily decrease blood pressure, it would also be associated with development of intrarenal arterial malformation, and ultimately have deleterious effects.", 
    "779": "Direct effects on intrarenal arterial morphology of an ACE inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/kg/day) and an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan, 50 mg/kg/day), administered from the last week of gestation until 8 weeks of age were examined in SHR. After stopping treatment at 8 weeks, we continued to monitor blood pressure until spontaneous death.", 
    "780": "Systolic blood pressure at 8 weeks was normalized by captopril and losartan (SHR control 187 +/- 8 mm Hg; captopril 118 +/- 5 mm Hg; and losartan 120 +/- 9 mm Hg). However, by 30 weeks, blood pressure had increased to control SHR levels. At 4 weeks, the media of renal arteries and arterioles was hypertrophied. Marked smooth muscle cell hyperplasia of cortical arteries resulted in significantly increased wall thickness by 8 weeks, despite similar external diameter. Arterial wall structure was disrupted, with fragmentation of elastic fibers and irregular distribution of collagen type I fibers. After stopping treatment, the rats gradually began to show poor health and all had died by 1 year of age, while all 1-year-old control SHR females were in good health. The cause of morbidity and mortality in the rats treated in early life was clearly malignant hypertension. Severe hypertrophy of renal arterioles was found, as well as cerebral hemorrhage.", 
    "781": "Despite initial normalization of blood pressure interference with the renin-angiotensin system during a crucial stage of development in SHR can initiate marked smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and disruption of the wall structure of the intrarenal arteries. Subsequent progression of this intrarenal process after cessation of treatment suggests an independent process that eventually results in malignant hypertension and early death."
