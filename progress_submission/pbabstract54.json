    "2": "In hypertensive patients, we evaluated flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD, high resolution ultrasound) of the brachial artery compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 25 microg s.l.). Automatic computerized analysis was used to measure brachial artery diameter on end-diastolic frames acquired every second during the study. Sixty-six healthy normotensive subjects were also evaluated to assess the presence of endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients.", 
    "3": "Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P< 0.01) lower FMD (5.9 +/- 2.5%) as compared to healthy controls (7.7 +/- 3.8%). The response to GTN was similar in normotensive subjects (7.5 +/- 3.1%) and hypertensive patients (7.2 +/- 6.5%). At baseline brachial artery diameter, FMD and response to GTN were similar in the nifedipine- and captopril-treated groups. Nifedipine and captopril similarly reduced blood pressure, but only nifedipine increased heart rate. Acute nifedipine, but not captopril, significantly (P< 0.01) increased brachial artery diameter, while FMD and response to GTN were not modified after nifedipine or captopril.",

    "5": "Hospital admission for congestive heart failure is extremely common and quite expensive, although it is frequently preventable. New drugs and therapies have been reported to reduce admissions, decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life for these patients. Patients with an ejection fraction less than 40 percent (decreased systolic function) should be treated with medication to improve symptoms and prevent progression of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a mainstay of treatment in patients who can tolerate them; in patients who cannot take these drugs, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents offer an alternative. Patients with New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure should also receive a beta blocker (metoprolol, carvedilol or bisoprolol). Recent research has shown that treatment with spironolactone improves mortality and hospital readmission rates. An exercise program should also be recommended for all patients with heart failure unless their condition is unstable.", 
    "6": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are under study in ischaemic heart diseases, their mechanism of action being still unknown. 2. The anti-ischaemic effect of trandolapril and the possible involvement of a bradykinin-modulation on endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in exerting this effect, were investigated. 3. Three doses of trandolapril, chronically administered in vivo, were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts subjected to global ischaemia followed by reperfusion. 4. Trandolapril has an anti-ischaemic effect. The dose of 0.3 mg kg(-1) exerted the best effect reducing diastolic pressure increase during ischaemia (from 33.0+/-4.5 to 14.0+/-5.2 mmHg; P<0.05 vs control) and reperfusion (from 86.1+/-9.4 to 22.2+/-4.1 mmHg; P<0.01 vs control), improving functional recovery, counteracting creatine phosphokinase release and ameliorating energy metabolism after reperfusion. 5. Trandolapril down-regulated the baseline developed pressure. 6. Trandolapril increased myocardial bradykinin content (from 31.8+/-6.1 to 54.8+/-7.5 fmol/gww; P<0.05, at baseline) and eNOS expression and activity in aortic endothelium (both P<0.01 vs control) and in cardiac myocytes (from 11.3+/-1.5 to 17.0+/-2.0 mUOD microg protein(-1) and from 0.62+/-0.05 to 0.80+/-0.06 pmol mg prot(-1) min(-1); both P<0.05 vs control). 7. HOE 140 (a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist) and NOS inhibitors counteracted the above-reported effects. 8. There was a negative correlation between myocyte's eNOS up-regulation and myocardial contraction down-regulation. 9. Our findings suggest that the down-regulation exerted by trandolapril on baseline cardiac contractility, through a bradykinin-mediated increase in NO production, plays a crucial role in the anti-ischaemic effect of trandolapril by reducing energy breakdown during ischaemia.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in preventing progression to macroalbuminuria and/or a decline in renal function in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria. Forty-two patients were randomized to treatment with either perindopril, slow-release nifedipine, or placebo. In the first 3 months, drug dosage was titrated to achieve a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of at least 5 mm HG: Thirty-three patients had a minimum of 24 months' data, and 25 patients were followed up beyond 36 months (mean, 67 +/- 4 months). Patients were studied every 3 months and at the end of the treatment period; those who remained normotensive discontinued therapy and were followed up for an additional 3 months. Baseline geometric mean albumin excretion rates (AERs) were as follows: perindopril, 66 microg/min; nifedipine, 59 microg/min; and placebo, 66 microg/min. During the first 3 years, 7 of the perindopril-treated but none of the placebo or nifedipine-treated patients reverted to normoalbuminuria (P < 0.01). Median AERs at 3 years of treatment in each group were 23 microg/min for perindopril, 122 microg/min for nifedipine, and 112 microg/min for placebo patients (P < 0.01). In patients with more than 3 years' follow-up, median AERs decreased by 45% in the first year and then stabilized in the perindopril group, but increased by 17.6% in the nifedipine group and 27.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.03) in the first year, then increased progressively. In these same patients, there was a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate in the nifedipine group (-7.8 +/- 1.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y), but not in the other two groups (perindopril, -1.0 +/- 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y; placebo, -1.3 +/- 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y; P = 0.004). At the end of the study, cessation of treatment for 3 months was associated with a doubling of AERs in the perindopril-treated group, but no change in the other two groups (P < 0.001). In conclusion, long-term perindopril therapy is more effective than nifedipine or placebo in delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reducing AER to the normoalbuminuric range (<20 microg/min) in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria.", 
    "8": "Solid-state reactions that occur in drug substances and formulations include solid-state phase transformations, dehydration/desolvation, and chemical reactions. Chemical reactivity is the focus of this chapter. Of particular interest are cases where the drug-substance may be unstable or react with excipients in the formulation. Water absorption can enhance molecular mobility of solids and lead to solid-state reactivity. Mobility can be measured using various methods including glass transition (T(g)) measurements, solid-state NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Solid-state reactions of drug substances can include oxidation, cyclization, hydrolysis, and deamidation. Oxidation studies of vitamin A, peptides (DL-Ala-DL-Met, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe methyl ester, and Met-enkaphalin acetate salt), and steroids (hydrocortisone and prednisolone derivatives) are discussed. Cyclization reactions of crystalline and amorphous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (spirapril hydrochloride, quinapril hydrochloride, and moexipril) are presented which investigate mobility and chemical reactivity. Examples of drug-excipient interactions, such as transacylation, the Maillard browning reaction, and acid base reactions are discussed for a variety of compounds including aspirin, fluoxitine, and ibuprofen. Once solid-state reactions are understood in a pharmaceutical system, the necessary steps can be taken to prevent reactivity and improve the stability of drug substances and products.", 
    "9": "We recently demonstrated that spironolactone may have beneficial effects on left ventricular hypertrophy in selected patients with essential hypertension undergoing treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. To clarify the possible mechanisms by which spironolactone improves cardiac hypertrophy, we investigated the change in serum procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide (PIIINP) in 11 patients with essential hypertension treated with spironolactone and an ACE inhibitor for 24 weeks. Both blood pressure and serum PIIINP levels were significantly decreased by treatment. There was a statistical significant correlation between the changes in LVMI and those in PIIINP. The reduction in PIIINP was significant in patients whose initial serum PIIINP levels were above the normal range. Before treatment, there were no statistically significant correlations between serum PIIINP levels and either LVMI, blood pressure, or plasma aldosterone concentration. Essential hypertensive patients matched in terms of duration of therapy, blood pressure and LVMI and treated with an ACE inhibitor alone showed no change in serum PIIINP levels. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that patients with essential hypertension and high serum levels of PIIINP are particularly responsive to MR blockade in terms of left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, these results suggest that spironolactone limits cardiac collagen turnover in such patients. Larger studies may provide definitive evidence for the involvement of aldosterone in left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with abnormally high PIIINP levels.", 
    "10": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to be beneficial in providing cardioprotective effects in humans, but the mechanism of these effects is not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects and mechanism of RAS inhibitors on ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced myocardial injury in rats. Rats were randomly divided into five groups and treated with vehicle (C), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1-A), angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist (AT2-A) or ACE-I plus bradykinin B2 antagonist. Ten minutes after administration, the left main coronary artery was ligated for 45 min, and then reperfused for 120 min. IR-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and confirmed by typical DNA laddering. Mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activity in the ischemic zone were measured by an in vitro kinase assay. The duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during ischemia was reduced by AT2-A and ACE-I, and increased by AT1-A and ACE-I+icatibant. ACE-I and AT2-A reduced apoptosis (by 54% and 53%) and infarct size (by 42% and 41%), while AT1-A increased apoptosis (by 86%) and infarct size (by 45%). These changes were negatively correlated with the change in ERK activity. The effects of ACE-I on apoptosis and infarct size were abolished by the coadministration of icatibant. Apoptosis was correlated with the occurrence of VT (r=0.837, p<0.001). These results suggest that both the accumulation of bradykinin and inhibition of AT2 receptor are cardioprotective against IR injury through the activation of ERK, but not JNK.", 
    "11": "We examined the influence of chronic antihypertensive treatment on the central pressor response in SHR. Adult male SHR were divided into 5 groups, i.e., those receiving 1) enalapril (Enal: 25 mg/kg/day in drinking water, n=12); 2) losartan (Los: 40 mg/kg/day, n=11); 3) candesartan (Cand: 4 mg/kg/day, n=12); 4) hydralazine+hydrochlorothiazide (H&H: 50+7.5 mg/kg/day, n=9); 5) vehicle (", 
    "12": "n=9). At 4 weeks of treatment, hypertonic saline (0.25, 0.5 M) was intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected into conscious rats. Plasma catecholamines were measured before and after i.c.v. injection. On completion of the experiment, heart weight was measured, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of the cerebrum was determined. All antihypertensive drugs elicited comparable reductions in systolic blood pressure, while heart rate was significantly higher in the H&H group than in the other groups during treatment. Pressor response to i.c.v. hypertonic saline (0.5 M) was significantly smaller in the Enal (12 +/- 3 mmHg) and Cand (11 +/- 2 mmHg) groups than in the Los (22 +/- 2 mmHg), H&H (16 +/- 2 mmHg), and CONTROL (29 +/- 5 mmHg) groups. Plasma catecholamines did not differ among the groups. Heart weight was lowest in the Enal group, followed by the Los and Cand groups. ACE activity of the cerebrum was significantly decreased in the Enal group. The results suggest that chronic treatment with various antihypertensive drugs differentially alters the central pressor response in SHR, and enalapril and candesartan are effective in attenuating this response.", 
    "13": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and alphabeta blocker in combination with a calcium antagonist on the progression of renal function and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension. The 65 subjects in this study were recruited from a cohort of 316 patients. The main criteria for inclusion were echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH (posterior wall thickness >12 mm) and serum creatinine of more than 1.5 mg/dl. Antihypertensive treatments were switched to the combination of amlodipine at a dose of 5 mg and benazepril at a dose of 2.5 mg daily or the combination of amlodipine at a dose of 5 mg and arotinolol at a dose of 20 mg daily at random irrespective of whether or not patients had been previously treated. The follow-up period was 2 years. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced from 150/90 +/- 15/11 mmHg to 130/75 +/- 11/9 mmHg (ACE) and the levels of serum creatinine were increased significantly from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.4 mg/dl (ACE). In the alphabeta-blocker group, these two values were similar and no significant changes were found. PWT was decreased from 14.2 +/- 0.6 to 12.9 +/- 0.3 cm in alphabeta blocker but was not significantly decreased in the ACE inhibitor group. In conclusion, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and abeta blocker might be effective treatment for hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "14": "Fifty mature male rats were separated into groups of ten rats each (control, L-NAME, spironolactone, enalapril and verapamil). On the 41st day of experimentation, animals were anesthetized, weighed and sacrificed. The tail blood pressure (TBP) was 76% higher in L-NAME group than in the control group. Spironolactone, enalapril and verapamil were efficient in reducing TBP in those respective groups of rats (spironolactone was less efficient in reducing TBP). The heart mass/body mass ratio (HBR) increased 24% in L-NAME group and spironolactone group. No differences in HBR were found when control animals and animals treated with enalapril and verapamil were compared. Heart volume (HV) was greater in L-NAME group than other groups, but it was not different comparing the L-NAME and the spironolactone groups. The left ventricle was responsible for the changes in the HV. The relationship between the HV and the body mass (BM) was not significant in the groups L-NAME and spironolactone. However, this relationship was significant and allometric in control, enalapril and verapamil groups. In control group, HV had a positive allometric tendency against the BM, but in the enalapril and verapamil groups this tendency was allometrically negative. Cardiac hypertrophy in rats under inhibition of NO synthesis was prevented by treatment with enalapril and verapamil more efficiently than spironolactone.",

    "20": "The benefit effects of nitric oxide (NO) donors in acute heart failure have led to the development of vasodilators as treatment of chronic heart failure. However, the mechanisms involved in the effects of NO are complex and still discussed. In chronic heart failure, the eNOS downregulation in vascular endothelium explains the alteration of endothelial function. In addition, in the myocardium, cytokines induce the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which increase NO production by myocytes and surrounding cells. This excess of NO production, associated with anion superoxide synthesis, limits the inotropic properties of catecholamines and exert proapoptotic effects. The role of NO donors in heart failure treatment is still controversial but by reducing preload they improve patient's symptoms. Beside blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors act via the inhibition of bradykinin degradation which increase NO levels. Finally, vascular endothelial NO expression is improved by exercise training and participates in the improvement of exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure involved in cardiac readaptation program.",

However, the issue of underutilization of effective medical therapies remains. Adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction should include aspirin, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents, all of which improve survival in the treatment and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.

Drugs mainly found were: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, terbinafine, zopiclone, D-penicillamine, imidazole derivatives, quinolones, macrolides, carbimazole and calcium channel blockers. The outcome was favourable for 60.3 per cent of patients. The possible efficacy of zinc is discussed.

No significant change in heart rate or central hemodynamics occurred during treatment with eprosartan compared with placebo.

There was a well-tolerated reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DRP). There were no significant adverse drug events. Only the sitting SBP and the sitting DBP were significantly lowered by fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because reduction in both SBP and DBP in elderly hypertensives has been shown to be beneficial, these findings take on further importance when considering the choice of medication for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. The increase in norepinephrine in the fosinopril-treated patients may explain why patients treated with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.",

None manifested vasoconstriction throughout exercise. By contrast, 20 CAD patients (35%) manifested progressive vasoconstriction from the onset of exercise, and 10 others (18%) manifested vasoconstriction at low heart rate thresholds (P < 0.001 versus normals) after initial vasodilation with exercise. Patients exhibiting vasodilation versus vasoconstriction during exercise had similar clinical and exercise profiles, except for a greater use of ACE inhibitors and a greater level of achieved metabolic equivalents among the former (P<0.05 for both).",

    "39": "A liquid chromatographic method with photometric detection for the determination of cilazapril and its active metabolite and degradation product cilazaprilat in urine and pharmaceuticals has been developed. The chromatographic method consisted of a microBondapak C18 column maintained at 30+/-0.2 degrees C, using a mixture of methanol-10 mM phosphoric acid (50:50 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min. Enalapril maleate was used as internal standard. The detection was performed at a wavelength of 206 nm. A study of the retention of cilazapril and cilazaprilat using solid-liquid extraction has been carried out in order to optimise the clean-up procedure for urine samples, which consisted of a solid-liquid extraction using C(R) cartridges. Recoveries greater than 85% are obtained for both compounds. The method was sensitive, precise and accurate enough to be applied to the determination of urine samples obtained from three hypertensive patients up to 24 h after intake of a therapeutic dose (detection limit of 70 ng/ml for cilazapril and cilazaprilat in urine).

The work is motivated by the need for assessing the mean treatment effect in a multicenter clinical trial study, assuming that the centers are a random sample from an underlying population. An estimating equation for the mean hazard ratio parameter is proposed. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. A variance estimator, based on large sample theory, is proposed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed estimator performs well in finite samples. The proposed variance estimator effectively corrects the bias of the naive variance estimator, which assumes independence of individuals within a group. The methodology is illustrated with a clinical trial data set from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction. This shows that the variability of the treatment effect is higher than found by means of simpler models.",

Their precise role in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular and renal disease should be established by several ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "43": "The primary objective of this randomised, placebo- controlled, double-blind, crossover study, was to evaluate and compare the longer term effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan and the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). After a 4-week placebo run-in period, nine patients with essential hypertension entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods during which patients were treated with placebo, enalapril 20 mg o.d. or losartan 50 mg o.d. Losartan and enalapril, taken between 07.00 and 08.00, reduced ambulatory BP throughout the 24-h period. Average night time BP was reduced from 133/85 mm Hg on placebo to 124/78 mm Hg on enalapril and to 126/77 mm Hg on losartan. Daytime BP averaged 157/101 mm Hg on placebo, and was significantly lower during enalapril (142/91 mm Hg) than during losartan treatment (147/95 mm Hg). Clinic BP, measured 2 to 4 hours after drug intake, was reduced to the same extent by both drugs. The losartan-induced BP changes were significantly related to those obtained with enalapril (0.63 < r < 0.93). Ambulatory BP monitoring was repeated after 4 weeks of combined therapy in six patients. The BP lowering effect of the combination was not significantly better than that achieved with enalapril alone. In conclusion, losartan 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. lower BP to approximately the same extent, except for a more pronounced effect of enalapril on daytime ambulatory BP. The current study does not provide convincing evidence that addition of losartan to enalapril in the doses used further reduces BP.", 
    "44": "The novel cyclooxygenase- (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib is an effective treatment for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Conventional treatment for these debilitating conditions routinely involves the use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous studies suggest that inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs is deleterious to kidney function, particularly in high-risk patients. As celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, we hypothesized that it may offer an improved renal safety profile in patients at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity. This article represents a post hoc analysis of the renal safety of celecoxib, using the safety database generated during its clinical development program. This analysis includes data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than 13,000 subjects. Most subjects were enrolled in randomized, controlled trials (of up to 12 weeks' duration); however, more than 5000 subjects received celecoxib for as long as 2 years in a long-term, open-label study at as much as twice the maximum recommended dosage. The overall incidence of renal adverse events after celecoxib was greater than that after placebo but similar to that after NSAIDs. The most common events reported after celecoxib, namely, peripheral edema (2.1%), hypertension (0.8%), and exacerbation of preexisting hypertension (0.6%), were not time- or dose-related. Peripheral edema was not associated with increased weight or blood pressure. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-drug interactions between celecoxib and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. We conclude that celecoxib is well tolerated by patients who may be at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity, such as the elderly and those with hypertension or preexisting chronic heart disease.", 
    "45": "In the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) trial, clopidogrel showed a statistically significant superiority over aspirin in the prevention of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. More recently, post-hoc analysis of the data also showed that repeat hospitalization for ischaemic or bleeding events was decreased with clopidogrel compared with aspirin. Complementary analyses show that the benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin is amplified in a large population at very high risk of further atherothrombotic events (diabetics, patients with high cholesterol, and patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombosis). A potential clinically useful advantage of clopidogrel is its low propensity for adverse interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, contrary to what may be seen with aspirin, as observed in a post-hoc CAPRIE analysis. The putative aspirin-ACE inhibitor interaction is being tested prospectively in the Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure (WATCH) trial - a randomized comparison of warfarin, clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with chronic heart failure. The good gastrointestinal tolerance of clopidogrel seen in CAPRIE has been further demonstrated in a study in healthy volunteers where there was a markedly lower gastroduodenal erosion score after 8 days' administration of clopidogrel 75 mg/day compared with aspirin 325 mg/day (p < 0.001). Following the positive findings obtained with clopidogrel plus aspirin in the Clopidogrel Aspirin Stent International Cooperative Study (CLASSICS) trial, other studies of clopidogrel plus aspirin have been initiated or are planned. These include Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High-risk patients (MATCH), a randomized comparison of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus clopidogrel in high-risk patients with recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack.", 
    "46": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors restore size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier in experimental animals and humans with proteinuric nephropathies, although the structural and molecular determinants of such an effect are not completely understood. This study used an accelerated model of experimental nephrosis to assess nephrin gene and protein expression in the kidney and the possible modulating effect of drugs that block angiotensin II (AII) synthesis/activity. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and control animals were studied at day 7, month 4, and month 8. Additional PHN rats were treated with lisinopril or AII receptor blocker L-158,809 and studied at 8 mo. Lisinopril and L-158,809 controlled BP, prevented proteinuria, and protected PHN animals from renal injury. An intense signal of nephrin mRNA was detected in glomeruli of control animals mainly restricted to podocytes. In PHN rats, nephrin staining progressively and remarkably decreased with time. Lisinopril and L-158,809 fully prevented the decrease in nephrin transcripts to levels comparable to those of control rats. Consistent with nephrin mRNA expression, immunostaining of the protein showed a progressive decrease in kidneys from PHN rats that was completely abolished by lisinopril and L-158,809. In summary, progressive renal injury was associated with downregulation of nephrin gene that was totally prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and AII receptor blocker, suggesting that renoprotection afforded by drugs that interfere with AII synthesis/activity was related to an effect on nephrin assembly.", 
    "47": "This study aimed to assess the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostanoids for the macula densa control of renal afferent arteriolar resistance and for renin secretion. For this purpose, studied were the effects of blocking macula densa salt transport by the loop diuretic bumetanide (100 microM) on renal perfusate flow and on renin secretion in isolated perfused rats, in which renocortical COX-2 expression was prestimulated in vivo by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, with low-salt diet, or with a combination of both. These maneuvers stimulated COX-2 expression in an order of ramipril + low salt> low salt > ramipril > controls. Flow rates through isolated kidneys at a constant pressure of 100 mmHg were dependent on the pretreatment regimen, in the way that they went in parallel with COX-2 expression. The COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (10 microM) lowered flow rates depending on the COX-2 expression level and was most pronounced therefore after pretreatment with low salt + ramipril. NS-398 did not change the increase of flow in response to bumetanide but attenuated the stimulation of renin secretion in response to bumetanide in a manner depending on the expression level of COX-2. These findings suggest that in states of increased renocortical expression of COX-2, overall renal vascular resistance and the macula densa control of renin secretion become dependent on COX-2-derived prostanoids.",

Specific receptor blockade has demonstrated that the beneficial effects of AT1 blockers arise from two mechanisms: the reduction of the AT1 receptor mediated response and the increase in plasma levels of Ang II through the AT1-receptor blockade, which leads to increased stimulation of the AT2 receptor (the so-called yin-yang effect). Both ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade provide significant renal protection in the majority of experimental animal models of kidney diseases. AT1 receptor blockade may offer additional clinical benefits over ACE inhibitor treatment, particularly in the kidney, where AT1-receptor blockade does not cause the fall in glomerular filtration rate seen with ACE inhibitor treatment. A number of long-term clinical studies currently running should show the real value of this new class of compounds in the management of hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases.", 
    "59": "To investigate the reaction kinetics of the solid-state degradation process of enalapril maleate, a Fourier transform infrared microspectroscope equipped with thermal analyzer (thermal FT-IR microscopic system) was used. The isothermal stability study was conducted at 120-130 degrees C for 1-2 h and changes in the three-dimensional plots of the IR spectra of enalapril maleate with respect to heating time were observed. The study indicates that the bands at 1649, 1728, and 1751 cm(-1) assigned to intact enalapril maleate gradually reduced in peak intensity with heating time. However, the peak intensities at 1672 and 1738 cm(-1) (due to enalapril diketopiperazine (DKP) formation) and at 3250 cm(-1) (corresponding to water formation) gradually increased with heating time. The solid-state diketopiperazine formation and the degradation process of enalapril maleate via intramolecular cyclization were found to be simultaneous. The isothermal decomposition curves were sigmoidal and were characterized by induction and acceleration periods, indicating the presence of autocatalytic solid-state decompositions. Moreover, the power-law equation (n = 1/4) was found to provide the best fit to the kinetics of decomposition. This isothermal FT-IR microscopic system was easily used to investigate the degradation of enalapril maleate and the concomitant formation of DKP. The solid-state reaction of enalapril maleate required an activation energy of 195+/-12 kJ/mol to undergo the processes of decomposition and intramolecular cyclization.",

The success of these therapies underscores the pathogenic role of neurohormonal activation in CHF. Clinical and experimental evidence supports a pathophysiologic role for pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in the effects of angiotensin II and norepinephrine in CHF. Potential mechanism(s) responsible for the effects of these immunomodulators can be explained on the basis of established principles of myocardial excitation contraction coupling (E-C). A novel hypothesis is proposed that cytokines and NO-mediated alterations in E-C coupling contribute to the reversible myocardial depression and beta-adrenergic desensitization observed in a diverse group of clinical conditions that activate host inflammatory responses, including CHF. Basic studies into cytokine signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes have the potential to provide important new insights relevant to the design of new management strategies for the treatment of congestive heart failure patients.",

Lever et al., Lancet, 352: 179-184, 1998). In this study, we examined the effect of several ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) antagonists on tumor development and angiogenesis in a murine hepatocellular carcinoma model. Among ACE inhibitors, perindopril appeared to be a potent inhibitor of tumor development and angiogenesis, whereas AT(1)-R antagonists did not exert such an inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of perindopril was achieved even on established tumors. The level of the potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in the tumor was significantly suppressed by perindopril. In vitro studies showed that perindopril-derived active form, perindoprilat, suppressed the endothelial cell tubule formation. Perindoprilat treatment also significantly inhibited VEGF mRNA expression in BNL-HCC cells in vitro. These results showed that the ACE inhibitor perindopril inhibited tumor development and angiogenesis independent from AT(1)-R blockage, and that VEGF alternation may be involved in the mechanism of this inhibitory effect. Because perindopril is widely used in clinical practice, it may represent an effective new strategy for anticancer therapy.", 
    "68": "Therapy of acute exacerbations of congestive heart failure associated with obesity cardiomyopathy consists of dietary salt restriction, inspired oxygen, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or, if left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate. Digitalis may be indicated in selected cases. These measures may also be useful chronically in association with weight loss. Substantial weight loss is capable of reversing all of the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with obesity except elevation of left ventricular filling pressure. Substantial weight loss may also reduce left ventricular mass and improve left ventricular diastolic filling in those with left ventricular hypertrophy before weight loss. Left ventricular systolic function also improves after weight loss in those with impaired pre-weight-loss systolic function. These beneficial effects of weight loss occur partly because of favorable alterations in left ventricular loading conditions. Substantial weight loss in patients with congestive heart failure associated with obesity cardiomyopathy produces a reversal of many of the clinical manifestations of cardiac decompensation and improves New York Heart Association functional class in most patients.", 
    "69": "Proteins of the plasma kinin-forming cascade bind to endothelial cells and activation of the cascade can be initiated along the surface. The light chain of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (domain 5) and factor XII bind to gC1qR, the heavy chain of HK (domain 3) binds to cytokeratin 1 and the interactions are zinc dependent. Prekallikrein binds to domain 6 of HK. Antisera to gC1qR and cytokeratin 1 inhibit binding and activation. Incubation of normal plasma with endothelial cells leads to gradual conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein, while plasma deficient in factor XII or HK are inactive within a 2-hour time frame. Thus factor XII is critical for activation to proceed. Augmentation of these reactions may occur when C1 inhibitor is functionally deficient or with ACE inhibitors which also inhibit kininases.", 
    "70": "Mice lacking natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) have marked cardiac hypertrophy and chamber dilatation disproportionate to their increased blood pressure (BP), suggesting, in support of previous in vitro data, that the NPRA system moderates the cardiac response to hypertrophic stimuli. Here, we have followed the changes in cardiac function in response to altered mechanical load on the heart of NPRA-null mice (Npr1-/-). Chronic treatment with either enalapril, furosemide, hydralazine, or losartan were all effective in reducing and maintaining BP at normal levels without affecting heart weight/body weight. In the reverse direction, we used transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce pressure overload. In the Npr1-/- mice, TAC resulted in a 15-fold increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression, a 55% increase in left ventricular weight/body weight (LV/BW), dilatation of the LV, and significant decline in cardiac function. In contrast, banded Npr1+/+ mice showed only a threefold increase in ANP expression, an 11% increase in LV/BW, a 0.2 mm decrease in LV end diastolic dimension, and no change in fractional shortening. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases that occurs in response to TAC did not differ in the Npr1+/+ and Npr1-/- mice. Taken together, these results suggest that the NPRA system has direct antihypertrophic actions in the heart, independent of its role in BP control.",

In urethane-anaesthetized male rats, electrical stimulation (5-20 Hz, 600 microA) of the SFO significantly increased the NA concentration in the region of the PVN, and the increase was significantly prevented by pretreatment with the angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonist saralasin (Sar, 5 microg), into the third ventricle (3V). Injections of ANG II (5 microg) into the 3V significantly enhanced NA release in the PVN area.

The first wave of enrollment began in July 1997 and was completed in February 1998. The second wave began in February 1999 and ended in June 1999. There were a total of 2,526 patients in wave 1 and 2,109 patients in wave 2. Comprehensive pre-, intra-, and postprocedure (in-hospital) data were analyzed for changes between recruitment waves. Patients in wave 2 were more frequently nonwhite (p < or = 0.001), hypertensive by history (p < or = 0.001), had more significant noncardiac comorbidity (p < or = 0.01), and had more frequently undergone prior percutaneous coronary intervention (p < 0.05). Patients in wave 2 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in a setting of acute coronary syndromes more frequently than wave 1 patients (p < or = 0.001). However, most interventions in both waves were performed on 1 vessel, irrespective of the extent of disease. Attempted lesions in wave 2 were longer (p < or = 0.001), less frequently totally occluded (p < or = 0.001), and more frequently in vessels with a prior stent (p < or = 0.01). Using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lesion classification scheme, attempted lesions in wave 2 were less complex than those in wave 1 (p < or = 0.001). Stent use increased significantly from wave 1 (67%) to wave 2 (79%, p < or = 0.001) as did the use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (wave 1, 24%; wave 2, 32%: p < 0.001).

However, the frequency of significant procedural coronary dissection and in- and out-of-laboratory abrupt closure were significantly less in wave 2 (p < or = 0.001) Discharge medications were more likely to include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and hypolipidemic treatment in wave 2 than in wave 1 (p < or = 0.001). These data indicate a continuing aggressive approach to patient care over the time interval analyzed. Although overall procedural outcomes are excellent, procedural safety has been further enhanced.

    "73": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become the cornerstone of therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF). Because ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of CHF, aspirin is frequently given concomitantly with ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF. Increased bradykinin levels, with the consequent enhanced synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins, appear to mediate a significant benefit of ACE inhibitor therapy in these patients. In contrast, aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, and thereby suppresses prostaglandin production. Thus, these counteracting effects on prostaglandins may result in antagonism between ACE inhibitor and aspirin therapy in heart failure patients. Several early reports questioned the safety of aspirin in CHF, and the potential antagonistic interaction between ACE inhibitors and aspirin in patients with heart failure has become the focus of both increasing research and intense debate. This article briefly highlights the theoretic considerations underlying this interaction, and reviews the available evidence for such an interaction from clinical trials.", 
    "74": "The mechanisms by which persistent proteinuria induces interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are not well known, although nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which regulates the transcription of many genes involved in renal injury, could be implicated. In rats with intense proteinuria, we studied the renal activation of NF-kappaB as well as the potential involvement of the vasoactive hormones angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Uninephrectomized Wistar-Kyoto rats receiving 1 g/d of BSA had proteinuria but no renal morphological lesions at day 1. By contrast, tubular atrophy and/or dilation and mononuclear cell infiltration were observed after 8 or 28 days of BSA administration, coinciding with maximal proteinuria. In relation to control uninephrectomized rats, the renal cortex of nephritic rats showed an increment in the activation of NF-kappaB at all time periods studied. By in situ Southwestern histochemistry, NF-kappaB activity was mainly localized in proximal tubules, interstitial mononuclear cells, and, to a lesser extent, the glomeruli. The administration of the ACE inhibitor quinapril plus the ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist bosentan during 28 days to BSA-overloaded animals diminished proteinuria, renal lesions, and NF-kappaB activity more markedly than single drugs. Cultured tubular epithelial cells exposed to BSA revealed an intense NF-kappaB activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Incubation of cells with receptor antagonists of Ang II (AT(1): losartan and AT(2): PD-123,319) or ET-1 (ET(A): BQ123 and ET(B): IRL1038) inhibited significantly the BSA-induced NF-kappaB activity (90%, 75%, 90%, and 60% of inhibition versus basal, respectively). Our results show that overload proteinuria causes NF-kappaB activation in tubular epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. The vasoactive peptides Ang II and ET-1 appear to be implicated in this effect. The results reveal a novel mechanism of perpetuation of renal damage induced by persistent proteinuria.", 
    "75": "To determine the effects of physiological alterations in endogenous angiotensin II activity on basal renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and its arterial baroreflex regulation, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists were microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla of anesthetized rats consuming a low, normal, or high sodium diet that were instrumented for simultaneous measurement of arterial pressure and RSNA. Plasma renin activity was increased in rats fed a low sodium diet and decreased in those fed a high sodium diet. Losartan (50, 100, and 200 pmol) decreased heart rate and RSNA (but not mean arterial pressure) dose-dependently; the responses were significantly greater in rats fed a low sodium diet than in those fed a high sodium diet. Candesartan (1, 2, and 10 pmol) decreased mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and RSNA dose-dependently; the responses were significantly greater in rats fed a low sodium diet than in those fed a normal or high sodium diet. [D-Ala(7)]Angiotensin-(1-7) (100, 200, and 1000 pmol) did not affect mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or RSNA in rats fed either a low or a high sodium diet. In rats fed a low sodium diet, candesartan reset the arterial baroreflex control of RSNA to a lower level of arterial pressure, and in rats with congestive heart failure, candesartan increased the arterial baroreflex gain of RSNA. Physiological alterations in the endogenous activity of the renin-angiotensin system influence the bradycardic, vasodepressor, and renal sympathoinhibitory responses to rostral ventrolateral medulla injection of antagonists to angiotensin II type 1 receptors but not to angiotensin-(1-7) receptors.", 
    "76": "Omapatrilat represents a new class of drugs capable of inhibiting both ACE and neutral endopeptidase 24.11, the so-called vasopeptidase inhibitors. It therefore contributes to neurohumoral modulation, which might improve endothelial function in cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the effect of omapatrilat in comparison to the ACE inhibitor captopril on systolic blood pressure and endothelial function in salt-induced hypertension. Dahl salt-sensitive rats (n=6/group) on standard or salt-enriched (4% NaCl) chow were treated for 8 weeks with either omapatrilat (36+/-4 mg/kg per day), captopril (94+/-2 mg/kg per day), or placebo. Aortic rings were then isolated and suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Systolic blood pressure of salt-fed, placebo-treated animals increased to 196+/-6 mm Hg, which was prevented by omapatrilat (162+/-5 mm Hg, P<0.05) and captopril (164+/-7 mm Hg, P<0.05) to a comparable degree. In control rats, acetylcholine (10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L) induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (97+/-4%), which was reduced by high-salt diet to 30+/-5% (P<0.005; n=6). Omapatrilat improved relaxation to a greater extent (86+/-5%) than did captopril (57+/-6%; P<0.05). eNOS protein expression and aortic nitrite/nitrate content were reduced in hypertensive rats and improved by both omapatrilat and captopril. Aortic endothelin-1 levels were increased in salt-fed animals and unaffected by omapatrilat or captopril. These data suggest that despite comparable blood pressure, omapatrilat is superior to captopril in improving endothelium-dependent relaxation in salt-sensitive hypertension.",

In a similar analysis, which also accounted for serum creatinine, serum uric acid was also significantly and independently associated with excess mortality of cardiovascular disease and stroke. The relative hazard rates associated with a 50-micromol/L increase of serum uric acid were 1.14 (1.02 to 1.27, P=0.02) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.34 (1.14 to 1.57, P<0.001) for fatal stroke. In conclusion, in older Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension, serum creatinine and serum uric acid were predictors of mortality.", 
    "79": "There is increasing evidence that direct pathobiological events in the vessel wall play an important role in vascular disease. An important mechanism involves the perturbation of the homeostatic balance between NO and reactive oxygen species. Increased reactive oxygen species can inactivate NO and produce peroxynitrite. Angiotensin II is a potent mediator of oxidative stress and stimulates the release of cytokines and the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules that mediate vessel wall inflammation. Inflammatory cells release enzymes (including ACE) that generate angiotensin II. Thus, a local positive-feedback mechanism could be established in the vessel wall for oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin II also acts as a direct growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and can stimulate the local production of metalloproteinases and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Taken together, angiotensin II can promote vasoconstriction, inflammation, thrombosis, and vascular remodeling. In this article, we propose a model that unifies the interrelationship among cardiovascular risk factors, angiotensin II, and the pathobiological mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular disease. This model may also explain the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular events beyond blood pressure reduction.",

However, a variety of studies have suggested that the positive relationship between BP and cardiovascular mortality is weakened or indeed reversed in the very elderly. Most intervention trials to date have either excluded or not recruited sufficient patients aged > or =80 years to determine whether there is a significant benefit from treatment in this age group. A meta-analysis of intervention trials that recruited patients aged > or =80 years has suggested a benefit in terms of stroke reduction but has also raised the possibility of an increase in total mortality. The benefit to risk ratio therefore needs to be clearly established before recommendations can be made for treating very elderly patients with hypertension. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) pilot recruited 1283 patients aged > or =80 years and showed the feasibility of performing such a trial in this age group. It was a Prospective Randomised Open Blinded End-Points (PROBE) design but the main trial has additional pharmaceutical sponsorship to run a double-blind trial. Therefore, the main trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the benefits of treating very elderly patients with hypertension. It compares placebo with a low dose diuretic (indapamide sustained release 1.5mg daily) and additional ACE inhibitor (perindopril) therapy if required. As in the pilot trial, the primary end-point is stroke events (fatal and non-fatal) and the trial is designed to determine whether or not a 35% difference occurs between placebo and active treatment. The main objective will be achieved with 90% power at the 1% level of significance. Secondary outcome measures will include total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiac mortality, stroke mortality and skeletal fracture. 2100 patients aged > or =80 years are to be recruited and followed up for an average of 5 years.

Unit costs of amlodipine and enalapril were applied to the daily dosages of individual patients to calculate the total costs and average costs per patient in each treatment group in the clinical trial on an intent-to-treat basis. Efficacy rates were used to calculate the average treatment costs per success in blood pressure control. Although not statistically significant, amlodipine treatment resulted in a higher efficacy (89.5%) vs. enalapril (85.2%). The average costs per amlodipine-treated patient were consistently lower (-$112.30) than for the enalapril-treated patient by week 50. Treatment with amlodipine resulted in an average cost per success of $609 per patient compared with $772 per enalapril-treated patient. A sensitivity analysis revealed that, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension over the 50-week treatment period, amlodipine would remain less costly than enalapril, with a decrease in the cost of enalapril of up to 17%, and would remain more cost effective, with a 21% decrease in the cost of enalapril.",

Since then other authors recognised the importance of captopril test in the detection of RVH, advising also it's application in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and pheocromocithoma. Based in different publications the sensitivity of captopril test is 40%-100% and the specificity 72%-100%. There are several reasons to explain the differences between these results. In our opinion, these observations appeared as a consequence of the different methodology used. Despite the fact that alternative procedures to captopril test in the screening of RVII do exist this is, in our opinion, the most simple, cheap, safe and efficient test available at the moment.", 
    "112": "The development of pharmacological agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) specifically have helped to define all the components of the system and their contribution to blood-pressure control and to the pathogenesis of hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure. The angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are among all available drugs that interfere with the RAS, the most efficient, so far, in the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases, with comfortable posologic schemes and an acceptable safety profile. The most important difference between them are more related to pharmacokinetic profile rather than to pharmacodynamic characteristics. With the use of ACEi the interference with other neurohumoral systems is unavoidable and the controversy has been pharmacologically and clinically installed. With the advent of oral selective AT1 angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) the pharmacological interference became eventually much more selective. Their antihypertensive efficacy is identical and their tolerability is better than that showed by ACEi. The ARBs differ mainly in their pharmacokinetics and in their binding capacity to the AT1 angiotensin receptor. The results of several ongoing clinical trials will show if the ARBs as ACEi will be capable to protect target-organs and to promote a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbility and mortality. In parallel there is an intense experimental and clinical research with other groups of drugs which also markedly interfere with RAS: renin inhibitors, chymase inhibitors and simultaneous inhibitors of vasopeptidases (ACE, endothelin converting-enzyme, neutral endopeptidase). From the pharmacological point of view, it is now possible to block effectively RAS with some relevant clinical results that will be certainly widen in the near future.", 
    "113": "Heart failure is a major health problem and is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. Recently, the role of the genetic background in the onset and development of the disease has been evidenced in both heart failure with and without systolic dysfunction, and in familial and non-familial forms of this condition. Familial forms of dilated cardiomyopathy are more frequent than previously thought. Various modes of inheritance and phenotypes have been reported and this condition appears genetically highly heterogenous. Five genes (dystrophin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C and delta-sarcoglycan), and additional loci, have been identified in families in which dilated cardiomyopathy is isolated or associated with other cardiac or non-cardiac symptoms. It has been postulated that the molecular defect involved could lead to abnormal interactions between cytoskeletal proteins, responsible either for defect in force transmission or for membrane disruption. More recently, the identification of mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins has led to a second hypothesis in which the disease might also result from a force generation defect. In non-monogenic dilated cardiomyopathy, susceptibility genes (role in the development of the disease) and modifier genes (role in the evolution/prognosis of the disease) have so far been identified. Some data suggest that the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and side-effects, might be related to some genetic polymorphisms, such as the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene. Although preliminary, these data are promising and might be the first step towards application of phamacogenetics in heart failure. This is of paramount importance as the medical treatment of heart failure is characterized by the need for polypharmacy. One of the major challenges of the next millenium, therefore, will be to identify genetic factors which might help define responders to major treatment classes, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, spironolactone, vasopeptidase inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists.", 
    "114": "The in vitro effects of omapatrilat, a dual vasopeptidase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), on exogenous bradykinin metabolism after a single passage through the coronary bed were compared with that of a NEP inhibitor (retrothiorphan, 25 nM), an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat, 130 nM), and omapatrilat (25 nM). Bradykinin and inhibitors were infused into isolated Langendorff rat hearts perfused at 1 ml/min followed by reperfusion at 10 ml/min. Residual bradykinin was quantified in the coronary effluent by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to calculate bradykinin recovery and its kinetic parameters (Vmax/Km). Bradykinin degradation rate at 1 ml/min was 4.56 +/- 0.39 1/min per gram without inhibitors and was significantly reduced to 2.57 +/- 0.19 1/min per gram in the presence of enalaprilat, to 2.97 +/- 0.38 1/min per gram with retrothiorphan, to 1.82 +/- 0.17 1/min per gram with both enalaprilat and retrothiorphan, and to 1.14 +/- 0.35 1/min per gram with omapatrilat. In a second set of experiments, the effect of a 14-day treatment of rats with either ACE inhibitors (enalapril, quinapril, and ramipril), a NEP inhibitor (candoxatril), or omapatrilat on exogenous bradykinin metabolism was studied in Langendorff perfused hearts isolated from these long-term treated rats. In untreated rats, bradykinin degradation at a coronary perfusion of 1 ml/min was 4.35 +/- 0.41 1/min per gram. This value was reduced by 30% for the NEP inhibitor, by 50% for all ACE inhibitors, and by 75% for omapatrilat. All inhibitors administered either short term or long term significantly reduced bradykinin degradation during a single passage through the coronary bed. However, omapatrilat administration resulted in the greatest protection from bradykinin breakdown than ACE or NEP inhibitors alone.", 
    "115": "In the treatment of most medical conditions, there are many choices. A critical question for practicing clinicians is: \"Are all drugs within a class interchangeable?\" In the past decade, the market has seen a proliferation of drugs within popular drug classes. The original drugs within a class typically have better scientific documentation than the newer ones, which are often referred to as \"me-too\" drugs. Due to a lesser financial investment, the latter may be available at a lower cost. Good reasons exist for grouping drugs, however, there is no accepted definition of the term \"class effect.\" Although members of a drug class share main actions, they may have clinically important differences in terms of efficacy and safety. There are many such examples in the literature. This article reviews the class effect concept as it applies to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Only half of the 10 ACE inhibitors available in the U.S. have been shown to improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure or myocardial infarction. It is unknown whether the other five have the same safety and efficacy profiles or what their optimal doses are. Thus, we do not know whether all ACE inhibitors are fully interchangeable. The practice of medicine ought to be based on solid scientific evidence, not on assumptions or extrapolations. For our patients, such practice is a legitimate expectation. Therefore, it seems prudent to recommend that patients requiring ACE inhibitor therapy be prescribed one that has been proven effective and safe.",

Cox regression analysis, controlling for baseline LVEF and assignment to ramipril, revealed: 1) that increases in EDVI and ESVI up to three months predicted an increasing risk of a future adverse clinical outcome; and 2) that the benefit with ramipril on clinical outcome was partly dependent on a reduction in LV volumes.",

The few data available on the use of ACE inhibitors in the elderly after AMI are conflicting. Nothing is known about the effects of ACE inhibitors in elderly postinfarction patients with preserved LV function: these patients have a remarkable medium- to long-term mortality and HF incidence after infarction. The aim of this study is to evaluate, in patients with AMI aged > or =65 years, the effects of Perindopril on the combined outcome of death, hospitalization for HF, and heart remodeling, considered to be a > or =8% increase in LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). Secondary objectives include the same factors listed in the primary end points but considered separately. In addition, safety of the drug, ventricular remodeling, and adaptation are being evaluated. A total of 1100 patients with AMI (first episode or reinfarction), aged > or =65 years, and preserved or only moderately depressed LV (LV ejection fraction > or =40%), are to be enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment (8 mg for 12 months of Perindopril or placebo, in double-blind conditions).

    "122": "The aim of the present study was to assess the possible differences in hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to local ACE inhibition in the human forearm of patients with essential hypertension with either quinaprilat or enalaprilat. Forearm vascular responses to infusion of quinaprilat or enalaprilat (0.5 microg/dL/min) into the brachial artery were studied in 12 male patients with essential hypertension. The experiments were performed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Before and during ACE inhibition, the vasoconstrictor response to four cumulative doses of angiotensin I (Ang I) was studied. Forearm blood flow was assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography. Local quinaprilat infusion induced a more rapid (even after 15 minutes; median vasodilation quinaprilat 29% vs. enalaprilat --1%, P < 0.02) and longer lasting forearm vasodilation as compared with enalaprilat. After 15 minutes of local ACE inhibition, the vasoconstrictor response to Ang I was completely blocked by both ACE inhibitors. We conclude that in patients with essential hypertension quinaprilat induces a more rapid and longer lasting vasodilatation than enalaprilat. These effects of quinaprilat are possibly related to its higher affinity for vascular ACE. On the other hand, the fact that these effects of quinaprilat were observed despite a similar degree of ACE inhibition as during enalaprilat may suggest that quinaprilat directly stimulates another vasodilatating mechanism.", 
    "123": "Beneficial effects of monotherapy with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers on hemodynamic function after myocardial infarction are well known. Until now, the effects of combined treatment on cardiac function and energy metabolism have been poorly described. This study examines the effects of combined ramipril and metoprolol treatment on the creatine kinase (CK) system and hemodynamic function in rats after infarction. Wistar rats with experimental infarction were randomized for treatment with ramipril (R), metoprolol (M), combined treatment (MR), or placebo (P). Sham-operated (SO) animals served as controls. After 6 weeks, we assayed for CK isoenzymes and performed hemodynamic measurements. In P versus SO, left ventricular systolic pressures (dp/dt(max) and dp/dt(min)) diminished, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased. Decreased total CK activity and mitochondrial CK isoenzyme, increased CK-MB, and increased CK-BB isoenzymes were measured in P versus SO. With infarct size < or =45%, mitochondrial CK increased in M and R versus P. Combined treatment had an additional enhancing effect on mitochondrial CK isoenzyme level versus M and R, decreased LVEDP versus P, as well as increased dp/dt(max) and dp/dt(min) versus R. These results provide evidence of an interaction between normalization of energy metabolism and improvement in cardiac function due to a combination of ACE inhibition and beta blockade after myocardial infarction.",

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with an ACE inhibitor after development of vascular inflammation could inhibit arteriosclerosis in rats. Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomized to four groups: the control group received no drugs, the 4wL-NAME group received L-NAME (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 4 wk, the 1wL + 3wNT group received L-NAME for 1 wk and no treatment for the subsequent 3 wk, and the 1wL + 3wACEI group received L-NAME for 1 wk and the ACE inhibitor imidapril (20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for the subsequent 3 wk. After 4 wk, we observed significant arteriosclerosis of the coronary artery (medial thickening and fibrosis) and increased cardiac ACE activity in the 1wL + 3wNT group as well as in the 4wL-NAME group, but not in the 1wL + 3wACEI group. In a separate study, we examined apoptosis formation and found that posttreatment with imidapril (20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or an ANG II AT1-receptor antagonist, CS-866 (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), induced apoptosis (TdT-mediated nick end-labeling) in monocytes and myofibroblasts appearing in the inflammatory lesions associated with a clear degradation in the heart (DNA electrophoresis). In conclusion, treatment with the ACE inhibitor after 1 wk of L-NAME administration inhibited arteriosclerosis by inducing apoptosis in the cells with inflammatory lesions in this study, suggesting that increased ANG II activity inhibited apoptosis of the cells with inflammatory lesions and thus contributed to the development of arteriosclerosis.", 
    "125": "Although intrinsic tumours of the brain seldom metastasize to distant sites, their diffuse, infiltrative-invasive growth within the brain generally precludes successful surgical and adjuvant therapy. Hence, attention has now focused on novel therapeutic approaches to combat brain tumours that include the use of anti-invasive and anti-proliferative agents. The effect of four anti-invasive agents, swainsonine (a locoweed alkaloid), captopril (an anti-hypertensive drug), tangeretin and nobiletin (both citrus flavonoids), were investigated on various parameters of brain tumour invasion such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion, migration, invasion and adhesion. A standard cytotoxicity assay was used to optimize working concentrations of the drugs on seven human brain tumour-derived cell lines of various histological type and grade of malignancy. A qualitative assessment by gelatin zymography revealed that the effect of these agents varied between the seven cell lines such that the low grade pilocytic astrocytoma was unaffected by three of the agents. In contrast, downregulation of the two gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was seen in the grade 3 astrocytoma irrespective of which agent was used. Generally, swainsonine was the least effective whereas the citrus flavonoids, particularly nobiletin, showed the greatest downregulation of secretion of the MMPs. Furthermore, captopril and nobiletin were most efficient at inhibiting invasion, migration and adhesion in four representative cell lines (an ependymoma, a grade II oligoastrocytoma, an anaplastic astrocytoma and a glioblastoma multiforme). Yet again, the effects of the four agents varied between the four cell lines. Nobiletin was, nevertheless, the most effective agent used in these assays. In conclusion, the differential effects seen on the various parameters studied by these putative anti-invasive agents may be the result of interference with MMPs and other mechanisms underlying the invasive phenotype. From these pilot studies, it is possible that these agents, especially the citrus flavonoids, could be of future therapeutic value. However, further work is needed to validate this in a larger study.",

Renal dopamine has local natriuretic actions and interacts with other hormones involved in renal sodium handling. The aim of the present work was to determine the effects of arterial underfilling induced by vasodilator therapy on renal sodium handling, neurohormonal activation and the activity of the renal dopaminergic system in patients with severe heart failure. For this purpose we monitored haemodynamic parameters, plasma levels of type B natriuretic peptide (BNP), catecholamines, aldosterone, renin activity (PRA), sodium and creatinine, and urinary excretion of sodium, creatinine, L-DOPA, dopamine and its metabolites, before initiation of sodium nitroprusside therapy and every 6 h thereafter (for 42 h), and again after 5 days of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, in 10 male patients with severe heart failure. The results of nitroprusside therapy were a marked increase in cardiac index and a substantial decrease in systemic vascular resistance index. Plasma levels of BNP decreased significantly, while PRA, noradrenaline and aldosterone showed marked increases, resulting in a substantial reduction in urinary sodium excretion. Creatinine clearance was not affected. Urinary dopamine and dopamine metabolites increased in response to nitroprusside therapy. After 5 days of ACE inhibition, urinary sodium returned to baseline values, while urinary dopamine was markedly reduced. These results suggest that the renal dopaminergic system is activated in patients with severe heart failure by stimuli leading to sodium renal reabsorption.",

This parameter was elevated after the final dose in both groups. The AUC (eighth dose)/AUC (first dose) ratio in the elderly was similar to that in the young. Blood pressure (BP) tended to decrease in the young and significantly decreased in the elderly after the first dose. The hypotensive effect was not enhanced after the final dose in either group.", 
    "147": "These results suggest that although plasma temocaprilat concentration rises during repeated dosing, its BP-lowering effect is not enhanced in the elderly. Therefore, if a remarkable BP reduction is not detected at the initiation of treatment, the risk of hypotensive episode might be small during long-term therapy with temocapril in elderly hypertensive patients.",

The study included 200 patients randomized to receive candesartan 16 mg or lisinopril 20 mg for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of the same monotherapy or a combination treatment. Main outcomes are the reduction of microalbuminuria and blood pressure. All three of the treatments are effective, but the dual blockade is respectively 18%, 8 mmHg and 5 mmHg more effective in reducing microalbuminuria, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

However, some authors have argued that ASA may decrease the effectiveness of ACEIs by decreasing the release of prostagandins. Although such negative interaction is still not conclusively demonstrated, the merits of the use of this association should be judged in each individual patient with heart failure. It seems prudent to use low doses of ASA (< or = 250 mg/day) in these patients. ADP antagonists may constitute an alternative to ASA since they do not block prostaglandin synthesis.",

The other 18 patients did not receive perioperative angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Using standardized criteria for discontinuation of chest tubes (< 2 mL/kg/day), volume and duration of pleural drainage were compared between groups. RESULTS. There were no differences between groups in demographic, diagnostic, or hemodynamic factors. There was no difference in cardiopulmonary bypass time between groups and no difference in postoperative pulmonary arterial pressures. The duration of pleural drainage was shorter (2.2+/-1.4 vs 5.9+/-1.4 days, p<0.001) and the volume less during the first 24 hours (4.7+/-1.2 vs 7.7+/-2.1 mL/kg, p<0.001) and overall (10.6+/-2.4 vs 19.6+/-4.5 mL/kg, p<0.001) in patients who received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors than those who did not.

In all groups, cardioplegic arrest was achieved by administering St. Thomas Hospital Cardioplegic Solution (STHCS). The first group was utilized as the control. In the second group, hearts were arrested with lisinopril (1 micromol/L) enriched STHCS. In the third group, animals were pretreated with oral lisinopril (0.2 mg/kg/twice a day) for ten days.

In Group I, Group II and Group III they achieved 29.5%+/-5.6%, 41.9%+/-4.9%, and 55.3%+/-5.8% of their preischaemic contractile force values respectively.

We explored the effects of renal NO production on O2 consumption using renal cortex from mice deficient (-/-) in endothelial (e) nitric oxide synthase (NOS). O2 consumption was determined polarographically in slices of cortex from control and eNOS-/- mice. NO production was stimulated by bradykinin (BK) or ramiprilat (Ram) in the presence or absence of an NOS inhibitor. Basal O2 consumption was higher in eNOS-/- mice than in heterozygous controls (919 +/- 46 vs. 1,211 +/- 133 nmol O(2). min(-1). g(-1); P < 0.05). BK and Ram decreased O2 consumption significantly less in eNOS-/- mice [eNOS-/-: BK -19.0 +/- 2.8%, Ram -20.5 +/- 3.3% at 10(-4) M; control: BK -29.5 +/- 2.5%, Ram -34 +/- 1.6% at 10(-4) M]. The NO synthesis inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated this decrease in control but not eNOS-/- mice. An NO donor inhibited O2 consumption similarly in both groups independent of the presence of L-NAME. These results demonstrate that NO production by eNOS is responsible for regulation of renal O2 consumption in mouse kidney.",

In a mouse model of UUO, we found that tubulointerstitial fibrosis is blunted when the TNF-alpha receptor, TNFR1, is functionally knocked out. In this study, we used mutant mice with UUO in which the angiotensin II receptor AT(1a) or the TNF-alpha receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 were knocked out to elucidate interactions between the two systems. The contribution of both systems to renal fibrosis was assessed by treating TNFR1/TNFR2-double knockout (KO) mice with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. The increased interstitial volume (Vv(int)) in the C57BI/6 wild-type mouse was decreased in the AT(1a) KO from 32.8 +/- 4.0 to 21.0 +/- 3.7% (P < 0.005) or in the TNFR1/TNFR2 KO to 22.3 +/- 2.1% (P < 0.005). The Vv(int) of the TNFR1/TNFR2 KO was further decreased to 15.2 +/- 3.7% (P < 0.01) by enalapril compared with no treatment. The induction of TNF-alpha mRNA and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA in the kidney with UUO was significantly blunted in the AT(1a) or TNFR1/TNFR2 KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Treatment of the TNFR1/TNFR2 KO mouse with enalapril reduced both TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 mRNA and their proteins to near normal levels. Also, alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and myofibroblast proliferation were significantly inhibited in the AT(1a) or TNFR1/TNFR2 KO mice, and they were further inhibited in enalapril-treated TNFR1/TNFR2 KO mice. Incapacitating the angiotensin II or the TNF-alpha systems individually leads to partial blunting of fibrosis. Incapacitating both systems, by using a combination of genetic and pharmacological means, further inhibited interstitial fibrosis and tubule atrophy in obstructive nephropathy.",

The degree of fibrinolytic activation after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has been found to affect the risk of restenosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of ACE I/D, AT1R A1166C, and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms on the changes of PAI-1 activity after primary successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. In 29 consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients, undergoing primary successful angioplasty, genotyping of ACE I/D, AT1R A1166C, and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and PAI-1 plasma activity (chromogenic method) was assessed before and after angioplasty. Following angioplasty, PAI-1 activity increased in 10 of 29 patients and decreased or remained unchanged in 19 of 29. ACE DD genotype was significantly (P = 0.04) associated with an increase of PAI-1 activity post angioplasty (OR DD/ID+II = 6.5, CI 95% 4.83-8.22). Whereas no effect of PAI-1 4G/5G and AT1R A1166C polymorphisms on PAI-1 response to angioplasty was demonstrated, these data suggest that renin-angiotensin system genes are involved in the regulation of the fibrinolytic response to balloon injury, possibly affecting angiotensin converting enzyme activity. This interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and hemostasis may be a mechanism by which ACE DD genotype affects the risk of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.", 
    "174": "In the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, ACE inhibitor therapy reduces albumin excretion and slows the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our study was designed to investigate whether these effects lay in amelioration of the underlying glomerular structural abnormalities. A total of 54 type 1 diabetic patients with albuminuria and blood pressure (BP) <150/90 mmHg were randomized to receive 10 mg enalapril once daily, 10 mg nifedipine retard twice daily, or placebo in a multicenter double-blind study of 3 years' duration. Renal biopsy was performed at baseline and follow-up, and tissue was analyzed by standard morphometric methods. BP, GFR, albumin excretion rate (AER), and HbA1c were measured every 6 months. Enalapril lowered AER after 6 months by 26% (P < 0.05); however, this reduction was not sustained at 3 years. There was no significant effect of nifedipine or placebo on AER. GFR decreased by a similar average rate of 4.1 ml x min(-1) x year(-1) (95% CI 2.6-5.6) in all three groups. BP and HbA1c were unchanged throughout the study in all groups. At baseline, nearly all biopsies showed classic appearances of diabetic glomerulopathy. There was no detectable effect of enalapril compared with either nifedipine or placebo on renal structure over 3 years. However, we found that patients with increased AER have established glomerulopathy and a progressive average decline in GFR of 4.1 ml x min(-1) x year(-1) in the absence of overt hypertension, and baseline AER appeared predictive of subsequent mesangial volume fraction (r = 0.20, P = 0.0018). In this small cohort of nonhypertensive patients studied for 3 years, disease evolution appears unaffected by treatment with either enalapril or nifedipine.",

    "178": "During the following year, 14 of 49 patients required repeat dobutamine, with home treatment with dobutamine for 6.3+/-3.7 months (n = 5). At 1 year, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification improved from 3.6+/-0.5 to 1.9+/-1.0, p < 0.0001; yearly hospitalizations fell from 2.7+/-2.3 to 1.2+/-3.0, p = 0.02; and LVEF rose from 17+/-7% to 24+/-11%, p < 0.0001. At 1 year, 14 patients who remained dobutamine dependent had significantly more severe symptoms than dobutamine-independent patients (n = 35). Transplant or death occurred in 7 of 14 patients with follow-up dobutamine, and in 5 of 35 patients free of subsequent dobutamine, p = 0.03. Patients with poor outcome (transplant n = 10, death n = 12) continued to be more limited (NYHA 2.7+/-0.9 vs. 1.7+/-0.9, p = 0.0002), with more follow-up hospitalizations (3.6+/-5.4 vs. 0.6+/-0.8, p = 0.0004), and no improvement in LVEF (17+/-8vs. 28+/-11%, p = 0.003).",

Thirty percent of patients with continued need for dobutamine had a significantly poorer 1-year clinical outcome.", 
    "180": "Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin that may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors serve to support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some instances, maximal benefit may be obtained with Ang II blockade using both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials that document the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.", 
    "181": "In the outcome trials that provided information on renal function in older hypertensive patients, diuretics and beta-blockers were mostly used as first-line drugs. The long-term renal effects of calcium-channel blockers remain unclear.",

Active treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both, titrated or combined to reduce the sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg, to less than 150 mmHg. The main outcome measures were serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance calculated by the formula of Cockroft and Gault.", 
    "184": "Serum creatinine concentration at the time when participants were randomly allocated to study groups was less than 176.8 micromol/l (2.0 mg/dl), averaging 88 micromol/l. At the time of the last serum creatinine measurement, the blood pressure difference (P< 0.001) between the two groups was 11.6/4.1 mmHg. In the intention-to-treat analysis (11,427 patient-years), serum creatinine and the calculated creatinine clearance were not influenced by active treatment. However, in the patients assigned randomly to receive active treatment, the incidence of mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine at least 176.8 mmol/l) decreased by 64% (P= 0.04) and that of proteinuria by 33% (P= 0.03). Active treatment reduced the risk of proteinuria more in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients: by 71%, compared with 20% (P= 0.04). In non-proteinuric patients, active treatment did not influence serum creatinine, whereas in patients with proteinuria at entry to the study, serum creatinine decreased on active treatment (P< 0.001). Furthermore, in on-randomized treatment comparison stratified for risk at baseline, serum creatinine concentration did not change (P= 0.98) in patients continuing to receive monotherapy with nitrendipine, whereas it increased by 6.73 mmol/l (P < 0.001) in patients who received hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with other study medication (P < 0.001 for difference in trends).", 
    "185": "In older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive treatment starting with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, nitrendipine, did not decrease blood pressure at the expense of renal function and prevented the development of proteinuria, especially in diabetic patients.",

    "187": "Eight-week-old male SHR were subjected to five-sixth nephrectomy. At the age of 10 weeks, the rats were randomly allocated to groups that received troglitazone (70 mg/kg per day); the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril (10 mg/kg per day); troglitazone (70 mg/kg per day) plus temocapril (10 mg/kg per day), or a vehicle alone as an untreated control group. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary protein excretion were measured every 2 weeks. At the age of 22 weeks, biochemical measurements and histological examination were performed.", 
    "188": "Blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and body weight were similar in the four groups. SBP, serum creatinine and glomerular sclerosis index were significantly reduced in all treated groups compared with those in the control group. Urinary protein excretion, glomerular volume and aortic media thickness were significantly decreased in temocapril-treated rats and troglitazone plus temocapril-treated rats compared with those in control rats. Although antihypertensive effects of troglitazone were minute compared with those of temocapril or troglitazone plus temocapril, there was no significant difference between the glomerular sclerosis indices in these three drug-treated groups.", 
    "189": "The results suggest that troglitazone has renoprotective effects in this rat model. These effects might be due to the inhibition of growth factors rather than to the minute hypotensive effect, although the mechanism remains to be elucidated.", 
    "190": "Numerous studies have shown that angiotensin II enhances sympathetic nervous transmission. The objective of the present study was to quantify the inhibitory effect of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers losartan, irbesartan and telmisartan and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on sympathetic neurotransmission and to compare the potency of these agents both at the presynaptic and the postsynaptic levels.", 
    "191": "In the male, normotensive pithed rat model, we studied the effect of losartan (1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), irbesartan (3, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg), telmisartan (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) and captopril (1.5, 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg) on electrical stimulation of the thoraco-lumbar spinal cord. To investigate the interaction between postsynaptic AT1-receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors, the effects of these compounds on pressor responses to exogenous noradrenaline were studied.", 
    "192": "Stimulation of the thoracolumbar spinal cord caused a stimulation-frequency dependent rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that could be dose-dependently reduced by both AT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibition. Interestingly, the highest doses of the AT1 antagonists caused less than maximal reduction in the rise in DBP. This phenomenon was not observed after ACE inhibition by captopril. In experiments with exogenous noradrenaline, no effect of AT1 blockade or ACE inhibition on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated blood pressure responses was seen.", 
    "193": "We conclude that, in the pithed rat model, the effects of stimulation of the thoraco-lumbar spinal cord on DBP are counteracted by blockade of presynaptically located AT1 receptors. The order of potency concerning sympatico-inhibition is telmisartan > losartan > irbesartan. Regarding the inhibition of angiotensin II-induced facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission, marked differences were observed between selective AT1 blockade and ACE inhibition. The finding that all three AT1 blockers cause less than maximal inhibition in their highest doses, as opposed to captopril, suggests that this is a class effect of the AT1 antagonists.", 
    "194": "Use of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) has suggested that at least one in 10 hypertensive subjects have primary aldosteronism (PA). There is thus a timely need to review the literature for effective drug therapies and to speculate on other therapeutic options by taking into account recent advances in understanding of the PA disease pathophysiological process.",

The best therapeutic response is obtained by directly antagonizing aldosterone at the receptor level using medium to low dose spironolactone and this response can be predicted by a raised ARR. The response to other potassium-sparing diuretics and calcium channel blockers are modest. IHA responds better than angiotensin II-unresponsive APA to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and this may also be true with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The discovery of the aldosterone synthase gene opens up the possibility for gene therapy.",

The target blood pressure (BP) for antihypertensive management should be systolic < 140 mmHg and diastolic < 90 mmHg, with minimal or no drug side-effects. However, a lesser reduction will elicit benefit, although this is not optimal. The reduction of BP in the elderly and in those with severe hypertension should be achieved gradually over 6 months. Stricter BP control is required for patients with end-organ damage, coexisting risk factors and co-morbidity, e.g. diabetes mellitus. Coexistent risk factors should also be controlled.",

    "205": "Adipocytes express many of the proteins of the renin-angiotensin system including angiotensinogen and AT(1)-receptors. A principal function of adipocyte tissue is the provision of energy substrate through lipolysis. This study was undertaken to determine if angiotensin-II (Ang-II) infusion or blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy with enalapril altered lipolytic activity and substrate oxidation. Eleven healthy male subjects were enrolled in the first study and postabsorptive whole-body lipolysis activity was measured using a stable isotope of glycerol ((2)H(5)-glycerol). Substrate oxidation was determined using indirect calorimetry in the Clinical Research Center. Subjects were then sequentially treated with low-dose Ang-II infusion (0.3 and then 1.0 ng/kg/min) on separate days, and the lipolysis and oxidation studies were repeated. Lastly, each subject was treated with 2 weeks of ACE inhibitor with enalapril (20 mg daily) and underwent lipolysis and oxidation studies for a fourth time. In a second study, 14 healthy male subjects were enrolled and underwent an identical baseline lipolysis and substrate oxidation assessment. These subjects then received an Ang-II infusion at pressor doses (10 ng/kg/min), and changes in lipolytic activity and substrate oxidation were measured again. In the first study, there was no effect on lipolysis activity from low-dose Ang-II infusion (baseline lipolysis activity (mean +/- SD) 2.06 +/- 0.55 micromol/kg/min, 2.10 +/- 0.69 micromol/kg/min after 0.3 ng/kg/min, and 2.32 +/- 0.56 micromol/kg/min after 1.0 ng/kg/min) or enalapril therapy (2.35 +/- 1.00 micromol/kg/min). In the second study, the larger dose of Ang-II increased blood pressure by 14/17 mm Hg, but there was no effect on lipolysis activity (1.36 +/- 0.49 micromol/kg/min v 1.63 +/- 0.82 micromol/kg/min). Substrate oxidation rates were largely unaffected by Ang-II infusions or enalapril therapy. There was no evidence that treatment with subpressor or pressor dosages of Ang-II produced a significant alteration in lipolytic activity. Moreover, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with enalapril was equally unremarkable in its effects on whole-body lipolysis. These data support the general concept that the renin-angiotensin system in adipocytes serves more to regulate the regional blood flow to adipose tissue and the size and number of fat cells rather than participating directly in the regulation of energy substrate.", 
    "206": "The present study was carried out to investigate whether estrogen modulates the drinking response induced by activation of angiotensinergic neural pathways from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the subfornical organ (SFO) in the female rats. Microinjection of ANG II (10(-10) M, 0.2 microl) into the LHA caused drinking in 17 out of 26 ovariectomized (OVX) female rats that were treated with propylene glycol (PG) vehicle and in 18 out of 28 OVX female rats that were treated with estrogen benzoate (EB). In both groups, previous injections of the ANG II antagonist saralasin (Sar, 10(-10) M, 0.2 microl) into the SFO significantly attenuated the water intake caused by the ANG II injection, suggesting that the ANG II-induced drinking response may be mediated by the angiotensinergic LHA projections to the SFO. Injections of ANG II (10(-10) M, 0.2 microl) into the SFO elicited drinking in all the animals that demonstrated the drinking response to ANG II injected into the LHA. The amount of water intake caused by either the injection of ANG II into the LHA or the SFO was significantly greater in the PG-treated than in the EB-treated animals. These results suggest that the circulating estrogen may act to attenuate the dipsogenic response induced by activation of the angiotensinergic pathways from the LHA to the SFO.",

Of the 1146 patients on mono- or combination therapies, 434 (56.8%) were treated with beta-blockers, 244 (31.9%) with diuretics, 211 (27.6%) with CCBs, 139 (18.2%) with ACE inhibitors, 103 (13.5%) with alpha-methyldopa 8 (1.0%) with brinerdine and 7 (0.9%) with hydralazine. In the 332 (43.5%) patients on combination therapy, 15 different two- and three-antihypertensive drug combinations were prescribed: a diuretic with a beta-blocker (37.2%) and a beta-blocker with either a CCB (20.9%) or an ACE inhibitor (12.4%) were the most popular two-drug regimens. The most commonly prescribed triple drug regimens were a diuretic and a beta-blocker plus either a CCB (26.1%) or an ACE inhibitor (17.4%) and diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor and a CCB (15.2%). Daily dosage of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and alpha-methyldopa were somewhat high in a considerable proportion of patients on both mono- and combined therapies. A substantial proportion (9.7%) of patients on monotherapy were treated with immediate release nifedipine.", 
    "210": "The pharmacotherapy of hypertension in elderly patients was found in some instances not to conform to recommended guidelines. For certain classes of antihypertensive agent such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and alpha-methyldopa, neither the principles of geriatric pharmacology nor of antihypertensive combination therapy, and in particular, the need to reduce daily dosage, were followed. The use of immediate release nifedipine in the elderly is irrational, and instead, the use of long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs should be considered. The results of long-term randomized clinical trials published during the last decade have had a minimal impact on clinical practice of primary care physicians in Bahrain.", 
    "211": "Prolongation of QT dispersion can be observed in some patients with myocardial infarction and serves as a possible independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to reduce QT dispersion in myocardial infarction patients. We hypothesized that ACE gene I/D polymorphism, which is known to modulate ACE activity, may also affect QT dispersion after myocardial infarction.", 
    "212": "We studied 609 myocardial infarction patients (532 men, aged 56.1+/-0.3; mean 5.5 years after myocardial infarction) from a population-based myocardial infarction register by standardized questionnaire, anthropometry, ECG, echocardiography, and genotyping of ACE I/D polymorphism. In addition, 540 unaffected siblings (251 men, age 54.6+/-0.4 years) of these patients were studied by the same protocol. As compared with their healthy siblings, mean QT dispersion was prolonged in myocardial infarction patients (65.9+/-1.4 ms vs 91.2+/-2.3 ms, respectively, P<0.001). QT dispersion was negatively correlated to left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.005). The ACE DD-genotype was associated with longer QT dispersion in myocardial infarction patients (103.0+/-4.6 ms vs 81.9+/-4.5 ms in the II group, P<0.001). This association was noted to be strong in multivariate analyses that included age, gender, ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, medication, and heart rate. In contrast, no association between the ACE DD-genotype and QT dispersion was detected in healthy siblings of myocardial infarction patients.", 
    "213": "Thus, the ACE D-allele may be associated with increased QT dispersion in patients after myocardial infarction but not in healthy subjects. An interaction of myocardial damage and genetic predisposition that both enhance the activity of the renin angiotensin system may decrease the repolarization homogeneity of the heart.", 
    "214": "Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) two- to fourfold compared with the risk in non-diabetic subjects. Although type 2 diabetes is associated with a clustering of risk factors (small, dense low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particles, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, high triglycerides, elevated blood pressure, obesity, central obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, etc.), the cause for an excess risk of CVD remains unknown. Recent drug treatment trials have indicated that the lowering of total and LDL cholesterol and blood pressure is similarly beneficial in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The treatment of hyperglycaemia reduces micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients. Beta-blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and thrombolytic therapy are also effective in the treatment of CVD amongst diabetic patients.", 
    "215": "The interaction between an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ramipril) and renal lithium handling was analysed in conscious, normotensive Wistar rats in the absence or the presence of a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant. The rats were treated for 5 days with ramipril (1 mg/kg/day p.o.) or its vehicle, alone or together with icatibant (0.1 mg/kg/day, s.c. infusion). Lithium chloride (8.3 mg/kg i.p.) was given as a single dose on day 5. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by tail plethysmography on day 3 (3, 9 and 15 h after ramipril administration) and renal function on day 4 (0-6 and 6-24 h urine sampling) and day 5 (0-6 h urine sampling). In another group of rats, 24 h sodium excretion was assessed during the first 4 days of ramipril treatment. Ramipril decreased renal lithium clearance (90+/-8 vs. 142+/-10 microl/min/100 g, P<0.001, n=24) and increased the fractional lithium reabsorption (74.3+/-1.9 vs. 66.7+/-1.7%, P<0.05) and plasma lithium concentration (0.108+/-0.006 vs. 0.085+/-0.004 mM, P<0.01). Alteration of renal lithium handling by ramipril was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure (-15% 3 h after ramipril administration) and sodium excretion (0-6 h after ramipril). The 24-h sodium excretion, however, tended to increase. Icatibant had no effect per se on renal function but attenuated the ramipril-induced decrease in renal lithium clearance (118+/-16 vs. 90+/-8 microl/min/100 g, n=12 and 24 respectively, P<0.05 one-tailed test) and systolic blood pressure. These results suggest that endogenous bradykinin contributes to the ramipril-associated alteration in renal lithium handling. Bradykinin B2 receptor-mediated vasodilation seems to be involved.", 
    "216": "A new method of measurement, simultaneous multigated spectral Doppler imaging (MSDI), was used to quantify the hemodynamic changes in kidneys after administration of captopril.", 
    "217": "Forty kidneys in 22 hypertensive patients were included in the study. All underwent MSDI and scintigraphy before and after administration of captopril.", 
    "218": "With scintigraphy used as the gold standard for diagnosing renal artery stenosis (RAS), three kidneys were found to be positive for RAS. Multigated spectral Doppler imaging detected a decrease in the resistive index after administration of captopril in all patients with RAS and correctly excluded RAS in one patient who was diagnosed as having RAS on scintigraphy. The resistive index was increased after captopril administration in normally functioning kidneys and was unchanged in kidneys with impaired function.", 
    "219": "With further supportive evidence, MSDI may prove to be a powerful tool for the acquisition of resistive index information and may increase the value of the resistive index as a physiological hemodynamic parameter in the evaluation of normal and abnormal conditions.", 
    "220": "To investigate the hypothesis that abnormalities of hemorheological (fibrinogen, plasma viscosity), endothelial (von Willebrand factor [vWF]), and platelet (soluble P-selectin) function would exist in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) who are in sinus rhythm, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 120 patients with stable CHF (median ejection fraction 30%). We also hypothesized that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers would beneficially affect the measured indices.", 
    "221": "In the cross-sectional analysis, plasma viscosity (P=0.001), fibrinogen (P=0.02), vWF (P<0.0001), and soluble P-selectin (P<0.001) levels were elevated in patients with CHF compared with healthy controls. Women demonstrated greater abnormalities of hemorheological indices and vWF than males (all P<0.05). Plasma viscosity (P=0.009) and fibrinogen (P=0.0014) levels were higher in patients with more severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV), but there was no relationship with left ventricular ejection fraction. When ACE inhibitors were introduced, there was a reduction in fibrinogen (repeated-measures ANOVA, P=0.016) and vWF (P=0.006) levels compared with baseline. There were no significant changes in hemorheological, endothelial, or platelet markers after the introduction of beta-blocker therapy, apart from a rise in mean platelet count (P<0.001).", 
    "222": "Abnormal levels of soluble P-selectin, vWF, and hemorheological indices may contribute to a hypercoagulable state in CHF, especially in female patients and in those with more severe NYHA class. Treatment with ACE inhibitors improved the prothrombotic state in CHF, whereas the addition of beta-blockers did not. These positive effects of ACE inhibitors may offer an explanation for the observed reduction in ischemic events in clinical trials.", 
    "223": "Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the beta-hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine. The enzyme in chromaffin granules occurs in a soluble form and a form confined to the surrounding membrane. DBH was noncovalently immobilized in the hydrophobic interface of an immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) liquid chromatographic stationary phase and the resulting DBH-IAM stationary phase was enzymatically active and was shown to mimic the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. DBH was also covalently immobilized onto a silica-based support containing, glutaraldehyde-P (Glut-P). The resulting DBH-Glut-P interphase was also enzymatically active, reproducible and shown to display characteristics of the solubilized enzyme. The results demonstrate that the different immobilization methods utilized for the enzyme can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the enzyme kinetic constants associated with enzyme/substrate and enzyme/inhibitor interactions for the two distinct forms of the enzyme. These new entities can be used in basic biochemical studies as well as in high throughput screening of substances for DBH substrate/inhibitor properties.", 
    "224": "This study investigated whether pulmonary vascular remodelling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertensive rats (10% oxygen; 4 weeks) could be prevented by treatment, during hypoxia, with amlodipine (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.), either alone or in combination with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Medial thickening of pulmonary arteries (30-500 microm o.d.) was attenuated by amlodipine whereas it was totally prevented by the combination treatment (amlodipine plus perindopril); neomuscularisation of small alveolar arteries (assessed from critical closing pressure in isolated perfused lungs) was not affected. Pulmonary vascular resistance (isolated perfused lungs) was reduced by both treatment regimes but only combination treatment reduced right ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, amlodipine has anti-remodelling properties in pulmonary hypertensive rats. The finding that combining amlodipine with another anti-remodelling drug produced effects on vascular structure that were additive raises the question of whether combination therapy with two different anti-remodelling drugs may be of value in the treatment of patients with hypoxic (and possibly other forms of) pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "225": "In recent years, a target blood pressure (BP) of at least 125/75 mmHg has been sought in order to reduce the rate of progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) and cardiovascular mortality. Some antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists (and perhaps endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors and endothelin antagonists), may also reduce CRF progression because they block some of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in renal damage. Although this effect seems to be partially independent of BP reduction, it is still not clear whether these drugs are really superior to other antihypertensive agents when low BP is achieved. However, the possibility that combination treatments with some of these drugs may confer additive or even synergistic renoprotective effects other than BP control is not only fascinating, but also important because multidrug antihypertensive regimens are required anyway to manage BP adequately in the majority of patients with CRF.", 
    "226": "Preventing subclinical organ damage is currently a major issue in the management of patients with essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs which act through different pathophysiological mechanisms might confer specific target organ protection beyond what is already provided by their blood pressure lowering effect.",

Blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness and timed urinary albumin excretion were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.",

Overall, end-organ damage improved with persistent blood pressure control. However, the two treatments had different specific effects. Lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction of the left ventricular mass index (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, P< 0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from 34+/-15 to 9+/-2 microg/min, P< 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater reduction of carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8+/-0.06 to 0.6+/-0.06 mm, P< 0.01).",

    "230": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the most effective antiproteinuric agents and should be used as first-line drugs in both diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies. The role of calcium channel blockers (CCB) is much more controversial. In diabetic patients verapamil and diltiazem seem more effective than dihydropyridines in reducing urinary protein excretion, and have additive effects with ACEI, but little is available on chronic treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies for non-dihydropyridine CCBs. To test whether the combination of verapamil 180 mg or amlodipine 5 mg with trandolapril 2 mg reduces urinary protein excretion more than trandolapril 2 mg alone, we planned a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial. The secondary aims are to evaluate the effects of both treatments on the selectivity of proteinuria and check their safety. Consecutive patients aged between 18 and 70 years with non-diabetic proteinuria > or =2 g/24 h and plasma creatinine < 3 mg/dl or creatinine clearance > or = 20 ml/min are asked to participate. After a four-week run-in during which previous antihypertensive therapy is withdrawn, a single dose of trandolapril 2 mg is given once a day in open conditions for four weeks. At the end of this period patients are randomly assigned to receive once a day, in a double blind fashion, either trandolapril 2 mg and verapamil 180 mg [plus a placebo], or trandolapril 2 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg. They are monitored after one, two, five and eight months.",

Subjects were recruited from patients attending other outpatient clinics and entered into the study if their SBP was more than 150 mm Hg after three visits. Patients were given a low and high dose of each of the main classes of drugs or placebo for 1 month each. The study was a balanced, randomized crossover design with five periods: placebo; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; beta-blocking drugs; calcium-blocking drugs; and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 24 to 26 h after the previous dose. A questionnaire for side effects was administered at each visit. Seventy-four patients entered the study. beta-Blockers could not be used in 15 patients because of asthma or bronchospasm and these had two placebo periods. There were 9 of 66 patients on P, 9 of 46 on beta-blockers, 4 of 65 on calcium-blocking drugs, 4 of 65 on diuretic, and 1 of 62 patients on ACE inhibitors who did not progress to the higher dose because of side effects. Decreases in SBP compared to randomized placebo were calcium-blocking drugs 15 mm Hg = diuretic 13 mm Hg > ACE inhibitors 8 mm Hg = beta-blockers 5 mm Hg. Blood pressure decrease correlated with placebo BP (P < .0005, r = 0.53 to 0.70). When corrected for placebo, target SBP (<140 mm Hg) was reached in between 6% to 15% of patients on monotherapy. Sequential monotherapy achieved target in 29%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and diuretics had no more side effects than placebo. Patients on beta-blockers had more side effects and the well-being score was reduced. Diuretics and calcium-blocking drugs are more effective in elderly patients at lowering SBP pressure. beta-Blockers were relatively ineffective, were frequently contraindicated, and had more side effects. Monotherapy achieved control in only a small number of patients. In elderly people with essential hypertension, therapy should be instituted with diuretics or calcium-blocking drugs, but combination therapy will usually be required to achieve goal.",

Among African American patients, 23 of 28 reached the top dose of 40 mg/day, whereas only 14 of 36 Caucasian patients reached that dose level. Among Caucasians, 92% responded, and only 48% of African Americans.

We evaluated the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and on bradykinin in postmenopausal women (PMW) who were hypertensive or normotensive. Subjects included 28 PMW whose elevated blood pressure (BP) was well controlled on antihypertensive agents excluding diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and ANG II receptor antagonists. As controls, we evaluated 16 normotensive PMW. All subjects received oral HRT daily for 6 months. The plasma levels of angiotensin I (ANG I), ANG II, and bradykinin as well as plasma renin activity (PRA) showed a significant increase in HRT in the hypertensive group, but not in the normotensive group. The serum ACE activity showed a significant decrease in both groups, but the plasma level of aldosterone was unchanged. Despite the decrease in serum ACE activity, there was an increase in the plasma ANG II level. Hormone replacement therapy increased the level of ANG II in the hypertensive women, but their BP was unaffected. The increase in plasma bradykinin level may maintain homeostasis in the presence of an increase in plasma ANG II, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hormone replacement therapy was associated with a decrease in serum ACE and an increase in plasma bradykinin in hypertensive PMW. Accordingly, the protective effect of HRT against cardiovascular disease in PMW can be provided by a decrease in ACE activity and an increase in bradykinin.",

The size of the infarct was determined using the creatine kinase integral method. 50 patients were investigated by cine magnetic resonance imaging 1 and 26 weeks after the infarction.

The MEDV-13 uses a modified electrotopological state (E-state) index to substitute for the relative eletronegativity (q) of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule of interest in the MEDV and a topological distance for the relative distance (d) in the MEDV. For an organic molecule containing several chemical elements such as C, H, O, N, S, F, Cl, Br, I, and P, the MEDV-13 includes at best 91 descriptors. Then it is essential to employ a principal component regression (PCR) technique to derive a QSAR model relating the biological activities to the MEDV-13. The MEDV-13 is used to study the QSAR of the corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) binding affinity of the steroids and the activity inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) of dipeptides, and resulting models have a comparable quality to the current three-dimensional (3D) methods such as CoMFA though the MEDV-13 is a descriptor based on two-dimensional topological information.",

With treatment, blood pressure decreased and plasma renin activity increased, while plasma aldosterone concentrations did not change. Aldosterone escape was observed in 38 of the 75 patients and in 17 of 37 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy before treatment. Left ventricular mass index did not change in patients with aldosterone escape but decreased significantly in patients without aldosterone escape. The present study demonstrated a high incidence of aldosterone escape in patients with essential hypertension despite the use of ACE inhibitors. The results also suggest that aldosterone escape may reverse the beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor on left ventricular hypertrophy.",

The second method depends on second derivative of the ratio spectra by measurement of the amplitudes at 241.2 and 273.2 nm for benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Chemometric methods, classical least squares and principal component regression, were applied to analyze the mixture.

The separation was carried out on Merck HPTLC aluminum sheets of silica gel 60 F(254,) using ethyl acetate-methanol-chloroform (10:3:2 v/v) as mobile phase. Second order polynomial equation was used for the regression line in the range 2-20 and 2.5-25 microg/spot for benazepril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The second method was based on HPLC separation of the two drugs on reversed phase, ODS column at ambient temperature using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water (35:65 v/v) and adjusting to pH 3.3 with acetic acid. Quantitation was achieved with UV detection at 240 nm based on peak area with linear calibration curves at concentration ranges 10-60 and 12.5-75 microg ml(-1) for benazepril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively.

Preliminary studies to evaluate the in vivo activity of RXP407 in rat led us to suspect possible differences in the binding property of RXP407 between human and rat ACE. The aim of the present study was thus to determine the potency of RXP407 toward rat and mouse ACEs, as compared to non-recombinant human ACE, and to assess the efficacy of this inhibitor in discriminating between the N- and C-domains of these ACE enzymes. By comparing the ability of RXP407 to block purified somatic and germinal ACE from mice, RXP407 was shown to be a potent N-domain-selective inhibitor of mouse somatic ACE, a behavior similar to that observed with human somatic ACE. In contrast, RXP407 appeared less potent toward purified ACE from rat and furthermore was unable to block ACE activity present in crude rat plasma. This study demonstrated that for further evaluation of the in vivo efficacy of RXP407, mice rather than rats should be used as the animal model. Thus, following the change in the Ac-S-D-K-P plasmatic levels, after i.v. injection of RXP407 to mice, will permit the potency and selectivity of this novel ACE inhibitor to be assessed.",

It is unclear whether this mortality benefit also applies to elderly patients with cardiogenic shock. Elderly residents (age > or = 65 years) of the Worcester, Massachusetts metropolitan area (1990 census population = 437,000) hospitalized with confirmed AMI and cardiogenic shock in all metropolitan Worcester, Massachusetts hospitals between 1986 and 1997 constituted the sample of interest. We examined the use of coronary reperfusion strategies, adjunctive therapy, and hospital mortality in a cohort of 166 cardiogenic patients treated early in the reperfusion era (1986 to 1991) compared with 144 patients with AMI treated approximately 1 decade later (1993 to 1997). There was a significant increase in the use of an early revascularization strategy over time (2% vs 16%, p <0.001). Marked increases in use of antiplatelet therapy, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were also observed over the decade-long experience. In-hospital case fatality declined significantly over time, from 80% (1986 to 1991) to 69% (1993 to 1997) in elderly patients who developed cardiogenic shock (p = 0.03). After adjusting for differences in potentially confounding prognostic characteristics between patients hospitalized in the 2 study periods, an even more pronounced reduction in hospital mortality (42%) was observed for the most recently hospitalized cohort. The most powerful predictor of in-hospital survival was use of an early revascularization approach to treatment. Thus, hospital mortality has declined for patients > or = 65 years of age with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, and this decline has occurred in the setting of broader use of early revascularization and adjunctive medical therapy for this high-risk population.", 
    "253": "Despite scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies continue to be underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospital Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl), beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease. Treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged after myocardial infarction in the 2-year period before (1992 to 1993) and the 2-year period after (1994 to 1995) CHAMP was implemented. In the pre- and post-CHAMP patient groups, aspirin use at discharge improved from 68% to 92% (p <0.01), beta blocker use improved from 12% to 62% (p <0.01), ACE inhibitor use increased from 6% to 58% (p <0.01), and statin use increased from 6% to 86% (p <0.01). This increased use of treatment persisted during subsequent follow-up. There was also a significant increase in patients achieving a LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl (6% vs 58%, p <0.001) and a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality. Compared with conventional guidelines and care, CHAMP was associated with a significant increase in use of medications that have been previously demonstrated to reduce mortality; more patients achieved an LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl, and there were improved clinical outcomes in patients after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction.",

It has been demonstrated that non-dippers are at increased risk of end-organ damage, in particular, renal and cardiovascular complications. As no reliable means of reversing impaired blood pressure variation has been established so far, we aimed at assessing the effect of a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril on the disturbed circadian blood pressure rhythm in diabetics without hypertension or nephropathy. A total of 18 type 1 diabetes patients (8 male, 10 female), aged 33.5+/-4.8, with duration of diabetes 5.8+/-2.8 years and HbA(1c) 6.6+/-0.4% (range 5.8--7.1%) were enrolled into the study. Ten well-matched type 1 diabetes patients served as an untreated control group. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) were performed thrice in each subject: before trandolapril, 2 mg once daily in the morning, was started; after the first dose of the drug; and after 2 weeks of the treatment. Mean (+/-S.D.) values of systolic, diastolic blood pressure, night fall in systolic, and diastolic blood pressure in the treatment group were (1) at baseline: 124.0+/-5.8 mm Hg, 89.3+/-4.2 mm Hg, 3.0+/-2.2%, 5.1+/-3.8%; (2) after the first dose: 116.1+/-7.6 mm Hg (P<.01 vs. baseline), 82.6+/-6.7 mm Hg (P<.01 vs. baseline), 4.2+/-2.6%, 4.7+/-2.5%; and (3) after 14-day treatment: 116.6+/-8.1 mm Hg (P<.01 vs. baseline), 76.9+/-9.6 mm Hg (P<.01 vs. baseline), 17.6+/-6.9% (P<.01 vs. baseline and after 24-h values), 19.4+/-8.0% (P<.01 vs. baseline and after 24-h values), respectively. ABPM results for the untreated controls were similar in all three measurements. In conclusion, within 14 days of trandolapril treatment, circadian blood pressure variation was successfully restored in normoalbuminuric normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients.",

A low capacity anion-exchange column was used with potassium phthalate as the mobile phase marker and indirect detection at 280 nm. The chromatographic conditions were optimized using the Box and Behnken factorial experimental design. The method was precise and accurate with percent recovery (+/-%R.S.D.) of 99.8+/-0.7% (n=12) with the spiked concentrations ranging between +/-30% of the assay level. Youden and Steiner's robustness test, involving seven chosen variables, showed that the method is robust. Using the developed method, commercially available captopril tablets were assayed and the results were found to be comparable with those obtained by the compendial method.",

Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was significantly increased on the third day of treatment and remained stable throughout the treatment period. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not change throughout the study. Filtration fraction (FF) was maximally lowered on the third day of treatment and remained stable during treatment. UAE was already significantly lowered after 2 days of treatment, during both the day and night, and remained stable throughout the treatment period. The time course of the changes in UAE paralleled that of the changes in MAP, ERPF and FF.", 
    "259": "The angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan effectively lowers UAE in microalbuminuric IDDM patients. The changes observed in renal haemodynamics and UAE are concordant in time and maximal within only a few days of treatment. These results support the importance of the specific effects of interference in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in microalbuminuric IDDM on blood pressure and renal haemodynamics in reducing urinary protein leakage, rather than non-haemodynamic, structural changes of the glomerular basement membrane.", 
    "260": "Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease; therefore, strategies to prevent the development of renal disease require close study. Here it is demonstrated that transient treatment of prepubescent rats with angiotensin inhibitors attenuated their susceptibility to the development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis after maturation. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive Izumo strain rats were divided into four groups, treated with vehicle, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) delapril (40 mg/kg per d), the angiotensin receptor antagonist (AT1R-Ant) candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg per d), or the vasodilator hydralazine (25 mg/kg per d) from weaning to puberty (3 to 10 wk of age), and then monitored without treatment for 6 mo. BP in the ACEI- and AT1R-Ant-treated groups remained significantly decreased, compared with the untreated and hydralazine-treated groups. Moreover, marked proteinuria and nephrosclerosis developed in the untreated and hydralazine-treated groups at 30 wk but were suppressed in the ACEI- and AT1R-Ant-treated groups. Of interest, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II concentrations, and renal renin mRNA levels were reduced by >50% in the ACEI- and AT1R-Ant-treated rats, suggesting that the treatments may have attenuated the development of nephrosclerosis by overcoming the susceptibility of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats to overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "261": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of a number of integral membrane proteins that is proteolytically shed from the cell surface by a zinc metallosecretase. Mutagenesis of Asn(631) to Gln in the juxtamembrane stalk region of ACE resulted in more efficient secretion of the mutant protein (ACE(NQ)) as determined by pulse-chase analysis. In contrast to the wild-type ACE, the cleavage of ACE(NQ) was not blocked by the metallosecretase inhibitor batimastat but by the serine protease inhibitor, 1,3-dichloroisocoumarin. Incubation of the cells at 15 degrees C revealed that ACE(NQ) was cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and mass spectrometric analysis of the secreted form of the protein indicated that it had been cleaved at the Asn(635)-Ser(636) bond, three residues N-terminal to the normal secretase cleavage site at Arg(638)-Ser(639). These data clearly show that a point mutation in the juxtamembrane region of an integral membrane protein can invoke the action of a mechanistically and spatially distinct secretase. In light of this observation, previous data on the effect of mutations in the juxtamembrane stalk of shed proteins being accommodated by a single secretase having a relaxed specificity need to be re-evaluated.",

Transplant-free survival was compared by genotype for the whole cohort and separately in patients with (n=120) and those without beta-blocker therapy (n=208) at the time of entry. Transplant-free survival was significantly poorer for patients with the D: allele (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=94/77/75; 2-year=78/65/60; ordered log-rank test, P:=0.044). In patients not treated with beta-blockers, the adverse impact of ACE D allele was dramatically increased (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=95/75/67; 2-year=81/61/48; P:=0.005). In contrast, in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy, no influence of ACE genotype on transplant-free survival was evident (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=91/80/86; 2-year=70/71/77; P:=0.73).", 
    "264": "In a cohort of patients with systolic dysfunction, the ACE D allele was associated with a significantly poorer transplant-free survival.

    "265": "End-stage renal disease is an enormous public health burden with an increasing incidence and prevalence. This escalating prevalence suggests that newer therapeutic interventions and strategies are needed to complement current antihypertensive approaches. Although much evidence shows that angiotensin II mediates progressive renal disease, recent evidence also implicates aldosterone as an important pathogenetic factor in progressive renal disease. Several lines of experimental evidence show that selective blockade of aldosterone, independent of renin-angiotensin blockade, reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat model and reduces proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in the subtotally nephrectomized rat model (ie, remnant kidney). Although pharmacological blockade with angiotensin II-receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis and/or glomerulosclerosis, selective reinfusion of aldosterone restores these abnormalities despite continued renin-angiotensin blockade. Based on this theoretic construct, randomized clinical studies will be initiated to delineate the potential renal-protective effects of antihypertensive therapy using aldosterone-receptor blockade. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.", 
    "266": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been shown to prevent left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. However, the effect of angiotensin on the signal transduction pathway of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction is as yet unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure myocardial MAPKs and AP-1, NF- kappa B, and Sp-1 DNA-binding activities after myocardial infarction. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on signal transduction pathway. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the coronary artery in Wistar rats. Temocapril (ACE inhibitor) (3 and 30 mg/kg/day) and candesartan cilexitil (ARB) (1 and 10 mg/kg/day) were orally administered once a day. After ligation of the left descending coronary artery, JNKs (p46JNK and p55JNK) increased to 2.0- (P<0.01) and 2.8-fold (P<0.01) at 7 days, respectively. ERKs (p44ERK and p42ERK) and p38 activities did not increase significantly. AP-1 and NF- kappa B binding activities increased at 5 days, reached their peak 2.2- and 2.0-fold at 7 days. Sp-1 did not change. ACE inhibitor and ARB inhibited JNKs, NF- kappa B and AP-1 activities. Increased JNKs, AP-1, NF- kappa B, and Sp-1 DNA-binding activities were suppressed by both drugs in the infarcted region. Doppler-echocardiography showed that ACE inhibitor and ARB prevented the dilatation of left ventricular cavity at 14 days and improved diastolic filling pattern. JNKs, AP-1 and NF- kappa B activation in myocardial infarcted rats could be responsible for left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction and angiotensin may be related to the activation of these signals.", 
    "267": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the early development of cardiac hypertrophy, but their roles in chronic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are unclear. We studied the angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac MAPK activation of the hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats in the subacute developing LVH stage, the chronic compensated LVH stage, and the congestive heart failure (CHF) stage. In the isolated, coronary-perfused heart preparation, Ang II infusion (1x10(-6)mol/l) activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-MAPK in the LV myocardium. No substantial differences were observed in the Ang II-induced ERK activation between the normotensive control DS rats and the hypertensive DS rats in either stage. In contrast, the Ang II-induced activation of JNK and p38-MAPK was augmented in the subacute LVH stage of the hypertensive DS rats, but then progressively attenuated in the chronic LVH and CHF stages. Chronic treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, temocapril (20 mg/kg/day), ameliorated the responsiveness of the JNK/p38-MAPK activation, suggesting that the decreased JNK/p38-MAPK activation is a consequence of negative feedback regulation for the activated cardiac renin-angiotensin system in chronic LVH and CHF. Thus, the Ang II-induced activation of multiple cardiac MAPK pathways are differentially regulated, depending on the stages of chronic hypertrophic process. The JNK and p38-MAPK activation may be involved in the early development of adaptive LVH. However, the responsiveness of the cardiac JNK/p38-MAPK pathways progressively decreased in chronic LVH and CHF under the chronic activation of tissue renin-angiotensin system.",

Hypertensive patients were put on oral enalapril, doses were titrated and maintained on 2.5 to 10 mg once daily. Twenty percent of the total hypertensive patients reported mild to moderate dry cough and was more frequently observed among females (27%). Significant decline was observed in MEF 50% and MEF 25% of vital capacity values (p 0.0204 and 0.0001) after 10 days of enalapril therapy.

ACE inhibitors though improve LV function their beneficial role on exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias is not established. To study the effects of ACE inhibitors on exercise capacity vis-a-vis their role on exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, 25 patients of congestive heart failure (CHF) of various etiologies in NYHA Class II and III were subjected to a prospective randomised controlled trial. The control group comprising of 12 patients received conventional treatment (digitalis and diuretics) and the test group was given enalapril/captopril in addition as tolerated. They were followed up for 3 months. Exercise testing on treadmill and monitoring of clinical and biochemical parameters were done at the beginning and end of study in all cases. Ventricular arrhythmias observed during exercise and post-exercise for 10 minutes was analysed using Lown's grading for frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmia. The mean exercise duration showed significant improvement on ACE inhibitor as compared to the control group (p < 0.05) however there was no significant change in the grades of arrhythmia. Serum electrolytes and other bio-chemical parameter were within normal range.

    "279": "Systemic hypertension exacerbates diabetic retinopathy and other coexisting ocular disorders through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Increased vascular permeability and intraocular neovascularization characterize these conditions and are complications primarily mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because systemic hypertension increases vascular stretch, we evaluated the expression of VEGF, VEGF-R2 (kinase insert domain-containing receptor [KDR]), and VEGF-R1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase [Flt]) in bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs) undergoing clinically relevant cyclic stretch and in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) retina. A single exposure to 20% symmetric static stretch increased KDR mRNA expression 3.9 +/- 1.1-fold after 3 h (P = 0.002), with a gradual return to baseline within 9 h. In contrast, BRECs exposed to cardiac-profile cyclic stretch at 60 cpm continuously accumulated KDR mRNA in a transcriptionally mediated, time-dependent and stretch-magnitude-dependent manner. Exposure to 9% cyclic stretch increased KDR mRNA expression 8.7 +/- 2.9-fold (P = 0.011) after 9 h and KDR protein concentration 1.8 +/- 0.3-fold (P = 0.005) after 12 h. Stretched-induced VEGF responses were similar. Scatchard binding analysis demonstrated a 180 +/- 40% (P = 0.032) increase in high-affinity VEGF receptor number with no change in affinity. Cyclic stretch increased basal thymidine uptake 60 +/- 10% (P < 0.001) and VEGF-stimulated thymidine uptake by 2.6 +/- 0.2-fold (P = 0.005). VEGF-NAb reduced cyclic stretch-induced thymidine uptake by 65%. Stretched-induced KDR expression was not inhibited by AT1 receptor blockade using candesartan. Hypertension increased retinal KDR expression 67 +/- 42% (P < 0.05) in SHR rats compared with normotensive WKY control animals. When hypertension was reduced using captopril or candesartan, retinal KDR expression returned to baseline levels. VEGF reacted similarly, but Flt expression did not change. These data suggest a novel molecular mechanism that would account for the exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy by concomitant hypertension, and may partially explain the principal clinical manifestations of hypertensive retinopathy itself. Furthermore, these data imply that anti-VEGF therapies may prove therapeutically effective for hypertensive retinopathy and/or ameliorating the deleterious effects of coexistent hypertension on VEGF-associated disorders such as diabetic retinopathy.",

    "288": "Several studies have demonstrated that essential hypertension is accompanied by sympathetic activation, which contributes to blood pressure elevation. Sympathetic activation also has adverse consequences in hypertensive patients beyond initiating blood pressure elevation. There is evidence that neural vasoconstriction has metabolic effects in skeletal muscle, impairing glucose delivery to muscles. In the liver, retarding of post prandial clearance of lipids contributes to hyperlipidemia. Cardiac sympathetic activation is a probable cause of sudden death in hearth failure. A trophic effect of sympathetic activation on cardiovascular growth is also likely, contributing to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Consequently, one of the major aims of antihypertensive therapy should be to attenuate sympathetic tone. It is possible that, among the antihypertensive drugs available, those inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system might best reduce cardiovascular risk.",

However, the mechanism on endothelial cells has not been assessed in detail. Cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were exposed to hypoxia with or without reoxygenation. Hypoxia enhanced apoptosis along with the activation of caspase-3. Reoxygenation increased lactate dehydrogenase release time-dependently, along with an increase of intracellular oxygen radicals. ACE inhibitor quinaprilat and bradykinin significantly lessened apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase release with these effects being diminished by a kinin B2 receptor antagonist and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. In conclusion, hypoxia activated the suicide pathway leading to apoptosis of HAEC by enhancing caspase-3 activity, while subsequent reoxygenation induced necrosis by enhancing oxygen radical production. Quinaprilat could ameliorate both apoptosis and necrosis through the upregulation of constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase via an increase of bradykinin, with the resulting increase of nitric oxide.",

First, ACE genotyping was carried out in 96 patients, 42 with coughs and 54 without coughs, which had been treated with various kinds of ACE inhibitors. However, no significant difference in the ACE genotypes was observed between the two groups. Second, the plasma concentrations of BK, SP and ACE inhibitor were measured in 12 patients, which were treated with trandolapril at a daily dose of 1 mg for 4-33 weeks. In 3 patients, the cough was induced during the trandolapril therapy, while it was induced not in 9 patients. The plasma levels of BK and SP did not significantly change after trandolapril administration in the patients with and without coughs. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in the plasma levels of BK and SP either before or after the trandolapril therapy. Also the plasma concentrations of trandolapril and trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, did not significantly differ between the two groups.

Elevated PP is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular, particularly coronary, disease. Pulse pressure is discussed in terms of both Windkessel and distributive models of the arterial circulation. Pulse pressure arises from the interaction of cardiac ejection (stroke volume) and the properties of the arterial circulation. An increased stiffness of the aorta and large arteries leads to an increase in PP through a reduction in arterial compliance and effects on wave reflection. A number of factors are known to influence arterial wall behavior and, therefore, PP. In addition to the effects of aging and blood pressure on arterial wall elasticity, there is some evidence that atherosclerosis, per se, amplifies these effects. Thus, the relationship between PP and coronary disease may be bidirectional. A number of dietary and lifestyle interventions have been shown to modify large artery behavior. These include aerobic exercise training and consumption of n-3 fatty acids. Conversely, strength training is associated with an increase in arterial stiffness and a higher PP. The effects of antihypertensive medication have been extensively studied, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of concomitant change in blood pressure, and to a lesser degree, heart rate. However a number of studies do suggest direct arterial wall effects, particularly for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A distributed compliance model of the arterial circulation provides a framework for understanding the causes, effects and potential treatment of elevations in PP.",

In arteries from patients with CHF, AI responses were inhibited by enalaprilat (p < 0.05) but not by chymostatin alone (p > 0.05).

We sought to determine the implementation of the treatment guidelines in patient samples from the general population.

Screening of two MI-registries allowed the identification of 226 MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients were considered to be eligible for ACE inhibitor therapy when a EF < or = 40% was documented in the patient records of cardiac rehabilitation clinics (REG-MI, n = 147) or detected by standardised echocardiography (KORA, n = 78). On average 5.5 years following MI, a standardised questionnaire and a detailed medical history was obtained. Specifically, information was collected regarding current medication and potential contraindications for ACE inhibitors. MI patients with LV dysfunction received ACE inhibitors in 62% (REG-MI) and 45% (KORA). The doses prescribed were substantially smaller than target doses used in the large-scale studies (REG-MI: 40 +/- 4%, KORA: 23 +/- 3%, % of target doses). Only 13% (REG-MI) and 3% (KORA) received more than 50% of the target dosage. Additionally, actual doses of the most frequently used ACE inhibitors were significantly different (captopril: 23 +/- 2%, enalapril: 42 +/- 5% of target doses). The likelihood of receiving ACE inhibitors was significantly higher in patients with written recommendation for such medication (odds ratio 6.02, confidence interval 1.93-20.16) and in patients visiting cardiologists (odds ratio 3.69, confidence interval 1.26-11.07) as revealed by multivariate analysis of the REG-MI database. Despite national and international guidance, a large proportion of MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction is not receiving ACE inhibitors, and when used, the doses prescribed are markedly smaller than target doses used in clinical trials that established the utility of these drugs.

We investigated here the capacity of hypothyroid rats (N = 12 for each group) to respond to a low dose of captopril added to the ration, a paradigm which induces an increase in angiotensin II synthesis in cerebral areas that regulate sodium appetite by increasing the availability of circulating angiotensin I. In addition, we determined the influence of aldosterone in hypothyroid rats during the expression of spontaneous sodium appetite and after captopril treatment. Captopril significantly increased (P<0.05) the daily intake of 1.8% NaCl (in ml/100 g body weight) in hypothyroid rats after 36 days of methimazole administration (day 36: 9.2 +/- 0.7 vs day 32: 2.8 +/- 0.6 ml, on the 4th day after captopril treatment). After the discontinuation of captopril treatment, daily 1.8% NaCl intake reached values ranging from 10.0 +/- 0.9 to 13.9 +/- 1.0 ml, 48 to 60 days after treatment with methimazole. Aldosterone treatment significantly reduced (P<0.05) saline intake before (7.3 +/- 1.6 vs day 0, 14.4 +/- 1.3 ml) and after captopril treatment. Our results demonstrate that, although hypothyroid rats develop a deficiency in the production of all components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, their capacity to synthesize angiotensin II at the cerebral level is preserved. The partial reversal of daily 1.8% NaCl intake during aldosterone treatment suggests that sodium retention reduces both spontaneous and captopril-induced salt appetite.",

For EF (%), MD was -3.6 for eyeball cineangiography versus cineangiography, -1.3 for eyeball 2-D echo versus method of discs, and +0.30 for eyeball 2-D echo versus area-length 2-D echo, respectively.

    "326": "Investigating cooperativity in multimeric enzymes is of utmost interest to improve our understanding of the mechanism of enzymatic regulation. In the present article, we propose a novel approach based on mass spectrometry to probe cooperativity in the binding of a ligand to a multisubunit enzyme. This approach presents the selective advantage of giving a direct insight into all the subsequent ligation states that are formed in solution as the ligand is added to the enzyme. A quantitative interpretation of the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra gives the relative abundance of all the distinct enzymatic species, which allows one to directly deduce the cooperativity of the system. The overall method is described for the addition of the oxidized cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) to a dimeric mutant of Bacillus stearothermophilus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). It is then applied to four tetrameric enzymes: sturgeon muscle GPDH, wild type and S48G mutant of GPDH from B. stearothermophilus, and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Bakers yeast. The results illustrate the possibilities offered by this new technique. First, mass spectrometry allows a control of the enzymes before the addition of NAD(+). Second, the cooperative behavior can be drawn from one single ESI mass spectrum, which makes the method highly attractive in terms of the amount of biological material required. Above all, the major benefit lies in the direct visualization of all the enzymatic species that are in equilibrium in solution. The direct measurement of cooperativity readily resolve the inconvenience of the classical approaches employed in this field, which all need to model the experimental data in order to get the cooperative behavior of the system.", 
    "327": "Risk for cardiovascular events seems to be higher in the early morning, also as consequence of a rise in blood pressure (BP) values due to the characteristic circadian pattern of BP variability. Therefore, a suitable therapeutic BP control should be tightest during the early morning. On the basis of the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) studies, it has been previously demonstrated that the antihypertensive effect of once daily drug, generally administrated in the morning, decreases at the end of the dosing period. A chronotherapeutic approach to the management of hypertension (this field has been pourly investigated so far) would allow the assessment of the optimum timing of drug dosing, according to the circadian BP rhythm and to the chronorisk maps, in hypertensive patients affected by associated vascular pathologies. This would increase the therapeutic effects. The aim of this study was to assess BP changes due to ACE-inhibitor (Lisinopril 20 mg/die) once daily administration at three different times (8.00 AM, 4.00 PM, 10.00 PM), in order to optimise the dosing time. 40 subjects (mean age +/- SD: 45 +/- 10) affected by primary mild to moderate hypertension were submitted to ABPM for 24 hours, by means of Spacelabs 90207, before and after pharmacological treatment. Patients were randomised to take the drug at 8.00 AM, 4.00 PM or 10.00 PM, and they repeated ABPM every two months, by changing the dosing time. The chronobiological analysis showed: 1) a sensible decrease both in Systolic (S)BP and Diastolic (D)BP without affecting the circadian rhythm, in all evaluations; 2) a greater reduction of SBP and DBP from 6.00 AM to 11.00 AM, period in which cardiovascular risk is higher, after 10.00 PM dosing; 3) no other sensible reduction in SBP and DBP occurred after night administration as compared to that caused by other dosing times. Lisinopril administration at 10.00 PM. has been shown to be much more useful since, although BP circadian rhythm was unmodified, it protects hypertensive patients from both vascular chronorisk and Cruickshank effect (J-curve). Therefore, a chronobiologist antihypertensive treatment in order to increase the therapeutic effect already obtained with the traditional statistic methods.",

No treatment modality for either IgAN or HSPN in pediatric patients has been shown to be effective by a properly designed and administered randomized controlled trial (i.e., the highest level of evidence--level 1). Lower levels of evidence support the use of a variety of corticosteroid regimens, often in combination with other agents, although there are some conflicting studies in this area.

A more recent treatment option is the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the first drug class shown to increase survival rates in CHF. Although controversy remains, ACE inhibitors appear to be gaining favor over digoxin in the pharmacologic approach to treatment.

There was a highly significant correlation between the responses to captopril and to candesartan (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). Seven subjects had an RPF response to captopril that was accentuated (90 +/- 13 mL/min/1.73 m2), while five had a response that was normal (-4 +/- 9).

Thus, there is a great need to identify therapies that arrest the progression mechanisms common to all forms of renal disease. Progress is being made. Perhaps the most visible advance is the randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating the renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There are also numerous other promising renoprotective therapies. Unfortunately, testing each therapy in RCT is not feasible. Thus the nephrologist has two choices: restrict renoprotective therapy to those shown to be effective in RCT, or expand the use of renoprotective therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies.",

    "343": "Agonist-induced endocytosis and/or down-regulation have been evaluated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) conjugates of the rabbit bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor (B2R). COS-1 cells transiently transfected with vectors coding for either of two rabbit B2R fluorescent variants, B2R-GFP and B2R-GFP DeltaS/T (with previously identified Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail mutated to Ala), exhibited specific and saturable binding (K(D) in the lower nM range). The acute addition of BK (10-100 nM) to HEK 293 cells stably expressing B2R-GFP in the presence of cycloheximide was rapidly followed by translocation of the surface receptors into the cells, with essentially complete recycling of the surface receptors in 1 to 3 h (confocal microscopy, cell fractionation). Adding captopril to inhibit angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity increased the half-life of BK in the culture medium (enzyme immunoassay) and, accordingly, promoted B2R-GFP internalization for at least 3 h. However, agonist-induced down-regulation was not observed under conditions optimal for endocytosis (microscopy, immunoblot using anti-GFP antibodies). In contrast, B2R-GFP was partially degraded following a short treatment of cells with trypsin. B2R-GFP internalized following agonist treatment was colocalized with fluorescent transferrin, supporting translocation of the receptor to recycling endosomes. B2R-GFP DeltaS/T failed to translocate into the cells following treatment with BK, but exhibited at baseline an altered subcellular distribution relative to B2R-GFP. The agonist BK promotes B(2)R receptor endocytosis followed by recycling to the cell surface, but does not promote receptor down-regulation in the heterologous system that we used here. Digestion initiated by extracellular proteases may be involved in pathological B2R down-regulation, as suggested by the simulation involving trypsin.",

    "347": "Based on studies presented here and other published experiments performed with surviving tissue preparations, with transfected cells and with cells that constitutively express the human angiotensin I converting enzyme ACE and B2 receptors, we concluded the following: ACE inhibitors and other endogenous peptides that react with the active site of ACE potentiate the effect of bradykinin and its ACE resistant peptide congeners on the B2 receptor. They also resensitize receptors which had been desensitized by the agonist. ACE and bradykinin receptors have to be sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer, for the ACE inhibitors to induce an allosteric modification on the receptor. When ACE inhibitors augment bradykinin effects, they reduce the phosphorylation of the B2 receptor. The primary actions of bradykinin on the receptor are not affected by protein kinase C or phosphatase inhibitors, but the potentiation of bradykinin or the resensitization of the receptor by ACE inhibitors are abolished by the same inhibitors. The results with protein kinase C and phosphatase inhibitors indicate that another intermediate protein may be involved in the processes of signaling induced by ACE inhibitors, and that ACE inhibitors affect the signal transduction pathway triggered by bradykinin on the B2 receptor.",

The stimulatory effect of angiotensin was prevented by losartan, a type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptor antagonist, and by nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker. Losartan and nifedipine also depressed the adrenocortical regeneration when given alone.

Data supporting goal blood pressures indicate the need to aggressively decrease this risk factor. Use of ACE inhibitors is hazardous in bilateral renal artery stenosis, particularly with volume depletion, but may be valuable in patients with unilateral stenosis. In African Americans, ACE inhibitor treatment is likely to be of benefit, although required doses may be higher than for whites, and caution must be exercised in certain situations.

    "354": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system, and the therapeutic agents which interact with this pathway have a significant impact in both heart failure and following myocardial infarction (MI). Polymorphisms within the genes controlling this enzyme system may also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Over the last decade an association between a polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene (called the DD-ACE polymorphism) and phenotypic expression of cardiovascular disease, namely MI, has been reported. Since then, several small case-controlled studies have confirmed an association with manifestations of ischaemic heart disease or various other cardiac end points. However, in a large prospective study the ACE gene was found to confer no appreciable risk. This review article considers the evidence that links polymorphisms of the ACE gene with cardiovascular disease. The Medline database (1990 - 2000) was searched using the keywords myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, angiotensin converting enzyme, polymorphisms (a search of the reference citations of relevant articles was also performed), and clinical studies on cardiovascular disease related to the ACE genotype were selected. Taken together, the available evidence supports the notion that the DD-ACE genotype adversely influences specific cardiovascular diseases, but appears to do so in specific geographical areas and in particular patient subgroups. It is not yet known whether it does this through an interaction with other genes or by as yet unexplained biochemical mechanisms. However, the impact of the DD-ACE genotype appears to be small and its clinical manifestations rather heterogeneous. This finding is not in contrast to the overall impact of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular disease, given the fact that the ACE enzyme is only one component in the renin-angiotensin cascade and that one genetic variant cannot be expected to contribute more than a minor individual impact in genetically complex multifactorial cardiovascular disease.",

Following 10 days of treatment (canrenoate group), only 9 patients presented with serum K and creatinine concentrations respectively > 5.5 mmol/l and > 2.0 mg/dl. Among those patients receiving canrenoate, the mitral E/A ratio was higher compared to the placebo group (p = 0.001) whereas the ESV was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The deceleration time for reperfused patients receiving canrenoate was higher than that observed for reperfused patients in the placebo group.

Recent clinical studies show that these drugs have favorable effects when administered orally in chronic mitral and aortic regurgitation. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibition regard the basic anatomic, hemodynamic and adaptive pathologic conditions related to volume overload, namely, the regurgitant orifice area and volume and ventricular remodeling. The heart is a plastic structure, constantly being altered in size, shape and composition in response to chronic volume overload. Thus, modulation of cardiac plasticity by ACE-inhibition raises the possibility of using new therapeutic strategies specifically designed to prevent and/or antagonize the mechanical disadvantages secondary to volume overload-induced cardiac remodeling. The beneficial effects of ACE-inhibition have also been observed in growing children with asymptomatic valvular regurgitation; thus, it appears that the unloading therapy has the potential of influencing the natural history of both mitral and aortic regurgitation and possibly delays surgical valve repair or replacement. These data justify early inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in children with left ventricular volume overload due to mitral and aortic regurgitation.",

    "365": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the processes of inflammation. An active component of this system, angiotensin II (Ang II), differentially regulates the production of oxyradicals, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factors and bradykinins by acting through AT1 or AT2 receptor subtypes. Many of the physiological actions of Ang II mediated through AT1 and AT2 receptors are opposite and thereby show physiological antagonism to each other. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of locally administered Ang II, the ACE inhibitor captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan in the carrageenan model of acute inflammation. Local administration of losartan (10-50 micrograms/paw) or Ang II (0.2-1 microgram/paw) alone did not induce inflammation, but significantly enhanced the carrageenan-induced edema in a dose-dependent manner. Coadministration of subeffective doses of losartan (10 micrograms/paw) and Ang II (0.2 microgram/paw) significantly potentiated the carrageenan-induced inflammation. In conclusion, the present study predicts that Ang II might be formed locally during carrageenan-induced acute inflammation.

Usually, it develops in the first week of therapy, but some atypical cases of the development of angioedema after several months to few years after the onset of the therapy have been reported. Undesired reactions caused by these drugs are probably not allergic, but they are caused by pharmacological effect of these drugs in persons with risk of allergic reaction. In this paper we present some patients with angioedema.",

Echocardiographic and nonechocardiographic predictors of ventricular recovery were examined.", 
    "374": "By day 90, 55 of 252 (22%) patients who had abnormal ejection fraction and wall-motion abnormalities on day 1 demonstrated complete recovery of function (ejection fraction in the normal range and infarct segment length of 0%), and an additional 36% (91 of 252 patients) demonstrated partial recovery of function. At 90 days, 53% (132 of 249) of patients had greater than 5% improvement in ejection fraction, whereas only 16% (39 of 249) had a decrease in ejection fraction of more than 5%. The majority of functional improvement occurred by day 14 after infarction. Of various clinical and echocardiographic measures obtained on day 1, peak creatine kinase level was the strongest independent predictor of subsequent recovery of ventricular function in multivariate analysis. Each 100-unit increase in peak creatine kinase was associated with a 4.3% decreased odds of recovery (P < 0.001) after adjustment for ejection fraction on day 1, extent of akinesis or dyskinesis, treatment regimen, Killip class, age, and sex.",

    "376": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is mainly responsible for converting angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII), and ACE inhibitors prevent atherosclerosis in animal models. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) degrades substance P, kinins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and aortic wall NEP activity was found to be increased in atherosclerosis. In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of candoxatril, a NEP inhibitor, and of omapatrilat, a dual ACE and NEP inhibitor, on the development of fatty streak in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice. Groups of ten male apoE-deficient mice were given either placebo, candoxatril 50 mg/kg per day, or omapatrilat 10, or 100 mg/kg per day for 4 months. None of the treatments influenced body weight, serum total or HDL-cholesterol. Compared with the placebo, candoxatril did not protect the mice from fatty streak deposit. In contrast, omapatrilat dose dependently inhibited the constitution of fatty streak in apoE-deficient mice. The precise advantages of the dual ACE and NEP inhibition versus the inhibition of only ACE should now be considered in the prevention of atherosclerosis as well as in the occurrence of its complications.",

AcSDKP has been measured in various biological media using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), but its presence in human plasma and urine has not been formally established. By using immunoaffinity extraction and liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that AcSDKP-like immunoreactivity measured with EIA in plasma and urine samples from untreated, captopril- (an ACE inhibitor) and AcSDKP-treated subjects corresponds to AcSDKP. The present study confirms that AcSDKP is naturally present in human plasma and urine and that EIA is reliable for its measurement in such media.",

Accordingly, blockade of this system by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has assumed a central role in the treatment of heart failure. Recently, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have gained prominence as a possible substitute for ACE inhibitors in therapy for heart failure. However, clinical data compiled on this use of ARBs have shown them to be useful only as alternative therapy in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. Continuing large-scale clinical investigations may lead to an expansion of their role in therapy for various cardiovascular diseases.",

The interactions of these abnormalities remain poorly understood. The diagnosis is considered in patients with anginal symptoms and no epicardial coronary narrowing. Therapy is also problematic, with beta-blockers as first-line pharmacotherapy followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.", 
    "380": "Glomerular structural modifications were measured in kidney biopsies from two follow-up studies in type-1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria and in kidney donors. Stereologic methods were used to obtain data on glomerular composition and absolute quantities per glomerulus to supplement data on diabetic glomerulopathy previously published. Diabetic patients at baseline (n=37) showed significant changes compared with controls (n=11). The volume fraction of tuft/glomerulus was increased, the proportion of capillary surface facing peripheral basement membrane was decreased (0.72+/-0.04 vs 0.77+/-0.03, P=0.0008), the ratio of mesangial surfaces, urinary/capillary, was decreased (0.67+/-0.17 vs 1.11+/-0.28, P<10(-4)), and the average capillary diameter was increased (8.9+/-0.9 microm vs 7.5+/-1.0 microm, P=0.0002). The total volume of mesangial extracellular material per glomerulus was increased (P=0.01), whereas glomerular volume was not significantly different from controls. Follow-up biopsies after antihypertensive treatment with ACE-inhibitor (n=7) or beta-blocker (n=6; 36-48 months) and after intensive insulin treatment (n=7; 24-33 months) showed no change. In a conventionally treated group (n=9), the glomerular volume, the volume of extracellular material/glomerulus, and the capillary length increased. The mean capillary diameter did not correlate with the glomerular volume. In conclusion, the development of diabetic glomerulopathy entails structural modifications of the glomerular tuft. Antihypertensive and intensified insulin treatment seem to slow the progression of ultrastructural changes.",

Prescribing both aspirin and ACE inhibitors was associated with a slightly lower risk of mortality (ARR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) than that seen in aspirin-only or ACE inhibitor-only groups, but the difference was not significantly different from the use of either medication alone.",

    "386": "Ischemic heart disease is an important and common contributor to the development of heart failure. Theoretically, all patients with heart failure may benefit from treatment designed to retard progressive ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. Patients with ischemic heart disease may also theoretically benefit from the relief of ischemia, the prevention of coronary occlusion, and revascularization. However, there is little evidence to show that the presence or absence of coronary disease modifies the benefits of effective treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Moreover, there is no evidence that treatment directed specifically at myocardial ischemia or coronary disease alters outcome in patients with heart failure. Treatments aimed at relieving painless myocardial ischemia have not been shown to alter prognosis. Lipid-lowering therapy is theoretically attractive for patients with heart failure and coronary disease; however, theoretical concerns also exist about the safety of such agents, and patients with heart failure have been excluded from large outcome studies very effectively. Some agents, such as aspirin, designed to reduce the risk of coronary occlusion seem ineffective or harmful in patients with heart failure, although warfarin may be safe and possibly effective. There is no evidence yet that revascularization improves prognosis in patients with heart failure, even in patients who are shown to have extensive myocardial hibernation. On current evidence, revascularization should be reserved for the relief of angina. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials are currently underway that are investigating the role of specific treatments targeted at coronary syndromes. The Carvedilol Hibernation Reversible Ischemia Trial: Marker of Success study is investigating the effects of carvedilol in a large cohort of patients with and without hibernating myocardium. The Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure study is comparing the efficacy of aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. The Heart Revascularization Trial-United Kingdom study is assessing the effect of revascularization on mortality in patients with heart failure and myocardial hibernation. Smaller scale studies are assessing the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in patients with heart failure. Only once the outcomes to these and other planned trials are known can the medical community know how best to treat their patients.", 
    "387": "The nephrotic syndrome, caused by glomerulonephritis, diabetes mellitus, or amyloidosis, is still a therapeutic challenge. Newer therapeutic approaches may be sought in the fields of immunosuppression, nonspecific supportive measures, heparinoid administration, and removal of a supposed glomerular basement membrane toxic factor. In immunosuppression, the newer drugs now used in organ transplantation (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil) can also be used in the treatment of glomerulonephritis. In nonspecific supportive treatment, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are now used in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Positive effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on the nephrotic syndrome have not yet been proven. Cyclooxygenase II inhibitors must be tested but probably have too many renal side effects, similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Heparinoids or glycosaminoglycans serve as polyanions and thus have protective effects on the negative charge of the glomerular basement membrane. They can now be administered as oral medications. The removal of a supposed glomerular basement membrane toxic factor that induces proteinuria has been attempted for 20 yr and now is usually performed using immunoadsorption. Especially in cases of recurrent nephrotic syndrome after renal transplantation for patients with glomerulonephritis, this approach has been successful in decreasing proteinuria, although in most cases its effect is not lasting but must be continuously renewed.", 
    "388": "We studied the angiotensin II-forming pathways in extracts from human and rat vascular tissues. In the extract from human artery, angiotensin I mainly converted to two products, angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin II, while in the extract from rat artery, the major angiotensin I products were angiotensin II and angiotensin-(5-10). The concentrations of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-9) generated in the human extract (1 mg protein/ml) after incubation for 30 min were 3.2 and 2.5 nmol, respectively, and that of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(5-10) generated in the rat extract (1 mg protein/ml) were 0.28 and 2.3 nmol, respectively. In the extract from human vascular tissues, the angiotensin II formation was inhibited by 8% with lisinopril and by 95% with chymostatin. The other product, angiotensin-(1-9) was inhibited completely by carboxypeptidase inhibitor. In the extract from rat vascular tissues, the angiotensin II formation was suppressed to 4% by lisinopril, but not by chymostatin. The angiotensin-(5-10) formation was completely inhibited by chymostatin. These findings suggest clearly that human vascular tissues contain two angiotensin II-forming enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme and chymase, but rat vascular tissues have no chymase-dependent angiotensin II-forming pathway.", 
    "389": "In this study of 27 untreated patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we report on elevated plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and its soluble receptor Flt-1 compared with healthy controls; these increased levels are reduced by the treatment of hypertension.

    "390": "The OPTIMAAL study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel, trial in high-risk patients who were treated early after acute myocardial infarction that compared treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a selective angiotensin II antagonist (losartan) on survival and morbidity. A total of 5,477 patients with heart failure during the acute phase or with a new Q-wave anterior infarction or reinfarction were recruited. This study describes the baseline data and initial course of the cohort and compares these data and patient management across countries.", 
    "391": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality. They also may have direct antiarrhythmic properties. We retrospectively analyzed the data from the Multicenter UnSustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), to determine the effects of ACE inhibitors on inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia and on sudden cardiac death and overall mortality in 2,087 patients with prior myocardial infarction, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and depressed left ventricular function. Results of electrophysiologic testing were compared by use of ACE inhibitors at baseline, and outcomes were compared between the 564 patients prescribed ACE inhibitors at discharge and the 1,523 patients who did not receive treatment. The inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiologic testing did not differ by baseline ACE inhibitor use (unadjusted p = 0.75). Patients discharged from hospital on ACE inhibitors had a lower ejection fraction, more extensive coronary artery disease, and fewer previous revascularizations at baseline. After adjustments for differences in baseline factors and initial hospitalization variables, there were no significant differences in total mortality (p = 0.47) or arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest (p = 0.51) with ACE inhibitor use at discharge over a median 43 months of follow-up.", 
    "392": "Arterial stiffness, as evidenced by increased pulse pressure (PP), is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. However, the prognostic importance of PP in patients who have undergone revascularization is unknown. We examined the prognostic importance of PP and predictors of increased PP in patients entered into the Balloon Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI). Estimated correlation and standardized regression coefficients were reported, indicating the relative magnitude of independent effects of baseline characteristics on PP. The independent association of PP and outcome over 5 years was determined. Baseline characteristics independently associated with PP were higher mean arterial pressure, older age, female sex, noncoronary vascular disease, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of hypertension (p <0.001 for all). Cox regression covariates significantly associated with time to death were age, smoking, male gender, diabetes history, congestive heart failure, and baseline use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretic, or digitalis. When PP was added to the model, it was found to be an independent predictor of time to death (p = 0.008). When PP and mean arterial pressure were added to the model, PP remained significantly associated with time to death (p = 0.033). When renal disease and noncoronary vascular disease were added to the model, the relative risk declined from 1.07 to 1.04 and the association was no longer statistically significant. Thus, increased PP is directly and independently associated with mean arterial pressure, hypertension, age > or =65 years, diabetes mellitus, and the presence of noncoronary vascular disease, and inversely associated with a history of myocardial infarction. After coronary revascularization, PP, reflecting arterial stiffness, is independently associated with total mortality.", 
    "393": "Experiments were performed to evaluate the hypothesis that opening of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK(Ca) channels) promotes juxtamedullary arteriolar dilation and curtails constrictor responses to depolarizing agonists. Under baseline conditions, afferent and efferent arteriolar lumen diameters averaged 23.4 +/- 0.9 (n = 36) and 22.8 +/- 1.1 (n = 13) microm, respectively. The synthetic BK(Ca) channel opener NS-1619 evoked concentration-dependent afferent arteriolar dilation. BK(Ca) channel blockade (1 mM tetraethylammonium; TEA) decreased afferent diameter by 15 +/- 3% and prevented the dilator response to 30 microM NS-1619. ANG II (10 nM) decreased afferent arteriolar diameter by 44 +/- 4%, a response that was reduced by 30% during NS-1619 treatment; however, TEA failed to alter afferent constrictor responses to either ANG II or arginine vasopressin. Neither NS-1619 nor TEA altered agonist-induced constriction of the efferent arteriole. Thus, although the BK(Ca) channel agonist was able to curtail afferent (but not efferent) arteriolar constrictor responses to ANG II, BK(Ca) channel blockade did not allow exaggerated agonist-induced arteriolar constriction. These observations suggest that the BK(Ca) channels evident in afferent arteriolar smooth muscle do not provide a prominent physiological brake on agonist-induced constriction under our experimental conditions.", 
    "394": "The management of heart failure has evolved in parallel with advances in the understanding of the disease process. Inotropes and diuretics are used to combat pump failure and fluid overload. While no convincing data has emerged regarding the long-term safety of inotropes, new exciting data concerning the role of diuretics, especially aldactone, has led to a renewed interest in this class of drug therapy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) were noted to not only affect symptomatology but also decrease mortality by interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recent research has focused on more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than that achieved with ACE inhibitors alone with the addition of direct angiotensin II receptor blockers. This new class of drugs may become not only a reasonable alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients intolerant of the drug but also a possible addition to ACE inhibitors in the battle to prevent progression of remodelling and disease. beta-blockers are the most exciting new class of drugs used to combat heart failure. They appear not only to combat the remodelling process that occurs in the progression of disease but also other pathological events such as apoptosis and cellular oxidation. New medical therapies currently being investigated include novel agents such as endothelin antagonists, natriuretic peptides, vasopressin antagonists and anticytokine agents--all part of a new era in drug management of heart failure that has evolved with continued advances in the understanding of chronic heart failure (CHF).", 
    "395": "Fixed verapamil SR/trandolapril combinations 180/1 mg and 180/2 mg (Tarka, Knoll AG) have a significantly superior antihypertensive effect compared to equal dosages of either agent alone. Verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg combination produces the best dose-response ratio of different dose combinations of these two drugs. Combination therapy has the most pronounced effect on blunting the early morning rise in blood pressure. Thus, verapamil SR/trandolapril combination therapy may be an appropriate treatment option in patients with moderate essential hypertension, particularly in those who have a tendency toward the early morning rise in blood pressure. The adverse effect profile of the fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril includes the typical side effects of its monocompounds. The fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is also effective and safe in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. The fixed low-dose combination therapy with verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg is a suitable treatment option for patients with moderate essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, because it improves parameters of carbohydrate metabolism and uricaemia and does not alter the lipid profile. The insulin-sensitising effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor monotherapy with its theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia is completely neutralised in the combination with verapamil SR. Comparative studies have shown that the low-dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril may be a suitable alternative to combinations containing a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocking agent for the long-term management of hypertensive patients for whom combination therapy is indicated. The combination of an ACE inhibitor with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than either agent alone. A combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker may provide additional benefit in inducing the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Combination therapy leads to a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction, improvement of wall motion index and increases exercise duration time in patients with coronary heart disease and left heart failure. It also improves the ratio of exercise to rest rate-pressure product and decreases the number of angina attacks. These findings support the hypothesis that the combination of verapamil and trandolapril might be useful in patients with attenuated left ventricular function and angina pectoris. Thus, Tarka is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent with a good safety profile and positive metabolic effects.", 
    "396": "During acute myocardial infarction (MI), aspirin, beta-adrenergic antagonists and oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used as an adjunct to reperfusion therapy. Medications upon discharge from the hospital should include aspirin and a beta-blocker. An ACE inhibitor should also be prescribed unless the ejection fraction is > 45%. Particular indications for an ACE inhibitor are an anterior MI, congestive heart failure, ejection fraction < 45% and mitral regurgitation. beta-blockers, when given to patients treated with ACE inhibitors, appear to produce an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor alone. Based on the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) trials, a statin should also be given to subjects with low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels above 125 mg/dl, independent of total cholesterol levels. Therapy should be administered in an attempt to reduce the LDL-cholesterol level to 90-100 mg/dl (2.3-2.6 mM/l). In patients with normal or low levels on initial evaluation, screening for lipid abnormalities should be deferred for 2 months since acute phase responses and passive hepatic congestion can cause spuriously normal levels. Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, lidocaine, anti-arrhythmic drugs and i.v. magnesium should not be administered routinely after acute MI and their use should be restricted to selected settings.", 
    "397": "Modern treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including thrombolysis and early interventional strategies, has reduced mortality rates but increased the number of patients requiring medical treatment. Post infarction treatment with aspirin, statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has improved morbidity and mortality and is cost-effective. The major successes of secondary prevention have been seen in the prevention of reinfarction, recurrent ischaemia and the development of heart failure. However, in spite of recent advances and increasing knowledge, the mortality rates remain high, partly due to the under use of the established and documented medical strategies. Implementation of the current treatment strategies into general practice remains a challenge. The field is undergoing rapid change due to the increasing use of early invasive strategies. The primary objective should remain the prevention of underlying aetiology: coronary artery disease (CAD). Secondary prevention following myocardial infarction (MI) will remain a major challenge in clinical practice within the foreseeable future.", 
    "398": "A wide variety of prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) agents can affect the production or viability of red blood cells, thereby contributing to anemia. An apparent hyporesponse to Epoetin alfa therapy in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients can sometimes be traced to a medication prescribed to treat a comorbid condition. The anemic potential of many of these agents has been defined and can often be anticipated or avoided by examining and modifying the regimen. Nurses can help assess and prevent medicine-related hyporesponse to Epoetin alfa by obtaining thorough histories and providing ongoing counseling on the need to minimize exposure to substances that contribute to anemia. A case study is provided to illustrate the use of nursing assessment skills to identify potential drug-related hyporesponse to Epoetin alfa.", 
    "399": "Major changes in the treatment of heart failure have occurred in the last fifty years that have had a dramatic effect on its morbidity and mortality. Over two hundred years have passed since the demonstration of the benefit of digitalis in heart failure to the development of potent loop diuretics. The observation that vasodilators could improve both cardiac function and mortality led to the investigation of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI). Although these agents had significant vasodilator properties, their major benefit appears to be related to their ability to effect remodeling of the failing left ventricle. The most recent randomized clinical trials demonstrate that Beta Adrenergic Blocking agents can provide an incremental effect on both mortality and morbidity when added to therapy with ACEI. Although these agents have improved the outlook for the heart failure patient, they have had very little effect on the improvement of left ventricular function. Future research must be directed at methods to deal with this issue by either changing the contractile properties of the cardiomyocyte by pharmacologic or electrical therapy or by transplanting functional cells that can increase the number of functioning contractile units.", 
    "400": "Almost half of the patients affected with congestive heart failure (CHF) in the United States are women. However, past studies have included predominantly men and generalized results to women. Many women with CHF are older, have hypertension, and have higher ejection fractions. Survival differences have been reported previously with conflicting results. Although treatment for left ventricular dysfunction is somewhat standardized, treatment for diastolic dysfunction is less defined. Clinical trials for this group of patients, many of whom are women, have not been performed. In comparison with men, women have several cardiovascular differences as well as differences in electrical properties. In addition, response to medical (pharmacologic) therapy may differ in men and women.Finally, functional status has been shown to be compromised in both men and women with CHF; however, some studies have shown women to experience more exercise intolerance. This may be because more women than men have diastolic dysfunction. Few women have been included in exercise trials. Future trials must address women with CHF, many of whom are older and have normal (or near normal) left ventricular function or diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "401": "For determination of levels of plasmatic inhibitor of ACE (angiotensin convertase) a simple method was used based on a combination of enzymatic reaction followed by an HPLC determination of its product. The inhibitor (e.g. enalaprilat) was at first separated from the biological material by deproteination (methanol). Then, an aliquot of the sample was added to the reaction mixture containing a commercial ACE enzyme, its specific substrate FAPGG (N-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl)-Phe-Gly-Gly) and buffer (Tris--HCl, pH 7.5). Degree of inhibition of the conversion of this substrate to FAP (desGlyGlyFAPGG) by the inhibitor present in the sample is related to its amount by a simple dose-response relationship. The amount of the FAP was determined by an HPLC on a RP-18 column with an acetonitril--nonylamine buffer (pH 2.4, adjusted with phosphoric acid) as a mobile phase with detection at 305 nm. Alternatively, the activity of the endogenous ACE present in the plasma was measured. The substrate FAPGG was added to the plasmatic sample containing both the inhibitor and endogenous ACE (as the sample was not deproteinized in this case) and the reaction product was determined as above. Inhibitor concentration has been obtained from a dose--response curve expressing the interaction with inhibitor with an ACE enzyme.", 
    "402": "Simultaneous blockade of systemic AT1 and AT2 receptors or converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) attenuates the hypoglycemia-induced reflex increase of epinephrine (Epi). To examine the role of brain AT1 and AT2 receptors in the reflex regulation of Epi release, we measured catecholamines, hemodynamics, and renin during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in conscious rats pretreated intracerebroventricularly with losartan, PD-123319, losartan and PD-123319, or vehicle. Epi and norepinephrine (NE) increased 60-and 3-fold, respectively. However, the gain of the reflex increase in plasma Epi (Deltaplasma Epi/Deltaplasma glucose) and the overall Epi and NE responses were similar in all groups. The ensuing blood pressure response was similar between groups, but the corresponding bradycardia was augmented after PD-123319 (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle) or combined losartan and PD-123319 (P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). The findings indicate 1) brain angiotensin receptors are not essential for the reflex regulation of Epi release during hypoglycemia and 2) the gain of baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia is increased by blockade of brain AT2 receptors in this model.", 
    "403": "This study tested the hypotheses that renal medullary blood flow (MBF) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has enhanced responsiveness to angiotensin (ANG) II and that long-term treatment with enalapril can correct this. MBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized rats, was not altered significantly by ANG II in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, but was reduced dose dependently (25% at 50 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) in SHR. Infusion of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) into the renal medulla unmasked ANG II sensitivity in WKY rats while L-arginine given into the renal medulla abolished the responses to ANG II in SHR. In 18- to 19-wk-old SHR treated with enalapril (25 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) when 4 to 14 wk old), ANG II did not alter MBF significantly, but sensitivity to ANG II was unmasked after L-NAME was infused into the renal medulla. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (assessed with aortic rings) was significantly greater in treated SHR when compared with that in control SHR. These results indicate that MBF in SHR is sensitive to low-dose ANG II and suggest that this effect may be due to an impaired counterregulatory effect of nitric oxide. Long-term treatment with enalapril improves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and decreases the sensitivity of MBF to ANG II. These effects may be causally related to the persistent antihypertensive action of enalapril in SHR.", 
    "404": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)], an endogenous bioactive peptide constituent of the renin-angiotensin system, acts as an inhibitory growth factor in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we evaluated whether the antiangiogenic effect of ANG-(1-7) in the mouse sponge model of angiogenesis might be receptor mediated and involved in the release of nitric oxide (NO). The hemoglobin content (microg/mg wet tissue) of 7-day-old sponge implants was used as an index of the vascularization and showed that daily injections of ANG-(1-7) (20 ng) inhibited significantly the angiogenesis in the implants relative to the saline-treated group. The specific receptor antagonist D-Ala(7)-ANG-(1-7); A-779 prevented ANG-(1-7)-induced inhibition of angiogenesis. The antiangiogenic effect was also abolished by pretreatment with NO synthase inhibitors aminoguanidine (1 mg/ml) or N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0.3 mg/ml). Selective AT1 and AT2 angiotensin-receptor antagonists and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in combination with ANG-(1-7) or alone, did not alter angiogenesis in the implants. These results establish that the regulation of the vascular tissue growth by ANG-(1-7) is associated with NO release by activation of an angiotensin receptor distinct from AT1 and AT2.", 
    "405": "Prekallikrein (PK) activation on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) presumably leads to bradykinin liberation. On HUVEC, PK activation requires the presence of cell-bound high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) and Zn(2+). We examined the Zn(2+) requirement for HK binding to and the consequences of PK activation on endothelial cells. Optimal HK binding (14 pmol/10(6) HUVEC) is seen with no added Zn(2+) in HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing gelatin versus 16--32 microM added Zn(2+) in the same buffer containing bovine serum albumin. The affinity and number of HK binding sites on HUVEC are a dissociation constant of 9.6 +/- 1.8 nM and a maximal binding of 1.08 +/- 0.26 x 10(7) sites/cell (means +/- SD). PK is activated to kallikrein by an antipain-sensitive mechanism in the presence of HK and Zn(2+) on HUVEC, human microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Simultaneous with kallikrein formation, bradykinin (5.0 or 10.3 pmol/10(6) HUVEC in the absence or presence of lisinopril, respectively) is liberated from cell-bound HK. Liberated bradykinin stimulates the endothelial cell bradykinin B2 receptor to form nitric oxide. Assembly and activation of PK on endothelial cells modulates their physiological activities.", 
    "406": "In Italy, the National Health System is funded from the taxation system of the state. It is organized by general practitioners in the community and specialists in the hospitals. All Italian citizens are registered with one of the general practitioners. Patients with suspected heart failure are generally referred from the family practitioner to a higher level of medical care. Only a minority of patients with heart failure are cared for by cardiologists, either as in- or outpatients. Echocardiography is widely available; nevertheless, few patients admitted to internal medicine divisions receive an echocardiogram compared to cardiology units. The ACE inhibitor usage by Italian cardiologists in patients with heart failure is satisfied, and the use of beta blockers is increasing in Italy at this time. Since only a small proportion of patients with heart failure are followed by cardiologists in Italy, further efforts are necessary until internists and general practitioners could be involved in treatment trials in heart failure. The aim of this approach is to transfer the beneficial effects observed in the trials to clinical practice.", 
    "407": "This paper reports on an international comparison of the characteristics, treatment and health outcomes of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients discharged from acute hospital care in Australia and Scotland. The baseline characteristics and treatment of 200 CHF patients recruited to a randomised study of a non-pharmacological intervention in Australia and 157 CHF patients concurrently recruited to a similar study in Scotland were compared. Subsequent health outcomes (including survival and readmission) within 3 months of discharge in those patients who received usual post-discharge care in Australia (n=100) and Scotland (n=75) were also compared. Individuals in both countries were predominantly old and frail with significant comorbidity likely to complicate treatment. Similar proportions of Australian and Scottish patients were prescribed either a 'high' (20 vs. 18%) or medium (64 vs. 66%) dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Proportionately more Australian patients were prescribed a long-acting nitrate, digoxin and/or a beta-blocker. At 3 months post-discharge, 57 of the 100 (57%: 95% CI 47--67%) Australian and 37 of the 75 (49%: 95% CI 38--61%) Scottish patients assigned to 'usual care' remained event-free (NS). Similarly, 15 vs. 12% required > or =2 unplanned readmission (NS) and 16 vs. 19% of Australian and Scottish patients, respectively, died (NS). Australian and Scottish patients accumulated a median of 0.6 vs. 0.9 days, respectively, of hospitalisation/patient/month (NS). On multivariate analysis (including country of origin), unplanned readmission or death was independently correlated with severe renal impairment (adjusted odds ratio 4.4, P<0.05), a previous hospitalisation for CHF (2.3, P<0.05), longer index hospitalisation (2.7 for >10 days, P<0.05) and greater comorbidity (1.3 for each incremental unit of the Charlson Index, P=0.05). Health outcomes among predominantly old and frail CHF patients appear to be independent of the health-care system in which the patient is managed and more likely to be dependent on the syndrome itself.",

We analysed death and unplanned readmission for heart failure at 1 month.", 
    "411": "This early report from the first 70 patients (67% male, 71% systolic dysfunction with a mean ejection fraction of 31.0+/-6.7%) enrolled in this study demonstrates elimination of 1-month hospital readmission in both RC and MC groups. This unexpected result represents a dramatic improvement both for this patient cohort (20% 30-day readmission rate prior to enrollment reduced to 0% following the index admission in both care groups) and in comparison with available data.", 
    "412": "Critical contributors to this improvement appear to be specialist cardiology care, adherence to clinical stability criteria prior to discharge and routine use of target or high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.

    "413": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible interaction between chronic aspirin therapy and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Forty-two patients with reduced LVEF were recruited from the warfarin aspirin reinfarction study (WARIS-II), a randomized, open study comparing enteric coated aspirin (160 mg/d), warfarin (INR 2.8--4.2) and the combination of aspirin (75 mg/d) and warfarin (INR 2.0--2.5) on mortality, reinfarction and stroke after AMI. LVEF and relevant biochemical measurements were performed before discharge and after 3 months. The overall LVEF increased during the study period from median 35 to 39% (P<0.001). There was no difference between patients on aspirin and warfarin regarding the main end point, LVEF. Furthermore, neither endothelin-1 nor ANP showed significant differences between the treatment groups. A possible interaction between ACE-I and aspirin might theoretically lead to reduced levels of renin activity in patients on aspirin, but we did not find any such inter-group difference. In conclusion, we did not find evidence of interaction between ACE-I and low-dose aspirin.", 
    "414": "The kidneys play the crucial role in the maintenance of the body fluid volume homeostasis. Several hypotheses have been introduced to explain sodium and water retention leading to edematous states in such pathologic conditions as congestive heart failure (CHF) and cirrhosis. We have suggested a unifying arterial underfilling hypothesis, explaining the development of edema in these conditions. Arterial underfilling, caused by decreased cardiac output or peripheral arterial vasodilation, leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and nonosmotic vasopressin release. This review discusses the pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in renal sodium and water retention, impaired mineralocorticoid escape, and resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with CHF and cirrhosis. Furthermore, the basis of current therapies in these disorders is discussed, including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics in CHF and cirrhosis, as well as new approaches to treatment of water retention with vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonists.", 
    "415": "Angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in the progression of renal diseases, including obstructive nephropathy. Increasing levels of angiotensin II in obstructive nephropathy upregulate the expression of several factors: transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), osteopontin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and CD14 among others. Local production of TGF-beta, by intrinsic renal cells or by macrophages invading the kidney, is a key mediator of renal fibrosis. Activation of TGF-beta stimulates endothelin production. Endothelin, in turn, is a potent stimulus for fibrogenesis. Oxidative stress, fueled in part by angiotensin II, upregulates the expression of adhesion molecules, chemoattractant compounds and cytokines. Sustained obstructive nephropathy leads to apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. Several factors and genes involved in apoptosis have been described. Nuclear factor kappa-B is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes present in several organs, including the kidney. NF-kappaB is activated in the setting of ureteral obstruction. Administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decreased significantly the activation of NF-kappaB in the obstructed kidney. Studies in neonatal rats indicate that chronic ureteral obstruction decreases the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Replacement of this factor decreased apoptosis and reduced the expression of vimentin, clusterin, and TGF-beta. The administration of IGF-1 also lessened the tubular and interstitial pathology in the setting of ureteral obstruction. A spectrum of urinary tract malformations have been described. The utility of certain markers such as fetal serum beta(2) microglobulin as a predictor of postnatal renal function in bilateral uropathies has been described. A number of pharmacologic interventions that ameliorate the increased expansion of the interstitial volume, decrease the expression of TGF-beta, and down-regulate the production of extracellular matrix and the infiltration of the interstitium by macrophages have been described. Drugs used include ACE inhibitors, administration of arginine, administration of osteogenic protein-1, Pirferidone, and so on. It is likely that in the next decade advances in genetic manipulations and new drug therapies may forestall the development of fibrosis in the setting of urinary tract obstruction.", 
    "416": "Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been reported to be useful in determining the prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy.

Clinical characteristics, plasma BNP, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index were compared between patients with and those without recurrent cardiac events.", 
    "419": "During the follow-up period, twelve cardiac events were observed. The New York Heart Association functional class was signi- ficantly higher in patients with cardiac events than in those without (p < 0.05). The plasma BNP level in pa- tients with cardiac events was significantly higher than in those without (521.0 +/- 156.0 vs. 126.8 +/- 20.1 pg/ml, p<0.001), despite more frequent treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (75 vs. 28%, p<0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower and the left ventricular mass index higher in patients with cardiac events as compared with those without (38.1 +/- 5.0 vs. 49.2 +/- 2.4%, p < 0.05; 193.8 +/- 14.3 vs. 132.6 +/- 7.8 g/m(2), p < 0.001, respectively). The plasma BNP was selected as an independent factor associated with cardiac events besides New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index using multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 2.656, p<0.05). The cardiac event rate was significantly higher in patients with a plasma BNP concentration >132 pg/ml using Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.001). Moreover, the plasma BNP level correlated inversely with the length of time from hospital discharge to a cardiac event (r = -0.575, p<0.05).",

    "421": "Dyslipemia as a risk factor for ischemic stroke and indications for statins in the prevention of ischemic stroke are revised. The role of cholesterol levels as a risk factor for ischemic stroke is controversial. This could be due to failures in the design of early epidemiological studies. Recent studies, however, do suggest a clearer risk relationship between cholesterol levels and ischemic stroke. Studies conducted on the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD) with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), using pravastatin and simvastatin, unequivocally show reductions in overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction and other coronary events. These studies show a reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke, and although relative risk reduction is great, absolute risk reduction is low; the reasons for this are analyzed. Apart from lipid mechanisms, statins act on the atheroma plaque; they have antithrombotic and possibly neuroprotecting properties. Statins reduce the number of strokes due to the decrease of atherothrombotic strokes, cardioembolic strokes secondary to IHD, and lacunar strokes related to atherothrombosis and probably to microatheromas. Although there are currently no specific studies available on the secondary prevention of stroke with statins, which are required to clarify certain points, according to European and American guidelines for prevention, statins would be indicated in the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic stroke, and in cardioembolic and lacunar stroke associated with clinical or silent atherosclerosis (IHD, peripheral artery disease). Patients with ischemic stroke of other etiologies, except for stroke in the young or other unusual causes, are patients with a high vascular risk (cardiac and cerebral) owing to the stroke itself, age and other vascular risk factors, and they should also be treated with statins, at least from the point of view of primary prevention of IHD. Natural statins (pravastatin and simvastatin) play an essential part in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, together with antiaggregants, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the treatment of other vascular risk factors.", 
    "422": "A variety of medications have been reported to cause depression as a side effect. This study evaluated cross-sectional associations between a variety of medications and a syndrome resembling major depression. A sample of 2,542 subjects were selected using the Mitofsky-Waksberg random digit dialing (RDD) procedure. Major depression was evaluated using a short form version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Current medication use was recorded during the same telephone interview. Statistical methods accounting for clustering and unequal selection probabilities were employed. Most medications were not associated with major depression: these included beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, digoxin, and diuretics. Calcium channel blockers were significantly associated with major depression, but only in a subset of young subjects, and these tended to be seriously ill individuals taking multiple medications. Opiate analgesics were associated with major depression, but only in male subjects. Corticosteroids were significantly associated with major depression in a logistic regression model that adjusted for age and gender. The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes causal inference about the observed associations. With the exception of the association of major depression with corticosteroid use, convincing associations with other medications were not observed. It is possible that medication-induced depressive episodes lead to changes in exposure status (such as discontinuation of the offending medications) such that the associations are not apparent in cross-sectional data. If this interpretation is correct, these data suggest that the problem of medication-induced depression is being managed effectively at the clinical level and is not a substantial public health problem.", 
    "423": "We previously reported that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevented the hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) in 129/SvEvTac mice, which have 2 renin genes (Ren-1 and Ren-2). In the present study, we induced hypertension by uninephrectomy and DOCA-salt in mice having only the Ren-1 gene (C57BL/6J) and investigated the effect of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril, 4 mg. kg(-)(1). d(-)(1)) and an angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist (L-158809, 4 mg. kg(-)(1). d(-)(1)) on the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal injury. After 4 weeks of treatment, systolic blood pressure in DOCA-salt mice was significantly increased (128+/-2 mm Hg) compared with controls (109+/-2 mm Hg) (P:<0.001), while plasma renin concentration was decreased by 97% (P:<0.001). DOCA-salt also induced left ventricular and renal hypertrophy and renal damage as manifested by proteinuria. Collagen content in the left ventricle and kidney was significantly higher in DOCA-salt mice (P:<0.001). Urinary albumin (P:<0.05) and proliferating cell nucleic antigen-positive cells in the tubules and interstitium of the renal cortex (P:<0.001) were significantly increased in the DOCA-salt group. Neither the ACE inhibitor nor the AT(1) antagonist had any antihypertensive effect; however, they partially prevented cardiac hypertrophy and completely inhibited left ventricular collagen deposition. In the kidney, both the ACE inhibitor and AT(1) antagonist partially reduced the increase in collagen but had no effect on hypertrophy. They also significantly prevented the effect of DOCA-salt on urinary albumin and proliferating cell nucleic antigen expression in the kidney. Despite the lack of an antihypertensive effect, both ACE inhibitor and AT(1) antagonist prevented cardiac remodeling and renal damage. Our results indicate that ACE inhibitors and AT(1) antagonists exert beneficial effects on the heart and kidney in DOCA-salt hypertensive mice independently of their effects on blood pressure.", 
    "424": "In hypertensive rats, environmental stress causes sodium retention by an exaggerated increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity, which is modulated by angiotensin II. We tested whether similar effects can be observed in humans. In 66 normotensive subjects (half of them with a family history of hypertension) and 36 subjects with mild essential hypertension, urinary sodium excretion and renal hemodynamics were examined at rest and during mental stress treated either with placebo or ACE inhibition in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Despite a marked increase in glomerular filtration rate in response to mental stress (Deltaglomerular filtration rate, 4.3+/-7.7 mL/min in normotensives without versus 5.6+/-8.4 mL/min in normotensives with a family history versus 10.1+/-5.7 mL/min in patients with mild essential hypertension; P:<0.002), the increase in urinary sodium excretion was blunted in patients with mild essential hypertension (Deltaurinary sodium excretion, 0.12+/-0.17 mmol/min versus 0.10+/-0.14 mmol/min versus 0.05+/-0.14 mmol/min; P:<0.05). ACE inhibition corrected the natriuretic response to mental stress in subjects with mild essential hypertension (Deltaurinary sodium excretion, 0.05+/-0.14 mmol/min with placebo versus 0.13+/-0.19 mmol/min with ACE inhibition; P:<0.01); thus, after ACE inhibition, urinary sodium excretion increased similarly in all 3 groups. In conclusion, impaired sodium excretion occurs during mental stress in human essential hypertension but not in subjects with positive family history of hypertension. This abnormality in sodium handling during activation of the sympathetic nervous system appears to be mediated by angiotensin II.", 
    "425": "N:-Acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is a natural inhibitor of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell entry into the S phase of the cell cycle and is normally present in human plasma. Ac-SDKP is exclusively hydrolyzed by ACE, and its plasma concentration is increased 5-fold after ACE inhibition in humans. We examined the effect of 0.05 to 100 nmol/L Ac-SDKP on 24-hour (3)H-thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) by cardiac fibroblasts both in the absence and presence of 5% FCS. Captopril (1 micromol/L) was added in all cases to prevent the degradation of Ac-SDKP. Treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with 5% FCS increased thymidine incorporation from a control value of 12 469+/-594 to 24 598+/-1051 cpm (P:<0.001). Cotreatment with 1 nmol/L Ac-SDKP reduced stimulation to control levels (10 373+/-200 cpm, P:<0.001). We measured hydroxyproline content and incorporation of (3)H-proline into collagenous fibroblast proteins and found that Ac-SDKP blocked endothelin-1 (10(-8) mol/L)-induced collagen synthesis in a biphasic and dose-dependent manner, causing inhibition at low doses, whereas high doses had little or no effect. It also blunted the activity of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in a biphasic and dose-dependent manner in serum-stimulated fibroblasts, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of DNA and collagen synthesis may depend in part on blocking mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Participation of p44/p42 in collagen synthesis was confirmed, because a specific inhibitor for p44/p42 activation (PD 98059, 25 micromol/L) was able to block endothelin-1-induced collagen synthesis, similar to the effect of Ac-SDKP. The fact that Ac-SDKP inhibits DNA and collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts suggests that it may be an important endogenous regulator of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the heart. Ac-SDKP may participate in the cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors by limiting fibroblast proliferation (and hence collagen production), and therefore it would reduce fibrosis in patients with hypertension.", 
    "426": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with abnormal ventricular electrophysiology. We have shown complete regression of LVH and normalization of ventricular electrophysiology in renovascular hypertensive rabbits treated with captopril. To determine if angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blockade produces the same benefit, we treated hypertensive rabbits with losartan for 3 months. LVH was evaluated by heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW). Vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia was assessed by ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) and dispersion of effective refractory period (ERP). The electrical properties of single left ventricular myocytes were characterized by action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and inward rectifier K+ current (I(K1)) density. Hypertensive rabbits treated with vehicle (LVH/Vehicle) had higher mean arterial pressure (MAP, 81+/-2 vs. 60+/-2 mm Hg) and HW/BW (2.71+/-0.07 vs. 1.97+/-0.04 g/kg), lower VFT (20+/-1 vs. 39+/-2 mA), larger dispersion of ERP (34+/-3 vs. 14+/-3 ms), longer APD90 (187+/-6 vs. 162+/-6 ms) and lower I(K1) density compared with control rabbits. Hypertensive rabbits treated with losartan (LVH/Losartan) had HW/BW (2.36+/-0.06 g/kg) between those of LVH/Vehicle and control rabbits, whereas MAP (65+/-2 mm Hg), VFT (34+/-2 mA), dispersion of ERP (19+/-1 ms), APD90 (160+/-6 ms), and I(K1) density were significantly different from LVH/Vehicle but similar to control. We conclude that AT1 blockade in renovascular hypertensive rabbits normalizes ventricular electrophysiology.", 
    "427": "We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the modulation of renal O2 consumption in dogs with pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). O2 consumption in the renal cortex (C) and medulla (M) of normal dogs and dogs with CHF was measured under control conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of three stimulators of NO production, bradykinin, ramiprilat, and amlodipine, or the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). Baseline O2 consumption (nmol O2/min per gram) was similar in the CHF group (C: 637+/-65; M: 618+/-83) and the control group (C: 601+/-58, M: 534+/-55). In normal dogs, bradykinin (10(-4) M), ramiprilat (10(-4) M), amlodipine (10(-5) M) and SNAP (10(-4) M) all significantly reduced O2 consumption in the cortex (-31.5+/-3.5%, -33+/-2.5%, -28.4+/-4.9%, -49.3+/-3.1%) and medulla (-26.9+/-2.2%, -31.4+/-2.2%, -23.1+/-1.3%, -48.3+/-4%), respectively. The responses to bradykinin, ramiprilat and amlodipine were significantly attenuated in dogs with CHF (C: -22.2+/-1.8%, -20.1+/-2.6%, -14.2+/-2.5%; M: -20.8+/-1.7%, -17.8+/-1.9%, -15.6+/-2.6%, respectively; p < 0.05). The responses in dogs with CHF were not altered by NO synthase blockade with L-NAME (10(-4) M). In contrast, in normal kidneys treatment with L-NAME significantly attenuated the response to all three stimuli of NO production. Responses to SNAP were not affected either by CHF or L-NAME. These data indicate that the role of NO production in the modulation of tissue O2 consumption in the kidney is impaired after the development of pacing-induced heart failure in dogs.", 
    "428": "Left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension is an important condition. It is associated with significant mortality and carries increased risk for developing nonfatal cardiovascular complications, including coronary heart disease. The pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy is linked to activation of the renin-angiotensin system, with excessive production of angiotensin II believed to be responsible. The therapeutic benefit of blocking angiotensin II at the receptor with selective angiotensin II antagonists, a relatively new class of antihypertensive agents, is therefore considered for regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Clinical evidence shows significant efficacy in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients after treatment with angiotensin II antagonists.

In the 85 patients with valid 24-h recordings reduction in 24-h BP was again similar for the two active groups.

Captopril, methimazole and penicillamine had the strongest antioxidative properties at the concentration level of 0.5 mM. The protective effects gradually decreased at higher and lower concentrations of these drugs. Contrary, the antioxidative properties of N-acetylcysteine increased with its levels growing in the reaction mixture, and only N-acetylpenicillamine did not protect erythrocytes against oxidative damages.

Clinical trials in hypertensive animals and humans show that these peptides/hydrolysates can bring about a significant reduction in hypertension.

    "441": "It is not clear whether some pathological changes in hypertension are directly pressure-dependent, or hormonally induced, or both. The aortic arch has apparently never before been studied for those changes. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of controlling angiotensin II (Ang II) and/or blood pressure (BP), directly at the inception of hypertension, on the aortic arch, the left ventricle of the heart (LV), and the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, enalapril) and a calcium-channel blocker (nifedipine) were used for 21 weeks. After treatment, rats were assessed for arterial plasma renin activity (PRA). The LV, aortic arch, and kidneys were then excised for the determination of organ and tissue weight in some of the animals, while in others the aortic arch was fixed in situ and processed for microscopic analysis. Both enalapril and nifedipine levelled BP in the SHRs to almost normal values. Enalapril was able to prevent the increase in LV and kidney weights (p=0.04 wet, p<0.001 dry; p<0.001 wet and dry, respectively) and the increase in the weight of the aortic arch and in the thickness of its media (p<0.001 wet and dry; p<0.001, respectively) seen in untreated SHRs. This was associated with a larger lumen diameter (p<0.001) and a lower media to lumen ratio (p=0.01). In contrast, nifedipine did not prevent any of the changes described. Neither nifedipine nor enalapril treatment had any effects on PRA in either rat strain. Our results support previous observations that BP is not the only factor causing some of the pathological changes in hypertension; tissue Ang II level may also play a major role.",

Insulin resistance is characterised by an impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Participation of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hyperinsulinaemia in EH patients has not been unanimously proven. The present study aimed to asses the influence of antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, enalapril = 10 mg/day) (9 male patients) or angiotensin II AT-1 receptor blocker (A II RB = losartan 50 mg/day) (9 male patients) respectively on insulin sensitivity in patients with EH. 3-hours euglycaemic clamp test with constant infusion of insulin (50 mU/m2/min) was performed twice: before and after 8 weeks of therapy with ACEI or A II RB respectively. The control group (CG) consisted of 12 healthy males (clamp test was performed once). Serum insulin concentration (I) was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Glucose disposal rate (M-value = mg/kg/min) and tissue insulin sensitivity (M/I value = mg/kg/min per mU/l) were calculated in subjects of the CG and in patients with EH before and after antihypertensive therapy with ACEI or A II RB, respectively. In CG the M-value (7.38 +/- 0.13) and tissue insulin sensitivity (M/I = = 6.76 +/- 0.19) were significantly higher than in EH before treatment with ACEI (M-value = 5.44 +/- 0.16; M/I = = 4.57 +/- 0.18) or A II RB (M-value = 5.75 +/- 0.21; M/I = 4.77 +/- 0.31), respectively. ACEI therapy was followed by a significant increase of both M (6.82 +/- 0.25) and M/I (5.68 +/- 0.25) values. In contrast to ACEI, treatment with A II RB did not influence neither M (5.75 +/- 0.21) nor M/I (4.79 +/- 0.21) values respectively. In contrast to A II RB, ACEI shows a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in EH patients. This effect does not seem to be mediated by an influence on the AT-1 receptor.",

Cardiac death is due not only to coronary artery disease, but also to left ventricular (LV) abnormalities (fibrosis, dysfunction) and arrhythmogenic triggers, such as autonomic imbalance. 2. Nitric oxide deficiency could be a key mediator leading not only to coronary atherosclerosis, but also to LV abnormalities and autonomic imbalance. 3. It may be possible to screen for the above abnormalities (e.g. echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels for LV abnormalities, 24 h tapes for autonomic imbalance and QT interval analysis). 4. Once individuals are identified as being at high risk, a range of interventions is possible (e.g. intensive statin therapy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors if LV abnormalities or autonomic imbalance are found).", 
    "452": "In the ventricles of adult mammalian hearts, production of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is negligible, restricted to the impulse-conducting cells, the papillary muscles, and a minority of subendocardial myocytes. ANP expression is reinduced in the ventricles of pressure-overloaded and failing hearts and is frequently used as a marker for myocyte hypertrophy. Using an immunohistochemical approach, we have characterized the size distribution of ANP-containing myocytes in the left ventricle of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) before and after chronic antihypertensive therapy and compared the results to age-matched normotensive Wistar rats (WR). Our findings show that in SHR the frequency of cells presenting ANP granularity is positively correlated with myocyte size (r=0.746, P<0.02). The highest proportion of ANP-positive myocytes (55-57%) was measured among cells of diameters 30-34 microm. In any corresponding cell size, the proportion of ANP-presenting myocytes was five- to tenfold higher in SHR than in the normotensive WR. We studied the effects of the antihypertensive drugs captopril, hydralazine, and nifedipine and found that, regardless of their effect on blood pressure or hypertrophy, all three eliminated ANP immunoproducts from the majority of the left ventricular myocytes and reduced the level of ANP mRNA, captopril being the most effective. The positive correlation between myocyte size and ANP expression was not maintained in the hearts of drug-treated SHR. Myocytes on the border of fibrotic areas or in regions of ANP presentation within the normal heart resisted the suppressive effect of the antihypertensive therapy, indicating that blood pressure or hypertrophy are not the sole correlates for ANP expression.", 
    "453": "A simple and highly sensitive voltammetric method was developed for the determination of benazepril (I) and ramipril (II). The compounds were treated with nitrous acid, and the cathodic current produced by the resulting nitroso derivatives was measured. The voltammetric behavior was studied by adopting direct current (DCt), differential pulse (DPP), and alternating current (ACt) polarography. Both compounds produced well-defined, diffusion-controlled cathodic waves over the whole pH range in Britton-Robinson buffers (BRb). At pH 3 and 5, the values of diffusion-current constants (Id), were 5.90 +/- 0.40 and 6.66 +/- 0.61 for I and II, respectively. The current concentration plots for I were rectilinear over the range of 1.5-40 and 0.1-30 microg/mL in the DCt and DPP modes, respectively; for II, the range was 2-30 and 0.1-20 microg/mL in the DCt and DPP modes, respectively. The minimum detectabilities (S/N = 2) were 0.015 microg/mL (about 3.25 x 10(-8)M) and 0.012 microg/mL (about 2.88 x 10(-8)M) for I and II, respectively, adopting the DPP mode. Results obtained for the proposed method when applied to the determination of both compounds in dosage forms were in good agreement with those obtained using reference methods. Hydrochlorthiazide, which is frequently co-formulated with these drugs, did not interfere with the assay. The method was also applied to the determination of benazepril in spiked human urine and plasma. The percentage recoveries adopting the DPP mode were 96.2 +/- 1.21 and 95.7 +/- 1.61, respectively.",

MPP+ is one of the most potent dopamine (DA)-releasing agents. Iron-catalyzed DA autoxidation and oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. If indeed the effect of MPP+ on hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation is due to DA release, reserpine-induced DA depletion may reduce MPP(+)-induced .OH formation. Imidapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, can resist MPP(+)-induced .OH formation via suppression of release of DA by angiotensin. Histidine, a singlet oxygen (1O2) scavenger, protects MPP(+)-induced .OH formation. Fluvastatin, an inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, can resist MPP(+)-induced .OH formation.

Cardiac function was assessed by measuring changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings, haemodynamics and cardiac responses in vivo to isoprenaline, 4 weeks after suspension of doxorubicin treatment, in vehicle-treated rats and in animals receiving zofenopril (15 mg/kg/os/day) alone, doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg i.v. once a week for 5 weeks) or zofenopril+doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin induced a significant lengthening of the QalphaT interval, which was completely prevented by zofenopril treatment. The cardiac positive inotropic effect induced by i.v. isoprenaline was selectively depressed by doxorubicin (no changes in chronotropic responses) and this adverse effect of doxorubicin was also prevented in zofenopril+doxorubicin pretreated rats. Doxorubicin induced a significant increase in relative heart weight, which was likewise prevented in zofenopril+doxorubicin treated rats. In separate experiments, zofenopril did not interfere with the antitumor activity of doxorubicin (inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice xenografted with A2780 human tumor line). In conclusion, the oral administration of zofenopril is able to significantly ameliorate, up to 4 weeks after the end of doxorubicin administration, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without affecting the antitumor activity of this anthracycline.",

    "495": "The mechanisms of action of omapatrilat, an agent that inhibits both neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and angiotensin-converting enzyme, on arterial function in patients with heart failure have not been previously reported. Forty-eight patients in New York Heart Association functional class II to III, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%, and in sinus rhythm were randomized to a dose-ranging (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) study of omapatrilat for 12 weeks. Measurements were obtained at baseline and 12 weeks. Decreases in systolic (25.0 +/- 4.5 vs 2.8 +/- 5.0 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and mean arterial (13.9 +/- 3.0 vs 0.3 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p < 0.05) pressure were seen after 12 weeks of therapy with higher doses. Ventricular-arterial coupling was improved with a dose-related decrease in augmentation index (-13.8 +/- 1.7% vs +6.1 +/- 2.1%, p < 0.01). There was no change in resting forearm blood flow between groups; however, maximum forearm vasodilator response during reactive hyperemia increased in the high-dose groups compared with the control group (+266 +/- 43% vs - 14 +/- 92%, p < 0.05). Omapatrilat induced an increase in postdose plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (30 +/- 11 vs -2 +/- 7 pmol/L, p < 0.01) in high-dose groups consistent with endopeptidase 24.11 inhibition. Omapatrilat shows beneficial changes in ventricular-vascular coupling and arterial function in heart failure.", 
    "496": "The QUO VADIS study was designed to explore whether 1 year of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril (40 mg/day) would decrease ischemia in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients (n = 149) scheduled for CABG were randomized 4 weeks before surgery. Study medication was used from randomization up to 1 year after CABG. Exercise testing was performed at randomization; the exercise test was repeated 1 year after CABG and patients underwent 48-hour Holter monitoring. Clinical ischemic events were recorded and defined as death, revascularization, myocardial infarction, recurrence of angina pectoris, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Total exercise time increased overall by 75 +/- 76 seconds 1 year after CABG (placebo +79 +/- 75 seconds, quinapril +72 +/- 79 seconds, p = 0.6). All patients had ischemic ST-segment changes at randomization; 33% of patients had ischemic ST-segment changes 1 year after CABG (placebo 29%, quinapril 37%, p = 0.4). On Holter monitoring, the number of patients experiencing > or = 1 episodes of ischemia was equal in both groups. Treatment with quinapril significantly reduced clinical ischemic events after CABG: 15% in patients on placebo versus 4% of patients on quinapril (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.87, p = 0.02). Long-term quinapril treatment significantly reduced clinical ischemic events within 1 year after CABG, although ischemia at exercise testing and Holter monitoring was unchanged.", 
    "497": "N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) inhibits not only hematopoietic cell proliferation but also fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in vitro. Ac-SDKP also prevents collagen deposition and cell proliferation in the left ventricle (LV) in rats with renovascular hypertension (renin dependent). However, it is not clear whether Ac-SDKP has similar effects in a model of renin-independent hypertension (aldosterone-salt). Using a hypertensive rat model of cardiac and renal fibrosis created by chronic elevation of circulating aldosterone (ALDO) levels, we examined the effect of Ac-SDKP on blood pressure, cardiac and renal fibrosis and hypertrophy, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the LV and left kidney. Uninephrectomized rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) controls that received tap water, (2) rats that received ALDO (0.75 microgram/h SC) and 1% NaCl/0.2% KCl in drinking water (ALDO-salt), (3) rats that received ALDO-salt plus Ac-SDKP 400 microgram. kg(-1). day(-1) SC, and (4) rats that received ALDO-salt plus Ac-SDKP 800 microgram. kg(-1). d(-1) SC. After 6 weeks of treatment, the ALDO-salt group was found to have significantly increased blood pressure with decreased body weight and plasma renin concentration (P<0.05), LV and renal hypertrophy as well as renal injury, significantly increased collagen content in both ventricles and kidney as well as increased collagen volume fraction in the LV (P<0.0001), and significantly increased interstitial and perivascular PCNA-positive cells in the LV and kidney (P<0.0001). Ac-SDKP at 800 microgram. kg(-1). d(-1) markedly prevented cardiac and renal fibrosis (P<0.005) without affecting blood pressure or organ hypertrophy. It also suppressed PCNA expression in the LV and kidney in a dose-dependent manner. We concluded that Ac-SDKP prevents increased collagen deposition and cell proliferation in the heart and kidney in ALDO-salt hypertensive rats. Because ACE inhibitors increase plasma and tissue Ac-SDKP and decrease cardiac and renal fibrosis, we speculate that Ac-SDKP may participate in the antifibrotic effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "498": "In the present study, we investigated the potentiating effect of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] on bradykinin (BK)-induced vasodilation in the mesenteric vascular bed of anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats using intravital microscopy. Topical application of BK and Ang-(1-7) induced vasodilation in mesenteric arterioles. The BK-induced effect, but not acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, or histamine responses, was potentiated in the presence of Ang-(1-7). This interaction was abolished by BK-B(2) and Ang-(1-7) antagonists (HOE 140 and A-779, respectively), a K(+) channel blocker (tetraethylammonium), and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin and diclofenac); however, nitric oxide synthase inhibition (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) did not modify the Ang-(1-7)-potentiating activity. Long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition increased BK and Ang-(1-7)-induced vasodilation. The BK potentiation by Ang-(1-7) was preserved after ACE inhibition, Ang II type 1 receptor blockade, or the combination of both treatments. The most striking finding of this study was the unexpected observation that the potentiation of BK vasodilation in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated short- or long-term with ACE inhibitors was reverted by the Ang-(1-7) antagonist A-779. Our results unmasked a key role for an Ang-(1-7)-related mechanism in mediating BK potentiation by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "499": "Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that tyrosine kinase activity contributes to renal arteriolar contractile responses to angiotensin (Ang) II. Rats were subjected to short-term enalaprilat treatment to decrease endogenous Ang II formation before tissue was harvested for experiments with the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique. Acute surgical papillectomy was used to avoid the indirect afferent arteriolar effect of Ang II that arises through increased tubuloglomerular feedback sensitivity. Arteriolar lumen diameter responses to 1 and 10 nmol/L Ang II were monitored by videomicroscopic methods before and during treatment with various tyrphostin compounds: 100 micromol/L AG18 (broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor), 100 nmol/L AG1478 (selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), or 100 micromol/L AG9 (inactive analog). Baseline afferent arteriolar lumen diameter averaged 23.5+/-1.2 micrometer and was not influenced by any tyrphostin. Ang II (10 nmol/L) decreased afferent diameter by 11.1+/-1.0 micrometer under untreated conditions, a response that was not altered by AG9 but significantly blunted by AG18 (34+/-9% inhibition) or AG1478 (52+/-8% inhibition). AG18 did not suppress afferent arteriolar contractile responses to membrane depolarization (20 to 55 mmol/L K(+ )bath). Efferent arteriolar baseline diameter averaged 24.1+/-0.8 micrometer and was unaltered by AG18 or AG1478; however, efferent diameter responses to 10 nmol/L Ang II were diminished 52+/-10% by AG18 and 51+/-13% by AG1478. These observations indicate that Ang II signaling in renal afferent and efferent arteriolar vascular smooth muscle is either mediated or modulated by tyrosine kinase activity, including that of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase.", 
    "500": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and heart failure. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a model for type 2 diabetes, exhibit endothelial dysfunction. Rats also received a high-sodium diet (6% NaCl [wt/wt]) and chronic angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade (10 mg/kg PO valsartan for 8 weeks). Compared with age-matched nondiabetic Wistar control rats, GK rats had higher blood glucose levels (9.3+/-0.5 versus 6.9+/-0.2 mmol/L for control rats), 2.7-fold higher serum insulin levels, and impaired glucose tolerance (all P<0.05). Telemetry-measured mean blood pressure was 15 mm Hg higher in GK rats (P<0.01) compared with control rats, whereas heart rates were not different. Heart weight- and kidney weight-to-body weight ratios were higher in GK rats (P<0.05), and 24-hour albuminuria was increased 50%. Endothelium-mediated relaxation of noradrenaline-precontracted mesenteric arterial rings by acetylcholine was impaired compared with the control condition (P<0.05), whereas the sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was similar. Preincubation of the arterial rings with the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac inhibited relaxations to acetylcholine almost completely in GK rats but not in Wistar rats, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction can be in part attributed to reduced relaxation via arterial K(+) channels. Perivascular monocyte/macrophage infiltration and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 overexpression were observed in GK rat kidneys. A high-sodium diet increased blood pressure by 24 mm Hg and 24-hour albuminuria by 350%, induced cardiac hypertrophy, impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation further, and aggravated inflammation (all P<0.05). The serum level of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha), a vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic arachidonic acid metabolite produced by oxidative stress, was increased 400% in GK rats on a high-sodium diet. Valsartan decreased blood pressure in rats fed a low-sodium diet and prevented the inflammatory response. In rats fed a high-sodium diet, valsartan did not decrease blood pressure or improve endothelial dysfunction but protected against albuminuria, inflammation, and oxidative stress. As measured by quantitative autoradiography, AT(1) receptor expression in the medulla was decreased in GK compared with Wistar rats, whereas cortical AT(1) receptor expression, medullary and cortical angiotensin type 2 (AT(2)) receptor expressions, and adrenal ACE and neutral endopeptidase expressions were unchanged. A high-sodium diet did not influence renal AT(1), AT(2), ACE, or neutral endopeptidase expressions. In valsartan-treated GK rats, the cortical and medullary AT(1) receptor expressions were decreased in the presence and absence of a high-sodium diet. A high-sodium diet increased plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations in presence and absence of valsartan treatment. We conclude that hypertension in GK rats is salt sensitive and associated with endothelial dysfunction and perivascular inflammation. AT(1) receptor blockade ameliorates inflammation during a low-sodium diet and partially protects against salt-induced vascular damage by blood pressure-independent mechanisms.", 
    "501": "In a previous study, we demonstrated that Dahl S rats (SS group) have low plasma renin activity, whereas transfer of a region of chromosome 13 containing the renin gene from Dahl R onto a congenic strain of Dahl SS/Jr/Hsd/MCW rats (S/ren(RR) group) restores renin secretory responses. In the present study, we compared the angiogenic responses to electrical stimulation in the SS and S/ren(RR) groups to explore the hypotheses that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis in skeletal muscle. Congenic SS and S/ren(RR) rats fed a 0.4% or 4% salt diet were surgically prepared by chronic implantation of an electrical stimulator. Another group of S/ren(RR) rats was treated with lisinopril 2 days before the surgery and throughout the stimulation protocol. The right tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were stimulated for 8 hours per day for 7 days. The contralateral muscles served as controls. Western blot analysis was performed to identify VEGF protein expression in these muscles. Electrical stimulation produced no change in vessel density of the SS group fed a 0.4% salt diet (change 5.50% and 8.14% for EDL and TA, respectively). Transfer of a region containing the renin gene restored the angiogenic response (change 16% and 30% for EDL and TA, respectively) despite a significantly higher blood pressure. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by lisinopril or high salt restored the responses observed in the SS group fed a low salt diet. In addition, increases in VEGF expression to electrical stimulation were observed only in the S/ren(RR) group fed a low salt diet. These results suggest that renin gene transfer restores angiogenesis and VEGF expression in the skeletal muscle of Dahl S rats.", 
    "502": "The observation in the 1970s that the performance of the dysfunctional left ventricle was under the influence of aortic impedance led us to exploration of the role of the renin-angiotensin system and other hormonal systems in the progression of heart failure. The apparent efficacy of vasodilator drugs led to the first randomized, controlled trial in heart failure that demonstrated that all impedance-lowering drugs did not exert the same long-term benefit. Differences on the structural remodeling process in the myocardium and arterial vasculature were shown to account for the differential long-term response. We now recognize that the remodeling process in the left ventricle may be inhibited by nitrates, converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers, and this growth process leads to adverse outcomes. The impedance load on the left ventricle is influenced by vascular remodeling that also may be inhibited by drugs such as converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus, progression of cardiovascular disease is largely a consequence of structural changes that are hormonally mediated and may be inhibited by drug therapy.", 
    "503": "This is a personal historical account relating the events that led to the first application of angiotensin inhibition (either by ACE inhibitors or by angiotensin receptor blockade) to the investigation of the pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure.

    "504": "Because hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates growth of endothelial cells exclusively without replication of vascular smooth muscle cells, we hypothesized that HGF may play a role in cardiovascular disease. In human vascular smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II suppressed local vascular HGF production in a dose-dependent manner. Using a rat balloon-injury carotid artery model, we demonstrated that blockade of angiotensin II inhibited neointimal formation, accompanied by a significant increase in local HGF production. However, the relation of vascular HGF to endothelial function was not clarified. Moreover, it is important to test the hypothesis in animal models that are more similar to human restenosis. Thus, in the present study, we used a porcine coronary artery balloon-injury model to study the role of angiotensin II in regulation of the local HGF system in vivo. Expression of HGF mRNA was significantly decreased in balloon-injured coronary arteries versus intact vessels. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril) significantly inhibited neointimal formation after balloon injury compared with vehicle (P:<0.05). In addition, vasodilator response of balloon-injured coronary arteries to bradykinin was restored by perindopril treatment, whereas no vasodilator response was observed in balloon-injured vessels treated with vehicle. Vasodilator response of balloon-injured arteries induced by perindopril was completely abolished by N:(w)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Of particular interest, vascular HGF mRNA was significantly increased in balloon-injured vessels treated with perindopril as compared with vehicle. Overall, the present study demonstrated that ACE inhibitor significantly inhibited neointimal formation, accompanied by significant improvement of endothelial dysfunction and a significant increase in local vascular HGF mRNA in vivo in a porcine coronary artery balloon-injury model. Given the strong mitogenic activity of HGF on endothelial cells, improvement of endothelial dysfunction by perindopril might be due to increased local HGF expression through enhancement of reendothelialization after balloon injury, in addition to its direct effect, ACE inhibition. Downregulation of the local vascular HGF system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.",

    "513": "This study analysed the effect of low doses of verapamil added to chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on blood pressure and serum creatinine levels in eight elderly hypertensive patients who had a steady increase of serum creatinine while on ACE inhibitors. The study was performed in eight elderly hypertensive subjects, five men and three women (mean age 70+/-2 years; systolic blood pressure 173+/-4 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure 99+/-1 mm Hg) and serum creatinine of 1.60+/-0.27 mg/dl before treatment. During an average of 25 weeks, ACE inhibitors significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but serum creatinine levels were increased over basal levels (0,68+/-0,20 mg/dl, p < 0.05). During an average of 10 weeks, the addition of verapamil did not decrease blood pressure further, but serum creatinine levels were reduced to baseline. Our study suggests that the addition of verapamil to ACE inhibitors can reverse ACE-induced increase in creatinine levels in elderly hypertensive patients in whom this side effect is observed.", 
    "514": "The above discussion on the interaction of aspirin and ACE inhibitors seems to suggest that aspirin in high doses may have adverse interaction with ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure but the data obtained is not sufficient or conclusive to recommended omission of aspirin in patients with heart failure. This raises a query in the mind of the physician whether to use a combination or not? The role of aspirin in the early period after myocardial infarction is well established so is the role of ACE inhibitors. Hence in patients with myocardial infarction and preserved left ventricular function it would not be wrong to administer combination of ACE inhibitors and aspirin. Albeit at a lower dose. In patients with large myocardial infarction or heart failure, warfarin may be an option but still needs to be documented in large trials. As suggested long term use of aspirin after infarction is still ambiguous and may be harmful in patients with heart failure with its anticedent side effects. But long term benefits of ACE inhibitors in heart failure are well documented. Hence if a choice has to be made whether to discontinue either of the two drugs it would be preferable to stop the aspirin. To answer the issue of use of aspirin in patients with heart failure it would be essential to conduct a double blind randomized trial comparing known anti-thrombotic treatment, aspirin and anti-coagulants on mortality in patients with heart failure, especially caused by coronary artery disease. Such a trial is underway at the present and till the results are available it should be left to clinical judgement of the physician whether to administer aspirin in patients with heart failure after weighing the benefits versus risk.",

They were randomly allocated to one of the 4 treatments: prazosin GITS 2.5 mg OD (Group 1), atenolol 50 mg OD (Group II), nifedipine SR 20 mg BD (Group III), and enalapril 5 mg OD (Group IV). All the drugs were given for 7 days, and blood samples were collected at 0 hr on day 1 (pre-treatment) and day 8 (post-treatment). Based on the dose (incremental concentrations of ADP)--response (% maximum aggregation) curve obtained, 2.5 microM/L of ADP was used to compare % inhibition of platelet aggregation among the 4 groups. We found that prazosin GITS inhibited % maximum aggregation significantly (p = 0.02) at 2.5 microM/L of ADP. Such inhibitory effect was not seen in any of the other groups. The inhibition produced by prazosin GITS differed significantly from the action of the other 3 drugs (p < 0.05). This antiplatelet effect of prazosin GITS bears more clinical relevance in view of the fact that it was seen at a time which is expected to coincide with the trough plasma levels of prazosin.",

A case of hypotension probably due to an albumin infusion is described. Bradykinin effects are probably the cause of many hypotensive reactions.

    "517": "The aim of this study is to investigate whether normal blood pressure (BP) can be achieved in patients with hypertension on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy by strict volume control without the use of antihypertensive drugs. Of the 78 patients in our center, 47 persons had hypertension and/or were on antihypertensive drug therapy. After discontinuing these drugs, a strong dietary salt restriction was imposed by repeatedly explaining the need for it to patients and families. If this approach did not result in sufficient BP decrease, ultrafiltration (UF) was added by increased use of hypertonic (3.86% glucose) peritoneal dialysis solution. Cardiothoracic index (CTI) on the chest radiograph was also used as a measure of volume control. With salt restriction alone or combined with UF, body weight decreased by a mean of 2.8 +/- 0.5 kg, and BP decreased from a mean of 158.2 +/- 17.0/95.7 +/- 10.3 to 119.7 +/- 16.0/77.9 +/- 9.7 mm Hg in 37 patients, accompanied by a decrease in CTI from 48.0% +/- 5.6% to 42.9% +/- 4.5%. In 19 patients who had residual renal function, 24-hour urine volume decreased to 28% of the pretreatment volume, accompanied by a mean decrease in Kt/V urea from 2.06 +/- 0.5 to 1.85 +/- 0.4. In 7 of the remaining patients who did not respond to the applied treatment, BP decreased from 158.8 +/- 23.2/111.6 +/- 9.8 to 113.5 +/- 14.3/76.4 +/- 6.2 mm Hg after administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Their CTI was 41.2% +/- 1.3%, indicating the absence of hypervolemia. In 3 patients, the desired results could not be reached because of noncompliance. Our findings show that normal BP can be achieved by severe salt restriction combined with increased UF in the majority of CAPD patients. This is accompanied by a decrease in CTI from upper limits into the normal range, but also by a decrease in residual renal function and Kt/V index. In most of the remaining patients, normal BP can be reached by the use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "518": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). beta-Adrenergic blockers, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) all reduce CVD mortality, but little is known about the extent to which these medications are used in patients with CRI. This study, a prospective cross-sectional study of consecutive patients seen by nephrologists in four Canadian centers for follow-up of progressive CRI in 1999, was performed to investigate the prevalence of coronary risk factors and use of cardioprotective medications among patients with CRI. Patients had creatinine clearances of 75 mL/min or less but were not on dialysis therapy. Three hundred four consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Mean age was 60.8 +/- 15.7 years, mean creatinine clearance was 30.3 +/- 18 mL/min, and the case mix of kidney diseases was similar to that in the Canadian Organ Replacement Registry data. One hundred seventeen of 304 patients (38.5%) had a history of previous CVD, and the prevalence of CVD was greater in patients with more severe CRI. Two hundred forty-three patients (79.9%) had a history of hypertension, 132 patients (43.4%) had hyperlipidemia, 114 patients (37.5%) had diabetes mellitus, and 71 patients (27.3%) were smokers. Thirty-five percent of the patients with CVD had blood pressures greater than 140/90 mm Hg; 103 patients (33.9%) were administered beta-blockers; 196 patients (64.5%), ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers; 83 patients (27.3%), ASA; and 56 patients (18.4%), statins. Patients with diabetes were not more likely than those without diabetes to be prescribed cardioprotective medications. CVD is common in the predialysis population, and its prevalence increases with more severe kidney failure. Despite this, the use of cardioprotective medications is relatively low, and many patients had suboptimal blood pressure control. Given the high burden of disease in these patients, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors should be used to control hypertension and/or for cardioprotection, and the increased use of ASA and statins should be considered.",

Proteinuric patients with nondiabetic renal disease, normotension, and restricted protein and sodium intake were treated with ACE inhibitors without diuretics. Fifty-nine patients were treated with either lisinopril (10 mg/d; 36 patients) or enalapril (5 mg/d; 23 patients) over a period of 37.7 +/- 20.7 months. Urinary protein excretion decreased to less than 50% of pretreatment values after 1 to 37 months (6.9 +/- 8.8 months) of therapy in 33 patients (56%); in 29 patients, it reached less than 0.5 g/d of protein. Urinary protein levels remained low in 19 of the 33 patients (57.5%) throughout the entire posttreatment period (30.8 +/- 17.7 months). However, in the remaining 14 patients, escape from the antiproteinuric effect was detected after 19.2 +/- 13.4 months, evidenced by a decrease in the rate of change in creatinine clearance from 0.052 +/- 0.114 mL/min/mon during the low-proteinuria period to -0.697 +/- 1.101 mL/min/mon after the lapse of antiproteinuric effect (P: < 0.001).

None of the patients showed renal arteries stenosis or other predisposing factors for the development of ARF. In conclusion, we want pointed out that losartan could affect renal function in a similar way as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). We suggested that use of losartan in risk situations, like old age, preexiting CRF, stenosis of renal arteries, solitary kidney and diuretic therapy, should be carefully monitored as well as that of ACE I.", 
    "522": "In recent years in conjunction with medicamentous treatment of renoparenchymatous hypertension in particular two problems were discussed: target blood pressure values and renoprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs. Prospective studies revealed that a blood pressure reading of < 130/80 mm Hg significantly retards the progression of nephropathy whereby patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d benefit from even lower BP readings. In diabetic nephropathy the drugs of choice are inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI), already in the incipient stage and also in normotensive patients. The importance of ACEI in the treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies was confirmed recently by controlled prospective studies AIPRI and REIN. A maximal renoprotective effect of ACEI probably calls for larger doses than those needed for normalization of BP. Long-term investigations of the renoprotective effect of antagonists of angiotensin AT1 receptors and comparative studies with ACEI resp. are not available. Dihydropyridine blockers of calcium channels with a short-term action (nifedipine) may have a negative influence on the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the effect of dihydropyridines of the second generation is tested in prospective studies. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a renoprotective action in diabetic nephropathy. In cca two thirds of the patients combined treatment with ACEI and diuretics or with calcium channel blockers is necessary. As to other antihypertensive drugs, vasodilatating beta-blockers and perspectively antagonists of endothelin receptors are useful.", 
    "523": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is believed to be important in the deterioration of endothelial dysfunction in CHF through stimulation of oxidative stress. Whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) improve endothelial function in CHF, the effects of angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers (ARB) are less well established. Therefore we compared the effects of the ACE-I lisinopril vs. the ARB candesartan on endothelial dysfunction in a rat model of CHF. CHF was induced by myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary ligation. Two weeks after MI, daily treatment with lisinopril (2 mg/kg) or candesartan cilexetil (1.5 mg/kg) was started. After 13 weeks, rats were sacrificed and endothelial function was determined by measuring acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasodilation in aortic rings, with selective presence of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to determine the contribution of nitric oxide (NO). ACh-induced vasodilation was attenuated in untreated MI (-50%) compared with control rats. This was in part due to an impaired contribution of NO (-49%). Lisinopril and candesartan cilexetil fully normalised ACh-induced dilation, including the part mediated by NO. Chronic RAAS-blockade with lisinopril and candesartan cilexetil normalised endothelial function in CHF in a comparable way. The effect of both treatments included the increase of the NO-mediated dilation, further indicating the important role of oxidative stress in the relationship between the RAAS and endothelial dysfunction in CHF.", 
    "524": "The present studies were performed to investigate whether the differences described between the two modalities for interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin AT 1receptor antagonists (AIIA) result in differences in renoprotective efficacy in the rat remnant kidney model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with an initial body weight of 225-300 g, underwent 5/6 renal ablation and had radiotransmitters installed for radiotelemetric blood pressure (BP) measurements, owing to the known limitations of periodic tail-cuff BP measurements to adequately reflect ambient BP profiles. After renal ablation surgery, the rats received no treatment (n=10); enalapril (n=11) or candesartan (n=9) after the first week, both administered initially at a dose of 50 mg/l of drinking water (~10 mg/kg). However, the dose of candesartan had to be reduced to 10-25 mg/l in 4/9 rats to avoid excessive hypotension. Both enalapril and candesartan produced significant reductions in average systolic BP during the subsequent approximately six weeks of observations as compared with untreated rats (187\u00b14 mmHg, p<0.001), but candesartan was significantly more effective at these relative doses (121\u00b13 vs. 133\u00b14 mmHg, p<0.05). At approximately seven weeks, serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured before sacrifice for morphologic assessment of percentage glomerulosclerosis (GS). Despite the described differences between ACE-I and AIIA after acute administration, the percentage GS was reduced similarly by enalapril (down to 6.8\u00b12.8%) and candesartan (down to 2.9\u00b11.5%) as compared with untreated rats (37.2\u00b14.3%). Moreover, GS in individual animals paralleled the BP reductions achieved. Proteinuria was reduced in parallel to the decrease in % GS. These data indicate that, at least in the 5/6 renal ablation model, RAAS blockade by either ACE-I or AIIA provides protection by BPdependent rather than BP-independent mechanisms. This may reflect the primarily hypertensive pathogenesis of GS in this model, and the fact that hypertension is also very angiotensin II-dependent in this model. Thus, these data suggest that models other than the 5/6 ablation model may be more appropriate to demonstrate the BP-independent protective effects of RAAS blockade.", 
    "525": "Chronic allograft nephropathy is the most prevalent cause of graft dysfunction and failure. Its pathogenesis and treatment remains poorly defined. The calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, may play a role in the progressive loss of renal function in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy. This effect may be either related to the direct stimulation of profibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2) or indirect mechanisms, through increases in blood pressure or alterations in either carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. Experimental studies have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can attenuate cyclosporine-mediated increases in TGF-\u03b2 production in renal tissue. Clinical studies have demonstrated that either cyclosporine or tacrolimus dose reduction may help reduce the rate of loss of renal function in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated that a chronic reduction in the dose of cyclosporine in transplant patients can reduce serum TGF-\u03b2 levels. Treatment with an ARB can normalise the plasma levels of TGF-\u03b2 in renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine. All these observations suggest that there may be a role of cyclosporine, and possibly tacrolimus, in worsening chronic allograft nephropathy through their effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and TGF-\u03b2 production.", 
    "526": "Altered operation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and dietary sodium intake have been identified as independent risk factors for cardiac hypertrophy. The way in which sodium intake and the operation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system interact in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy is poorly understood. The aims of this study were to investigate the cardiac effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), using co-treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with different sodium intakes. Our experiments with SHR show that, at high levels of sodium intake (4.0%), aggressive RAS blockade treatment with candesartan (3 mg/kg) and perindopril (6 mg/kg) does not result in regression of cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, RAS blockade coupled with reduced sodium diet (0.2%) significantly regresses cardiac hypertrophy, impairs animal growth and is associated with elevated plasma renin and dramatically suppressed plasma angiotensinogen levels. Histological analyses indicate that the differential effect of reduced sodium on heart growth during RAS blockade is not associated with any change in myocardial interstitial collagen, but reflects modification of cellular geometry. Dimensional measurements of enzymatically-isolated ventricular myocytes show that, in the RAS blocked, reduced sodium group, myocyte length and width were decreased by about 16-19% compared with myocytes from the high sodium treatment group. Our findings highlight the importance of `titrating' sodium intake with combined RAS blockade in the clinical setting to optimise therapeutic benefit.", 
    "527": "The optimal doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for maximal reduction in urinary protein excretion are not known. Moreover, beneficial effects from ARBs, such as tissue protection owing to a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may be independent of blood pressure-lowering by ARBs. In this investigation, we evaluated whether increasing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, in subjects already on the maximally-recommended FDA doses of 32 mg, would induce a further reduction in 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients with heavy proteinuria (urinary protein excretion >1.5 g/day; mean 4.4\u00b12 g/day). Ten patients were started on 16 or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil daily. After 1-2 months of therapy, the dose was titrated upwards to 96 mg. In all subjects, there were further reductions in 24-hour urinary protein excretion when the dose was increased beyond the recommended 32 mg maximal dose. Increasing the dose of candesartan cilexetil to 96 mg was safe, as most subjects showed no changes in serum potassium and, as expected, only a slight increase (0.5-0.7 mg/dl) in serum creatinine. These data warrant further investigation, since some subjects may require higher doses of candesartan to achieve optimal regression of proteinuria.", 
    "528": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers are the newest class of antihypertensive drugs to be developed. No large-scale clinical trials have been performed to evaluate their efficacy alone, or in combination with other drugs. A large-scale, eight week, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-arm trial evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and dose-response of candesartan cilexetil, 16-32 mg once-daily, either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, in a diverse hypertensive population in actual practice settings. 6465 patients with high blood pressure, of whom 52% were female and 16% African American, with a mean age of 58 years, were included. 5446 patients had essential hypertension and 1014 patients had isolated systolic hypertension. In order to be included in this study, patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140-179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-109 mmHg inclusive at baseline), despite a variety of other antihypertensive drugs. Of the 5156 patients with essential hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, the mean pretreatment blood pressure (BP) was 156/97 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil monotherapy reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18.0/12.2 mmHg. Similarly, in the 964 patients with isolated systolic hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, candesartan cilexetil monotherapy reduced SBP/DBP from 158/81 by 16.5/4.5 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil was similarly effective when employed as add-on therapy. When added to baseline antihypertensive medication in 51% of the patients with essential hypertension not achieving BP control, additional reduction in BP was achieved regardless of the background therapy, including diuretics (17.8/11.7 mmHg) calcium antagonists (16.6/11.2 mmHg), beta-blockers (16.5/10.4 mmHg), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (15.3/10.0 mmHg), and alpha blockers (16.4/10.4 mmHg). Likewise, when candesartan cilexetil was used as add-on therapy in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there was a consistent further reduction of mean SBP/DBP, regardless of the background therapy. Moreover, these monotherapeutic or add-on efficacy benefits were seen regardless of age (<65 or >65 years), gender, or race. Despite the open-label design of the study which enhances efficacy owing to the placebo effect, the Ang II receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil either alone, or as an add-on therapy, is highly effective for assisting in the control of systolic and diastolic hypertension.", 
    "529": "We have investigated whether the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil, has a persistent effect on blood pressure even after withdrawal of treatment, as has been shown consistently for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-1). Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were divided into four groups (n=16 per group) and treated with candesartan cilexetil (high-dose: 5 mg/kg/day; middle-dose: 1 mg/kg/day; low-dose: 0.5 mg/kg/day) or control from age four weeks to 20 weeks. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were also investigated. The drug was given in the drinking water, the concentration adjusted for water consumption and rat weight. Blood pressure (BP) was measured regularly by the indirect tail-cuff method during the treatment period and after treatment, from age 20 weeks to 32 weeks. At age 20 weeks, candesartan treatment had caused a slight reduction in body weight, an increase in water consumption and a reduction in heart rate. During treatment, candesartan caused a dose-dependent reduction in BP. After withdrawal of treatment, BP increased but remained lower than that of untreated control SHR for the medium- and high-dose groups throughout the follow-up period, the reduction being 8-11% at the end of follow-up. At age 32 weeks, there was no significant difference between the three candesartan-treated groups. We conclude that treatment with the AT1-receptor antagonist candesartan has a modest persistent effect on BP after withdrawal of treatment.", 
    "530": "Pharmacological interruption of the renin-angiotensin system is possible at three major sites, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the AT1 receptor and at the interaction of renin with its substrate, angiotensinogen. Skeggs and his associates in 1957 argued logically but without prognostic accuracy that 'since renin is the initial and rate-limiting substance in the renin-angiotensin system, it would seem that the renin inhibition approach would be the most likely to succeed'. In fact, the development of agents that act at all three levels has enjoyed substantial success, yet renin inhibition, which showed early progress in studies in humans, has languished. Our task in this essay is to review the reasons for the slow evolution of renin inhibition and to discuss the potential of such agents in modern pharmacotherapy. All of the structure-action relationships have involved variation on the original peptide structure. The possibility that alternative approaches based on x-ray crystallography and reconstruction of the structure of the active site would lead to novel agents, appears not to have been explored systematically. This opportunity is all the more attractive because renin is one of the few targets that is actually soluble and amenable to x-ray crystallographic studies. At the moment, it appears that all renin inhibitor development programs have been closed, although hints periodically reappear to indicate that one company or another is pursuing a novel agent. The decision to close programs seems to have reflected not the therapeutic potential of renin inhibitors, but rather the cost of their synthesis, continuing problems with bioavailability and the remarkable success of the competitor class--the AngII antagonists. We believe that the potential of renin inhibition in human therapy has been under estimated and still shows substantial promise.", 
    "531": "Nicotine may contribute to smoking-induced endothelial dysfunction because of its ability to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. We investigated whether the acute administration of nicotine changes the hypotensive responses to bradykinin in rats. The effects of pre-treatment with losartan or enalapril on the nicotine-induced changes in the responses to bradykinin were also evaluated. In study 1, anesthetized rats were cannulated via carotid artery for the measurement of mean arterial pressure. Dose-response curves to bradykinin (0.1, 0.4, 1.6, 6.4, 25 and 100 microg/kg) were generated before and 10 min after the injection of nicotine (200 microg/kg, i.v.) or saline. The individual dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation using the ALLFIT program, which provided an estimate of the maximal response (E(max)) and of the dose of bradykinin producing the half-maximal response (ED(50)). In study 2, rats were pre-treated orally with losartan (10 mg/kg/day) or enalapril maleate (25 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Control rats received tap water alone. After pre-treatment, the rats were anesthetized and used as described in study 1. Nicotine decreased the E(max) (from 73.0+/-7.5 to 65.7+/-3.3 mm Hg; P<0.05) but did not affect the ED(50). In study 2, losartan or enalapril did not affect nicotine-induced decrease in responses to bradykinin; E(max) decreased in both groups (from 68.7+/-6.3 to 62.8+/-4.2 mm Hg, and from 53.8+/-13.0 to 43.1+/-7.1 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.05) without significantly changing the ED(50). These results suggest that nicotine impairs the endothelium-dependent hypotensive responses to bradykinin. This effect is not influenced by inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme or by blockade of the angiotensin AT(1) receptors.", 
    "532": "Spinorphin has been isolated from the bovine spinal cord as an endogenous inhibitor of enkephalin-degrading enzymes (aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase III, angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase), and tynorphin has been synthesized as a more potent inhibitor of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase III. In this study, the effects of spinorphin and tynorphin on synaptic transmission were studied in rat isolated hippocampal slices. Field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region after stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Spinorphin (1 microM), which alone had no effect, potentiated the facilitatory effects of enkephalin on the filed potentials at a stimulation interval of 15 s. At a stimulation interval of 10--4 s, spinorphin alone frequency dependently inhibited the field potential. On the other hand, tynorphin (1 microM), which alone had no effect at any stimulus interval, tended to potentiate the facilitatory effects of enkephalin. Spinorphin blocked long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s), whereas tynorphin had no effect on long-term potentiation. These results suggest that, at a low stimulation frequency, spinorphin potentiates the facilitatory effects of enkephalin by preventing degradation of enkephalin, whereas at a high stimulation frequency spinorphin use dependently inhibits synaptic transmission independently of enkephalin. On the other hand, tynorphin tends to potentiate the facilitatory effects of enkephalin without use-dependent inhibition.",

Barnidipine monotherapy was the final treatment in 74% of patients in the ITT population (50% barnidipine 10 mg, 24% barnidipine 20 mg). The overall response rate was 84.1% at endpoint. Overall mean sitting DBP decreased by 18.4 mmHg from 102.1 mmHg at baseline to 83.7 mmHg at endpoint. Although a total of 82.2% of patients reported at least one adverse event, only 37.4% of patients experienced an adverse event that was possibly or probably related to the study medication.

Following a 4 week single-blind placebo runin, 315 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) of 95-115 mmHg and a systolic blood pressure of 150-200 mmHg were randomised to receive barnidipine 10 mg (n = 159) or HCTZ 12.5 mg (n = 155) once daily. In patients who had not responded (SiDBP > 90 mmHg) after 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, the dose was titrated upwards to barnidipine 20 mg or HCTZ 25 mg. After 18 weeks, those who did not respond to the higher dose had enalapril (up to 10 mg once daily) added to their regimen. Statistically equivalent reductions in SiDBP were achieved with barnidipine and HCTZ monotherapy. At week 18 of double-blind treatment on monotherapy, 84% of patients in both groups were responders. The addition of enalapril in non-responders produced a further reduction in blood pressure. Both drugs were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was greater in the barnidipine than HCTZ-treated group but they were consistent with vasodilation and were categorised as mild to moderate. In conclusion, barnidipine and HCTZ are well tolerated and have equivalent long-term antihypertensive efficacy in older hypertensive patients.

    "556": "After 8 weeks of treatment a decrease in systolic blood pressure in AH group was 24.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure 16.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P < 0.001). In the group with DM this decrease was 22.4 +/- 2.8 mm Hg and 15.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p < 0.001), respectively. In the group with nephropathy this decrease was 26.4 +/- 2.4 and 16.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001), respectively. Heart rate changed significantly only in diabetics: from 75.1 +/- 1.7 to 72.9 +/- 1.3 beats/min. Biochemical parameters in the hypertensive and diabetic patients did not change significantly. In the nephropathy group there was a significant decrease in creatinine and increase in creatinine clearance. Their level of glucose and potassium changed insignificantly.", 
    "557": "The treatment with quadropril results in a significant decrease in blood pressure, does not influence parameters of carbohydrate metabolism, improves nitrogen eliminating function of the kidneys.", 
    "558": "The evidence from recent clinical outcome trials in arterial hypertension (AH) and the treatment guidelines from national and international authorities have placed a clear emphasis on \"tight\" blood pressure (BP) control. This has been particularly well illustrated in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus and AH where \"tight\" BP control clearly improves the outcome with reduced numbers of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Whilst the clinical trials in AH have identified benefits through BP reduction with a range of antihypertensive drugs there is a considerable volume of evidence to suggest that the optimal treatment for diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria should be based upon ACE inhibition. It is widely held that inhibition of intra-renal renin angiotensin systems leads to greater benefit than can be achieved by hemodynamic changes alone. Thus, management of AH and nephropathy in both DM and other forms of renal disease revolves around BP reduction through an ACE inhibitor-based treatment regimen. Where there is renal failure it may be prudent to administer a drug such as spirapril which has non-renal elimination mechanisms and which has been shown to have no accumulation problems or increased adverse effects.",

    "563": "Elevated pulse pressure is an important cardiovascular risk factor in the elderly, and it remains to be determined whether this can be reversed. Drug treatment is justified in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension whose systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher on repeated measurement. Absolute benefit is greater in men, in patients aged 70 years or more, and in those with previous cardiovascular complications or greater pulse pressure. In the recently published comparative trials blood pressure gradients largely accounted for most, if not all, of the differences in outcome. In hypertensive patients, calcium-channel blockers may offer greater protection against stroke than against myocardial infarction, resulting in an overall cardiovascular benefit similar to that provided by older drug classes. The hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or alpha-blockers might influence outcome over and beyond that expected on the basis of their blood pressure lowering effects still remains to be proved.", 
    "564": "Ischemic nephropathy is a major cause of chronic renal failure in people over 50 years of age. In addition, renal artery stenosis is associated with increased mortality, particularly if renal or cardiac function is compromised. The diagnosis is made both by clinical characteristics and imaging studies. At present, duplex Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography appear to be the most promising non-invasive screening tests. Although data from controlled trials are lacking, revascularization is the mainstay of therapy for ischemic nephropathy. Advances in percutaneous interventions now allow revascularization to be offered to many patients, including those who are poor surgical candidates. The role of medical therapies (statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, intensive control of blood pressure) and how to best utilize revascularization (which patients and when) remain to be defined.",

Patients 65 years of age or older were less likely than their younger counterparts to be discharged on a beta-blocker (272 of 315 [86.3%] versus 305 of 333 [91.6%], P<0.04) and more likely to be discharged on a calcium channel blocker (70 of 315 [22.2%] versus 35 of 333 [10.5%], P<0.0001).

    "570": "In Ren-2 rats, plasma active renin and prorenin increase following binephrectomy (BNx) related to increasing plasma potassium. Adrenal is the source of the increasing prorenin but active renin comes mainly from thymus and gut. Trophic influences other than potassium were tested in the present work. Angiotensin did not influence the post-BNx increases in plasma active or prorenin but suppressed resting plasma prorenin from non-adrenal, non-renal sources virtually to zero. ACTH and histamine had no discernible effects. Hexamethonium decreased by 50% the post BNx increase in prorenin but not active renin. In Sprague-Dawley and spontaneously hypertensive rats, low levels of active renin secretion were detected from adrenal but no prorenin. Thus, in anesthetized Ren-2 rats, secreted prorenin is from two sources, i.e. extrarenal and extra-adrenal sites readily suppressible with angiotensin and the adrenal that is partly suppressible by autonomic blockage. This may assist in identifying the origin of extra-renal prorenin secreted in man.",

Since then, 3 large clinical trials showed important clinical benefits of beta-blockers in this population. Therefore, we designed the present study to establish whether in patients with heart failure already receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, the addition of pentoxifylline would have an additive beneficial effect.",

Primary end points were New York Heart Association functional class, exercise tolerance, and left ventricular function. Patients were followed up for 6 months. Five patients died (3 in the placebo group). Patients treated with pentoxifylline had a significant improvement in functional class compared with the placebo group (P:=0.01), with an increment in exercise time from 9.5+/-5 to 12.3+/-6 minutes (P:=0.1).

    "574": "This study investigated the effects of insulin therapy, inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation with aminoguanidine and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril on diabetes-related increases in protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat. PKC activity in the glomeruli, retina and mesenteric artery was increased by 1.5-2-fold after induction of diabetes, and this increase was maintained over 24 weeks. Treatment with insulin at 2 units or 6 units per day attenuated glomerular PKC in proportion to the level of glycohaemoglobin after 4 weeks of diabetes (r=0.68, P<0.0001). The higher dose of insulin prevented the diabetes-related increase in glomerular PKC activity, although blood glucose levels were not normalized. After 8 weeks of diabetes, ramipril completely prevented the diabetes-related increases in PKC activity in the glomeruli, retina and mesenteric artery. By contrast, aminoguanidine treatment resulted in no inhibition of glomerular PKC activity, partial inhibition of retinal PKC activity and complete inhibition of mesenteric artery PKC activity. After 24 weeks of diabetes, both aminoguanidine and ramipril prevented the diabetes-related increases in PKC activity in all three tissues, in parallel with suppression of albuminuria by both agents. Aminoguanidine also prevented diabetes-related increases in retinal permeability at 16 weeks. These results suggest that the organ-protective effects of insulin, aminoguanidine and ramipril in diabetes may be mediated, at least in part, through the differential inhibition of PKC activity in various tissues.",

Open-label hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 or 25 mg was added if needed according to a prespecified titration rule. Men and women aged > 18 years with mild to moderate hypertension (morning mean supine DBP [SDBP] > or = 95 mm Hg and < or = 114 mm Hg) were eligible to participate. Patients with significant cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded. The primary efficacy end point was trough SDBP response at 26 weeks; secondary efficacy end points included changes from baseline at trough in both standing and supine DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate after 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks; SBP control (reduction from baseline of > or = 10 mm Hg); normalization of supine SDBP to < or = 90 mm Hg; and the need for add-on HCTZ. Changes in quality of life were also examined. Adverse events were obtained from spontaneous reporting and recorded. Serious adverse events were reported to the sponsor according to predefined timelines.",

Of the 533 patients randomly assigned to treatment and included in the safety analysis, 520 (97.6%) were included in the efficacy analysis; 346 received telmisartan and 174 received atenolol. A total of 489 patients (91.7%) completed the study (325 [93.9%], telmisartan; 164 [94.2%], atenolol). Full SDBP response (trough SDBP < or = 90 mm Hg and/or a reduction from baseline of > or = 10 mm Hg) was observed in 84% and 78% of telmisartan- and atenolol-treated patients, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant. Final SBP/DBP reductions of 20.9/14.4 mm Hg were observed for the telmisartan regimen versus 16.7/13.3 mm Hg for the atenolol regimen; only the difference in SBP was significant (P = 0.005). Reduction from baseline in SBP of > or = 10 mm Hg was achieved by 80% of telmisartan-treated and 68% of atenolol-treated patients (P = 0.003). Adverse events were reported by 52.7% of patients given telmisartan and 61.2% of patients given atenolol; this difference was not statistically significant. Most events were mild or moderate. Although fatigue and male impotence were more common in atenolol-treated patients (3.4% and 4.0%, respectively), the incidence of these adverse events was too low to differentiate statistically.",

    "579": "Verapamil SR (180 mg) plus trandolapril (2 mg) is a potent antihypertensive combination but the efficacy and safety of this treatment has not been studied fully in hypertensive patients with metabolic disorders. We enrolled 298 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who had at least one of the following disorders: diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia or mild renal failure. The sitting systolic pressure and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure was inadequately controlled in only 24 patients (8.8%). Progressive decreases in blood glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels were observed during the study. There was no significant change in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and transaminase levels (p > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in microalbuminuria levels. There was no significant change in glycosylated haemoglobin levels in diabetic patients. Verapamil SR plus trandolapril is an effective drug combination in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used safely in patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and mild renal failure.", 
    "580": "Aldosterone escape during chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may contribute to the high mortality among patients with heart failure. Aldosterone exerts several detrimental effects in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, has proved beneficial when added to ACE inhibitors in patients with severe heart failure. However, spironolactone has substantial side effects mostly due to anti-androgen and anti-progestagen actions. This may limit its use in less severe heart failure. Recently, more selective aldosterone antagonists have been developed, which appear to have the same potential as spironolactone with fewer side effects. Trials to assess efficacy of these drugs in hypertension and mild heart failure are now being started.", 
    "581": "Hypertension is the most common of the cardiovascular risk factors. Although its risks have been known for decades, hypertension remains inadequately diagnosed and undertreated. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, including the role of the renin-angiotensin system, has led to the development of new approaches for patient management. Compared with traditional antihypertension treatments, angiotensin II receptor antagonists may offer more effective treatment and an improved side effect profile. These agents also may have an important treatment role in other cardiovascular conditions for which ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed. As clinical trial data are showing, the full potential of these drugs has yet to be determined.", 
    "582": "Persistent dry cough is an occasional but clinically important adverse reaction to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI). Its reported incidence is variable, and why cough occurs in only certain individuals has been unclear. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with serum ACE activity. We have previously shown that susceptibility to cough induced by ACEI is associated with this polymorphism such that patients with genotype II are more susceptible to cough than patients with other genotypes. In order to confirm and extend our previous observation, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 10 healthy volunteers with genotype II and 10 with genotype DD. The cough threshold was determined by the concentration of inhaled capsaicin causing two or more coughs. After the usage of an ACEI, cilazapril, for 4 weeks, changes in the cough threshold in subjects with genotype II [before: 6.6+/-3.7 nM (mean+/-SD); after: 5.0+/-4.6 nM] significantly differed from those in subjects with genotype DD (before: 9.0+/-9.4 nM; after: 9.3+/-9.1 nM). Skin responses to intradermal bradykinin, which is a substrate of ACE and tussigenic, were significantly increased in subjects with genotype II (before: 1.6+/-0.6 vs. after: 2.6+/-0.5 cm2, P<0.05) but not in subjects with genotype DD (before: 1.4+/-0.5 vs. after: 1.6+/-0.6 cm2, n.s.) after usage of cilazapril. By contrast, skin responses to intradermal substance P did not change in subjects with either genotype. These findings provide further evidence of a link between ACEI-induced cough and I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and suggest that ACEIs induce cough by modulating the tissue level of bradykinin.",

After three weeks, there was a slight but not significant increase in time to 0.1 mV ST depression in both groups (p = NS); rate pressure product (RPP = heart rate x systolic blood pressure) was also unaffected. After 12 weeks, however, time to 0.1 mV ST depression further increased in the enalapril group (5.6 +/- 1.9 min) but was unchanged in the placebo group (4.4 +/- 1.3 min; p < 0.05 between groups).

In addition to this combination therapy, beta-blockers were started in all patients. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R1 and R2) were measured at baseline and 12 weeks after the initiation of beta-blocker therapy. We also measured plasma levels of neurohumoral factors, as well as left ventricular (LV) size and function. Ten age-matched subjects with no cardiac disease served as the control group.", 
    "591": "Baseline levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha and sTNF-R2 were significantly higher in patients with DCM than in control subjects (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels (r = 0.545, p = 0.029). The TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio correlated well with plasma epinephrine levels (r = 0.677, p = 0.025), and the level of sTNF-R2 was closely related to LV size. Serum levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha and sTNF-R2 were significantly decreased during beta-blocker therapy (p < 0.005).",

    "594": "In CHF, hydrostatic overload causes disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane and depression of carbon monoxide diffusion (DCO); enalapril improves DCO through mechanisms still undefined; and saline infusion in the pulmonary circulation worsens DCO, putatively because of an upregulated sodium transport to the alveolar interstitium. We investigated whether enalapril modulates sodium handling and whether losartan shares the same properties.", 
    "595": "In 29 patients with CHF, DCO, its membrane diffusion subcomponent (DM) and right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures were monitored during saline infusion, in the control condition, during enalapril therapy (20 mg/day) for two weeks and after crossover to losartan (50 mg/day) for two weeks (first 20 patients), or after the combination of enalapril with aspirin (325 mg/day) for one week (last 9 patients).", 
    "596": "Saline, 150 ml, lowered DCO (-7.9%; p < 0.01) and DM (-9.9%; p < 0.01) without hydrostatic variations. Responses to 750 ml of saline were qualitatively similar. After treatment with enalapril, baseline DCO (p < 0.01) and DM (p < 0.01) were augmented; after sodium loading, the percent reductions of DCO (p < 0.01) and DM (p < 0.01) were comparable to those before it, resulting in higher absolute values. This suggests that the greater the gas conductance improvement with enalapril, the lower the impedance with saline. Losartan was ineffective on gas transfer at rest and under salt challenge. Aspirin counteracted the benefits of enalapril.",

Inhibitory peptides for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) having anti-hypertensive effect have been isolated from enzymatic digests of various food proteins. LKPNM, which was isolated from the thermolysin digest of dried bonito was activated 8-fold by ACE itself and showed a prolonged effect after oral administration. Two vasorelaxing peptides, ovokinin and ovokinin(2-7), showing antihypertensive effect after oral administration were obtained from ovalbumin digests. We found that low molecular weight peptides derived from food proteins lowered serum cholesterol without increasing excretion of cholesterol and bile acids.

On October 21, 1998, he was admitted because of remittent fever and multiple arthralgia and diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) was made. He was also found to have hypertension of 210/110 mmHg, and soon developed ptosis of the eye, facial paresis and perceptive deafness of the right side. Cerebrospinal fluid showed protein of 98 mg/dl and mildly elevated IgG, IgA and IgM levels with normal cell count. Brain MRI examination revealed multiple cerebral lesions in the frontal, parietal and cerebellar areas on the right, whose cause was thought to be vasculitis. Renal angiography demonstrated a right renal artery stenosis, compatible with renovascular hypertension. He was treated with 60 mg of prednisolone per day, which brought about a satisfactory improvement of the above rheumatic and neurologic signs. On November 17, 1998, he received a follow-up study of MRI, which failed to show any cerebral lesions, supporting the effectiveness of prednisolone.

The articles were classified into four different groups. Groups 1 and 2 give proper references to the defined daily doses (DDDs) used in the studies, either by full reference to the version of the ATC Index with DDDs or by listing the actual DDDs used. The articles in groups 1 and 2 represent 46% of the articles in the survey. The articles classified in groups 3 and 4 give references only to general articles about the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification (ATC)/DDD system or no references at all. Fifty-four percent of the articles in the survey were classified in these groups. In these articles it is not possible to identify which DDDs have been used in the presentation of drug consumption data.", 
    "606": "According to the results from our literature survey, it is not common practice to include the ATC codes and the DDD values used or to make reference to the versions of the ATC/DDD index used when results from drug utilisation studies are published. One possible reason for this might be little or no knowledge about the ATC/DDD system as a dynamic system in which alterations are made annually. The lack of references to the actual DDDs used in the studies make comparisons between different data sets difficult and misleading.", 
    "607": "Aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are often associated for the treatment of coronary disease and/or chronic heart failure, but conclusions of some prospective and retrospective studies show a possible negative interaction between aspirin and ACEIs. ACEIs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and also the catabolism of bradykinin, which results in increased synthesis of vasodilatory agents [prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO)], whereas aspirin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. Thus, a potential interaction from the opposing effects of aspirin and ACEIs could affect the metabolism of bradykinin. We conducted an extensive Medline search, as well as a manual search, of published literature including pharmacodynamic studies and clinical trials concerning the impact of aspirin on the effect of ACEIs in hypertension, coronary disease and chronic heart failure. A review of this literature shows five studies in hypertension (all prospective and using blood pressure as the main criterion of assessment), five in coronary disease (three retrospective and two prospective trials, four of which use mortality as the criterion of assessment) and 13 in chronic heart failure (eight using haemodynamic measurements of which seven are prospective--one prospective study using pulmonary tests, four using clinical events including mortality as criterion of assessment of which two are prospective). The counteraction of ACEI efficacy by aspirin is demonstrated in one out of five studies in hypertension, one out of four of studies in coronary disease and nine out of thirteen in chronic heart failure. This counteraction is more often observed with high dosages of aspirin (greater than 250 mg/day, four out of six studies) and less often with lower dosages (less than or equal to 250 mg/day, three out of 11 studies). These studies are retrospective analyses or use haemodynamic end-points, so there is as yet no methodological argument strong enough to contraindicate the aspirin-ACEI association or to prove the clinical relevance of this interaction. In conclusion, prospective studies using mortality as a criterion of assessment are needed to offer the practitioner the answer to the question of ACEI-aspirin association.", 
    "608": "The most recent published guidelines regarding management of patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) advocate the administration of aspirin (ASA), beta blockers (BB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and discourages the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCB).

    "612": "In recent years, much attention has been given to end organ protection by antihypertensive, anti-heart failure, and anti-ischemic medications. This review describes the available information on end organ protection by calcium-channel blockers (CCBs). In normotensive patients and patients with hypertension treated with long-acting dihydropyridines, medial thickness was thinner than in patients treated with atenolol or in untreated hypertensive patients. Long-term treatment was associated with significant reduction in left ventricular mass. Calcium-channel blockers also improved endothelial-dependent relaxation and reversed the vasoconstrictive response to nitric oxide inhibitors. In diabetic patients, CCBs were effective in preserving kidney function and microalbuminurea. The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and CCBs was more effective than ACE inhibitors alone in preserving kidney function. In animal experiments, CCBs prevented development of coronary atheroschlerosis; however, in humans only limited data are available on their antiatherogenic effect. Some studies suggest that CCBs exert antiplatelets properties and may therefore be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "613": "The estimation of the volume-weighted mean nuclear volume, nu(nu), and the numerical nuclear density in the plane, N(A), was used to analyze cardiomyocyte nuclei in the condition of cardiac hypertrophy caused by nitric oxide (NO) synthesis blockade and simultaneous antihypertensive treatment for 40 days (four groups of ten rats each: control, L-NAME, L-NAME+enalapril, L-NAME+verapamil). The blood pressure (BP) increased 71% in the L-NAME group. In the L-NAME+enalapril and L-NAME+verapamil groups, the BP did not show any alteration when compared with the respective controls. In comparison with the control group, nu(nu) was 250% greater, and the N(A) was 25% smaller in the L-NAME animals, while no difference occurred in the other two groups. With respect to cardiomyocyte nuclear size, the present results suggest a beneficial effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the calcium channel blocker verapamil when NO synthesis is blockaded.", 
    "614": "Using Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) that exhibits hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, the role of local angiotensin II in cardiovascular complications at early stages of NIDDM was characterized. OLETF rats were given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle from the age of 5 weeks to 20 weeks. Arteriolar, intermediate and venular capillary proportions were determined by the double-staining method and levels of collagen and non-collagenous proteins were determined by the selective dye-binding method in heart tissues. In OLETF rats at 20 weeks of age, capillary network remodeling (i.e., an increase in arteriolar portions and a decrease in venular portions) and an increase in collagen content were detected. Cilazapril not only exerted favorable effects on markers of diabetes, but also prevented capillary network remodeling and ameliorated the increase in collagen content. These results suggest that 1) capillary network remodeling and increase in extracellular matrix protein levels precede the onset of overt NIDDM in OLETF rats, and 2) angiotensin II may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac complications in the early stages of NIDDM.", 
    "615": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of E-3174, a human active metabolite of the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, on hemodynamic functions in dogs with severe heart failure (HF). In dogs, insignificant plasma levels of E-3174 are present following administration of losartan, and therefore, the effects of these two drugs can be studied independently in the dog. HF was established by rapid pacing of the right ventricle (250-270 beats/min) for 4 weeks. We examined changes in cardiovascular functions after acute intravenous administration of losartan (1 mg/kg) and E-3174 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg), as well as an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (0.3 and 1 mg/kg), under condition of HF. The HF before treatment was characterized by increases in pre- and after-load of the left ventricle (LV), consequent low cardiac output, and LV dilatation. E-3174 at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg reduced pulmonary artery pressure (-13+/-6% and -22+/-3% from baseline, respectively, p<0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-18+/-4% and -36+/-10%, p<0.05) and mean arterial pressure (-24+/-2% and -36+/-7%, p<0.05), increased stroke volume (SV: +12+/-7% p>0.05; +36 +/-19%, p<0.05), and reduced peripheral resistance (-23+/-5% and -41+/-9%, p<0.05), but had no effect on the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt/P) or the time constant for relaxation. Effects of losartan at 1 mg/kg were similar to those of 0.3 mg/kg of E-3174. Enalapril at 1 mg/kg caused changes comparable to those seen after E-3174 administration (1 mg/kg), except that the increase in SV (+16+/-8%, p<0.05) with enalapril was not as great as that with E-3174. Both losartan at 1 mg/kg and E-3174 at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg increased fractional shortening to a similar extent (FS: +52+/-12%, +47+/-8% and +56+/-8%), while enalapril at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg had no significant effects on FS. Reflex elevation of plasma renin activity induced by 1 mg/kg of E-3174 was similar to that caused by 1 mg/kg of enalapril, suggesting that the two drugs achieved similar inhibition of the endogenous renin angiotensin system. Our study demonstrated that acute blockade of the AT1 receptor with E-3174 reduced elevated pre- and after-load and consequently increased stroke volume in a canine HF model. With the exception of changes in stroke volume, these effects of E-3174 were comparable to those produced by enalapril, and were 3 times stronger than those by losartan.",

The aim of this study was to assess the validity of home-measured BP for monitoring and controlling patients with arterial hypertension while on a homogeneous treatment. An additional objective was to establish the degree of office BP control obtained. This was a prospective, longitudinal, observational and multicenter study in a cohort of 156 patients of both sexes, aged over 18 years and with essential hypertension. All of them received the fixed combination enalapril/HCTZ 20/6 mg as the only hypertensive agent for at least 4 weeks previously. Office BP was the average of three measurements. For home BP, a semi-automated device (OMRON HEM 705 CP) was used. The patients measured their BP twice a day for 2 consecutive days. The average differences between the two measuring methods were low, but significant: 3.99 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP; p < 0.05), 2.02 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP; p < 0.05). Pearson's regression coefficient between the office and home values was highly significant (p < 0.0001) for SBP, DBP and heart rate.

The percentage of patients with strict office DBP and SBP control (< 140/90 mmHg) was 61.3% and with DBP control (<90 mmHg) 92%.

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured by a constant infusion technique. The reference substances used were [131I]iodohippurate (Hippuran) and [125I]iothalamate. The lithium clearance method was used for measuring renal water and sodium handling. Microalbuminuria was measured. A subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken and the media thickness to lumen diameter ratio of small resistance vessels was determined. Left ventricular mass index was determined by echocardiography. Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with regimens based upon either isradipine, perindopril or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride. Atenolol and hydralazine were added as secondary and tertiary drugs, respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. Investigations were performed before and after 9 months of normalization of blood pressure. Renal function in untreated hypertensive patients was characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal blood flow, normal glomerular filtration fraction and normal serum creatinine. No association was found between peripheral resistance vessel structure in subcutaneous vessels and renal hemodynamic parameters. Patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass >360 g) had lower glomerular filtration fraction, greater renal vascular resistance, lower renal blood flow and increased microalbuminuria in comparison with patients with less pronounced cardiac changes. After 1 year of treatment, which had a profound effect on heart and vessel structure, renal hemodynamics were unchanged in patients receiving antihypertensive treatment regimens based on the ACE inhibitor perindopril or the Ca-antagonist isradipine, whereas renal plasma flow was reduced, glomerular filtration rate preserved and filtration fraction significantly increased in those treated with a regimen based on diuretics. The serum creatinine concentration was decreased in the former group, whereas it was unchanged in the latter two.

Because of the similar localization and regulation of nNOS and COX-2 expression, we have examined whether there is a functional interrelationship between the expression of the two enzymes. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed for 1 week either a low-salt diet (0.02% w/w) which produced moderate increases of nNOS and COX-2 expression, or low salt combined with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg per day), which produced strong increases of renocortical nNOS and COX-2 expressions. To inhibit nNOS or COX-2 activities, animals received in addition N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/kg per day) or rofecoxib (10 mg/kg per day) for 1 week, respectively. L-NAME treatment did not change COX-2 expression and conversely rofecoxib treatment did not change nNOS expression in the kidney cortex under any experimental conditions. L-NAME but not rofecoxib attenuated renin mRNA levels. Rofecoxib markedly reduced renal prostanoid excretion. These findings suggest that under these conditions the control of nNOS and COX-2 gene expression in the macula densa regions of the kidney cortex are not dependent on each other.",

    "642": "To determine whether effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on well-established pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and coronary remodeling depend upon normal plasma renin levels, the influence of enalapril on ventricular mass and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) was determined in a low-renin female rat model of chronic pressure overload, (deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertension, DOCA), and compared to its effect in a normal-renin model, (aortic construction, AC). Six weeks after experiment initiation, plasma renin activity of DOCA-treated rats was reduced to approximately 12% that of sham-treated and AC-treated groups. Enalapril was then added to the drinking water of half the animals in each group for two additional weeks. Comparing experimental groups to controls, this delayed enalapril treatment had 1) no effect on the elevated arterial pressures, 2) no effect on the elevated coronary resistance, and, in the DOCA group, 3) no effect on cardiac hypertrophy. However, this brief enalapril treatment reduced absolute and relative ventricular weights of AC rats. These data suggest that circulating renin is required for the anti-hypertrophic efficacy of late-onset brief treatment with enalapril. Since enalapril-induced reversal of cardiac hypertrophy in AC rats was not accompanied by reversal of coronary remodeling, growth signals other than angiotensin II may be involved in coronary remodeling.",

Two studies were conducted. Both were single dose, crossover design with or without a 2.4 g dose of sevelamer in healthy volunteers. Within each study, there was a 7-day washout interval between the two dose administrations. There were 28 volunteers in the enalapril study and 32 in the metoprolol study. The mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles of enalapril, enalaprilat, and metoprolol were not altered by the simultaneous administration of sevelamer. Values for the ratio of ln[AUC(0-infinity)], ln[AUC(0-t)], and ln(Cmax] with and without sevelamer were approximately 100%, and the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of these parameters with and without sevelamer were within the 80% to 125% range in all cases except for the ln[Cmax] of enalapril, which had an upper confidence bound of 125.4%.

In this study, we examined the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on beta1-peptide-induced cardiomyopathy. Rabbits were divided into four groups: (1) control group (n= 6) receiving saline injection; (2) beta1-peptide group (n = 8) immunized with beta1-peptide; (3) ACEI group (n = 6), lisinopril (3 mg/day) given orally and receiving saline injection; and (4) ACEI + beta1-peptide group (n = 7), lisinopril (3 mg/day) given orally and immunized with beta1-peptide. Our results showed that, after 1 year, all rabbits in the beta1-peptide group had an increase in heart weight, wall thinning and dilatations of both ventricles as compared with rabbits in the ACEI + beta1-peptide group that had normal heart weight and shape. All rabbits in the beta1-peptide group exhibited multifocal degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells with moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells. In the ACEI + beta1-peptide group, three rabbits showed focal degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells accompanied by mononuclear cells. The lesions in this group were apparently less marked than those in the beta1-peptide group. In conclusion, ACEI protects the myocardium from injury induced by an autoimmune mechanism against beta1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "645": "Angiotensin II has an important role in the structural and functional regulation of the cardiovascular and renal systems. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can be achieved with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and non-peptidic, orally active, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) antagonists. However, the question that has yet to be answered is whether ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists have similar renoprotective effects in various experimental diseases. Although many studies have assessed the role of either ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists, we have reviewed the literature comparing both types of blocker in the same experiment. In most models of hypertension or renal failure, both classes of blocker appear to have similar antihypertensive and renal profiles. In a few models, the influence of the ACE inhibitor on arterial pressure and/or renal function is more marked than that of the AT1 receptor antagonist. Even though the maximum dose-effect curve for each compound was not often carried out for the systemic haemodynamics and renal alterations, the difference between both classes of blocker, when observed, appeared to favour the participation of non-angiotensin II or non-AT1-mediated mechanisms. Among them are the stimulation of prostaglandin production, kinin accumulation, nitric oxide generation and modulation of endothelin or TGFbeta1 expression via direct or indirect pathways. Future experimental and probably human studies aimed at comparing angiotensin II receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors, with respect to blood pressure and renal damage, should be designed with all these concerns in mind.", 
    "646": "Oral sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), which is a common complaint for patients with hypertension and those taking antihypertensive agents. This post hoc subanalysis assessed the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in men with ED who were receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication. Efficacy was assessed in 3414 men (1218 of whom were taking antihypertensive medication) who received sildenafil (5 to 200 mg) or placebo for 6 weeks to 6 months in 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The significant improvements in erectile function demonstrated by sildenafil-treated patients were comparable in patients taking and those not taking antihypertensive medication. Safety was assessed in 3975 men (1094 of whom were taking one or more antihypertensive agent, classified as a diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha1-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker), who received sildenafil or placebo in 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For patients taking sildenafil and antihypertensive medication, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (34%) was similar to that for sildenafil-treated patients not taking any antihypertensive agent (38%). The incidences of the most common adverse events and of adverse events potentially related to blood pressure decreases (eg, hypotension, dizziness, and syncope) were similar in both sildenafil groups. The number of antihypertensive medications taken from among the five classes had no effect on the adverse event profile of sildenafil. Sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in patients taking concomitant antihypertensive medication, including those on multidrug regimens.", 
    "647": "The development of hypertension is accompanied by rarefaction of arterioles and capillaries in both animal models and humans. Although many studies have examined the effects of antihypertensive therapies on hemodynamics, cardiac hypertrophy, and large vessel structure, the question of whether changes in microvascular density induced by hypertension can be restored by pharmacologic treatment has yet to be answered. We report a series of experiments performed in rats with renovascular hypertension induced by unilateral nephrectomy and renal artery stenosis (Goldblatt one-kidney, one-clip model). Animals were treated for 4 weeks, after renal artery clipping, either with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril [PER], 0.76 mg/kg/day), or with an indol derivative diuretic with specific vascular properties (indapamide [IDP], 0.24 mg/kg/day) or with the combination of both drugs at the same doses as during monotherapy. Coronary microvessel densities (arterioles and capillaries) were evaluated by double immunolabeling in nonserial cryostat sections of the left ventricular inner myocardium. After 4 weeks of hypertension (mean arterial pressure, 174+/-11 v 124+/-5 mm Hg in normotensive (NT) controls, P < .01), cardiac hypertrophy (+59%, P < .001) was associated with a significant increase in myocardial arteriolar density (+27%, P < .01), and a decrease in capillary density (-12%, P < .05). Treatment with PER prevented the increase in arterial pressure, heart weight, and arteriolar density, but did not significantly affect the low coronary capillary density in comparison with that measured in untreated hypertensive (HT) rats. Treatment with IDP preserved normal capillary myocardial density but did not significantly lower the blood pressure (BP) (169+/-9 mm Hg) and only slightly reduced the cardiac ventricular hypertrophy: - 14% v untreated HT (P < .05) and +37% v NT (P < .01). In the same way, IDP normalized the left ventricular capillary density in spontaneously HT rats (+18% v untreated rats, P < .01). The combination of both drugs, PER and IDP, at the same low doses as during monotherapy, resulted in normal levels of arterial pressure and complete normalization of cardiac hypertrophy and arteriolar and capillary myocardial densities. In conclusion, the results observed after PER suggest that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system could inhibit large coronary vessel growth but minimally affects the capillary density despite complete normalization of BP. Indapamide could have beneficial effect on myocardial capillary density. The combination of IDP and PER has additional effects and prevents the increase in BP and cardiac weight, and reverses microvascular rarefaction, specifically arteriolar and capillary densities.",

In this study AT1 receptor blockade was started at the same time points to evaluate whether this had an effect superior to ACE inhibition. SHRSP drank 1% NaCl. Group 1 served as controls. Group 2 and 3 rats were started on losartan and enalapril after proteinuria exceeded 40 mg/day. Group 4 and 5 rats were started on losartan and enalapril after the first observation of cerebral edema with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. In controls, median survival was 54 days (range, 35 to 80 days) after the start of salt loading. With early-onset losartan and enalapril, survival increased to 305 days (range, 184 to 422 days) and 320 days (range, 134 to 368 days) (both P < .01 v group 1). Cerebral edema formation was prevented in all but two rats, one from each treatment modality. Development of proteinuria was markedly reduced. With late-onset treatment with losartan and enalapril, survival was 290 days (range, 120 to 367 days) and 264 days (range, 154 to 319 days) (both P < .01). Both losartan and enalapril decreased cerebral edema to baseline levels. Ultimately cerebral edema reoccurred, despite continued treatment, in 75% of the rats. Systolic blood pressure did not decrease after losartan treatment, but, similarly to early-onset treatment, decreased transiently after enalapril treatment. Cerebral edema and proteinuria were prevented and reduced in SHRSP treated with either an AT1 receptor antagonist or an ACE inhibitor. Survival was markedly and similarly prolonged by both treatments, whether initiated directly before or after development of cerebral edema. In rats where treatment was initiated after manifestation of cerebral edema, both cerebral edema and proteinuria reappeared despite continued treatment. Apparently, when hypertension is sustained, reappearance of target organ damage may not be entirely dependent on angiotensin.", 
    "649": "Relationship between serum ACE activity and mean blood pressure (MAP) after administration of a single oral dose of the ACE inhibitor enalapril 10 and 20 mg tablets was investigated in 19 Iranian normotensive male subjects. Enalapril at doses, which maximally inhibit ACE activity, reduced MAP dose dependently. The t(max) of ACE inhibition decreased significantly by increasing the enalapril doses, but t(max) of MAP reduction did not change by increasing the dose. The AUC (area under the curve) of ACE inhibition versus time was significantly larger in 20 mg enalapril group compare to 10mg enalapril group (p<0.001). A significant correlation was found between log of residual ACE activity and MAP (r=0.4927; p<0.001). It is concluded that in Iranian normal subjects, after administration of a single oral dose of enalapril, MAP related to residual ACE activity.",

A 249 nm wavelength was chosen as the isosbestic point in the absorbance ratio method, and the absorbance ratios A236/A249 nm for BNZ and A269/A249 nm for HCT were used for calculation of regression equations. For the Vierordt method, A1(1) values (%1.1 cm) obtained at 236 and 269 nm for both substances were used for quantitative analyses of BNZ and HCT. In the HPLC method, simultaneous determination of BNZ and HCT from dissolution medium was achieved using the mobile phase containing phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.2) and acetonitrile (65:35) on a Supelcocil LC-18 (4.6 x 250, 5.6 mm) reversed phase column. Dissolution tests of commercial tablets were carried out according to USP XXII paddle method in 0.1 N HCl at 50 rpm at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C.

In protocol II, ACE mRNA and activity were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S on regular or high salt treated with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) Fab fragments blocking brain 'ouabain' or gamma-globulins, and in Dahl R on high or regular salt ACE mRNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and angiotensin I and II by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography. In protocol III, effects of i.c.v. angiotensin I and i.c.v. bradykinin on renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), heart rate and blood pressure before and after i.c.v. captopril were assessed in Dahl S and R rats on regular or high salt intake from 4-8 weeks of age.",

Dahl S rats showed small but significant increases in ACE mRNA in the hypothalamus on regular salt diet. In Dahl S rats on high salt diet for 2 or 5 weeks ACE mRNA levels significantly increased in both hypothalamus and pons, compared with Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S rats on regular diet. After 5 weeks of high salt diet, ACE mRNA levels in the hypothalamus in Dahl S rats were almost three-fold higher and in the pons two-fold higher than in Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S on regular salt diet. High salt diet also increased ACE activity of the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S but not Dahl R. Consistent with this increased ACE activity, central responses to angiotensin I were clearly enhanced and to bradykinin markedly diminished in Dahl S on high salt intake. Chronic blockade of brain 'ouabain' by i.c.v. Fab fragments prevented the increases in blood pressure, ACE mRNA and activity in the hypothalamus and pons by high salt intake in Dahl S rats. Angiotensin I levels in the hypothalamus and pons were similar in both groups of rats and there were no significant changes caused by high salt diet in Dahl S and R rats. On regular salt intake angiotensin II levels in the hypothalamus of Dahl S rats showed a significant decrease as compared with Dahl R rats on regular salt diet, and were similar in the pons of the two strains. High salt intake did not affect angiotensin II levels in either hypothalamus or pons in Dahl S and R rats.",

The present study examined the ratio of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to chymase-dependent Ang II formation in various isolated vessels from monkeys, dogs and rats. In all of the examined vessels, the addition of KCl at a concentration of 50 mM could induce a maximal contraction. Except for monkey coronary artery and rat renal and femoral artery, the addition of Ang I could induce transitory contractions, whereas the force of contractions in these vessels was quite different. The sensitivity to Ang II in these vessels was similar to that for Ang I. In monkey gastroepiploic and mesenteric arteries, about 70% of the Ang I-induced contraction was suppressed by chymase inhibition, while it was suppressed about 50% in monkey renal, femoral and carotid arteries. In dog renal arteries, about 65% of the Ang I-induced contraction was suppressed by chymase inhibition, while it was suppressed by about 30% in other dog arteries. In contrast, in all rat arteries, Ang I-induced contractions were completely suppressed by treatment with ACE inhibitor alone. We concluded that regional differences in the response to Ang I exist in vascular tissues, and the ratio of ACE- to chymase-dependent Ang II formation is different in the various vessels.", 
    "678": "Recent findings on the use of beta-adrenergic blockers in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are reviewed. CHF is a progressive, debilitating disease that afflicts 4.6 million patients in the United States. Treatment has traditionally consisted of a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and digoxin. Despite advances in ACE-inhibitor therapy, the five-year mortality rate remains nearly 50%. Overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system is believed to contribute to mortality. Beta-blockers have recently been added to the standard of care for patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were recently completed that addressed the benefits of beta-blockers in CHF. The overall mortality rate was reduced 65% by carvedilol, 34% by metoprolol, and 33% by bisoprolol; all these reductions were significant compared with placebo, and the trials were ended early. Bucindolol, however, did not have a significant effect on mortality. These drugs are hepatically metabolized and may require dosage adjustment in hepatically impaired patients. Decompensation of heart failure is another consideration; a beta-blocker should be added only for patients with stable CHF. Dosages must be slowly adjusted to targeted levels. Adverse effects do not differ significantly among beta-blockers. In addition to their effect on mortality, beta-blockers reduce CHF-related morbidity, such as all-cause hospitalization. Carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with CHF and can be used with limited adverse effects. The choice among these agents does not affect clinical outcomes; bucindolol, however, has proven ineffective.", 
    "679": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, and a component of this ameliorative effect has been attributed to accumulation of kinins in cardiac tissues. However, little is known regarding the levels of kallikrein-kinin components in the heart during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The objectives of the present study were to define the effects of pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy on cardiac levels of kininogen, kallikrein and bradykinin B2 receptor mRNAs. The pressure-overload induced by aortic constriction produced cardiac hypertrophy in mice after 14 and 28d, assessed from the increased ratios of heart weight to body weight and elevation of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA in the heart. B2 receptor mRNA rapidly decreased in the heart within 7 d after the operation, subsequently returning to those of sham-operated animals. In contrast, levels of both low-molecular-weight kininogen and tissue kallikrein mRNAs were increased 7, 14 and 28 d after aortic constriction. These findings suggest that the mechanical load or stretch in cardiac tissue by pressue-overload rapidly produces the downregulation of B2 receptor expression during the initial stage which may allow the promotion of cardiac hypertrophy induced by a mediation of hypertophic factors such as angiotensin II, while upregulation of kininogen and kallikrein mRNAs during the chronic stage may lead to an enhancement of local kinin generation in the heart, from which further progression of cardiac hypertrophy during later stages may be regulated.",

Nevertheless some questions have arisen. On the one hand the generalizability of these trial results, particularly for older persons with serious medical comorbidities and poor functional status, is not clear. On the other hand different antihypertensive drugs have shown to be effective. Which drug for which patient? Even data from randomised intervention trials showing that the treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, were missing, ACE inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure. For a younger population the captopril prevention project showed no differences between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blocker) concerning the primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular death). The STOP-2 study also confirmed these results for elderly patients. When treating elderly patients one must be aware of physiological changes with age and the comorbidities. Of significance among this patient group is declining renal function. Admissions for uraemia that are related to the use of ACE inhibitors are still commonplace, although many cases are preventable by monitoring renal function, but guidelines are still missing. Concerning the comorbidities ACE inhibitors have benefits compared to other antihypertensive drugs, especially in cases of heart failure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.",

Male Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (Li) or control diet (C) for 16 weeks postnatally. Li-treated rats developed renal failure, hypertension and proteinuria. During the subsequent 24 weeks, subgroups were treated with ACEI. The kidneys were fixed by perfusion, and tissue blocks were serially cut for estimation of glomerular volume and glomerular characteristics by light microscopy. Mesangial and mesangial matrix volume fractions, surface density of capillary walls, basement membrane thickness and foot process width (FPW) were measured by electron microscopy. Glomerular volume was decreased in Li-rats, with increased intra-individual variation. In all Li-rats, some glomeruli (mean 27%) were abnormal, with severe changes in only three rats. Ultrastructural parameters obtained by systematic sampling of three glomeruli in each rat showed no differences among groups. Among Li-treated animals there was a significant correlation between FPW and albumin excretion per unit filtration surface, and between filtration surface per glomerulus and inulin clearance. In conclusion, long-term lithium administration to newborn rats caused marked changes in glomerular volume which were not associated with measurable changes in structural parameters.

The initial evaluation failed to reveal any underlying monoclonal gammopathy, or cryoglobulinemia, or other systemic causes for the renal disease. A percutaneous renal biopsy was consistent with immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG), which is rare in children and is characterized histologically by fibrillar deposits in the glomeruli. Children can present with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome and progress to end stage renal disease. Our patient was treated with an ACE inhibitor and is currently free of edema and with normal renal function on follow-up at 1 year. Immunotactoid glomerulopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children with sickle cell disease. Renal biopsy is indicated in children with sickle cell disease and nephrotic syndrome and ITG should be considered as potential cause. Although there is no effective treatment for this condition, ACE inhibitors can decrease the protein-uria and possibly delay the progression to end stage renal disease. The side effects related to the use of ACE inhibitors should be monitored. These include renal impairment, hyperkalemia, anemia, neutropenia, and angioedema. Since we have a short follow-up in our patient, the role and safety of ACE inhibitors in the management of ITG need further evaluation.", 
    "686": "Experimental, genetic and clinical evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may participate in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease. This interrelationship may involve mechanisms other than changes in arterial blood pressure. In addition to various possible interactions, accumulating evidence suggests that the RAAS is involved in the regulation of the fibrinolytic system. Several recent studies have shown that stimulation of the RAAS may be associated with an activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Since profibrinolytic factors (especially tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) remain unchanged, increased activity of the RAAS may thus alter the fibrinolytic balance towards a decreased fibrinolytic activity. These findings may be of special importance for a variety of clinical problems such as the long-term effect of a low NaCl-intake on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the possible value of drugs indirectly or directly interfering with the RAAS such as diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists.",

The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of spasticity. The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients.",

Although the ELITE (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) trial suggested that losartan improved survival compared with captopril, this study was not designed to look at mortality. ELITE-II, an adequately powered study, showed no difference in mortality rates between patients taking captopril and those taking losartan. The combination of AgII receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors provides additional benefit on blood pressure lowering and prevention of ventricular remodeling.

These findings are in contrast to those with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which tend to increase HR and have been associated with an adverse outcome in acute cardiovascular conditions. At the same time, there is evidence to suggest that HR-lowering calcium-channel blockers decrease cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction.",

    "708": "Aggravation of anemia in chronic renal failure patients by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has been attributed to the inhibition of angiotensin II which facilitates erythropoietin(Epo) production. This study was aimed at evaluating whether ACEIs aggravate anemia in maintenance hemodialysis patients and to investigate the influence of ACE gene polymorphism on erythropoiesis in these patients. Ninety-one hemodialysis patients were divided into 2 groups, based on whether or not they were administered ACEIs, into the ACEI group(n = 24) and the non-ACEI group(n = 67), and comparisons were made of the doses of recombinant human Epo(rHuEpo) administered, the hematocrit(Hct) and the plasma Epo concentrations. Among the patients in the non-ACEI group, only 17 did not receive rHuEpo, while all of the patients in the ACEI group received rHuEpo. The average dose of rHuEpo was 102.7 +/- 45.4 IU/kg/week in the ACEI group and 57.8 +/- 55 IU/kg/week in the non-ACEI group and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. A statistically significant difference in the Hct was also observed between the two groups: the mean Hct in the ACEI group was 28.7 +/- 2.9% while that in the non-ACEI group was 31.1 +/- 3.7%. The plasma Epo concentrations were significantly lower in the ACEI group than in the non-ACEI group. No significant differences in the rHuEpo dose and Hct were observed between the three ACE genotype classes in either the ACEI or the non-ACEI group, however, there was a significant difference among the three genotypes in the non-ACEI group in regard to the plasma Epo concentrations; patients with the DD genotype had higher concentrations than those with the DI or II genotypes. These data suggest that anemia in maintenance hemodialysis patients is worsened by ACEIs as a result of the suppression of Epo production. Although it has been suggested that the endogenous Epo concentrations in maintenance hemodialysis patients are associated with ACE gene polymorphism, no significant influence of the ACE genotype on the rHuEpo dose or Hct was evident. Therefore, it is possible that exacerbation of anemia by ACEIs in the patients receiving rHuEpo is a result of an inhibited bone marrow response to Epo.", 
    "709": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has proved effective in retarding the progression of renal disease in the remnant kidney model, as well as other experimental diseases, and most importantly, in a range of progressive human renal diseases. Attention has focused on the role of angiotensin II in propagating progression both by its hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic actions. Recent evidence, predominantly in the remnant kidney model, indicates that the drugs used to block this hormone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also lower aldosterone levels. Aldosterone as well as angiotensin II thus appears to be instrumental in sustaining the hypertension and fibroproliferative destruction of the residual kidney.", 
    "710": "Proteinuria is one of the major risk factors for renal disease progression in patients with chronic nephropathies. Studies in disease models have helped to delineate mechanisms leading to renal structural damage as a result of persistent dysfunction of the glomerular barrier to proteins, even when the primary immune or non-immune insult to the kidney has ceased. From these preclinical studies, a role for endothelin in proteinuric chronic renal diseases has been suggested, thus providing the rationale for novel therapeutic approaches with endothelin receptor antagonists to maximize renoprotection so far achieved with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II receptor antagonism. Trials are needed to explore this potential area of clinical interest.", 
    "711": "The MERIT-HF study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind, two-week placebo run-in period. There were two primary objectives: total mortality; and the combined endpoint of total mortality or all-cause hospitalizations (time to first event). Several other combined endpoints were also predefined, as were number of hospitalizations due to heart failure and other cardiovascular causes, withdrawal of study medicine due to all causes, and due to worsening heart failure, and change in NYHA class. The effect on Quality of Life was assessed in a substudy. The major inclusion criteria were symptomatic heart failure for at least 3 months corresponding to NYHA class II-IV; and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less in 40 to 80 year old men and women. The patients had to be on optimal treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization, defined in principle as any combination of diuretics and an ACE inhibitor. The recommended starting dose was half a 25 mg tablet of metoprolol CR/Zok once daily in patients in NYHA functional class III-IV, and one 25 mg tablet once daily in patients in NYHA class II. It was recommended to double the dose after each 2-week period in order to reach the highest tolerated dose aiming for a target dose level of 200 mg once daily of metoprolol CR/Zok or placebo. This dosage regimen could be modified according to the judgement of the investigator. Randomization began on February 14, 1997, and the last patient was randomized April 14, 1998. 1990 patients were randomized to metoprolol CR/Zok and 2001 to placebo. The International Steering Committee stopped the study by October 31, 1998, upon recommendation from the Independent Safety Committee. The second pre-planned interim analysis (50% point) had shown that the pre-defined criterion for termination of the study was met and exceeded. The mean follow-up time was 1 year.", 
    "712": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now accepted as part of the routine management of patients with heart failure. Their use has been mandated in all the new major mortality trials to test the efficacy of beta-blockers in heart failure. Morbidity and mortality remain high in those with heart failure even with the benefits proven for both these groups of agents. In spite of the evidence for benefit of ACE inhibitors they are persistently used in lower doses in clinical practice than tested in the large-scale trials. This was so prevalent as to allow the conduct of a substantial study, the ATLAS trial, to compare high and low dose ACE inhibition. Its equivocal findings have allowed different interpretations. Clinical experience would suggest that starting with a low dose is appropriate but the dose should be titrated then without undue delay to the levels used in the trials wherever possible. The evidence for benefit with these drugs had been obtained largely in patients with impaired systolic function. However the AIRE study selected patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction rather than with impaired systolic function. A substantial and long-term benefit was found from ACE inhibition. A cohort of patients had ventricular function assessed and as anticipated almost one half had preserved systolic function. Whilst the absolute benefit in lives saved was greater in the higher risk/low ejection fraction group, the relative risk reduction was not significantly different between those with preserved or impaired systolic function. The publication of the HOPE trial, although not a study of patients with heart failure, has clarified the situation considerably for those taking day to day care of patients. The HOPE study selected patients on the basis of high cardiovascular risk excluding those with known impaired systolic function. Although not an entry requirement for the study, ejection fraction was measured in a substantial majority and was above 40% indicating preservation of systolic function. The ACE inhibitor ramipril markedly reduced the combined end-point of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction. Importantly there was a highly significant 20% risk reduction in the rate of myocardial infarction, a prospectively defined end-point, over the average four and a half year follow-up. Taken together with the retrospectively derived evidence from the heart failure trials there is now compelling evidence that the ACE inhibitors prevent myocardial infarction. The majority of patients with clinical heart failure have underlying ischaemic heart disease. Prevention of myocardial infarction and control of blood pressure are two key factors in the management of these patients irrespective of systolic ventricular function. The ACE inhibitors like the beta-blockers therefore have a pivotal role in their management. A challenge to current clinical trials is to determine whether these properties are shared to the same degree by the angiotensin antagonists or if even further gains in benefit can come from their combination. The neutral findings of the ELITE II study comparing the angiotensin antagonist, losartan, with the ACE inhibitor, captopril, have heightened interest in the on-going trials addressing these issues.", 
    "713": "Sudden death is extremely common in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. At least one third of those with hypertension and probably about half of those who survive a myocardial infarction or suffer from cardiac failure who die in a clinical trial, die suddenly. Beta-blockers reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly in those who have had a myocardial infarction or heart failure. ACE inhibitors are perhaps less effective. Other cardiovascular drugs have not been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.", 
    "714": "National and international societies have issued guidelines on the management of heart failure: The European Society of Cardiology, WHO, ACC/AHA Task Force Report, US Department of Health and Human Services, German Society of Cardiology. The therapeutic approaches to heart failure have undergone considerable changes during the last few years. The guidelines have to be updated almost yearly due to new results from prospective randomized studies. Although an agreement could be reached with respect to general measures and drug treatment, no agreement on mechanical devices, pacemakers and surgical interventions has been reached. The basis for medical treatment of chronic heart failure depends on diuretics, digitalis, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Calcium antagonists and other positive inotropic drugs, other than digitalis, should be avoided as far as possible. Thiazides, loop diuretics and aldosterone antagonists are needed for acute and chronic treatment of heart failure, alone or in combination (diuretic resistant heart failure!). Digitalis glycosides are needed in patients with atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate or atrial flutter and in patients with systolic dysfunction, large hearts and symptomatic failure class NYHA III and IV. However, digitalis does not convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Today there is no question that ACE inhibitors improve the prognosis of all patients with heart failure in all stages, if ejection fraction is reduced. Therefore, most patients after myocardial infarction or after having experienced pump failure due to myocarditis or cardiomyopathy are treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors seem to be most pronounced the worse the situation is. Relative risk reductions (mortality!) between 10% and 40% have been published depending on the severity of symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Those patients with high absolute risk have more to gain than those with low risk for any given \"risk reduction\", of course. Recent studies also indicate that most high risk cardiac patients profit from ACE inhibitors even if pump function is normal (i.e., patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebral vascular disease, hypertension) (15). AT1 antagonists can substitute for ACE inhibitors, if the latter are not tolerated due to cough. Up to now, beta-blocking agents apart from diuretics seem to be the best investigated drugs in heart failure. Large controlled studies with bisoprolol, carvedilol and metoprolol in addition to diuretics, digitalis and ACE inhibitors convincingly yielded positive results in chronic left ventricular failure patients. Reduction of mortality by 35% and even of sudden cardiac deaths by 40% have been proven beyond doubt. Thus, heart failure patients today should also receive beta-blocking agents in all stages of the disease. In the era of controlled prospective studies (evidence-based medicine), physicians are well advised to use only drugs that have been proven beneficial in large controlled studies.", 
    "715": "It is still a controversial issue whether different classes of antihypertensive drugs are equally effective in the regression of cardiac hypertrophy and associated complications. The present study compared the effects of prolonged treatment with the Ca2+-channel blocker amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor enalapril, respectively, in TGR(mREN2)27 rats (TGR), an animal model of renin-dependent hypertension. TGR were divided into three groups and received either amlodipine, enalapril or drinking water without addition, Sprague-Dawley rats (SPRD) served as normotensive control group. Cardiovascular parameters were monitored by radiotelemetry, and drug doses were titrated until 24-h blood pressure was reduced to approximately 140/90 mmHg in both active treatment groups. After 8 weeks of treatment left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was completely reversed in both treatment groups despite a tenfold increase in plasma angiotensin II in amlodipine-treated TGR. In untreated TGR LV catecholamines were depleted, and beta1-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was blunted. Treatment of TGR with enalapril prevented both the depletion of tissue catecholamines and the desensitisation of LV beta1-adrenoceptors. Amlodipine had no effect on cardiac adrenergic signal transduction. Basal activity of LV soluble guanylyl cyclase was not different between TGR and SPRD, but its sensitivity to stimulation by nitric oxide was slightly reduced in TGR. Treatment had no effect on basal and stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity. The present study in an animal model of renin-dependent hypertension suggests that blood pressure reduction per se is sufficient for a regression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, beta-adrenergic desensitisation was prevented only in the enalapril-treated group, supporting a blood pressure-independent contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the regulation of beta-adrenergic signal transduction.", 
    "716": "Sympathetic activity is modulated by angiotensin II (AII), both at pre- and postsynaptic level in the rat caudal artery. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), this artery receives more dense sympathetic innervation than blood vessels of normotensive strains. This fact seems to be linked to the enhanced pressor responses elicited by noradrenaline in SHR. In this work we describe, in the SHR, the effect of a chronic treatment with the angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan, in modulating noradrenergic mechanisms involved in caudal artery contraction. The effect of losartan is compared to that of captopril, given at doses leading to a similar decrease of both arterial blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy. The contractile response of caudal artery rings induced by endogenous noradrenaline released by low frequency transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) has been studied. Under our conditions, TNS (0.5-1 Hz) induced higher contractile responses in SHR treated with losartan than in the control and captopril-treated groups. This difference seems to be due to an increase of the postsynaptic effect of noradrenaline (NA) rather than to an increase of noradrenaline release from sympathetic endings, since i) DE50 value for NA was lower in losartan-treated SHR than in the other groups, and ii) AII induced a dose-dependent increase of TNS-evoked release of radioactivity from caudal artery segments loaded with [3H]-NA, in both control and captopril-treated groups but had no effect in the losartan-treated group. These results show that chronic treatment with losartan, although slightly enhancing the pressor effect of NA at postsynaptic level, fully supresses the facilitatory role of AII on NA release.",

    "722": "Hypertension is often associated with diabetes mellitus. Its physiopathology is different when it's a question of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension is often the result of a underlying nephropathy. In the case of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension is more often essential and it lies within a plurimetabolic syndrome and insulin resistance context. In all cases, hypertension worsens the patients' prognostics, increasing the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. The optimal blood pressure control allows to limit their evolution. It is necessary to fight against all cardiovascular risks like sedentary lifestyle, obesity, tabacco or hyperlipemia. ANAES recommends a blood pressure control lower or equal to 140/80 mmHg. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) are the first recommended treatment because of their action in case of nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, besides ACE, diuretics. beta-blockers can be used in first line. Often, therapeutic associations are necessary.", 
    "723": "The effects of enalapril on 50 patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), confirmed by clinical features and radionuclid ventriculography, were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, and controlled method for eight weeks. The results showed that left atrial diameters (LAD), interventricular septum thicknesses (IVST) and left ventricular mass indexes (LV-MI) except left ventricular diameters (LVD) were decreased in the enalapril treatment group. The left ventricular diastolic function parameters such as the early peak filling velocity (EPAV), the atrial peak filling velocity (APAV), the deceleration of early peak filling velocity (DC) and the isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) were improved, the NYHA class and the exercise tolerance were increased, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and the cardiac index (CI) were not altered in the enalapril treatment group. The patients with LVDD were well tolerated with enalapril. The parameters mentioned above were not altered in control group. It is suggested that enalapril is an effective drug in the treatment of LVDD.",

After a 28-day placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 28 days of once-daily, double-blind, double-dummy treatment with telmisartan 40, 80, or 120 mg; enalapril 20 mg; or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was manually recorded for 12 hours after the first dose and after 24 hours at baseline (Day 0), Day 1, and Day 28 of double-blind treatment. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed from telmisartan plasma concentrations. All doses of telmisartan and enalapril significantly reduced BP compared with placebo (p < or = 0.01). Mean +/- SE reductions in supine DBP after 28 days of treatment ranged between 7.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg and 9.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg in the telmisartan groups, 9.6 +/- 1.3 mmHg with enalapril, and 1.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg with placebo. Mean +/- SE reductions in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) were between 10.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg and 15.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg with telmisartan versus 10.2 +/- 2.1 mmHg with enalapril; placebo increased supine SBP by 3.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg. The BP reductions after 4 weeks of treatment with telmisartan were no different from those achieved with enalapril. No significant linear trend in BP reduction was evident among telmisartan doses. Reductions in SBP and DBP were maintained over the 24-hour period at Day 28. Treatment did not affect supine heart rate. Trough/peak DBP ratios were > or = 85% for all telmisartan doses versus 65% for enalapril. High interpatient variability in telmisartan plasma concentrations was observed. For example, mean +/- SD values for Cmax were 159 +/- 104 ng/mL for telmisartan 40 mg, 693 +/- 606 ng/mL for telmisartan 80 mg, and 1635 +/- 1406 ng/mL for telmisartan 120 mg. Plasma concentration-effect analyses indicated that the antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 40, 80, and 120 mg are at the plateau region of the concentration-response curve. All active treatments were well tolerated, with tolerability profiles similar to placebo, and telmisartan did not produce any clinically relevant first-dose effects. These data confirm the antihypertensive efficacy and placebo-like tolerability of telmisartan.", 
    "730": "A multiple-dose, open-label, two-period, crossover randomized study was conducted in 12 healthy male volunteers to investigate the effect of multiple-dose telmisartan on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. On day 1 of a 7-day medication period, subjects received a loading dose of digoxin 0.5 mg in the morning, followed by an evening dose of digoxin 0.25 mg, either alone or together with telmisartan 120 mg administered in the morning. On the subsequent 6 days, either digoxin 0.25 mg or digoxin 0.25 mg together with telmisartan 120 mg was administered once daily in the morning. Each 7-day medication period was separated by a washout period of > or = 14 days. A steady-state plasma concentration-time profile was assessed for digoxin during each period and for telmisartan during the period with the combined treatment. Multiple-dose telmisartan administered with digoxin resulted in higher serum digoxin concentrations than those observed after digoxin given alone. Geometric mean AUC144-168, Cmax, and Cmin values for digoxin when given in combination with telmisartan were higher by 22%, 50%, and 13%, respectively, compared with values when given alone. However, the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean of Cmin was within the predefined 80% to 125% range of no interaction. During combination medication, digoxin tmax was shorter and Cmax/AUC144-168 increased, suggesting that the rise in digoxin Cmax may be due to more rapid drug absorption. Study medications were well tolerated, with the incidence, nature, and intensity of adverse events being similar during both medication periods. Also, no changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory tests were observed during the study. Although there was some evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction between digoxin and telmisartan found in this study, the safety and tolerability of digoxin were unaffected by concurrent administration of telmisartan in the study population. Since any symptoms of overdose are related only to steady state and not peak concentrations and due to the fact that there was a lack of effect on serum trough levels of digoxin in this study, it is unlikely that the findings have any clinical relevance. The magnitude of increase in digoxin concentrations is comparable with increases observed with administration of calcium antagonists, carvedilol, ACE inhibitors such as captopril, and antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, quinidine, and propafenone. Monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations should be considered when patients first receive telmisartan and in the event of any changes in telmisartan dose.", 
    "731": "The pharmacokinetics of oral telmisartan 120 mg evaluated in subjects with severe renal insufficiency between dialyses and during hemodialysis were compared with those observed in healthy male subjects. Between dialyses and during dialysis, the plasma concentration-time curves of subjects with renal insufficiency were lower than those of healthy subjects. The mean plasma protein binding of telmisartan was 99.5% in healthy subjects, compared with mean values of 99.1% between dialyses and 98.8% during dialysis. Only very small amounts of telmisartan were removed by dialysis. Single doses of telmisartan 120 mg were well tolerated in subjects with severe renal insufficiency when administered either between dialyses or during dialysis, and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs were detected. In conclusion, the maximum plasma concentrations of telmisartan and areas under the plasma concentration-time curves in subjects with severe renal insufficiency were markedly reduced compared with healthy subjects. The fraction of telmisartan not bound to plasma proteins was increased approximately twofold. Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile in subjects with renal insufficiency did not affect the safety profile of telmisartan, which was well tolerated in these subjects.", 
    "732": "The pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan were assessed in subjects with hepatic impairment in a single-center, open-label study. Single oral doses of telmisartan 20 mg and 120 mg, separated by a washout period of 14 days, were given to 12 hepatically impaired subjects and 12 healthy subjects. In 5 hepatically impaired subjects who received both oral doses, a single i.v. infusion of telmisartan 120 mg was later administered. After oral dosing, the pharmacokinetic profile of telmisartan was characterized by rapid absorption and disposition kinetics and a slow terminal elimination phase with mean half-lives of 27 to 42 hours. The maximum plasma concentration and area under the telmisartan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) increased in hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy volunteers 6.4-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively, for telmisartan 20 mg and 3.2-fold and 3.1-fold, respectively, for telmisartan 120 mg. Maximum plasma concentrations and AUC0-infinity after i.v. infusion were markedly elevated compared with values obtained from other studies conducted in healthy volunteers. Hepatic impairment resulted in an apparent increase in the absolute bioavailability of telmisartan, and total clearance following oral and i.v. administration was significantly reduced compared with healthy volunteers. Plasma protein binding of telmisartan was > or = 99.5% in hepatically impaired and healthy subjects and was not changed when compared to healthy subjects. Oral and i.v. telmisartan were well tolerated in both the hepatically impaired and the healthy; headache was the most common potentially telmisartan-related adverse event. Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters were transient and of no clinical relevance. The good tolerability of telmisartan in hepatically impaired patients demonstrated in this study, the proven sustained blood pressure control in hypertensive patients, and the increased exposure in patients with hepatic dysfunction suggest that effective treatment of hypertensive patients with impaired hepatic function would be achieved even with the lowest dose of telmisartan available. The increased bioavailability of telmisartan suggests that lower doses of telmisartan should be considered when the drug is administered to patients with hepatic impairment.", 
    "733": "This open-label, crossover study was performed to establish if there is evidence for interaction between telmisartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, and amlodipine, a class II (dihydropyridine) calcium channel antagonist, on the basis of pharmacokinetics and safety. In a two-way crossover trial, 12 healthy Caucasian males were randomized to receive once daily for 9 days oral amlodipine 10 mg with or without oral telmisartan 120 mg. After a washout period of > or = 13 days, the subjects were switched to the other medication regimen. The geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state (day 9) for amlodipine when given alone were the following: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 17.7 ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 331 ng.h/mL, and renal clearance 39.5 mL/min, with 8% of the total amlodipine dose being excreted. When concomitant telmisartan was given, the respective values were 18.7 ng/mL, 352 ng.h/mL, and 43.0 mL/min, with 9.4% of the total amlodipine dose being excreted renally. The limits of the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of these steady-state parameters were 0.97 to 1.14 for Cmax and 0.98 to 1.16 for AUC; both were within the predefined reference range (0.8 to 1.25) for bioequivalence. The high intersubject variability in urinary amlodipine excretion resulted in bioequivalence not being demonstrated for renal clearance. Adverse effects were few, mild to moderate in intensity, and transient whether amlodipine was given alone or with telmisartan. Vital signs, except for blood pressure, and clinical laboratory values were unaffected by either medication. The findings of this study show that concomitant telmisartan and amlodipine may be administered as there is no clinically significant variation in primary pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine in the presence of telmisartan, and the safety of the combination is comparable to that of amlodipine alone.", 
    "734": "Two open-label, two-way, crossover studies were performed to assess any pharmacokinetic interaction of telmisartan with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Healthy male adult volunteers (n = 12) received a single oral dose of acetaminophen 1 g alone and with oral telmisartan 120 mg in one study. Oral ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily with and without oral once-daily telmisartan 120 mg was given for 7 days in the other study conducted in 6 males and 6 females. In both studies, there was a washout period of > or = 13 days between single and combination medication administration. The primary end points Cmax and AUC were compared between combination (acetaminophen or ibuprofen + telmisartan) and single-agent medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Pharmacokinetic drug interaction was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and calculation of 90% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment ratios using log-transformed parameters. Bioequivalence (i.e., lack of interaction) was concluded if the 90% CI of the ratios for both Cmax and AUC were within the acceptance limit of 0.80 to 1.25. Geometric mean Cmax values for acetaminophen and R-(-)- and S-(+)-ibuprofen enantiomers were similar with and without telmisartan coadministration (12.6 micrograms/mL vs. 14.1 micrograms/mL; 17.3 micrograms/mL vs. 16.7 micrograms/mL; 19.4 micrograms/mL vs. 19.5 micrograms/mL, respectively), and values for R-(-)- as well as S-(+)-ibuprofen were bioequivalent. Geometric mean AUC values for acetaminophen and R-(-)- and S-(+)-ibuprofen were also bioequivalent with and without telmisartan. The distribution and elimination parameters of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen were comparable in the presence or absence of telmisartan. The concomitant and single-agent medications were all well tolerated. In conclusion, the long half-life and excellent safety profile of telmisartan were unaffected by concurrent acetaminophen or ibuprofen medication; thus, once-daily dosing of telmisartan can be maintained, which may help to optimize patient compliance, and patients may self-administer concomitant acetaminophen or ibuprofen.", 
    "735": "The effects of multiple-dose telmisartan on the steady-state pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of warfarin were assessed in 12 healthy young males in an open-label, single-period study conducted over 30 days. Subjects received loading doses of oral once-daily warfarin on days 1 to 5, which were individually adjusted at days 6 and/or 9 to attain stable predose prothrombin time values (INRpre) of between 1.2 and 1.8 by the end of medication phase 1 (day 14). From days 15 to 24 (medication phase 2), subjects received oral once-daily telmisartan 120 mg in addition to individualized oral doses of once-daily warfarin. On days 25 to 31 (medication phase 3), oral once-daily warfarin was again administered alone at individualized doses. Under steady-state conditions, INRpre remained unchanged during medication phases 1, 2, and 3. The difference between phases 1 and 3 was -0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.7 to 0.10) and between phases 2 and 1 was 0.03 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.10). Mean trough plasma warfarin concentrations (Cpre) were stable during medication with warfarin alone but showed a small, although statistically significant, decrease during the combined-medication phase. The point estimate of the ratio of phase 2/phase 1 was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.95). The decrease in Cpre did not result in decreased anticoagulation. This suggests that the extent of pharmacokinetic interaction between telmisartan and warfarin is limited, and since telmisartan had no effect on INRpre and the concomitant medication was well tolerated, there is no evidence for a clinically relevant interaction between telmisartan and warfarin.", 
    "736": "This open-label, crossover study had two objectives: to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of high-dose telmisartan with and without coadministered high-dose hydrochlorothiazide and to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide with and without coadministered telmisartan. A total of 13 healthy males and females of nonchildbearing potential received the following oral, once-daily medications, each for 7 days: telmisartan 160 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, and telmisartan 160 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Between medication periods, there was a 14-day washout. Blood was collected at intervals over 48 and 84 hours, respectively, at the end of the 7-day dosing period for the determination of plasma telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography. Predose blood samples were also collected on days 1, 6, and 7. Tolerability of single-agent and combination medication was monitored. For hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan, given alone or in combination, there were no appreciable differences in trough plasma concentrations between days 6, 7, and 8; thus, at day 7, both agents had achieved steady state. Mean values of the primary end points (Cmax and AUC0-24) and secondary end points (Cmin and t1/2) for both telmisartan and hyrochlorothiazide were unaffected when administered simultaneously. Moreover, concurrent telmisartan had no effect on urinary excretion of hydrochlorothiazide. Transient lightheadedness, associated with postural hypotension, was the most common adverse event. The absence of any significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of either hydrochlorothiazide or telmisartan shows that no dose adjustment is required if the two agents are given concurrently for the management of hypertension.", 
    "737": "The study was conducted in healthy male volunteers to evaluate the absorption, metabolic pattern, and mode of elimination of telmisartan, a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist. [14C]telmisartan was administered orally in solution as a single 40 mg dose to 5 subjects. A further 5 subjects received short-term intravenous infusion of [14C]telmisartan 40 mg. Measurement of total 14C radioactivity in plasma showed that about 50% was absorbed following oral administration, with maximum plasma concentration observed after 0.5 to 1 hour. Absolute bioavailability was 43%. On average, 84% of total radioactivity in plasma reflected the parent compound. The remainder of total radioactivity could be ascribed to the glucuronide conjugate of telmisartan, which represented the only metabolite in man. About 99.5% of telmisartan was bound to plasma protein, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Telmisartan was reversibly distributed into erythrocytes. More than 90% of administered dose was excreted within 120 hours, and the excretion balance was complete 144 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was almost exclusively (> 98%) excreted via the feces; urinary excretion accounted for < 1% of the dose, irrespective of the route of administration. In the small fraction excreted into urine, the glucuronide conjugate of telmisartan was predominant. Although some telmisartan glucuronide was detected in plasma, only unchanged drug was identified in the feces. No changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or clinical laboratory tests were detected following telmisartan administration, and adverse events, predominantly unrelated to treatment and of mild intensity, were infrequent. One subject fainted and, on another occasion, reported faintness; these events were probably due to the antihypertensive action of the intravenous study medication.", 
    "738": "The past 20 years have witnessed a marked decline in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This decline has been due in large part to advances in coronary risk factor modification and a better understanding of the atherosclerotic process. Compelling scientific and clinical trial evidence proves that comprehensive risk factor modification extends patient survival and reduces cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This article reviews the ABCs of optimal medical and lifestyle management in patients with documented atherosclerotic vascular disease as well as in those adults who are at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease, based on contemporary clinical trial evidence.", 
    "739": "-The kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system is an important vasodilator and vasodepressor component of the cardiovascular system. Acting mainly through B(2) receptors, kinins may counterbalance the pressor effect of angiotensin II, salt, and mineralocorticoids plus salt. Using rats lacking the bradykinin precursors low- and high-molecular-weight kininogen or a B(2) kinin receptor antagonist (icatibant), we investigated whether absence or blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system alters blood pressure (BP) in rats given (1) chronic infusion of Ang II, (2) a normal or high salt diet, or (3) chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) plus salt. We confirmed the genotype and phenotype of Brown Norway Katholiek rats (BNK) and found that they had a G-to-A point mutation on the kininogen gene compared with Brown Norway (BN) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, very low levels of high-molecular-weight kininogen (17+/-3 ng/mL) compared with BN and SD (1814+/-253 and 2397+/-302 ng/mL, respectively; P:<0.01), and plasma low-molecular-weight kininogen concentrations below detectable limits compared with 1773+/-74 and 1781+/-140 ng/mL for BN and SD, respectively. Basal BP was the same in BNK and BN. Chronic infusion of icatibant did not alter BP in BN or Wistar rats. At doses that blocked the acute effect of bradykinin, icatibant did not potentiate the pressor effect of a chronic subpressor or pressor dose of angiotensin II in male and female Wistar rats nor that of a high salt diet (2%) plus unilateral nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. Moreover, blockade of the kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in either BN rats given a very high dose of icatibant or kinin-deficient rats (BNK) did not potentiate the pressor effect of angiotensin II (nonpressor dose) or a high salt (3% NaCl) diet given for 2 weeks. Established DOCA-salt hypertension was not exaggerated in rats treated with icatibant but was partially attenuated by ramipril (1.5 mg. kg(-)(1). d(-)(1) for 7 days; P:<0.002). This antihypertensive effect was abolished by icatibant (P:<0.002, ramipril versus ramipril plus icatibant). These results suggest that endogenous kinins do not participate in the maintenance of normal blood pressure or antagonize the development of hypertension induced by chronic infusion of angiotensin II, a high salt diet, or DOCA-salt. However, kinins appear to play an important role in the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in DOCA-salt hypertension.", 
    "740": "-Bradykinin is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator that contributes to the blood pressure lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, although the efficacy of this therapy has been reported to vary among different ethnic groups. To determine whether vascular sensitivity to bradykinin is decreased in blacks compared with whites, we measured forearm blood flow with venous plethysmography in response to intraarterially-administered bradykinin (100, 200, and 400 ng/min) under salt-controlled conditions in 28 (14 black, 14 white) normotensive subjects genotyped for the ACE insertion/deletion (I:/D) polymorphism. Acetylcholine (ACh) (15, 30, and 60 \u00b5g/min) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 \u00b5g/min) were infused as endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent controls. Compared with whites, blacks exhibited a blunted vasodilator response to bradykinin (maximal blood flow: 20.4+/-2.5 versus 10.9+/-1.4 mL. 100 mL(-1). min(-1), P:=0.004) and SNP (14.1+/-1.6 versus 9.9+/-1.7 mL. 100 mL(-1). min(-1), P:=0.05) but not to ACh (10.5+/-2.8 versus 6.6+/-1.0 mL. 100 mL(-1). min(-1), P:=0.21). White subjects who carried at least 1 ACE D allele demonstrated significantly greater vasodilator responses to bradykinin compared with those homozygous for the I: allele (DD or I:D versus I:I, F=5.6, P:<0.04). In contrast, only blacks homozygous for the ACE D allele had a significantly greater vasodilator response to bradykinin than those who carried the I: allele (DD versus ID or II, F=8.3, P:=0.01). The ethnic difference was most pronounced in subjects heterozygous at the ACE I/D locus in which blacks had a markedly attenuated response to bradykinin compared with whites (F=41.0, P:<0.001). There was no effect of ACE I/D genotype on the vasodilator responses to SNP or ACh in either ethnic group. These data confirm that vascular reactivity to bradykinin and the endothelium-independent vasodilator SNP is decreased in normotensive blacks compared with whites, consistent with attenuated vascular smooth muscle reactivity. The data suggest that genetic variation at the ACE gene locus interacts with ethnicity to impact the vascular response to bradykinin.", 
    "741": "-To determine whether natriuretic peptides in addition to the renin-angiotensin system are involved in functional and structural vascular changes in salt-sensitive hypertension, we compared equipotent hypotensive treatment with the dual neutral endopeptidase/ACE inhibitor omapatrilat (35 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) or the ACE inhibitor captopril (100 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)). The reactivity and geometry of mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl salt-sensitive rats were studied in vitro under perfused and pressurized conditions. Chronic salt administration increased systolic blood pressure by 57+/-4 mm Hg, whereas concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were reduced in heart and in plasma (P:<0.05). In addition, the medial cross-sectional area of small mesenteric arteries was increased and endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine and contraction in response to endothelin-1 were impaired in the mesenteric arteries of salt-sensitive rats on a high-salt diet (P:<0.05). Concomitant treatment with either omapatrilat or captopril reduced the increase in systolic blood pressure and hypertrophic remodeling to a similar degree (P:<0.05) but affected plasma and cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide levels differently (P:<0.05). In addition, omapatrilat normalized endothelium-dependent relaxations to a greater extent than captopril (P:<0.05). Furthermore, vasopeptidase inhibition increased cGMP levels compared with captopril (P:<0.05). Contractions to endothelin-1 were normalized by either antihypertensive drug. These results suggest that in the Dahl rat, with similar reductions in systolic blood pressure, omapatrilat is superior to captopril in preventing impaired endothelial function in small resistance arteries. Thus, vasopeptidase inhibition may have therapeutic advantages of the prevention of changes in vascular function and structure in salt-sensitive forms of hypertension.", 
    "742": "Potential determinants of chronic renal disease (CRD) progression were studied in male Munich-Wistar rats subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy and treated with candesartan (Csn; n = 30) or enalapril (Ena; n = 27) from 5 wk postsurgery. Despite control of systolic blood pressure (SBP; 24 wk: Csn = 143 +/- 9; Ena = 148 +/- 8 mmHg), urinary protein excretion rates (U(pr)V) increased over 24 wk (Csn = 92 +/- 10; Ena = 99 +/- 8mg/day). Glomerulosclerosis scores (GS) at 24 wk were similar for Csn (42 +/- 7%) vs. Ena (42 +/- 4%), values close to those of untreated controls at 12 wk (43 +/- 4%). At 24 wk, SBP and UprV correlated strongly with GS, together accounting for 72% of the variance in GS. Renal cortex mRNA levels (determined by competitive RT-PCR) for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were elevated in Csn and Ena at 12 wk and remained higher at 24 wk vs. sham. Strong correlations were evident among TGF-beta1, MCP-1, and interleukin-1beta and renal injury at 24 wk. Cns and Ena are thus equally effective renoprotective agents in this model. During renin-angiotensin system inhibition, renoprotection is dependent on control of both SBP and UprV. Incomplete suppression of renal cytokine gene expression may also contribute to CRD progression.", 
    "743": "Vasoprotective function of endothelial cells is associated, among others, with biosynthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), carbon monoxide (CO) and plasminogen activator (t-PA). These endothelial mediators calm down activated platelets and leukocytes, prevent the occurrence of parietal thrombotic events, promote thrombolysis, maintain tissue perfusion and protect vascular wall against acute damage and against chronic remodeling. Endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from atherosclerosis or diabetes type 2 is associated not only with suppression in release of the above mediators but also with deleterious discharge of prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGH2, PGG2), superoxide anion (O2-, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). We looked for mechanisms of protective endothelial function, with a special respect to the differences between peripheral and pulmonary circulation.", 
    "744": "Cultured endothelial cells of bovine aorta (BAEC) were used to study physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of increasing free cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i. A porphyrinic sensor quantified the release of NO from BAEC. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) we looked for induction by bradykinin (Bk) of mRNAs for a number of enzymes. In blood perfused rat lungs we studied protective role of NO against injury inferred by lipopolysaccharide on pulmonary microcirculation that was accomplished by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet activating factor (PAF), cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cyst-LTs) and the complement system. In vivo we analyzed the influence of Bk, perindopril and quinapril ('tissue type' angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-Is) on endothelial function in entire circulation of anaesthetized rats using a thrombolytic bioassay and EIA for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen.", 
    "745": "In BAEC Bk via kinin B2 receptors raised in a concentration-dependent manner (1 pM-10 nM) free cytoplasmic calcium ions [Ca2+]i, that triggered the release of NO from BAEC. Calcium ionophore (A23187, 1-100 nM) as well as receptor agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 10 nM-1 microM), adrenaline (Adr, 1-10 microM) or acetylcholine (Ach, 10-100 microM) produced a similar rise in endothelial [Ca2+]i as did Bk at a nanomolar concentration. 'Tissue type' ACE-Is, e.g. quinapril or perindopril acted through accumulation of endogenous Bk. However, the potency of ACE-I to change endothelial function is by several orders of magnitude lower than that for exogenous Bk. In vivo the major difference between thrombolytic actions by quinapril or perindopril on one hand, and by exogenous Bk on the other was longevity of thrombolysis by ACE I and a distinct hypotensive action of exogenous Bk. Still, the long-lasting isolated thrombolytic effect of ACE I was mediated entirely by endogenous BK as evidenced by the preventive action of icatibant, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist. Moreover, in vivo the immediate thrombolysis by ACE-I was mediated by PGI2 rather than by NO or t-PA, as shown by pharmacological analysis, and by direct blood assays of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen. Bradykinin as a mediator of pleiotropic endothelial action of several cardiovascular drugs (e.g. ACE-I) may complete its mission not only through B2 receptor and [Ca2+]i--mediated release of PGI2 or NO. Here, we describe a new route of the Bk action. Bk mediated induction of the [Ca2+]i-independent, so called 'inducible', endothelial isoenzymes required for generation of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. After 4 hours of incubation of HUVEC with Bk (10 nM) it induced mRNAs for haemooxygenase 1 (HO-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E synthase (PGE-S) whereas mRNA for nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was weakly affected. We proved also that unlike in peripheral circulation, in pulmonary circulation only NO but not PGI2 would play a protective role. In the blood-perfused lung, endotoxaemia liberates lipids, such as TXA2, PAF and cyst-LTs. These toxic lipids along with the activated complement mediate pulmonary damage. Pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide is the only local protector against lung injury evoked by the phagocytised bacterial lipopolysaccharide.", 
    "746": "Summing up, in peripheral circulation endogenous Bk is the most efficient activator of protective endothelial function. For instance, thrombolytic action of 'tissue type' ACE-I depends on the Bk-released PGI2. Acting as an agonist of endothelial B2 kinin receptors Bk rises [Ca2+]i with a subsequent activation of constitutive COX 1 and NOS-3. This is followed by an immediate release of PGI2 and NO. Moreover, acting as 'microcytokine' Bk induces mRNAs for HO-1, COX-2 and PGE S, the isoenzymes responsible for a delayed endothelial biosynthesis of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", 
    "747": "The influence of captopril and enalaprilat on central nervous system in laboratory animals has been studied. The effects of the drugs on duration of ethanol (4 g/kg i.p.) and thiopental (70 mg/kg i.p.) induced sleep, body temperature, spontaneous locomotor activity and analgesic properties (hot plate and tail-flick test) have been investigated in mice. Captopril (5 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) and enalaprilat (5 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) were used in single administration or repeated one for 10 days. Moreover, pharmaco-EEG profile of captopril and enalaprilat in rabbits has been studied. We have shown that single administration of captopril (both doses) and single or prolonged administration of enalaprilat decreased the duration of ethanol and thiopental-induced sleep. Captopril (5 mg/kg) and enalaprilat (5 and 20 mg/kg) increased pain threshold. Both studied drugs after their single or repeated administration did not influence spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. Captopril and enalaprilat decrease body temperature in mice. Examined ACEIs produce changes in EEG recording, more profoundly exhibited after administration of enalaprilat.", 
    "748": "The aim of the study was to compare the effects of long-term treatment with different types of antihypertensive drugs on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic function in patients with essential hypertension. We examined 60 patients with mild to moderate hypertension from 35 to 55 years old (middle age 44.3 +/- 2.3 yrs) having no concomitant diseases. Patients were treated for six months with different types of antihypertensive drugs: 21 patient received nifedipine-retard 40 mg/day, 20--atenolol 100 mg/day, 10--losartan potassium 100 mg/day, 9--perindopril 4 mg/day. Cardiac structure and function was studied by echocardiography. For the left ventricle (LV) the diastolic mass normalised for body surface area (LVMI), the ratio of the early and atrial mitral inflow velocities (E/A), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), relative wall thickness (RWT) were measured. After six months of treatment LVMI decreased by 9% in nifedipine group (P < 0.01), by 10.5% in atenolol group (P < 0.01), by 12% in losartan group (P < 0.01) and by 8.2% in perindopril group (NS). RWT decreased in all groups, while diastolic dimension index remained unchanged. The reversal of LVH was not related to blood pressure reduction. It was more significant in patients with initially higher values of LVMI. Antihypertensive effects of the drugs were comparable. Long-term treatment with all types of selected drugs improves cardiac structure and function independently of their antihypertensive action. Our data suggest that on the basis of the influence on cardiac remodelling no preference for any studied drug can be discerned. The work had the following source of support: the atenolol (Falitonsin) and nifedipine-retard (Corinfar-retard) were provided by the AWD Company (Germany), losartan potassium has been provided by Merck Sharp & Dohme Company and perindopril (Prestarium) by the Servier Group.", 
    "749": "Heart failure develops as a consequence of cardiac injury. As the heart begins to fail to meet the body's metabolic demands, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system are activated. These interrelated systems act in concert to facilitate cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Though these neurohormonal systems are initially compensatory, evidence suggests that they promote deleterious cardiac remodeling and myocyte destruction. Recent studies in patients with heart failure have targeted the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system for therapeutic intervention. This article reviews major recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials in heart failure that have resulted in a new standard of care for patients with this devastating disease.", 
    "750": "The outpatient treatment of heart failure can be divided into 2 broad categories: older therapies, which improve hemodynamics, and newer therapies, which increase survival and improve function. Hemodynamic \"triple\" therapy includes digoxin to increase cardiac inotropy, antihypertensives to lower systolic pressure, and diuretics to remove fluid and decrease filling pressures. Disease-modifying therapy requires the use of specific agents to lower blood pressure (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II blockers, spironolactone, or hydralazine and nitrates) and beta-adrenergic blockade with carvedilol. The success of these newer therapies suggests that the standard triple therapy for heart failure should be expanded to \"quadruple\" therapy that includes carvedilol.", 
    "751": "Pneumonia is a common cause of death in older people. Antimicrobial drugs do not prevent pneumonia and, because of increasingly resistant organisms, their value in curing infection will become more limited. Establishing new strategies to prevent pneumonia through consideration of the mechanisms of this devastating illness is essential. The purpose of this review is to discuss how pneumonia develops in older people and to suggest preventive strategies that may reduce the incidence of pneumonia among older adults. Aspiration of oropharyngeal bacterial pathogens to the lower respiratory tract is one of the most important risk factors for pneumonia; impairments in swallowing and cough reflexes among older adults, e.g., related to cerebrovascular disease, increase the risk for the development of pneumonia. Thus, strategies to reduce the volumes and pathogenicity of aspirated material should be pursued. For example, since both swallowing and cough reflexes are mediated by endogenous substance P, pharmacologic therapy using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which decrease substance P catabolism, may improve both reflexes and result in the lowering of the risk of pneumonia. Similarly, since the production of substance P is regulated by dopaminergic neurons in the cerebral basal ganglia, treatment with dopamine analogs or potentiating drugs such as amantadine (and, of course, prevention of cerebral vascular disease, which can result in basal ganglia strokes) should affect the incidence of pneumonia. The purpose of this review is to consider promising pharmacologic treatments as methods of preventing pneumonia in older adults and to review other proven strategies, e.g., infection control and cerebrovascular disease prevention that will lessen the incidence of pneumonia.", 
    "752": "1. Somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a protein that contains two similar domains (N- and C-terminal), each possessing an active site. We have examined the effects of a generator of hydroxyl radicals (g*OH: 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on ACE using an in vitro approach. 2. The generator of hydroxyl radicals inactivated ACE in a time (2-6 h)- and concentration (0.3-3 mmol/L)-dependent manner at 37 degrees C. When ACE was coincubated for 4 h with g*OH (3 mmol/L), its activity decreased by 70%. Addition of dimethylthiourea or mannitol + methionine, two *OH scavengers, resulted in a significant protection of ACE activity. Mercaptoethanol and dithiotreitol, two thiol-reducing agents, also efficiently protected ACE activity. 3. The hydrolysis of two natural and domain-specific substrates was explored. The hydrolysis of angiotensin I, preferentially cleaved by the C-domain, was significantly inhibited (57-58%) after 4 h exposure to g*OH (0.3-1 mmol/L). Under the same conditions of exposure, the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, a specific substrate for the N-domain, was only slightly inhibited by 1 mmol/L g*OH. 4. Hydrogen peroxide, another source of *OH, was used. After exposure to H2O2 (3 mmol/L; 4 h), an 89% decrease in ACE activity was observed. Pretreatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine (1 mmol/L) attenuated H2O2-mediated ACE inactivation, demonstrating that the effect of H2O2 was partly due to its conversion into *OH (Fenton reaction). 5. In summary, our findings demonstrate that g*OH and H2O2 inhibit ACE activity and suggest a preferential action of g*OH on the C-domain of the enzyme.", 
    "753": "Vibrio cholerae produces a little-studied cytotoxin, haemagglutinin/protease (HA/P), in addition to several better-characterized enterotoxins, i.e. cholera toxin (CT), zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) and accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace). We have found recently that HA/P perturbs the barrier function of Mardin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cell line I (MDCK-I) by affecting the intercellular tight junctions (TJs) and the F-actin cytoskeleton. In the present study we have assessed more specifically how TJs are affected by HA/P by investigating the cellular localization and biochemical integrity of two well-characterized TJ-associated proteins, occludin and ZO-1. Western blot analysis showed that occludin bands of 66-85 kDa were digested by HA/P to two predominant bands of around 50 kDa and 35 kDa, and that this degradation was greatly attenuated when the specific bacterial metalloproteinase inhibitor Zincov was co-administered. Trypsin, on the other hand, did not degrade occludin when it was applied in the same way, suggesting that the degradation of occludin by HA/P is an early and specific event. The other TJ-associated protein ZO-1 was not degraded by HA/P in parallel experiments, suggesting the selectivity of HA/P-associated protein degradation. Moreover, immunofluorescence labelling and confocal microscopy showed that ZO-1, but not occludin, around cell-cell boundaries was rearranged by HA/P treatment. Since ZO-1 is located on the inside of the plasma membrane and is directly associated with occludin, the results indicate that breakdown of occludin may send signals to ZO-1 that affect its organization and the structure of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Our finding that the zinc-containing metalloprotease of V. cholerae specifically degraded occludin suggests that specific degradation of important host proteins by bacterial zinc-containing metalloproteases may be an important mechanism in microbial pathogenesis.", 
    "754": "The aim of the study was to investigate if hypertension affects pancreatic islet blood flow and endocrine function. For this purpose, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared with normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Both islet size and islet cell replication in 4-month-old SHR was increased compared with WKY. The (pro)insulin biosynthesis was reduced in islets isolated from SHR, whereas the insulin content was unchanged. A hyperinsulinemic response to glucose in vivo was observed in 4- and 12-month-old SHR. Pancreatic blood flow, measured using a microsphere technique, was lower in SHR than in WKY in rats aged 5 weeks, 4 months or 1 year. Islet blood flow was lower in 4-month-old and 1-year-old SHR. In 4-month-old animals, islet blood flow was unaffected by administration of enalaprilate and prazosin in both strains, but was markedly decreased by the administration of N(G)-methyl-L-arginine. It was concluded that the islets of SHR have a decreased insulin production in vitro and a decreased islet blood perfusion. The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial. Because SHR maintained an essentially normal glucose tolerance, an adaptation of the beta-cells to the metabolic and hemodynamic changes imposed by hypertension occurred.",

This case outlines airway compromise from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and discusses its subsequent management.", 
    "756": "Despite manifest benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the prognosis of patients with heart failure, there is a lack of consistency in the results of trials investigating the effects of ACE inhibitors on exercise capacity. The inconsistencies cannot be readily explained by variations in effects on known neurohumoral or conventional haemodynamic factors. Drawing on insights from physiology of pump-load interactions, in a normal circulation there is an optimal extent of systemic vasodilation at which the delivery of hydraulic energy from the cardiac pump is maximal (the 'impedance matchpoint'). In heart failure, the vasoconstrictive effects shift the operating point towards mismatch at higher resistances, and optimal vasodilatory therapy would reshift the operating point to the matchpoint. Excessive dosage, however, would cause overvasodilatation leading to a reduction in cardiac power output and consequently compromising exercise ability. High levels of ACE inhibitors may not therefore improve exercise ability. Another potential reason for the observed inconsistencies is that the often used parallel-group study design (ideal for mortality studies) may not be suitable for investigating drug effects on exercise capacity because dropouts from such studies would introduce occult selection biases, thereby confounding treatment effects. In conclusion, this reappraisal of the conflicting observations reported on ACE inhibitor effects on exercise capacity has highlighted a proposition that there is an optimal dosage of ACE inhibitors which will most enhance exercise capacity, and this will require further well designed cross-over studies to elucidate.",

We examined whether ACE inhibitor treatment may have a nephroprotective effect in normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients without microalbuminuria and with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and whether any effect was associated with the ACE genotype. In a prospective double-blind randomized study, normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with normal serum creatinine and no microalbuminuria were treated with either placebo or perindopril, an ACE inhibitor. Urine albumine/creatinine ratio (ACR), mean blood pressure (MBP) and index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on S-creatinine were determined. ACE genotype was determined by electrophoresis. ACR was higher in the placebo group than in the perindopril group after 4 months, and continued to increase during the study period. After 36 months of observation, ACR in the placebo group was 1.7+/-1.1 mg/mmol, and 0.6+/-0.2 mg/mmol in the ACE-inhibitor-treated group (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). During treatment, a significant increase in ACR in the placebo group (p=0.007), Wilcoxon matched paired test) was observed. There were no differences between the groups regarding MBP or GFR.

    "772": "There is convincing evidence for a specific BP-independent effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on albuminuria in glomerular disease. Because progression of glomerular disease is not consistently halted by these agents, there is a need to explore potential renoprotective effects of other drugs. Recent animal work documented that nonhypotensive doses of moxonidine, a sympathicoplegic agent, reduce albuminuria and development of glomerulosclerosis in a BP-independent manner. A randomized, crossover design was used to assess the human relevance of the experimental data in 15 normotensive, nonsmoking type 1 diabetic mellitus patients with good glycemic control (age, 37.3 +/- 6.6 yr; 9 men/6 women; duration of diabetes, 23.6 +/- 5.1 yr) with baseline urinary albumin excretion rates (AER) >20 microg/min in the run-in phase. AER was assessed in overnight timed urine collections. The patients were assigned to a 3-wk placebo and a 3-wk moxonidine (0.2 mg twice a day) period, respectively, in random order. This dose causes modest BP lowering in hypertensive individuals but does not affect BP in normotensive individuals. There was no significant effect on ambulatory BP (mean arterial pressure, 91.8 +/- 7.1 mmHg in the third week of placebo and 91.1 +/- 8.7 mm Hg on moxonidine). There was a significant (P< 0.006) difference of the treatment effects between placebo and moxonidine, respectively, on AER; median AER at the end of the placebo period was 39.8 microg/min (range, 15.9 to 117 microg/min) versus 29.0 (range, 9.03 to 85.8 microg/min) at the end of the moxonidine period. The data document an antialbuminuric effect of nonhypotensive doses of moxonidine. Diminished sympathetic traffic to the kidney is the most plausible explanation for the finding.",

From entry until the end of follow-up, the changes of PWV in response to decreased BP were measured ultrasonographically. BP was controlled by adjustment of \"dry weight\" and, when necessary, with ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and/or beta-blockers, in combination if necessary. Fifty-nine deaths occurred, including 40 cardiovascular and 19 noncardiovascular events. Cox analyses demonstrated that independent of BP changes, the predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were as follows: absence of PWV decrease in response to BP decrease, increased left ventricular mass, age, and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Survival was positively associated with ACE inhibitor use. After adjustment for all confounding factors, the risk ratio for the absence of PWV decrease was 2.59 (95% CI 1.51 to 4.43) for all-cause mortality and 2.35 (95% CI 1.23 to 4.41) for cardiovascular mortality.

The purpose of this in vivo microperfusion study is to examine whether the renal nerves modulate the effect of intraluminal angiotensin II on proximal tubule transport. The decrement in volume reabsorption after addition of 10(-4) M luminal enalaprilat is a measure of the role of luminal angiotensin II on transport. Acute denervation decreased volume reabsorption (2.97 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.30 +/- 0.21 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.001). Although luminal 10(-4) M enalaprilat decreased volume reabsorption in controls (2.97 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.61 +/- 0.26 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.001), it did not after acute denervation (1.30 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.19 nl. mm(-1). min(-1)). After chronic denervation, volume reabsorption was unchanged from sham controls (2.26 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.70 +/- 0.19 nl. mm(-1). min(-1)). Addition of luminal 10(-4) M enalaprilat decreased volume reabsorption in sham control (2.70 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.60 +/- 0.10 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05) but not with chronic denervation (2.26 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.07 +/- 0.20 nl. mm(-1). min(-1)). Addition of 10(-8) M angiotensin II to the lumen does not affect transport due to the presence of luminal angiotensin II. However, addition of 10(-8) M angiotensin II to the tubular lumen increased the volume reabsorption after both acute (1.30 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.67 +/- 0.18 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05) and chronic denervation (2.26 +/- 0.28 vs. 3.57 +/- 0.44 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01).

    "780": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is expressed in macula densa (MD) and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (cTALH) and is involved in regulation of renin production. We and others have previously found that selective COX-2 inhibitors can inhibit renal renin production (Cheng HF, Wang JL, Zhang MZ, Miyazaki Y, Ichikawa I, McKanna JA, and Harris RC.

In the present studies, we utilized mice with genetic deletions of the COX-2 gene in order to investigate further the potential role of COX-2 in mediation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Age-matched wild-type (+/+), heterozygotes (+/-), and homozygous null mice (-/-) were administered the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), captopril, for 7 days. ACEI failed to significantly increase plasma renin activity, renal renin mRNA expression, and renal renin activity in (-/-) mice. ACEI increased the number of cells expressing immunoreactive renin in the (+/+) mice both by inducing more juxtaglomerular cells to express immunoreactive renin and by recruiting additional renin-expressing cells in the more proximal afferent arteriole. In contrast, there was minimal recruitment of renin-expressing cells in the more proximal afferent arteriole of the -/- mice. In summary, these results indicate that ACEI-mediated increases in renal renin production were defective in COX-2 knockout (K/O) mice and provide further indication that MD COX-2 is an important mediator of the renin-angiotensin system.",

We evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with quinapril (Q) on the l -arginine/nitric oxide (NO) pathway in normotensive rats under baseline and inflammatory conditions. The role of bradykinin was also investigated. The animals received for 1 week either the ACE-inhibitor Q (1 and 10 mg/kg/day), the B(2)receptor antagonist HOE 140, Q+HOE 140, or no drug. At the end of chronic treatment, rats underwent either a 6-h placebo or an E. coli endotoxin challenge. The following measurements were made: (i) endothelial and inducible NO synthase (eNOS and iNOS) protein expression; (ii) eNOS/iNOS activity; (iii) serum levels of nitrite/nitrate and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha; (iv) NO in the expired air (eNO). Q increased baseline aortic eNOS protein expression (up to 99%, P<0.001) and activity (l -citrulline synthesis up to 94%, P<0.01; serum nitrite/nitrate up to 55%, P<0.05). HOE 140 partially reversed Q-induced upregulation of eNOS (P<0.05). Moreover, Q counteracted LPS effects, i.e. increased the impaired eNOS pathway and limited iNOS induction (up to 94 and 24%, respectively), and reduced the increased nitrite/nitrate and TNF- alpha serum levels as well as eNO (up to 25, 38 and 28%, respectively, P<0.01 for all comparisons). HOE 140 did not influence Q effects on iNOS during endotoxaemia. In conclusion, in (patho)physiological conditions in rats, Q up-regulated eNOS with a bradykinin-mediated mechanism, while downregulated iNOS with a possible TNF- alpha -mediated mechanism.", 
    "782": "Advanced glycation end-product (AGE) is important in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) is effective in treating this disorder. We have shown that the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) cascade is responsible for AGE-induced mitogenesis in NRK-49F (normal rat kidney fibroblast) cells, but its role in renal fibrosis in DN remains unknown. Therefore, we have sought to determine whether JAK/STAT is involved in AGE-regulated collagen production in NRK-49F cells. We found that AGE time (1-7 days) and dose (10-200 microg/ml)-dependently increased collagen production in these cells. Additionally, AGE increased RAGE (receptor for AGE) protein expression. AGE-induced RAGE expression was dose-dependently inhibited by antisense RAGE oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and captopril. AGE-induced type I collagen production and JAK2-STAT1/STAT3 activation were decreased by AG-490 (a specific JAK2 inhibitor), antisense RAGE ODN and captopril. Meanwhile, STAT1 and STAT3 decoy ODNs also suppressed the induction of collagen by AGE. We concluded that RAGE and the JAK2-STAT1/STAT3 pathway were involved in AGE-induced collagen production in NRK-49F cells. Furthermore, captopril was found to reverse AGE-induced collagen production, probably by attenuating RAGE expression and JAK2-STAT1/STAT3 activities."
