The levels of plasma glucose, serum insulin, serum lipids, glycated hemoglobin A(lc) (Hb A(lc)), and fructosamine were determined before and during long-term (mean +/- SD, 26.2 +/- 1.2 weeks) therapy with cilazapril. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed before and during treatment. Significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both patient groups were maintained during the study. Neither fasting nor post-glucose load venous plasma glucose levels were altered in either group of patients, and no patient with normal glucose tolerance developed diabetes mellitus during the study. There was no significant change in the insulinogenic index (delta serum insulin/delta venous plasma glucose at 30 minutes post-glucose load) in either group, and glucose intolerance was slightly improved with significant reductions (P < 0.01) in Hb A(lc) and fructosamine in the patient group with impaired glucose tolerance. Serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were significantly (P < 0.01) decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased in patients with hypercholesterolemia (TC levels > or = 5.69 mmol/L). These results suggest that long-term cilazapril therapy may improve glucose and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Cilazapril also appears to be useful as an antihypertensive agent for hypertensive patients with either impaired glucose tolerance or hypercholesterolemia.",

Kidney fibrosis correlates well with overall renal function, but is only rarely recognized as affecting function itself.

    "4": "Aortocaval fistula (AVF), a model of volume overloaded heart failure, was induced in rats by our newly developed technique using a simple and rapid 18-gauge needle multipuncture. After 3 weeks of oral administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist TCV-116, 1 mg/kg per day, we evaluated the hemodynamics, heart weight, and degree of left ventricular dilatation. We also compared the effect of TCV-116 with that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor delapril, 1 g/L in drinking water.",

We report a case in whom there was no other likely explanation for the acute pancreatitis than enalapril therapy, which was temporally associated with the symptoms. Possible mechanisms underlying the induction of pancreatitis by ACE inhibitors are discussed. With the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, the incidence of rare adverse effects such as potentially lethal pancreatitis is likely to increase. Clinicians need to be aware of this association.", 
    "8": "In this study the efficacy and safety of short-term cilazapril administration on renal haemodynamics were evaluated in mild to moderate hypertensive subjects. Our final goal was to evaluate whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved by treatment was associated with maintained renal function. After a run-in period with placebo, 40 hypertensive subjects without renal or cardiac diseases were randomly allocated to a double-blind 4 week controlled trial with cilazapril 5 mg once a day (20 patients) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day (20 patients). Renal haemodynamics measurements included effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by radionuclide study using 131I-hippuran and 99mTc, according to the methods described by Schlegel and Gates, respectively. Effective renal blood flow [ERBF = ERPF/(1-Ht)], filtration fraction (FF = GFR/ERPF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR = MBP x 80/ERBF) were calculated. At the end of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide administration significant decreases (p < 0.001) in SBP, DBP and MBP vs baseline values were observed. In the cilazapril group a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in RVR and FF and a significant increase (p < 0.001) in ERPF and ERBF were also found. In the hydrochlorothiazide group a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in RVR was found. No important side effects were observed with either treatment. In conclusion our data indicate that both cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced blood pressure equally well but only cilazapril improved renal blood flow and reduced filtration fraction.",

Both are risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular disease and their combination is associated with an increased incidence of nephropathy, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Several trials such as the HDFP and SHEP studies that included diabetic patients have demonstrated the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy in reducing mortality. In diabetes, studies have focussed predominantly on the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in reducing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Such therapy has been shown to decrease albuminuria in the setting of \"normal\" and elevated blood pressure in both type I and type II diabetic patients. This reduction in albuminuria has been observed in microalbuminuric diabetic patients and also in those with overt renal disease. Recent studies in type I diabetic patients with overt nephropathy indicate that these effects on urinary albumin excretion are associated with reduction in the rate of decline in renal function and development of end-stage renal failure. Indeed, several groups have shown that the initiation of antihypertensive therapy improves the prognosis of type I diabetic patients with nephropathy. While certain classes of drugs may reduce the rate of progression of complications such as nephropathy, others have side effect profiles that are disadvantageous in patients with diabetes.", 
    "17": "The French drug surveillance (pharmacovigilance) system is based on a network of 31 regional centres which receive adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports from health professionals and are drug information centers. Cases are entered into a common database, with causality scores. This database contains large amounts of data, which may be used for pharmaco-epidemiological studies. As an example, all cases in which an antihypertensive drug, suspect or not, was cited were identified. ACE-inhibitor cough was also explored.", 
    "18": "Since 1985, > 70,000 case reports have been entered into the database. 63 per cent were reported by specialists, 20 per cent by GPs. 54 per cent came from University Hospitals, 21 per cent from private practice. The most numerous age group was 60 to 69. The overall sex ratio (F/M) was 1.28, the female preponderance being most marked at < 39 and > 70 years of age. 43 per cent took only one drug, 20 per cent two drugs, 13.4 per cent three, and 24 per cent > three drugs. The most frequently reported effects concerned the skin and appendages (15 per cent), general status and central nervous system (9.5 per cent each), platelets, liver, and GI systems (6 per cent each). Outcome was favourable in 74 per cent. Dechallenge was positive in 71 per cent, rechallence in 6 per cent. 3.4 per cent of the patients died; in 2.2 per cent death was related to a reaction. Causality assessment indicated close temporal relationship (C2 or C3) in 69 per cent of cases; in 51 per cent of cases, no other obvious cause was found. 66 per cent of the reactions were labelled when reported. The database could also be used to explore drug utilisation: as an example, we studied the age and sex distribution of reports containing antihypertensive drugs, irrespective of their possible causal role in the reaction. Antihypertensives were mentioned in 14 per cent of the reports. The age distribution was skewed towards greater age, with a maximum of 70 years. F/M was 1.57, with more M use < 20 and 30-59, whereas F were more common between 20-29 and 60 years. beta-blockers were more often associated with patients under 70, whereas above 70 diuretics and centrally acting antihypertensive drugs were more often reported. This could be related to greater use or worse tolerance of these drugs. As an example of the exploration of a specific drug-reaction relationship, we explored the relationship between the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and cough. ACE inhibitors were present in 6 per cent of cases, but in 75 per cent of reports of cough. F/M was 1.29 (NS) for all reports concerning ACEI, 1.28 for cough unrelated to ACEI, 2.1 for cough with ACEI (P < 0.05). Cough was present in 12 per cent of all reports concerning ACEI. There was no clear difference between ACEI for cough or sex ratio; women cough more with ACEI. This does not seem related to greater ACEI use by women or to greater sensitivity of women to cough. The reason for this sex difference remains to be explained. There are large amounts of essentially underutilized data in drug surveillance databases. How they can or should be used remains to be validated.", 
    "19": "The efficacy and safety of trandolapril alone and in combination with a calcium channel blocker were evaluated in 13,147 hypertensive patients over 60 years old. Two patient groups were constituted. After a 2-week wash-out period, the patients in group I received monotherapy with trandolapril 2 mg/day for 4 weeks. Trandolapril was continued for another 4 weeks in responding patient, otherwise the dosage of trandolapril was doubled or another antihypertensive was added. Group 2, composed of patients previously treated with a calcium channel blocker with insufficient efficacy, was treated according to the same treatment regimen, but the calcium channel blocker was maintained throughout the study. 13,147 patients (group 1: 11,329 patients, group 2: 1,818 patients) with a mean age of 68 +/- 7 years were followed. After 4 weeks of treatment, the blood pressure measured by mercury sphygmomanometer decreased from 176 + 11/99 +/- 8 mmHg to 164 +/- 12/87 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.0001). This blood pressure fall was similar in group 1 (-22 +/- 12/-12 +/- 8 mmHg) and in group 2 (-21 +/- 11/-12 +/- 8 mmHg). In the pure systolic HT subgroup treated by trandolapril monotherapy, the antihypertensive effect predominantly affected the SBP (-23 +/- 12/- 4 +/- 6 mmHg). The antihypertensive effect was correlated with the initial blood pressure. In group 1, in the case of insufficient response to trandolapril monotherapy, the addition of a calcium channel blocker was the strategy which achieved the most marked antihypertensive effect (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). This bitherapy was more effective than the trandolapril+diuretic combination (-18 +/- 11/- 11 +/- 8 mmHg and -15 +/- 10/- 9 +/- 7 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.001). A total of 1,270 adverse events were reported by 996 patients (7.6%), leading to discontinuation of treatment in 372 patients (2.8%). The most frequent adverse effects were cough (2.8%), headache (0.8%), vertigo (0.8%) and nausea (0.5%). Only one minor equivalent of angioneurotic oedema was reported. In conclusion, trandolapril is effective and well tolerated in elderly hypertensive patients. In the case of pure systolic HTA, its action is essentially exerted on SBP. The combination of trandolapril+calcium channel blocker appears to be the most effective strategy in the case of incomplete blood pressure control by trandolapril alone.",

    "24": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in the developed world. Proteinuria (\"macroalbuminuria\" > 200 micrograms/min; or 300 mg/24 h) heralds a phase of established renal pathology with inexorable decline to end-stage renal disease, although its progression can be delayed by antihypertensive medication, in particular the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Control of blood pressure is vital; even if in the normal range, it is usually raised compared with that in nondiabetic control groups. Reducing blood pressure can lower the rate of decline of the glomerular filtration rate by 90%. Before established proteinuria there is a \"microalbuminuric\" (20-20 micrograms/min, or 30-300 mg/24 h) phase, and during this time preventive intervention may be effective. In so-called \"normotensive\" microalbuminuric subjects antihypertensive medications, in particular the ACEI, significantly reduce the progression to macroalbuminuria. Control of glycemia is important; recent evidence has shown that it is particularly important before the development of microalbuminuria; thereafter the role of glycemic control is not clear. Some researchers have suggested that protein restriction may be helpful, but more data are required. For the moment, improved glycemic control in the normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects and treatment with ACEI after the onset of microalbuminuria would seem appropriate in light of knowledge today. Furthermore, any level of hypertension is totally unacceptable and should be treated aggressively; the ACEI seem to be becoming the \"agents of choice.\"", 
    "25": "Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to prevent postexercise proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. To determine whether calcium antagonists have the same effect, 40 young healthy volunteers underwent maximal aerobic exercise with and without nifedipine 10 mg per os 1 h before the first or second trial. Urinary excretion of albumin (UAE), transferrin (UTE) and alpha 1-microglobulin (UME) were examined before and after each trial. UAE, UTE and UME were significantly increased after exercise. Nifedipine significantly decreased UAE (p = 0.001) and UTE (p = 0.02) after exercise, and slightly decreased the maximal work load and the basal excretion of albumin. UME was unchanged. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrate that nifedipine administration before exercise significantly reduces postexercise proteinuria.",

    "29": "The binding of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug oxaprozin to human serum albumin was studied by bioaffinity high-performance liquid chromatography using a column based on immobilized human serum albumin. Displacement studies using marker compounds for the major drug binding sites showed that oxaprozin has a high affinity for the benzodiazepine/indole site and binds to the warfarin site but with a significantly lower affinity. Biochromatography and ultrafiltration techniques were used to screen for possible competition and allosteric interactions between oxaprozin and potential co-administered drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antipyretics, hypoglycaemics, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, anaesthetics, metal ions and anticancer agents. Competition occurred mainly with drugs bound at the benzodiazepine site (benzodiazepines, various non-steroidal anti-inflammatories).", 
    "30": "Previous studies from our laboratory using exogenously administered neurokinin (NK) agonists have shown that both NK1- and NK2-receptor subtypes are involved in plasma extravasation in the guinea-pig airways. In the present study, we have extended these observations using antidromic vagal stimulation to stimulate sensory c-fibres as a means of eliciting the release of endogenous tachykinins in propranolol- and atropine-treated guinea-pigs. Antidromic vagal stimulation (5 ms, 30 s) induced frequency-dependent (1-10 Hz) bronchoconstriction that was completely abolished by co-administration of the NK1-selective antagonist CP-99,994 ((2s-methoxy-benzyl)-(2-phenyl-piperidin-3s-yl)-amine), and the NK2-selective antagonist SR-48,968 ((S)-N-methyl-N-[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenyl piperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) butyl]benzamide), each at a dose sufficient to block NK1 and NK2 receptors, respectively (each at 0.3 mg kg-1, i.v.). In contrast, SR-48,968 when given alone only partially blocked the vagal stimulation-induced bronchospasm, whereas CP-99,994 had no effect. Significant increases (2-3-fold) in plasma extravasation of [125I]fibrinogen in the trachea, main bronchi, distal airways and oesophagus following vagal stimulation (5 Hz, 5 min, 10 V, 5 ms) were observed. Pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan (1 mg kg-1, i.v.), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (1 mg kg-1, i.v.), potentiated both vagal stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction and plasma leakage in all tissues examined. This potentiation was due to reduced metabolism of endogenously released tachykinins since enhanced plasma overflow of immunoreactive substance P was observed following vagal stimulation in thiorphan- and enalapril-treated guinea-pigs. CP-99,994 substantially blocked plasma leakage in all parts of the airways and in the oesophagus. In comparison, SR-48,968 had no significant effect in the trachea and the oesophagus but partially inhibited plasma leakage in the main bronchi and distal airways. Co-administration of both CP-99,994 and SR-48,968 abolished the residual plasma leakage in these two regions. These results support the hypothesis that both NK1 and NK2 receptors are involved in tachykinin-induced pulmonary responses in the airways.", 
    "31": "1. In eight hypertensive patients with ACE inhibitor-induced cough the resolution of the cough was examined in a prospective observational study over 4 weeks duration. Resolution of cough was measured by visual analogue scales and questionnaire at baseline and days 3, 7, 14 and 28. In addition changes in cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin, and skin responses to bradykinin and substance-P were measured at the same time points. 2. All patients recorded significant subjective improvement in cough questionnaire scores for severity and night time waking, and by visual analogue scales for severity and frequency of cough (all P < 0.0005 for trend from day 0-28). Significant changes in subjective measures were recorded by 3 to 7 days for most measures, but further reductions were observed up to day 28 (all P < 0.01 day 28 vs day 0). 3. The sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin fell over the 28 days of study after stopping enalapril. The potency of capsaicin relative to day 0 was reduced to 0.25 (95% CI 0.07-0.87) by day 14, and to 0.20 (95% CI 0.06-0.67) by 28 days. 4. After stopping enalapril there was a highly significant reduction in wheal area produced by intradermal bradykinin, with the majority of the effect seen by day 3 (P < 0.0005). The wheal area to intradermal substance-P also declined with time after stopping enalapril, but significant changes were not observed until 14 days (P < 0.01). 5. Multiple regression analysis of the rates of decline for the subjective and objective measures of cough showed significant associations between the response to inhaled capsaicin and the VAS scores for severity of cough (P = 0.005) and frequency of cough (P = 0.011). Capsaicin response was not related significantly to the severity of cough measured by self-administered questionnaire. 6. There was a significant association between bradykinin response and VAS scores for frequency of cough (P < 0.04) and severity of cough (P < 0.05), but not with cough by questionnaire or the capsaicin response. The response to substance-P did not relate significantly to any of the measures of cough. 7. Cough caused by enalapril improved markedly by 14 days but took up to 28 days to resolve. It was associated with increased sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin which decreased over 28 days, and which paralleled changes in subjective cough scores.",

Forty-five consecutive critically patients suffering from trauma or postoperative complications were randomly separated into three groups (15 patients in each group) receiving either 0.25 mg h-1 or 0.50 mg h-1 enalaprilat, respectively, or saline solution as placebo (= control group). The infusion was continued for 5 days. 3. Haemodynamic and respiratory parameters were intensively monitored on admission to the intensive care unit (= 'baseline' values) and daily during the next 5 days. 4. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased significantly only in the enalaprilat-treated patients, whereas heart rate (HR) remained unchanged in these patients. 5. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were decreased by enalaprilat (0.50 mg h-1: PAP (mean +/- s.d.) decreased from 28.0 +/- 4.1 to 24.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) and remained significantly lower than in the control group. In the untreated control group, cardiac index (CI), oxygen consumption (VO2I) and oxygen delivery (DO2I) significantly decreased, which was blunted by enalaprilat infusion. Oxygen extraction (O2-extr) increased in both enalaprilat groups (0.25 mg h-1: from 26.1 +/- 5.5 to 30.4 +/- 4.0%; 0.50 mg h-1: 25.2 +/- 5.6 to 30.9 +/- 4.4%) and decreased in the control patients. 6. Right ventricular haemodynamics improved by enalaprilat infusion (0.50 mg h-1: RVEF increased from 40.0 +/- 3.5 to 45.5 +/- 4.0%). Lactate plasma concentrations decreased in the group with 0.50 mg h-1 enalaprilat (from 1.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg dl-1) and increased in the control patients. 7. Continuous infusion of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat exerted beneficial cardiorespiratory effects in the critically ill. The widespread common risk of altered perfusion with decreased CI, DO2, VO2, O2-extr and increased lactate concentration was blunted by enalaprilat infusion. 8. Although 0.5 mg h-1 enalaprilat was most effective, a dose of 0.25 mg h-1 also showed beneficial haemodynamic effects in the critically ill.", 
    "33": "We investigated whether patients with cough due to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have a common pattern of airway responses to methacholine inhalation. Studies assessing only presence or absence of hyperresponsiveness to this agent have produced conflicting results. Spirometric testing before and after methacholine was performed in 14 hypertensive patients at least two weeks after discontinuation of these inhibitors, when cough had abated or disappeared. Subjects were predominantly female (86%) nonsmokers (93%), with high prevalence of respiratory atopic illnesses (57%) probably due to ethnic background (72% Hispanic). Premethacholine spirometric values were normal. Postmethacholine bronchoconstriction of varying degrees was observed in seven patients, but reached the level of hyperresponsiveness in only one patient with asthma. The other seven subjects exhibited no bronchoconstriction. The two groups did not differ in age, concomitant illnesses (e.g., atopy) and medications, or blood pressure reduction. We conclude that airway responses to cholinergic stimulation do not exhibit a common pattern and are randomly distributed in hypertensive patients who develop cough induced by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "34": "Magnesium sulphate has antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties, a coronary and systemic vasodilating action, a direct myocardial protective effect in experimental and clinical models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Two meta-analyses have pooled the results of several small studies that had analyzed the effect of controlled hypermagnesiemia in acute myocardial infarction before the advent of thrombolytic and antithrombotic therapies. The results have shown a more than 50% mortality reduction, with a minimum estimated benefit of about 30%, and a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias of about 50%. In LIMIT-2, a double-blind trial of 2,316 patients where magnesium was administered as a 8 mMol bolus followed by a 24-hour infusion of 65 mMol, a 24% reduction in mortality was observed. However, these data have not been confirmed in the more than 58,000 patients of the ISIS-4 trial. In this study magnesium, at the same dose of the LIMIT trial, did not reduce 5-week mortality, neither in the general population (7.64% versus 7.24% in control patients, p = n.s.) nor in specific subgroups. The results of ISIS-4 have excluded the routine use of magnesium sulphate in acute myocardial infarction in the era of fibrinolysis and aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. Nevertheless, magnesium administration could still be considered in certain clinical situations, such as 1) the presence of contraindications to fibrinolysis and aspirin, 2) the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias unresponsive (or as an alternative) to lidocaine, 3) severe hypertension when beta-blockers are not indicated.",

We therefore performed a meta-analysis of articles on this subject. The secondary objective in our meta-analysis was to study whether there is any difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients in antiproteinuric response to blood pressure reduction. To identify all articles we performed a computer search using the bibliographic databases. To minimize publication bias, only trials in which a direct comparison was made between an ACEi and another antihypertensive were included. Studies performed both in diabetic and in non-diabetic patients were eligible. Included were 41 studies, comprising 1124 patients, of which 558 had non-diabetic renal disease. The mean antiproteinuric effect of ACEi was significantly greater than that of their comparator drugs: -39.9% (95% confidence interval: -42.8 to 36.8%) versus -17.0% (-19.0 to -15.1%) respectively (difference 24% (19.5 to 28.6%)). The blood-pressure-lowering effect was equal: -12.0% (-12.8 to -11.2%) versus -11.4% (-11.7 to -11.1%) respectively (difference -0.8% (-1.8 to 0.2%)). Thus it may be concluded that ACEIs confer an antiproteinuric effect beyond that attributable to their blood-pressure-lowering effect. A wide interstudy variation in antiproteinuric response to non-ACEI antihypertensives was observed. Multiple variable regression analysis was performed to assess which factors may explain this heterogeneity. From the comparator drugs, the class was of no importance: calcium-channel antagonists (CCA), beta-blockers, and a rest group of other drug types showed a similar response. Patient characteristics such as initial GFR and blood pressure partly explained the variation in response, but most of it appeared dependent on the blood pressure reduction achieved. Furthermore the type of CCA is of importance, with nifedipine having the least effect. A significantly greater antiproteinuric effect of 'non-ACEI' antihypertensives was found in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetics. However, this coincided with a greater blood pressure reduction in diabetics. Adjusted for differences in blood pressure control, diabetics showed even a slightly lesser antiproteinuric response to non-ACEI antihypertensive compared to non-diabetics.", 
    "36": "Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, we compared the effects on left ventricle (LV) and BP of 6-month treatment with a calcium antagonist or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in 36 hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (group 1, 18 subjects treated with sustained-release isradipine; group 2, 18 subjects treated with perindopril). At the basal evaluation, the two groups had comparable BP and LV parameters. After treatment, both groups showed a similar and significant reduction in 24-h, day- and night-systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP). The reduction in LV mass index was greater (p < 0.01) in group 2. In group 1, percentage of decrease of LV mass correlated significantly with percentage of decrease in 24-h and daytime BP; this was not true of group 2. Together with the reduction in LV hypertrophy, there was a significant increase of peak lengthening rate of LV diameter that was greater (p < 0.01) in group 1. Both drugs can reduce LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic function. The reduction of hypertrophy induced by perindopril appears to be partly independent of BP decrease and therefore partly related to a direct action of perindopril on the myocardium.", 
    "37": "A single-blind, run-in, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled comparison trial was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of low-dose amlodipine 2.5 mg daily, low-dose benazepril 10 mg daily, and the combination of the two drugs at the same doses used once daily in patients (n = 401) with mild to moderate (stages I and II) systemic hypertension. Both monotherapy regimens were shown to significantly reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with baseline placebo values, and the combination regimen was shown to be superior in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with either of the monotherapy regimens. The combination therapy also resulted in a greater percentage of patients having successful clinical response in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure. The amlodipine and benazepril regimen was also shown to be associated with a similar incidence of adverse experiences as the active monotherapy or placebo regimens, although the group given combination therapy appeared to have a lower incidence of edema than the group given amlodipine alone. Low-dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) plus benazepril (10 mg) provides greater blood-pressure-lowering efficacy than either monotherapy, and has an excellent safety profile.", 
    "38": "The effects of dialyzer membrane material and concurrent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on plasma bradykinin levels during hemodialysis were investigated by administration of 3 successive hemodialyses using a PAN DX membrane dialyzer and another 3 using a polysulfone membrane dialyzer with the order of the 2 sequences randomized, for 6 patients receiving concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitor and 6 others receiving no ACE inhibitor. With the PAN DX membrane dialyzer the plasma bradykinin concentration obtained from the dialyzer outlet was significantly higher than that from the inlet at 10 min, but not at 5 min after initiation of dialysis, whereas no significant difference between inlet and outlet bradykinin concentrations was observed at either time with the polysulfone membrane dialyzer. No significant difference was observed between the changes in plasma bradykinin concentration in cases involving concurrent ACE inhibitor and that in cases receiving no ACE inhibitor. The results suggest that the PAN DX membrane dialyzer stimulates bradykinin production, but also that its release of bradykinin is delayed, possibly because of adsorption and modified release of bradykinin by the PAN DX membrane, and that ACE inhibitor may have no significant effect on the change in plasma bradykinin levels.", 
    "39": "Clinical studies of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with glomerular disease have shown the clinical efficacy of these agents. Fifteen renal transplant hypertensive and proteinuric patients on triple drug treatment with cyclosporin (CSA), azathioprine and methylprednisolone entered the therapeutic protocol of this study. All patients followed up last year had stable graft function (serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dl). Hypertension was treated by nifedipine retard and occasionally by furosemide. Patients with a renal artery graft stenosis, at least as judged by technetium-scan imaging were excluded. In order to evaluate the possible role of ACE inhibitors on hypertension and proteinuria, perindopril 4 mg/daily was added for two months to the above regimen. Two patients, who showed a reversible deterioration of renal function during treatment and three who did not comply to the therapeutic protocol were excluded. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as 24 h urine protein was found to be significantly (p < 0.01) reduced at the end of the two-month combined treatment with perindopril and nifedipine retard in comparison to the result of monotherapy with nifedipine retard. GFR and ERPF showed no significant difference (NS) between the two modes of treatment. It is suggested that the combined treatment with nifedipine retard and perindopril is more effective than the monotherapy with nifedipine retard in the management of moderate to severe post-transplant hypertension and proteinuria of renal transplant patients.", 
    "40": "14 healthy subjects (8 males and 6 females), aged 25-40 years, were studied before and after oral administration of a single dose of 50 mg captopril as well as after 3 d treatment with 100 mg captopril daily per os. We found that in addition to the well-known effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, captopril, after 3 d treatment, significantly increases plasma and urinary kallikrein activity, plasma vasopressin and urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2. Atrial natriuretic peptide did not change significantly after either the single dose or the short-term treatment. We conclude that the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril could be mediated by increasing activity of the kallikrein-kinin system and of PGE2 without any participation of atrial natriuretic peptide.", 
    "41": "To evaluate the long-term effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on vascular angiotensin II (AII), eicosanoid production and vascular reactivities, we treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with alacepril for 6 weeks and perfused the isolated mesenteric arterial bed which contains resistance vessels. Alacepril significantly lowered the arterial blood pressure. Changes in perfusion pressure in response to norepinephrine (NE) were attenuated, and isoproterenol-stimulated AII release from the perfused mesenteric arterial beds was inhibited in the alacepril-treated SHR. Vasodilation induced by acetylcholine (Ach) and prostacyclin (PGI2) release was significantly increased in the vasculature of the alacepril-treated SHR. Alacepril exerted no effect on cyclic GMP (cGMP) formation, but increased cAMP formation in the vasculature. These findings suggest that ACEI inhibits AII formation and facilitates PGI2 production in the resistance vessels, which leads to blunting of the pressor response to NE and improvement of endothelial function in SHR. These humoral and mechanical changes in the vasculature may contribute to the depressor and organ protective effects of ACEI.", 
    "42": "1. Current therapy of heart failure relies on diuretics, positive inotropic compounds and vasodilators. The short-term haemodynamic benefits, especially of the cAMP generators, may be compromised by long-term limitations leading to an increased mortality. In contrast, some vasodilators, especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, improve survival even in severe heart failure. 2. Modulation of Na(+)- or K(+)-channels and calcium sensitization are positive inotropic mechanisms whose promise in treatment of heart failure needs to be fully explored. 3. The introduction of vasodilator therapy has been a significant advance. Newer compounds act to inhibit the endogenous vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin, or to potentiate the endogenous vasodilators atrial natriuretic factor and nitric oxide. The full potential of these compounds is yet to be realised.", 
    "43": "Transdermal system(s) bearing captopril were developed using a low temperature casting method and aqueous based polymers viz., eudragit RL-100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The developed system(s) were subjected to an in vitro characterization study. The results were compared with the transdermal systems of the same composition prepared at room temperature. The study revealed that the system(s) prepared using the low temperature casting method performed better in comparison to those prepared at room temperature. The developed system(s) followed zero order release kinetics.", 
    "44": "A 17-year-old male with neurofibromatosis presented with severe hypertension secondary to an abdominal aortic coarctation and bilateral renal artery stenoses. Despite previous surgical bypass grafts and aggressive medical management, including treatment with diuretics, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and direct vasodilator agents, severe hypertension persisted. Following intravascular stent placement in the aorta and both renal arteries, blood pressures normalized.", 
    "45": "The past few decades have seen a remarkable development in the field of pharmacological therapy, one of the most notable examples being the treatment of arterial hypertension. Some of the early anti-hypertensive agents were relatively crude by today's standards, but gradually efficacy, tolerability, or both, of blood pressure-lowering (BP) drugs have been improved. It is presently possible to choose from a number of effective and well-tolerated compounds for the treatment of hypertension. The latest additions to the anti-hypertensive armamentarium are the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, the most advanced of these being losartan. It is perhaps most relevant to compare losartan to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, another class of anti-hypertensive agents which acts mainly by interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Studies have shown that losartan lowers BP at least as effectively as ACE inhibitors. However, the side-effect profile of losartan is more favourable. In particular cough, a relatively common side-effect of ACE inhibitors, has been shown to be significantly less common during losartan treatment. This is probably because losartan does not interfere with bradykinin metabolism, unlike the ACE inhibitors. Regarding the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a powerful risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, we have shown that losartan is more effective in this regard than treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol. It appears, based on these and other findings, that interference with the RAAS is particularly useful in causing reversal of the cardiovascular hypertrophic changes. The prognostic implications remain to be demonstrated, but it would be logical to expect a benefit from this effect. It was recently shown that polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease even in the absence of conventional risk factors. If these findings are confirmed the interest in interfering with the RAAS as a therapeutic modality in hypertension would obviously be strengthened. It is not easy to predict the future role of any new therapeutic modality. The positive relation between efficacy and tolerability of losartan, as well as the fact that several observations suggest that interference with the RAAS could be favourable from a prognostic point of view, suggest that losartan may come to play an important role in the future treatment of hypertension.", 
    "46": "One hundred and thirty five non-smoking hypertensive patients with ACE inhibitor cough confirmed by lisinopril rechallenge and placebo dechallenge were recruited into a double-blind random parallel-group comparison of losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg each given once daily for a maximum of 8 weeks. The aim of the study was to compare the incidence of cough with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with previous ACE inhibitor cough. Cough detected by self-administered questionnaire was the primary end-point, and cough frequency by visual analogue scale a secondary end-point. The incidence of cough with losartan (29%) was lower than that for lisinopril (72%, P < 0.01) and similar to that for hydrochlorothiazide (34%). Cough frequency by visual analogue scale was lower for losartan than lisinopril (P < 0.01) and similar to that for hydrochlorothiazide. The specific selective AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is significantly less likely than lisinopril to cause cough in patients who previously have had ACE inhibitor cough. ACE inhibitor cough is likely to be related to non-specific kininase II inhibition.", 
    "47": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) raises blood pressure (BP) by a number of actions, the most important ones being vasoconstriction, sympathetic nervous stimulation, increased aldosterone biosynthesis and renal actions. Other Ang II actions include induction of growth, cell migration, and mitosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, increased synthesis of collagen type I and III in fibroblasts, leading to thickening of the vascular wall and myocardium, and fibrosis. These actions are mediated by type 1 Ang II receptors (AT1), and may be blocked by losartan, a specific blocker of AT1 receptors. In particular, studies employing losartan have shown that Ang II is an important contributor to BP regulation and plays a significant role in hypertension and in the pathophysiology of vascular damage during the course of hypertension. Ang II is also involved in the process of atherosclerosis and in remodelling and repair processes of the myocardium following myocardial infarction. Finally, increased Ang II is an important part of neurohumoral activation in heart failure. Exciting new discoveries concerned with polymorphisms of genes coding for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen suggest that Ang II may be genetically associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "48": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of moexipril, a non-sulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in older patients with hypertension. One hundred and seventy two hypertensive men and women, 65-80 years old, with seated DBP between 95 and 114 mm Hg were studied. The study was a 2 year, multicentre (12 centres), open-label protocol of moexipril monotherapy or combination therapy (with hydrochlorothiazide). Blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, adverse effects and laboratory studies were assessed following moexipril at 7.5 or 15 mg once daily or 7.5 or 15 mg daily in combination with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide if the seated DBP remained > or = 90 mm Hg on moexipril monotherapy. The primary measure of efficacy was a change from baseline in seated DBP. Secondary outcome measures included changes in seated DBP, pulse rate, laboratory parameters and adverse side-effects. Following 1 year of therapy in 135 patients, the BP fell 16/14 mm Hg among patients receiving moexipril monotherapy and 27/17 mm Hg for those receiving combined therapy compared with baseline (P < 0.001 for both). After 2 years of treatment, reductions were similar in 120 patients. Nineteen patients (11%) were prematurely withdrawn from the study because of inadequate therapeutic response and 28 (16%) because of adverse experiences. There were no significant changes in pulse rate or postural reductions in BP on either moexipril monotherapy or combination treatment. Three adverse side-effects occurred at a frequency exceeding 2% that were possibly or probably attributable to moexipril or combination therapy: hypotension (2%), dizziness (6%) and increased cough (12%). There were no clinically relevant mean group changes from baseline laboratory values in the treatment groups. In conclusion, these long-term data demonstrate that moexipril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, has long-term anti-hypertensive efficacy and is generally well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension.", 
    "49": "Twenty mild to moderate hypertensive subjects (11 men, 9 women, mean age 54.3 years, range 39-65 years) were studied to determine whether an intravenous form of captopril could be as safe and efficacious as an oral form and to estimate the time course of anti-hypertensive action over a wide dose range (100-fold) of i.v. doses versus oral captopril and placebo. Each subject demonstrated supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < or = 90 mm Hg following prospective ACE inhibitor monotherapy, with return of supine DBP to within 95-110 mm Hg 4 weeks after ACE inhibitor discontinuation. These subjects were then admitted to an inpatient unit for six 24 h periods; an initial acclimation period followed by five single doses of i.v. captopril (1.25, 12.5 and 125 mg) or placebo given as a 20 min infusion and oral captopril (25 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, double-dummy crossover study. Each dose was separated by 48 h. All 20 patients completed the study with no clinically significant adverse events. Captopril at doses of 125 mg i.v., 12.5 mg i.v. and 25 mg orally produced similar BP reductions over the 12 h postdose interval, and were more effective in lowering BP than intravenous captopril 1.25 mg or placebo. The 125 mg intravenous captopril dose was no more effective overall in BP reduction than the 12.5 mg i.v. and 25 mg oral doses and was associated with a greater incidence of adverse events. Treatment with 12.5 mg i.v. captopril is safe and comparable to 25 mg oral therapy.", 
    "50": "High blood pressure (BP) in the elderly must not be ignored as a normal consequence of aging. The criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension and the necessity to treat it are the same in elderly and younger patients. The aim of treatment of elderly hypertensive patients is to decrease BP safely and to reduce risk factors associated with cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The treatment of elderly hypertensive patients should be adjusted according to the needs of the individual, based upon age, race, severity of hypertension, co-existing medical problems, other cardiovascular risk factors, target-organ damage, risk-benefit considerations and costs. In addition to the elevated BP, other cardiovascular risk factors include smoking, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypercreatininaemia, peripheral vascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microalbuminuria (or albuminuria). Thus, the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy in elderly hypertensive patients should be based not only on the expected response, but also on the effects of therapy on lipid, potassium, glucose and uric acid levels, and left ventricular anatomy and function. Co-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, renal failure, gout, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidaemia and peripheral vascular disease) are major determinants for the selection of antihypertensive medications. With previous therapies (diuretics, beta-blockers, etc.), good BP control in the elderly was associated with clear and statistically significant reductions in stroke-related morbidity and mortality, but the overall effects on cardiovascular and renal complications of hypertension was either more variable or less obvious. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not only efficacious antihypertensive agents in the elderly, but also appear promising in counteracting some of the cardiovascular and renal consequences of hypertension. They are well tolerated and have a relatively low incidence of adverse effects. ACE inhibitors possess ancillary characteristics that are potentially beneficial for many elderly patients, including reduction of left ventricular mass, lack of metabolic and lipid disturbances, no adverse CNS effects, no risk of induction of heart failure, and a low risk of orthostatic hypotension. Since ACE inhibitors may improve perfusion to the heart, kidney and brain, they are well worth considering for the treatment of elderly patients with hypertensive target organ damage, especially in patients with heart failure, and diabetic patients with early nephropathy.", 
    "51": "Ischaemic myocardiopathy mandates the control of coronary risk factors and the administration of antiplatelet therapy. If myocardial ischaemia exists, an antianginal treatment will be prescribed. In case of heart failure, the association of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics is required. A beta-blocker, especially at low dose, should be discussed according to the symptoms. When ischaemic cardiomyopathy is asymptomatic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is also likely to benefit the patient. Coronary revascularization may be indicated according to the importance of both residual ischaemia and resistance to medical therapy.", 
    "52": "Stable angina is usually due to coronary atherosclerosis and complicated by myocardial lesions responsible for ischaemic myocardiopathy. Tobacco suppression, aspirin and cholesterol lowering drugs especially statins are the best way to slow coronary atherosclerosis progression. beta-blockers, physical conditioning are the two main medical means to suppress anginal symptoms. Converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are useful to slow the progression rate of ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Revascularisation procedures are combined with medical treatment and help treating symptoms and preventing myocardial lesions.", 
    "53": "During the past 15 years, the in-hospital mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction has considerably declined. The 2 main reasons for this decrease in mortality have been the introduction of intensive coronary care units, and reperfusion of myocardial infarction, either by coronary thrombolysis or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. However benefits of other therapies should not be overlooked. General care measures should include: close supervision, bed rest, liquid diet, analgesics, reduction of anxiety, oxygen therapy, intravenous heparin and aspirin, monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, combined or not with thrombolytic therapy, are also available to reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity. The benefits to be expected from these 2 medications combined have not yet been demonstrated, so that it appears reasonable in common practice to choose either drug according to the patient's functional state.", 
    "54": "A 67-year-old man presented with a high fever and a generalized rash. His extended hospital stay was characterized by fever with repeated staphylococcal bacteremia and the appearance of axillary lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Skin lesions became hyperpigmented, dry, and atrophic with areas of exfoliation and uclers. Examination of skin and lymph node biopsy specimens showed findings consistent with mycosis fungoides. The patient unexpectedly recovered on discontinuation of captopril. A positive macrophage inhibiting factor response for both captopril and enalapril indicated that the non-sulfhydryl moiety was the antigenic stimulant for the lesion resembling mycosis fungoides.", 
    "55": "From the five broad classes of antihypertensive drugs that have been in use long enough for adequate clinical experience to be obtained, the most recent report of the Joint National Committee on Hypertension recommends drugs from two older classes--the diuretics and the beta-adrenergic blockers--as first-line treatment. This article argues that newer drugs and in particular the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be equally or more appropriate as first choice. Physicians should choose on the basis of a drug's pharmacologic properties and the patient's clinical profile, rather than according to a generic set of rules. Considering that the goals of modern antihypertensive therapy are not only lowering of blood pressure to prevent complications, but also long-term cardioprotection without adverse effects on the quality of life, some newer drugs might even prove more cost-effective in the long run.", 
    "56": "The stability of ramipril in water, in apple juice, and in applesauce was studied. The contents of a single capsule each of ramipril 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg were mixed in glass beakers with 120 mL of deionized and filtered water, apple juice, or applesauce. Each mixture was apportioned into 10 120-mL amber polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers. Five of the containers in each set were stored at 23 degrees C, and samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. The other five containers were stored at 3 degrees C, and samples were taken at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours. The samples were analyzed for ramipril concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The quantity of drug remaining in the PET container after \"administration\" was determined by mixing the contents of single 5-mg ramipril capsules with 60 mL of apple juice, pouring the mixture into a waste receptacle, rinsing the PET container three separate times with 10 mL of water, and analyzing the pooled fluid from these rinses for ramipril concentration by HPLC. Under no condition did the percentage of ramipril remaining drop below 90%. No peaks for degradation products appeared in the chromatograms. The mean +/- S.D. quantity of ramipril remaining in the PET containers after draining was 0.3 +/- 0.3% for the apple juice. Ramipril from 1.25-, 2.5-, and 5-mg capsules mixed in water, in apple juice, and in applesauce was stable for 24 hours at 23 degrees C and for 48 hours at 3 degrees C.",

    "58": "To determine whether ACE inhibitor other than captopril improves insulin sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension, we measured insulin sensitivity to glucose utilization using SSPG method in 10 lean hypertensive subjects before and after chronic cilazapril treatment (1.5 +/- 0.2 mg/day, 15.6 +/- 2.1 weeks). The results were compared with those obtained in 10 healthy control subjects. SSPG obtained by insulin sensitivity test was significantly higher in hypertensive subjects, indicating a lower insulin sensitivity than in controls. After cilazapril treatment, SSPG reduced significantly to the level which was statistically not different from control subjects. Hyperinsulinemia diminished after treatment, while no significant change of blood glucose was observed during oral glucose tolerance test in hypertensive subjects. Plasma HDL cholesterol increased by cilazapril treatment. Cilazapril treatment has beneficial effect in the reversal of insulin resistance in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "59": "A one-year open study was focused on the therapeutic effect and tolerance of spirapril in 171 patients with mild to moderate hypertension in 11 centres in the Czech and Slovak Republic. The antihypertensive effectiveness was investigated after four weeks, after 12 weeks and after 52 weeks. Only the results recorded after one year are reported. The study was completed after one year by 139 patients, incl. 120 (86.3%) with a normal diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or less. The study was not completed by 32 patients (18.8%): because treatment was not effective--9.4%, because of undesirable effects--4.7%, 3.5% were eliminated by the investigators for various reasons (change of domicile, poor collaboration) and 1.2% because the protocol was not respected. According to the analysis \"intention to treat\" the diastolic pressure was normalized by monotherapy with spirapril in 25.1% of the baseline group; combination of spirapril with bopindolol led to normalization of the pressure in another 38.0% patients and in 7.0% patients normal diastolic pressure was achieved by a combination of spirapril with a hydrochlorothiazide; i.e. a total of 70.1% of the baseline group had a normal diastolic pressure after one year of treatment. In another 9.4% of the baseline group the diastolic pressure declined by 10 mmHg or more but not to normal levels. Thus normalization or effective control of pressure was achieved after one year in 79.6% patients according to the analysis \"intention to treat\". The combination of spirapril and bopindolol proved very effective. Patients where it was necessary to combine spirapril with bopindolol or hydrochlorothiazide had significantly higher baseline readings of blood pressure. During treatment the authors did not record in any of the groups a change of lipids, potassium, uric acid, the haemogram, liver tests or creatinine. Treatment was well tolerated and undesirable effects were rare (most frequent side effects: cough 3.5%, vertigo also 3.5%). The results of the study indicate that spirapril is an effective and well tolerated ACE inhibitor in the treatment of hypertension and its combination with bopindolol is equally suitable as the combination of spirapril with hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "60": "Ultrasonic duplex scanning has been validated as a noninvasive method to evaluate the kidney arteries and hemodynamic characteristics of renal blood flow in patients with renal artery stenosis. The purpose of our study was to assess the changes in renal vascular impedance in 22 patients with renovascular hypertension, as compared with 45 essential hypertensives and 15 normotensives, by using the Doppler parameter resistance index (RI) before and after a captopril oral test. After the captopril test the delta RI decreased significantly in the stenotic artery (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that PRA values after captopril correlated inversely with the changes of RI only in the stenotic artery (P < 0.05). Thus, our findings suggest that the application of the captopril test to renal echo-Doppler may represent a feasible, noninvasive, and inexpensively useful tool in the screening studies aimed at diagnosing renovascular hypertension.",

    "65": "The effects of cilazapril on exercise tolerance and neurohumoral factors were investigated in old myocardial infarction (OMI) patients with asymptomatic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Cilazapril (0.5 mg) was administered once daily to OMI patients (n = 20) [NYHA class I, sinus rhythm, ejection fraction by radionuclide scanning < 50% (36.8 +/- 9.1%, mean +/- SD)]. Two weeks later, five patients were excluded from the study because of cough or hypotension, and 15 patients received 1.0 mg cilazapril once daily for the next 6 weeks. Exercise tolerance, neurohumoral factors and ejection fraction were measured in OMI patients before and after administration of cilazapril. Seven age-matched healthy adults served as the controls. OMI patients had latent heart failure because their exercise tolerance values and aldosterone levels were lower and alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide levels were higher than those in healthy subjects. In OMI patients, 8 weeks after cilazapril administration, exercise duration increased from 545 +/- 59 to 590 +/- 74 sec (p < 0.05), anaerobic threshold from 17.5 +/- 3.2 to 20.1 +/- 2.8 ml/min/kg (p < 0.05), peak-VO2 from 23.5 +/- 4.7 to 27.1 +/- 4.4 ml/min/kg (p < 0.05), plasma renin activity from 1.34 +/- 1.13 to 5.82 +/- 5.47 ng/ml/hr (p < 0.01) and alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide decreased from 100.7 +/- 44.3 to 80.5 +/- 28.0 pg/ml (p < 0.05).

    "73": "Studies conducted over the last decade demonstrated variable therapeutic efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on the progression of glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy. In this study, among patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, 53 patients in whom creatinine clearance had been monitored over 5 yr were recruited for study. These patients were classified into two groups according to whether or not renal function had declined as determined by the slope of creatinine clearance against time: group 1 had stable renal function; group 2 had declining renal function (average: -6.7 +/- 1.3 ml/min/yr). 21 of 53 patients were treated with ACE inhibitor and followed for 48 wk. Gene polymorphism consisting of insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp DNA fragment (presumed to be a silencer element) of the ACE gene was determined by PCR. 46 age-matched individuals without history of proteinuria were analyzed as controls. The DD genotype was significantly more frequent in group 2 (43%) than in controls (7%) or group 1 patients with stable renal function (16%). 48 wk after ACE inhibitor administration, proteinuria significantly decreased in patients with DD genotype but not in those with ID or II genotypes. The results indicate that deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene, particularly the homozygote DD, is a risk factor for progression to chronic renal failure in IgA nephropathy. Moreover, this deletion polymorphism predicts the therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibition on proteinuria and, potentially, on progressive deterioration of renal function.",

This study compares the delayed effects of a brief period of vasopressin V1A receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in young female and male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) on the development of hypertension in adult life. In a separate study, the role of vasopressin in the maintenance of blood pressure in adult SHR was assessed. Young SHR received either the nonpeptide vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist OPC-21268, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, or vehicle from 6 to 10 weeks of age. During the treatment period, OPC-21268 and ramipril reduced systolic blood pressure compared with control SHR (P < .001). Blood pressure in male SHR 7 weeks after treatment withdrawal was 178 +/- 1 mm Hg in ramipril-treated, 184 +/- 1 mm Hg in OPC-21268-treated, and 200 +/- 2 mm Hg in control SHR (P < .001). Similar results were seen in female SHR, although both OPC-21268 and ramipril were less effective antihypertensive agents in female compared with male SHR. The sustained attenuation in blood pressure was not associated with significant cardiovascular structural changes (left ventricular-to-body weight ratio, renal weight-to-body weight ratio, mesenteric resistance artery media-to-lumen ratio). Results of vasopressin V1A receptor binding kinetics and plasma renin or aldosterone concentrations did not suggest a lasting effect of OPC-21268 on the vasopressin system or of ramipril on the renin-angiotensin system following treatment withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Chronic administration of nitric oxide inhibitors provides a new model of hypertension with pronounced target organ damage. We investigated the effects of oral treatment with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 6 weeks on vascular reactivity of the aorta in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Certain rats received verapamil or trandolapril in addition to L-NAME. Systolic blood pressure increased in the L-NAME group (by approximately or equal to 80 mm Hg systolic) but not in controls or rats treated with verapamil or trandolapril. Isometric tension changes of aortic rings were recorded. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were reduced in the L-NAME group (58 +/- 6% versus 104 +/- 1% in placebo, P < .05) but were normalized by treatment with verapamil or trandolapril. In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were not significantly reduced in L-NAME hypertension but were slightly enhanced by trandolapril therapy (P < .05) in the L-NAME group only. In quiescent rings, acetylcholine caused endothelium-dependent contractions in particular after in vitro incubation with L-NAME. These contractions tended to be enhanced in L-NAME hypertension (23 +/- 4% versus 14 +/- 3% in the placebo group; P = NS) and were significantly reduced after treatment with verapamil or trandolapril (P < .05).

    "76": "To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition produces functional changes in the aorta normotensive rats, four groups of rats were studied in parallel for 6 weeks. Group 1 orally received ramipril and beta 2-kinin antagonist HOE140 500 micrograms/kg per day s.c. by injection for the remaining 2 weeks; group 3, hydralazine 100 mg/kg per day PO for 6 weeks; group 4 (control), subcutaneous injections of saline solution during the last 2 of 6 weeks. In aorta isolated from group 1 the relaxations induced by bradykinin, acetylcholine, and histamine were significantly potentiated compared with those of group 4. In group 3, despite a decrease in systolic blood pressure similar to that induced by ramipril treatment, the responses to these three endothelium-dependent vasodilators were not different from those of group 4. In group 2, bradykinin-induced relaxations were completely abolished whereas acetylcholine-induced and histamine-induced relaxations were to those of group 4. The inhibitory effect of the endothelium on serotonin-induced contractions was significantly increased in preparations of group 1 compared with those of groups 2 through 4. Indirect measurements of nitric oxide formation such as contractions evoked by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and aortic cGMP content were also significantly enhanced in preparations from group 1 compared with those of groups 2 through 4. Moreover, because the relaxations to nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were similar in groups 1, 2, and 4 an alteration of the guanylate cyclase activity by ramipril treatment is quite unlikely. Thus long-term treatment with ramipril potentiates the endothelium-dependent responses in the rat aorta by enhancing nitric oxide availability.",

Cardiac beta 1-adrenergic receptor density was decreased while its dissociation constant (Kd) was not altered in the viable tissue of the left ventricle of the CHF rat, which is consistent with beta-adrenergic receptor downregulation. Cardiac norepinephrine content decreased in the CHF rats. Rats were treated orally with ACE inhibitors, 3 mg/kg trandolapril or 10 mg/kg enalapril once daily, or 5 mg/kg captopril twice daily from the 2nd to the 12th weeks after the operation. Treatment with ACE inhibitors attenuated the reduction in cardiac output and stroke volume indices and improved the inotropic response to dobutamine and isoprenaline and reversed partially the cardiac norepinephrine content in the CHF rat. ACE inhibitor treatment also attenuated the reduction in beta 1-adrenergic receptor density in the viable tissue of the left ventricle of the CHF rat.",

In contrast, in DCM, EDV showed a smaller increase than in the N group (two-way ANOVA: F = 5.98, P < .001), ESV increased (P < .001), and EF and PFR remained unchanged. After enalapril, the cardiac adaptations to volume loading were restored to normal. In particular, EDV, EF, and PFR increased (P < .001), and ESV was reduced (P < .001).

We looked for the effects of cilazapril on all phases of the response to injury, ie, on proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the media, their migration, their proliferation in the neointima, and their disposition of extracellular matrix in the neointima. Although treatment was discontinued after 2 weeks, the inhibitory effect of cilazapril on neointimal formation was evident even 52 weeks after injury. The amount of extracellular matrix deposited in the intima during cilazapril treatment was decreased by 20% 2 weeks after injury, but no effect was seen if tissues were analyzed at 4 or 52 weeks. [3H]Thymidine-labeled cells (pulse labeling as well as 14-day continuous labeling) showed a decrease in SMC labeling in the tunica medica by 50%, but no inhibition in the labeling indices was seen in the neointima. The fraction of unlabeled neointimal cells in the cilazapril-treated rats as judged from continuous labeling experiments was inhibited by 86%. Taken together, these data suggest an antiproliferative effect on medial SMCs and an inhibition of SMC migration into the intima by cilazapril. Since intimal extracellular matrix deposition was only delayed, the decrease in medial SMC proliferation and subsequent migration seems to be the main reason for the reduction of neointima formation.",

In an effort to provide more insight into this subject, we examined the effects of captopril on working capacity of patients who had low ejection fractions but no congestive heart failure after AMI. One hundred sixty-six participants were recruited from 5 centers after randomization to either captopril or placebo for the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study. Upright cycle ergometer tests were performed with continuous measurements of respiratory gases at 4, 12, and 24 months after AMI. Our study concurs with 2 of 3 previous post-AMI studies and supports the conclusion that working capacity is not affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition at 4 or 12 months after AMI in patients without congestive heart failure. In addition, no significant effect of captopril was noted at 24 months after AMI. Peak oxygen uptake tended to decrease between 12 and 24 months in the placebo group by an average (+/- SD) of -22 +/- 322 ml/min (n = 66), but to increase in the captopril group (+62 +/- 289, n = 57), a difference that was significant (Mann-Whitney chi-square, p = 0.02).

Known benefits of captopril appear not to include an increase in working capacity within the first 24 months after AMI.",

The results of recent clinical trials support a beneficial role for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in attenuating mortality from myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction.

Echocardiography is mandatory if CHF is a serious consideration after initial evaluation. Digitalis, diuretics, and vasodilators in the form of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the mainstays of pharmacologic therapy. Early use of ACE inhibitors for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and established CHF lessens morbidity and mortality. The number of expensive hospitalizations can be reduced by patient education and institution of a flexible therapeutic program guided by the patient's symptoms and daily weigh-ins.",

Symptoms and physical findings can be helpful in diagnosis but have limited sensitivity and specificity. Objective measurement of ventricular function is essential in virtually all patients in whom a diagnosis of heart failure is suspected. Reversible causes of heart failure must be sought. Outpatient management includes education and counseling, emphasis on and assessment of compliance with diet, and pharmacologic treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment but are underused, and maximal doses are not given apparently because of concern about side effects. Diuretic therapy should be administered only as needed to manage fluid overload. Calcium channel blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with impaired ventricular function. Patient follow-up should be guided by the results of the medical history and physical examination. Routine serial testing of ventricular function and exercise performance is discouraged.",

However, there have been many reports of persistent chronic dry cough and inflammatory skin reactions (rash and/or angioedema, etc.) induced by ACE inhibitors. In this study, in order to evaluate the cough and inflammatory reaction, we measured the number of citric acid-induced coughs and the intradermal inflammation with ovalbumin in guinea pigs consecutively treated with ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalaprilat and imidapril) for 3 days. The number of citric acid-induced coughs and the inflammatory responses were significantly enhanced by treatment with lisinopril and enalaprilat, whereas imidapril produced no change in either response. These results correspond to the frequency of adverse effects in clinical practice, which suggests that imidapril has the least ability to induce the inflammatory skin response and cough. Furthermore, the enhancement produced by the ACE inhibitors in the number of coughs and the inflammatory responses were significantly reduced by pretreatment with indomethacin (prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor). This finding suggests that PGs at least participate in the mechanism for ACE inhibitor-induced cough and inflammatory skin response.", 
    "101": "The pharmacodynamic profile of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril and its active diacid, moexiprilat, was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung. Upon oral administration of moexipril (10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats, plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased to undetectable levels, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 98% and plasma angiotensin I concentration increased 8.6-fold 1 h after dosing. At 24 h, plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, whereas plasma ACE activity was still inhibited by 56%. Four-week oral administration of moexipril (0.1-30 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered blood pressure and differentially inhibited ACE activity in plasma, lung, aorta, heart and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. Equidose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with moexipril and enalapril over 4 weeks led to comparable decreases in blood pressure, inhibition of plasma ACE and reduction of plasma angiotensinogen and to a similar attenuation of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and potentiation of the depressor responses to bradykinin. In contrast, ACE inhibition in aorta, heart and lung was significantly greater with moexipril than with enalapril, whereas in the kidney both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a similar extent. In summary, moexipril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that is comparable to enalapril in potency and duration of antihypertensive activity. The results of the present study demonstrate that 1) the antihypertensive potency of a given ACE inhibitor cannot be predicted from its in vitro characteristics and 2) the degree of blood pressure reduction does not correlate with tissue ACE inhibition.", 
    "102": "Plasma digitalis-like substance and altered function of arterial Na+,K(+)-ATPase have both been linked with elevated blood pressure, but the influence of antihypertensive therapy on these factors remains unknown. Therefore, we treated spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril for 10 weeks. The therapy markedly reduced blood pressure and plasma digoxin immunoreactivity, and it normalized the elevated plasma Na+:K+ ratio in the hypertensive animals. Relaxations of endothelium-denuded denervated arterial rings induced by return of potassium to the organ bath upon precontractions elicited by potassium-free solution were used to evaluate the function of vascular Na+,K(+)-ATPase. The rate of potassium relaxation was faster in quinapril-treated hypertensive rats and in both Wistar-Kyoto groups than in the hypertensive controls. Potassium relaxation was also effectively inhibited by the Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain in all groups. In addition, arterial contractions to potassium chloride and relaxations to nitroprusside were examined. The contractions to lower concentrations of potassium chloride (20 mM) were enhanced in untreated hypertensive rats when compared with the other groups, although the maximal responses were corresponding in all groups. The time to reach base-line tension after washout of potassium chloride (125 mM) and the relaxations to nitroprusside did not differ in the study groups. In conclusion, the present results showed that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in parallel reduced plasma digoxin-like factor, enhanced arterial potassium relaxation (probably reflecting enhanced function of Na+,K(+)-ATPase) and normalized plasma Na+:K+ ratio in this type of genetic hypertension.", 
    "103": "Combined neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition produces greater acute hemodynamic effects than either treatment alone. We investigated whether BMS-182657 (BMS), which bears inhibitory activities against both NEP and ACE, elicited similar enhanced effects. BMS inhibited NEP and ACE, in vitro (IC50 = 6 and 12 nM, respectively) and the pressor response to Ang I in rats. In deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats sensitive to NEP inhibition but not to ACE inhibition, BMS at 100 mumol/kg i.v. lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 180 +/- 6 to 151 +/- 5 mm Hg. In sodium-depleted, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) sensitive to ACE inhibition but not to NEP inhibition, BMS at 100 mumol/kg p.o. lowered MAP from 151 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 5 mm Hg. Cardiomyopathic hamsters with heart failure were administered vehicle or one of the following (30 mumol/kg i.v.): the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat; the NEP inhibitor SQ-28603; or BMS. Enalaprilat and SQ-28603 had minimal hemodynamic effects. BMS decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 1 mm Hg and left ventricular systolic pressure by 27 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 3 mm Hg at 30 and 60 min, respectively (P < .05 vs. each other group). These changes were associated with a 40% increase in cardiac output, a 47% decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a lowering of MAP by 21 +/- 3 mm Hg at 60 min (P < .05 vs. each other group). There were no significant differences in the changes in heart rate or left ventricular stroke work index among the four groups. Hence, BMS-182657 is a dual inhibitor of NEP and ACE, is antihypertensive irrespective of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and has acute hemodynamic effects in hamsters with heart failure greater than those produced by selective inhibition of NEP or ACE. The NEP and ACE inhibitory activities of BMS-182657 act synergistically and mimic the interaction resulting from combining selective inhibitors of these enzymes.", 
    "104": "Today indications for treatment of hypertension in older age are no longer contested, even if only systolic pressure is raised. The choice of the antihypertensive drug for elderly patients, however, depends on concomitant diseases. The diversity of the latter demands a judicious, individualized use of the available substances (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors). In elderly patients as well, a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk is achievable by pharmacotherapy. So far, however, such results have only been reported for the use of diuretics and beta-blockers, in purely systolic hypertension by diuretics exclusively; however smaller studies, suggest that comparably favorable results may be obtained with calcium antagonists.", 
    "105": "Because of their high morbidity and mortality, elderly people benefit most from drugs with a proven effect on disease complications and premature death. Thiazides, beta adrenergic blocking drugs, oral anticoagulants and aspirin are drugs that satisfy such criteria. These medications are comparatively well tolerated and cheap. They should not be neglected in favour of newer drugs with a less complete performance record.", 
    "106": "In this study, the formation of biologically active angiotensins from angiotensin I (Ang I) in isolated rat hearts was evaluated. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in Ang I metabolism was also investigated. HPLC analysis of heart perfusate showed that 125I-Ang I was metabolized extensively (single passage) in the rat coronary circulation in vitro leading to the formation of the biologically active angiotensins: angiotensin II (Ang II), Ang-(2-8), Ang-(3-8) and Ang-(1-7). Ang II was the major product identified in HPLC fractions, corresponding to 7.8 +/- 0.89% of the total radioactivity recovered. A similar profile was observed when single-passage metabolism of non-isotopic Ang I was evaluated by HPLC, followed by radioimmunoassay of the eluate fractions. When 125I-Ang I was perfused in the presence of ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, ramiprilat) in concentrations up to 130 microM, the formation of Ang II was only partially inhibited (approximately 50%). A similar tendency was observed for Ang-(2-8), Ang-(3-8) and Ang-(2-7). The formation of Ang-(1-7) and its related fragments Ang-(3-7) and Ang-(4-7) was not changed significantly by ACE inhibitors, although a slight increase in formation of these fragments was observed. No significant changes were observed for the carboxyl-terminal fragments of Ang I: Ang-(2-10), Ang-(3-10), and Ang-(4-10). The fractional metabolism of Ang I was not modified by ACE inhibition. These findings suggest that biologically active angiotensins can be formed from Ang I in the rat coronary circulation. These locally generated peptides may contribute to the actions of the renin-angiotensin system in the heart.", 
    "107": "A novel sensitive and specific method for the measurement of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity utilizing HPLC is described. ACE activity was determined in detergent-extracted canine hearts utilizing the synthetic ACE-specific substrate hippuryl histidyl leucine (HHL), both in the presence and the absence of the site-specific inhibitor captopril. Tissue ACE activity was quantitated from the moles of hippuric acid (HA) formed, in time-fixed assays, utilizing HPLC separation of HA from HHL and UV-spectrophotometry for quantitation of HA as in the standard Cushman and Cheung assay (Cushman DW and Cheung HS, Biochem Pharmacol 20: 1637-1648, 1971). Separation of HA from HHL was performed by reverse phase HPLC on a phenyl silica gel column with an eluent consisting of 20% acetonitrile in 0.1 M aqueous ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After the standard liquid/liquid extraction procedure with ethyl acetate, HPLC analysis revealed the presence of unreacted substrate, HHL, in amounts comparable to the product of interest, HA, in the final assay; moreover, the amount of HA formed did not fall completely to zero in the presence of captopril. Regional studies of canine cardiac ACE activity utilizing the HPLC-based assay and the standard assay method showed a significantly higher ACE activity in the right ventricle compared with the left ventricle (2.37 +/- 0.7 vs 1.24 +/- 0.18 mU/g, P < 0.05 [N = 6], respectively) in the HPLC-based assay, but no difference in right and left ventricular ACE activities by the standard assay (0.25 +/- 0.08 vs 0.31 +/- 0.09 mU/g [N = 6], respectively). Kinetic studies utilizing the HPLC-based assay coupled with the use of captopril showed Km (1.34 +/- 0.08 mM) and Vmax (36.8 +/- 11.5 x 10(-10) M/min) values in agreement with those in the literature. Our results demonstrate that the application of HPLC to the standard Cushman and Cheung assay improves the sensitivity and specificity of the standard assay and enables the use of much smaller amounts (approximately 4 vs approximately 400 mg for the Cushman and Cheung assay) of tissue for ACE activity assay.", 
    "108": "The effect of chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis has been investigated in two models of acute inflammation induced by carrageenin, i.e., paw oedema and pleurisy. Chronic inhibition of NO biosynthesis was achieved by including N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the drinking water to give a dose of approximately 75 mumol/rat/day for 2 and 4 weeks. Control animals received either tap water alone or the inactive enantiomer D-NAME. Since chronic NO inhibition increases blood pressure, rats made hypertensive (2 kidney-1 clip model; 2K-1C) were used to evaluate the effect of hypertension on the carrageenin-induced paw oedema. In a separate set of experiments, L-NAME-treated animals concomitantly received captopril (140 mumol/rat/day) to prevent hypertension. Animals chronically treated with L-NAME (but not D-NAME) for 2 and 4 weeks developed hypertension to the same extent as 2K-1C rats. Carrageenin-induced paw oedema was significantly reduced in animals chronically treated with L-NAME, but not with D-NAME or in 2K-1C rats. Subplantar injection of iloprost completely reversed the inhibition of paw oedema caused by L-NAME. Captopril (140 mumol/rat/day) significantly lowered the high blood pressure levels induced by L-NAME but did not significantly affect the inhibition of paw oedema caused by L-NAME. No changes in vascular permeability, as assessed by Evans blue extravasation, were observed in L-NAME-treated animals. The chronic treatment with L-NAME for 2 and 4 weeks did not inhibit carrageenin-induced leucocyte migration and fluid exudation into the pleural cavity. Although carrageenin-induced paw oedema is reduced in L-NAME-treated rats, this response reflects a decrease in local blood flow rather than an effect on vascular permeability.", 
    "109": "Management has changed dramatically: There is no doubt now that strict glycemic control protects against nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Direct evidence comes from study of intensive insulin therapy in IDDM. The implication is that similar protection can be gained in NIDDM. Microalbuminuria mandates ACE inhibition and dietary protein restriction. Proliferative retinopathy can be arrested with laser photocoagulation.", 
    "110": "Infarct expansion starts within hours to days after transmural myocardial injury. Previous echocardiographic and left ventriculographic studies demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy limits left ventricular dilatation, particularly in patients with anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or impaired left ventricular function. Forty-three patients with an acute Q-wave AMI were randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset to intravenous enalaprilat (1 mg) or placebo. Patients were then given corresponding oral therapy and followed for 1 month. Predrug and 1-month gated blood pool scans were obtained in 32 patients to evaluate changes in cardiac volumes and ejection fraction. Twenty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month to evaluate left ventricular infarct expansion. Blood pressure decreased at 6 hours but returned to baseline in both groups after 1 month of therapy. The change in cardiac volumes from baseline to 1 month differed between the placebo (end-diastolic volume +16 +/- 5 ml, end-systolic volume +8 +/- 6 ml), and enalapril (end-diastolic volume -8 +/- 9 ml and end-systolic volume -14 +/- 7 ml) groups (p < 0.05 vs placebo). Global and infarct zone ejection fractions improved significantly at 1 month in the enalapril group (+6 +/- 3% and 19 +/- 5%, respectively) but did not change over 1 month in the placebo group. Infarct segment length and infarct expansion index by magnetic resonance imaging were significantly less in those treated with enalapril, suggesting less infarct expansion in this group. Thus, early administration of enalaprilat to patients presenting with a first Q-wave AMI prevents cardiac dilatation and infarct expansion.", 
    "111": "Authors performed an open, crossover, multicenter study of oral cilazapril versus previous captopril treatment in mild to moderate hypertension. The treatment of the 100 outpatients on daily three or four times captopril was found ineffective, or in some cases side effects or non compliance necessitated a switch to a once daily dose of cilazapril. Reasons of ineffectivity were compliance problems in 76% of the patients during long term captopril therapy. Blood pressure decreased from 163.28 +/- 14.5/97.5 +/- 9.35 mmHg on captopril therapy to 136.67 +/- 12/83.49 +/- 7.77 mmHg at the end of a 12 week cilazapril treatment (p < 0.001). 80 patients received cilazapril monotherapy (with doses of 2.5 mg in 54 cases, 5 mg in 18 patients). 7.5 mg in 4 cases, 1 and 1.25 mg in 2 patients. In 20 patients an adjunctive diuretic was also added, while the cilazapril treatment was ineffective in 3 patients. In respect of the global evaluation and scoring of cilazapril versus captopril therapy, a clear and statistically significant improvement could be demonstrated in efficacy, tolerability and compliance after a 12 week cilazapril treatment. The 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement performed in 13 patients also verified a decrease in blood pressure achieved by cilazapril therapy. Authors conclude that in case of ineffectivity of three or four times daily captopril treatment (caused most likely by non-compliance), a switch to a once daily dose drug like cilazapril is indicated.",

Good blood glucose control and active antihypertensive treatment may stop or retard the further development towards renal failure. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors seem to have a renoprotective effect. In this article we suggest guidelines for the use of ACE-inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes and early diabetic nephropathy. Special concerns are included in respect of adolescents, pregnant women and persons with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "113": "The role of the autonomic and the renin-angiotensin (R-A) activities in short-term cardiovascular control during the bradycardic phase following severe hemorrhage was investigated in conscious rats. Spectral analysis of beat-to-beat fluctuations of the R-R interval (RRI), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in the 0.01-5-Hz range was carried out under control conditions and following a bleeding of 30% of total blood volume, with and without i.v. injection of atropine (2 mg/kg), prazosin (2 mg/kg), propranolol (5 mg/kg) or captopril (7 mg/kg). The bradycardic stage was characterized by: (i) an increase of the three oscillatory components exhibited by RRI variability which appears driven by vagal activity and buffered by beta-adrenergic activity, while the increase of the slower LF (0.01-0.2 Hz) oscillations seems driven by the slow alpha-adrenergic control; (ii) a decrease of SBP and DBP oscillations and absence of SBP-RRI correlation in the MF band (0.2-0.6 Hz) possibly related to a decrease in the sympathetic drive of SBP-MF and DBP-MF oscillations and in RRI baroreflex control; (iii) an increase in LF oscillations of SBP and even more of DBP that seems driven by the slow alpha-and beta-adrenergic control and buffered by the R-A control, responses possibly related to an increase of LF oscillations of peripheral resistance; (iv) the persistence of high SBP-RRI correlation in the LF band and in the respiratory band (1-3 Hz); the former seem to reflect the existence of a slow baroreflex control mediated by beta-adrenergic activity, the latter appears to be caused by feedforward mechanical effects of RRI changes on SBP.", 
    "114": "Diabetic complications are mostly vascular and involve alteration in blood vessel reactivity and permeability. The contribution of the latter dysfunction to the development of target organ damage has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we verify the acute effect of three peptidase inhibitors (phosphoramidon: N-(alpha-rhamnopyranosylhydroxyphosphinyl)-Leu-Trp, thiorphan: 3-mercapto-2-benzyl-propanoylglycine, and SQ 28,603: N-(2-mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]- < or = b-alanine; each at a dose of 2 mg/kg), as well as captopril ([2S]-1-[3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl]-L-proline; 10 mg/kg), and an aminopeptidase inhibitor (amastatin: ([(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoyl]-Val-Val-Asp; 2 mg/kg) on capillary extravasation abnormalities in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat using the Evans blue method. Untreated diabetic rats exhibited a significant enhancement of Evans blue extravasation in the duodenum, upper bronchus, pancreas and skin (175 +/- 19, 94 +/- 4, 95 +/- 9 and 47 +/- 10 micrograms/g dry tissue respectively compared to 67 +/- 9, 44 +/- 5, 47 +/- 4, and 6 +/- 2 micrograms/g dry tissue). The three endopeptidase inhibitors normalized capillary permeability in all tissues. Also, treatment with captopril was associated with complete correction of capillary dysfunction in the skin and partially in the duodenum, upper bronchus, and pancreas. These findings indicate for the first time that the use of neutral endopeptidase inhibitors may be beneficial in preventing capillary abnormalities in this diabetic rat model.", 
    "115": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is synthesized as a type 1 ectoprotein. It is released from the cell surface by a proteolytic cleavage-secretion process which is enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol esters. Here, we report the development of an in vitro cell-free assay system for the cleavage-secretion, its characterization, and the identification of a potent inhibitor of this process. Membranes prepared from ACE89 cells secreted the testicular isozyme of ACE (ACET) in a temperature- and time-dependent fashion. As expected, the in vitro secreted ACET lacked the membrane-anchoring carboxy-terminal tail of the cell-associated ACET. The in vitro secretase activity was resistant to high salt extraction and to inhibitors of serine, chymotrypsin, trypsin, cysteine, aspartate, and elastase type proteases. However, the activity was sensitive to metal ion chelators and to a synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative, compound 3, a known inhibitor of certain metalloproteases. Compound 3 very efficiently blocked both basal and phorbol ester-stimulated ACET secretion by ACE89 cells. The inhibition was rapid, dose-dependent, and reversible, and ACET synthesis, glycosylation, and transport were not affected. Cleavage-secretion of ACET in transiently transfected HeLa cells was also inhibited by compound 3. Finally, in vitro cleavage-secretion of the other isozyme of ACE, ACEP, by membranes isolated from rabbit lungs was strongly inhibited by compound 3. These results indicate that the cleavage-secretion of both isozymes of ACE is carried out by an integral membrane metalloprotease which is specifically inhibited by compound 3.", 
    "116": "OBJECTIVE: Cough frequency and severity with fosinopril and enalapril were assessed in hypertensive patients with previous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-associated cough. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, 8-week double-blind treatment. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients (mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonsmokers, mean age 58 years; 55% females; 72% Caucasian, 6% black, 19% Hispanic) were studied. Patients with other cough etiologies, significant co-morbidity, or confounding medications were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to fosinopril 10 mg (n = 85) or enalapril 5 mg (n = 94) once daily. Dosage could be doubled for blood pressure control after 4 weeks. Outcome measurements: The primary end point was all-cough frequency based on patient daily diary ratings; a cumulative cough frequency score was calculated. Secondary end points included cough severity, nonproductive cough frequency, night awakenings, cough time of day, and spontaneously reported cough. RESULTS: Fosinopril and enalapril demonstrated similar blood pressure control. Significant cough profile differences were observed in favor of fosinopril: all-cough frequency was 40.6 plus minus 3.8 (mean plus minus SE) versus 52.8 plus minus 3.6 (p = 0.02); nonproductive cough frequency was 26.7 plus minus 3.5 versus 40.3 plus minus 3.4 (p less-than-or-equal 0.01); and cough time of day was 49.2 plus minus 5.2 versus 66.0 plus minus 5.0 (p = 0.02), for fosinopril and enalapril, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed all-cough frequency was 33.5 plus minus 6.3 versus 56.6 plus minus 5.3 (p = 0.006) for fosinopril and enalapril, respectively, in patients who previously had cough on one of these two ACEI (predominantly enalapril). Ten (12%) fosinopril and 25 (27%) enelapril patients spontaneously reported cough (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients with previous ACEI-associated cough reported less frequent cough with fosinopril compared to enalapril, based on cumulative patient diary scores and spontaneously reported cough. This difference was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who previously experienced cough associated with enalapril therapy. Patients with prior ACEI-associated cough may experience less frequent with fosinopril.", 
    "117": "Duration of action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is not solely related to its individual elimination half-life. It is also determined by its ACE inhibiting potency and affinity for ACE. Its degree of lipophilicity is also an important factor in determining tissue penetration. Any attempt to calculate the duration of action, and, consequently, the interdosing interval, of an ACE inhibitor should take into account and integrate all these variables. The measurement (or the calculation) of each of these variables is not in itself an easy task and is very much prone to error. Given the failure of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to provide an adequate and simple method capable of predicting reliably the time-effect relationship of ACE inhibitors, it is obvious that the pragmatic way to determine this time-effect profile is to monitor blood pressure changes during the clinical use of a given ACE inhibitor. Because very little information is available for many ACE inhibitors concerning their trough/peak ratio, we have recently reviewed all the published studies assessing the antihypertensive efficacy of commercially available ACE inhibitors with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Our literature analysis suggests that not all once daily ACE inhibitors comply with the Food and Drug Administration requirement of a trough/peak ratio higher than 50%. However, current evidence suggests that the definition of this ratio is dependent upon the methodology employed for its determination. The only validated analytical approach that is based on blood pressure measurements in a few confined patients, during phase II dose-finding studies. Fuller information may be sought with alternative evaluative approaches based on ambulatory BP measurements in large numbers of patients and in more pragmatic daily life conditions. Although this remains to be demonstrated, long acting ACE inhibitors may provide additional benefits over the shorter acting ones by producing an optimal 24 h and longer therapeutic coverage, with fewer peak-effect related side effects and better control of blood pressure during critical nighttime and early morning hours.", 
    "118": "Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has proved to be an innovative tool for the assessment of the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs. It enables evaluation of the magnitude of the drug-related blood pressure fall and also of the duration of this effect throughout 24 h. Moreover, ambulatory blood pressures have advantages compared to office blood pressure: they are not affected by the white coat effect occurring at the time of the doctor's visit, are devoid of a placebo effect, are more reproducible than occasional clinic measurements, and may yield important information on the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings were used to test the antihypertensive effect of a novel angiotensin converting enzyme, trandolapril, in 62 mild to moderate essential hypertensive outpatients. After a 4 week wash-out, period, patients were randomized to 2 mg trandolapril or placebo for 6 weeks. A 4-week wash-out period was scheduled at the end of the treatment period. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed at the end of each period, starting in the morning. Trandolapril (n = 31) significantly reduced 24 h systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared to pre- and posttreatment periods and to placebo (n = 17). The reduction involved both the daytime and nighttime blood pressure values and was evident also in the last hours of the recording, the trough-to-peak ratio being 0.6 for systolic and 0.7 for diastolic blood pressure. Thus, trandolapril at a dose of 2 mg once daily is an effective long-lasting antihypertensive drug.", 
    "119": "Trandolapril is a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that effectively lowers blood pressure in doses up to 2 mg. Only a small additional effect is seen with higher doses. The drug is transformed in vivo to the active metabolite trandolaprilat. When renal function is severely impaired a dose reduction may be necessary because the clearance of trandolaprilat is significantly correlated to creatinine clearance. Trandolapril has a sustained action that is reflected in long-lasting inhibition of ACE, even after discontinuation of treatment. Blood pressure is controlled by the drug in about 60% of patients with a side effect profile that is comparable to that of the other ACE inhibitors. Trandolapril can be given safely over a prolonged period of time.", 
    "120": "This article discusses the pharmacologic basis on which trandolapril exhibits a more potent and longer-lasting antihypertensive effect than its chemical prototype enalapril. Our studies have shown that 1) trandolapril and its active metabolite trandolaprilat are more lipophilic than enalapril and its active diacid enalaprilat; 2) trandolaprilat is three times more potent than enalaprilat in vitro; and 3) trandolapril is 10 times more effective and longer-acting than enalapril in lowering the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The long duration of action of trandolapril can be attributed to its long-lasting inhibition of the vascular tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The long action onto the vascular tissue ACE may be due to the high lipophilicity of trandolapril which may increase its tissue penetration and its elimination half-life from the tissue, and the unique nature of the vascular tissue which, unlike the other tissues, does not respond to trandolapril with the induction of de novo ACE that may counteract the ACE inhibition. These data imply that trandolapril is a potent ACE inhibitor with distinctively long action, which might be a result of its vascular tissue affinity and the lack of any ACE inducing ability of the vascular tissue.", 
    "121": "Elevated systemic blood pressure is associated with more rapid progression of renal failure, as recently documented by prospective observations. Intervention studies with antihypertensive medication have clearly documented that progression can be attenuated by antihypertensive medication. Experimental studies and, more recently, controlled prospective trials in humans, have provided evidence that in this respect angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are superior to equipotent doses of alternative antihypertensive agents, suggesting a specific nephroprotective action. Experimental studies suggest that this is not only due to hemodynamic, but also to nonhemodynamic, mechanisms. The effect of calcium channel blockers on this progression is less uniform and may depend on the model used, the percentage of blood pressure lowering, and possibly also the type of calcium channel blocker. Despite some discrepancies in experimental studies, recent controlled clinical trials show a similar slowing of progression with either ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. Since combination therapy is required in most patients with advanced renal failure, recent experimental studies on development and glomerular sclerosis and clinical studies showing at least additive effects on reduction of proteinuria independent of blood pressure argue for combining ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists.", 
    "122": "The main reason for treating arterial hypertension is obviously to reduce hypertension-induced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies have demonstrated a preventive effect against stroke when elevated blood pressure has been lowered by pharmacological intervention. A preventive effect of such therapy has also been shown with regard to coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the issue here is much less clear, perhaps because diuretics have been the main therapy in the majority of the large intervention trials. There are reasons to believe that newer therapy, e.g., the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, would be more effective in preventing CHD in hypertensive patients. Some of this evidence will be reviewed in this paper.", 
    "123": "The transgenic rat TGR(mRen-2)27 develops severe hypertension with high adrenal renin and low kidney renin. The mechanism of suppressed kidney renin in these animals is still unclear. We investigated the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril on the renin-angiotensin system in plasma and tissues (adrenal gland and kidney), and the effect of mouse renin antibody on plasma and tissue renin activity before and after perindopril administration. Perindopril lowered blood pressure in the TGR(mRen-2)27 rats from 254.5 +/- 7.4 mm Hg to 154 +/- 7.8 mm hg (n = 8, P < .0001), while blood pressure in the untreated TGR (mRen-2)27 rats increased from 253.7 +/- 8.1 to 276.1 +/- 14.3 mm Hg during the study period. Perindopril significantly suppressed plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) from 19.4 +/- 2.5 pg/mL to 2.6 +/- 0.4 pg/mL, P < .0001, while markedly increasing plasma renin concentration (PRC) from 15.5 +/- 1.8 ng AngI/mL/h to 148.2 +/- 35.5 ng AngI/mL/h, P < .005 and kidney renin from 56.7 +/- 18.1 micrograms AngI/g/h to 827.4 +/- 79.1 micrograms AngI/g/h, P < .0001. However, adrenal renin was not increased. A mouse Ren-2 renin antibody at a 1:1000 dilution that suppresses purified mouse Ren-2 renin activity by 62.6 +/- 3.6% (n = 3, P < .0001) and does not suppress renin activity in plasma and kidney of the Sprague-Dawley rats, suppressed PRC in the untreated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats by 52.3 +/- 3.5% (n = 6, P < .0001). However, it only suppressed PRC in the perindopril treated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats by 7.0 +/- 2.4% (n = 6, P < .05). The antibody suppressed adrenal renin in both untreated and perindopril treated TGR(mREN-2)27 rats by 57.3 +/- 5.4% (n = 5, P < .0001) and 49.7 +/- 2.2% (n = 6, P < .0001), respectively. On the other hand, the mouse antibody suppressed kidney renin in the untreated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats by only 11.0 +/- 3.3% (n = 6, P < .05), and did not suppress kidney renin in the perindopril treated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats (n = 6, P < .0001), respectively. On the other hand, the mouse antibody suppressed kidney renin in the untreated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats by only 11.0 +/- 3.3% (n = 6, P < .05), and did not suppress kidney renin in the perindopril treated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats (n = 6, P < NS). The pH profile of renin activity in plasma confirmed the results of the antibody study. We conclude that in the TGR(mRen-2)27 rats adrenal renin is mainly mouse renin and kidney renin is mainly rat renin. The main sources of circulating renin in the TGR(mRen-2)27 rats are extra-renal tissues, including the adrenal glands, where mouse Ren-2 renin transcripts are highly expressed. The increased circulating renin in perindopril treated TGR(mRen-2)27 rats is rat renin derived from the kidney. The failure of adrenal renin to increase with perindopril suggests that at least in the basal state there is no feedback inhibition as there is in the kidney. The low kidney renin appears to be due to physiological rather than genetic factors.", 
    "124": "In atherosclerotic mini-pigs, we attempted to determine (i) whether high-fat atherogenic diet disturbs the taurocholate transepithelial transport and incorporation in the ileal epithelium mounted in Ussing chambers, and (ii) whether these processes are sensitive to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which slow the development of vascular atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic mini-pigs, the mucosal to serosal transepithelial fluxes were markedly lower (72% inhibition) and free diffusion was more altered than active processes. Taurocholate incorporation into enterocyte (75% inhibition) paralleled the flux reduction. The transport disturbance observed here might be explained by changes in bile salt permeability in relation to alterations of the membrane properties. Taurocholate absorption was lowered by atherogenic diet, whereas bile salts were not trapped in the enterocyte, therefore atherosclerosis-induced alterations preferentially affected the passage through the brush-border. In the ACE inhibitor treated atherosclerotic mini-pigs, perindopril and enalapril similarly inhibited serum ACE activities. Perindopril further corrected taurocholate fluxes by 50% and fully restored taurocholate incorporation. Since enalapril did not restore the atherosclerosis-induced alterations, the involvement of intestinal ACE in bile acid recycling and of an ACE inhibitor class effect on these mechanisms both remain to be ascertained.", 
    "125": "The tubular uptake and esterolysis of quinapril and quinaprilat were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats using an in vivo micropuncture technique. [3H]Quinapril or [3H]quinaprilat was injected with [14C]inulin into either proximal or distal segments of the renal tubules, and urine was collected over 30 min. Urine and perfusate were assayed for [14C]-inulin using dual label spectrometry. [3H]Quinapril and [3H]quinaprilat concentrations were determined in urine and perfusate using a reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry. These studies demonstrated that quinapril could access the esterase enzyme from tubular fluid and be metabolized to quinaprilat in both proximal and to a lesser extent distal segments of the kidney tubule. Quinapril, but not quinaprilat, was extensively reabsorbed. Its reabsorption along the proximal tubule and/or the loop of Henle could account for as much as 45-50% of the available dose of quinapril. Further, the urinary recovery of quinapril and quinaprilat (after dosing quinapril into proximal segments) was urine flow rate dependent.", 
    "126": "Angiotensin II exerts its action via at least two distinct receptor subtypes designated AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors seem to be responsible for most of the known angiotensin II effects while the role of AT2 receptors is not yet clear. Adipocytes of adult rats express exclusively the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II stimulates prostacyclin release in adult rat adipocytes and in mouse preadipocytes. In the latter prostacyclin release is completely blocked by an AT2 receptor antagonist. Adipocyte angiotensin II receptors seem to be regulated by age and fat mass. Blockade of these receptors by an AT1 antagonist seems to prevent adipose tissue hypertrophy. Moreover, adipose tissue contains all the main components of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin II and angiotensin II receptors. Angiotensinogen expression in adipocytes is stimulated by a high fat diet concurrent with enlargement of fat mass, associated with insulin resistance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve insulin sensitivity. Taken together, there is evidence of interaction between insulin and angiotensin II in regulation of adipose tissue metabolism and cellularity. Clarification of these interactions could lead to significant progress in pharmacological treatment of obesity and its comorbidity.", 
    "127": "In 20 patients of cor pulmonale with heart failure and respiratory failure and in 11 healthy men, after intravenous captopril injection, acute hemodynamic and hormonal change were observed. The results indicated that intravenous captopril injection rapidly reduced cardiac preload and afterload, reduced pulmonary arterial pressure, increased cardiac output, inhibited renin system activity, decreased plasma level of thyroxin and atrial natriuretic peptide. A rapid symptomatic improvement in patients with acute or severe cor pulmonale was shown and there was no significant effect on blood gas immediately.", 
    "128": "Numerous large, double-blind, randomized trials have demonstrated that, overall, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improves survival of patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, several practical issues concerning ACE inhibition in the presence of AMI have not yet been answered. These include whether ACE inhibition should be initiated in all patients with AMI, how soon ACE inhibition should be attempted in relation to onset of pain and possibly thrombolysis, and, lastly, how long ACE inhibition should be maintained after the acute event. Each of these issues is addressed, and recommendations are made on the basis of the results from recent randomized trials in AMI and congestive heart failure.", 
    "129": "This review summarizes the evidence from five of the larger randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors started in the early phase of myocardial infarction on subsequent mortality and major morbidity. Altogether, information on about 98,000 patients is available from these trials. In four studies, trial treatment was started within 24 h, and in one study within 36 h, of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, and mortality was assessed after a few weeks or months of treatment. When taken together, these trials show that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce a significant 7% relative risk reduction in mortality (P < 0.006), which corresponds to an absolute difference of about five fewer deaths per 1,000 patients treated. The benefits may be greater in higher-risk patients (e.g. those with previous myocardial infarction, heart failure or large infarcts). These results demonstrate that for a wide range of patients without clear contraindications, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors started early in acute myocardial infarction prevent further deaths in the first few weeks when added to standard therapy (aspirin, thrombolytic therapy and beta-blockers). The early benefits seen with ACE inhibitors seems to persist for at least the first year. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.", 
    "130": "In recent years, growing evidence has suggested a beneficial effect from the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction. Since important differences between the structure and effects of the various ACE inhibitors exist, differences in outcome can be expected. This review discusses the structural, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between ACE inhibitors administered after myocardial infarction, both in experimental settings and in clinical practice.", 
    "131": "Ischaemic heart disease is a major cause of chronic heart failure in Western societies. Despite some progress in the treatment of heart failure, it is still a disabling disorder with both high mortality and high morbidity. The incidence of chronic heart failure has increased over the past decade, probably as a result of the recent success in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The importance of measures with potential capacity to prevent the development of symptomatic heart failure may be best illustrated by the fact that, among patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the prognosis is much worse in those with symptomatic failure than in those who are asymptomatic. Recently, the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction has been studied in a number of large placebo-controlled trials. These studies indicate that patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after an acute myocardial infarction should receive long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor and that such treatment may improve survival, reduce the incidence of overt heart failure and reduce the risk of reinfarction.", 
    "132": "The rationale for using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy after acute myocardial infarction has been largely founded on observations made in experimental situations, and in humans before the routine introduction of reperfusion therapies. An important area of ongoing debate therefore continues to be the role of ACE inhibition as an early adjunct to attempts to achieve and maintain patency of infarct-related coronary arteries. Data from clinical trials indicate a substantial survival benefit in patients with impaired ventricular function, but provide little support for the routine treatment of the remaining majority of patients. An important issue in determining whether these agents should be used in a more general and long-term secondary prevention role, is their potential ability to prevent subsequent reinfarction. However, such a strategy is unlikely to be enhanced by either immediate initiation of treatment or withdrawal after just 1 month of therapy.", 
    "133": "Our understanding of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has advanced considerably in recent years. The RAAS plays a central role in the control of salt and water balance, and in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. The haemodynamic changes in the period after myocardial infarction stimulate intense activation of both the circulating and the local RAAS. This acts through its end-products, angiotensin II and aldosterone, to promote sodium and fluid retention, and to increase cardiac contractility and systemic vascular tone. There is increasing evidence that, in the long term, this apparently adaptive response may be harmful, and might contribute to the development of some of the complications seen after infarction. Angiotensin II is capable of inducing coronary as well as systemic vasoconstriction, and may therefore prolong the duration of ischaemia. The response of the RAAS after infarction can be modified pharmacologically. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs are already the mainstay of treatment in heart failure, and have now been shown to have a crucial role in the prevention of ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction. Although the precise mechanism of this benefit is unclear, it provides further incentives to develop more effective strategies capable of suppressing neurohumoral activity following infarction.", 
    "134": "The present study compares the hemodynamic effects and mechanisms of action of angiotensin II (AngII) antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and renin inhibitors in the guinea pig, an animal with high similarity to primates in terms of in vitro and in vivo responses to several human renin inhibitors. Animals were anesthetized with urethane and ketamine. The carotid artery was catheterized for monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. After 30 min stabilization, drug (or vehicle) effects were monitored for 1 h following each increasing dose (i.v. bolus injection). Drugs tested include losartan, an AngII receptor antagonist; two renin inhibitors, BILA 2157 BS and PD-134672; and captopril, an ACE inhibitor. All drugs dose dependently decreased blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced more than systolic blood pressure, suggestive of vasodilation. The maximum decrease (32 +/- 6%, p < 0.05 vs. vehicle) in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by losartan was achieved with a dose of 1 mg/kg. A similar decrease in MABP was observed with renin inhibitors at a dose of 3 mg/kg, without affecting heart rate. A further increase in the dose of renin inhibitors (6 mg/kg) decreased not only blood pressure but also heart rate. Captopril decreased MABP with a maximum of 48 +/- 3% (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle, losartan, and PD-134672). In the presence of HOE-140, a bradykinin antagonist, the MABP decrease by captopril was only 35 +/- 4%, (p < 0.05 vs. captopril alone). Bilateral nephrectomy reduced the peak MABP effect of PD-134672 by 67%, while the effects of captopril on MABP were affected to a lesser degree (57%). Therefore, captopril remains more effective in reducing MABP (p < 0.05 vs. that of PD-134672). These results suggest that renin inhibitors and AngII antagonists act more specifically on the renin - angiotensin system cascade, while captopril acts partially by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. The small animal model described provides a novel tool for the comparative pharmacologic assessment of different renin - angiotensin system inhibitors.", 
    "135": "Considerable progress has been made in the medical treatment of chronic heart failure. A large number of patients with NYHA class II and III heart disease can be improved to class I and II. Treatment is maintained on an outpatient basis in order to prevent episodes of acute failure, while avoiding the adverse effects of drugs at high doses or in combination. Diuretics are still the drug class most frequently prescribed, especially loop diuretics (furosemide) which have the advantage of being able to be used in patients with renal failure. Aldosterone antagonists have the pathophysiological value of reducing the development of myocardial fibrosis. Digitalis alkaloids have a positive inotropic effect, which is even observed in the presence of sinus rhythm and which is associated with slowing of the heart rate in tachyarrhythmias. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are among the most recently used drugs. They decrease the left ventricular post-load and prevent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors cannot be administered orally in the long-term and are therefore not suitable for outpatient treatment. However, they are very effective by intravenous injection during the acute phase of heart failure and cardiogenic shock in hospital.", 
    "136": "Among the various anticancer drugs, used alone or in combination during courses of chemotherapy, anthracyclines (leader: doxorubicin) are responsible for direct myocardial toxicity, which can exceptionally be acute, but more often chronic with a delayed onset. This cardiotoxicity is directly proportional to the cumulative dose administered and the recommended total dose for doxorubicin is 550 mg/m2. The risk factors able to potentiate cardiotoxicity must be analysed before starting chemotherapy and follow-up by ultrasonography and/or isotope ejection fraction must be repeated before each course. The treatment of anthracycline-induced heart failure consists of digitalis alkaloids combined with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The cardiac toxicity of 5FU is currently explained by the theory of coronary spasm, based on clinical findings such as chest pain associated with ischaemic electrical modifications. The incidence of this toxicity is low, but it can be fatal. Exceptional examples include the cardiotoxicity induced by high-dose cyclophosphamide responsible for acute haemorrhagic myocarditis, potentiation of the cardiotoxic effect of anthracyclines by dacarbazine and plicamycin, and serious ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias induced by amsacrine. Among the various cytokines used in oncology, interferon is responsible for heart failure, reversible after stopping treatment, but also for ventricular arrhythmias, or even sudden death, the pathophysiology of which still remains unclear.", 
    "137": "The contractile action of bradykinin on isolated smooth muscles is known to be potentiated by special peptides isolated from snake venoms and other animal sources. A fraction F (AppF) has been derived from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus venom. This fraction does not increase the depressor effect of bradykinin n blood pressure, potentiates the action of bradykinin on isolated guinea-pig ileum and prolongs the duration of relaxation in isolated rat duodenum. This fraction was able to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vitro. The primary structure of this decapeptide is given.", 
    "138": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme lisinopril were compared with those of the calcium antagonist nifedipine in 162 non-insulin-dependent diabetic hypertensive patients for a 24-week period. In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, lisinopril and slow-release nifedipine produced similar reductions in blood pressure (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after lisinopril; -15/-12 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing nifedipine). Fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and plasma lipids appeared to be unaffected by either agent. Also, 28% of the patients on lisinopril and 30% of those on nifedipine presented microalbuminuria. Both drugs induced a reduction in the albumin excretion rate (AER). The geometric mean x:tolerance factor of the reduction in AER among the 23 microalbuminuric patients on lisinopril (-10.0 x:1.3 micrograms/min) was greater, though not significantly so, than that observed in the 26 on nifedipine (-0.9 x 1.2 micrograms/min). Moreover, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study population. Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients as well as in the general population. To what extent a reduction in the AER could ameliorate diabetic patients is, at present, unknown. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed a similar antihypertensive effect in these patients which was not associated with significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid concentrations. The clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear.", 
    "139": "Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) reduce proteinuria in nephrotic humans and animals, but the mediator(s) of this effect has not been identified definitively. To determine whether enhanced kinin activity contributes to the antiproteinuric action of CEI, rats with passive Heymann nephritis were treated with the B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140, 300 micrograms/kg per day, for 3 days and then the CEI enalapril (ENAL), 35 mg/kg per day, was given for another 4 days while HOE 140 was continued (HOE/ENAL). Additional groups of nephrotic rats were untreated (CON), received HOE 140 only (HOE), or received ENAL only. ENAL alone produced a > 60% decrease in albuminuria after 4 days, whereas HOE 140 alone had no effect on albuminuria. In HOE/ENAL, pretreatment with HOE 140 prevented the decrease in albuminuria observed in ENAL. GFR increased significantly over time in all groups but was not different among the groups on any day. The clearance of albumin decreased significantly in ENAL (P < 0.001) and was significantly lower than in CON, HOE, or HOE/ENAL on Day 10. The fractional clearance of albumin decreased in all groups as a result of the increase in GFR but was significantly lower in ENAL compared with the other three groups at Day 10 and was not different between CON, HOE, and HOE/ENAL. Plasma renin activity and concentration were increased significantly in both ENAL and HOE/ENAL, indicating that converting enzyme was effectively inhibited in both groups. It was concluded that enhanced kinin activity contributes to the antiproteinuric action of CEI in this model of nephrotic syndrome.",

    "141": "Experiments were performed on hearts from 36-week-old SHR with established left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 12) and from 36-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 12). Furthermore, to evaluate whether antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril interferes with the potential relationship between mast cells and fibrosis in SHR, we treated 16-week-old SHR (n = 12) with oral quinapril (10 mg/kg body weight per day) for 20 weeks.", 
    "142": "Mast cells were counted in 25 high-power fields. Toluidine blue-stained sections and avidin staining were used to detect mast cells. The extent of myocardial fibrosis was analysed in samples stained with Masson's trichrome.

    "143": "In the left ventricle of untreated SHR compared with age- and sex-matched normotensive WKY rats we found more extensive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, an increased collagen volume fraction, an increased hydroxyproline concentration and an increased number of mast cells. Similar but less intense abnormalities were observed in the right ventricles of untreated SHR compared with the left ventricles of the same rats. In the left ventricles of quinapril-treated SHR compared with those of untreated SHR we found a marked decrease in fibrosis, a lower collagen volume fraction, a lower hydroxyproline concentration and fewer mast cells. Treatment with quinapril was also accompanied by normalization in the myocardial structure of the right ventricles of SHR. A positive correlation was found between the density of mast cells and the collagen volume fraction in the left ventricles of all of the rats.", 
    "144": "The present findings suggest that mast cells can play a part in the development of the myocardial fibrosis that occurs in the cardiac ventricles with hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, the present results suggest that the ability of quinapril to interfere with mast cells might be involved in its cardioreparative properties.",

The highest dose of lisinopril had reduced the blood pressure of the SHR to below that of the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and prevented most structural changes, but there was a slight reduction in body weight in those rats. Comparable blood pressure control with D 8731 was associated with similar structural parameters.",

Age-matched untreated SHR (n = 16) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 17) served as controls. The experiments were carried out at 40 weeks.", 
    "152": "Withdrawal of captopril treatment resulted in a rapid rebound of SBP to a level close to that of untreated SHR in the low-dose group, whereas a persistently lower SBP was maintained in the high-dose group. Both doses of captopril treatment completely prevented wall hypertrophy either of arteriolar resistance vessels or of muscular vessels. Captopril decreased left ventricular mass:body weight ratio dose-dependently. High-dose captopril improved the resting and stress systolic and diastolic function. Thoracic angiotensin converting enzyme levels were dose-dependently reduced by captopril treatment. The curves of perfusion pressure response to incremental doses of phenylephrine shifted to the right in both captopril treatment groups compared with those of the control SHR. Addition of L-NAME and L-arginine to the perfusate augmented or attenuated the vasoconstrictor activity in all of the rats, whereas high-dose captopril totally restored the abnormal hypersensitivity to L-NAME and caused less attenuation in response to L-arginine in the control SHR.", 
    "153": "The persistent lower blood pressure caused by early captopril treatment was ascribed mainly to its sustained normalization of structure and function of resistance vessels, which may be partly mediated by the improvement of endothelial cell function. The persistent reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme activity in blood vessel wall attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy, and the improvement of cardiac systolic and diastolic function may also contribute to the sustained hypotensive effect.", 
    "154": "To address several methodological questions related to calculation of trough:peak ratio from 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) recordings.", 
    "155": "Data from patients with mild essential hypertension who were included in parallel group (n = 280) or cross-over studies (n = 39) were pooled. 24 h ambulatory BP recordings were available after 2- to 4-week washout from treatment and at the end of a 4- to 8-week period of treatment with calcium antagonists (n = 143), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 103) or placebo (73 patients from parallel group studies and 39 from a cross-over study). Each recording started between 0900 and 1000 h, immediately after the drug or placebo intake during the treatment phase. BP was measured at 15 min intervals during the day and at 15-20 min intervals during the night. Peak changes were calculated from systolic BP and diastolic BP 2-8 h after drug intake, and trough changes from readings taken during the last 4 h of the 24 h.", 
    "156": "Peak changes induced by drug treatment were progressively reduced when data were averaged over 1, 2, 4 and 6 h. BP reproducibility showed a concomitant increase and the best compromise between correct estimate of peak changes and reproducibility was the average of the adjacent 2 h with the maximal BP fall. Peak and trough (average of last 2 h) changes showed a normal distribution, whereas trough:peak ratios showed non-normal distributions, large scatters and many individual values with no pharmacodynamic significance (namely, much above unity and below zero). Selecting responders to treatment reduced the dispersion and made the trough:peak ratio distribution normal. There was no correlation between trough:peak ratios and changes in BP variability (standard deviation of 24 h mean) induced by treatment. Placebo administration caused no trough but a modest peak fall. Peak changes during placebo also showed a wide scatter and a non-normal distribution, which makes correction with respect to average peak placebo data inappropriate in parallel-group studies. However, placebo correction may be performed for each subject in cross-over studies, leading to a reduction in peak changes and an increase in trough:peak ratio values.", 
    "157": "When the trough:peak ratio is assessed from ambulatory BP, peak and trough changes should preferably be computed over a 2 h time window. To remove values with no pharmacodynamic significance, the analysis should preferably be conducted only in responders to treatment at peak. Although placebo is accompanied by some peak effect, placebo correction might be appropriate only for individual subjects in cross-over studies.", 
    "158": "To assess the role of the kidney dopamine system on the diuretic state induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we examined the changes in urinary excretion and plasma level of dopamine, and kidney dopamine receptors in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor. We administered cilazapril 10 mg/kg orally to 13-week-old SHR daily for 21 days (CILAZA group). Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in the CILAZA group on Day 6 compared with that in vehicle-treated SHR (control group). The urine volume was three- to fivefold higher in the CILAZA group, and total urinary dopamine secretion was also increased compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in affinity and number of kidney dopamine receptors between the CILAZA and the control groups. In conclusion, the diuretic effect caused by cilazapril is partly mediated by inhibition of the water reabsorption via the increase of dopamine production in the kidney.", 
    "159": "In this study 72 dogs the efficacy and safety of quinapril and captopril in the treatment of canine heart failure were found to be comparable. Differences exist between the dosage schedules of both ACE inhibitors. The recommended dosage schedule for the short acting captopril is three times daily 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight. Quinapril belongs to a newer generation of ACE inhibitors with a longer half life. Therefore a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg KGW once daily was in most cases sufficient for a successful therapy. This means that quinapril can ease the management of canine heart failure, because at least in dogs with mild to moderate heart failure the dosing interval is longer compared to captopril. Moreover, the treatment of small dogs is easier, because quinapril is available as 5 mg tablets whereas the smallest captopril tablets contain 12.5 mg agent.", 
    "160": "Although pharmacological therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proved to be effective in patients with heart failure (HF), the experimental basis of this effect has not yet been addressed. In the present study, animals with HF were treated with an oral administration of 10 mg/kg/day captopril, 10 mg/kg/day enalapril and 3 mg/kg/day trandolapril from the 2nd to 12th week after the operation. HF was induced by permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery of the rat at 2 mm from its origin. Treatment of the HF rats with the ACE inhibitors enhanced the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure, attenuated the rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, an indirect marker of preload, and diminished the reduction in cardiac output and stroke volume indices of the HF animal. Treatment also reversed the reduction in ATP, creatine phosphate, creatine and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate of the viable left and right ventricles of the HF animal. The improvement of the cardiac output index and high-energy phosphate levels of the HF rat by the ACE inhibitors was associated with the recovery of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. In sham-operated animals, treatment with the ACE inhibitors reduced mean arterial pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure, but not metabolic variables concerning myocardial energy metabolism. The present results provide evidence that ACE inhibitor therapy improves cardiac function and myocardial energy metabolism of experimental animals with chronic heart failure. The mechanism underlying the benefit of long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors is probably attributable to recovery or preservation of the mitochondrial function and reduction in preload.", 
    "161": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the control of blood pressure and drinking was investigated in fresh water (FW)- and seawater (SW)-adapted eels, Anguilla anguilla, by comparing the effects of pharmacological manipulation through the use of papaverine (stimulator) and captopril (inhibitor) on the endogenous system. In SW eels basal blood pressure levels were lower (23.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg) with correspondingly higher basal drinking rates (0.51 +/- 0.07 ml/kg/hr) and plasma AII concentrations (32.89 +/- 4.19 fmol/ml) compared to FW eels (33.8 +/- 1.3 mm Hg, 0.06 +/- 0.02 ml/kg/hr, 9.72 +/- 0.60 fmol/ml, respectively). In FW eels papaverine caused immediate hypotension with full recovery, decrease in plasma osmolality, and increase in drinking rate and plasma AII concentration, but in SW eels, hypotension with full recovery and an increase in plasma osmolality, drinking rate, and plasma AII concentration occurred. In FW eels captopril had no effect on the parameters measured, but in SW eels it caused a sustained decrease in blood pressure and a decline in the basal drinking rate and plasma AII concentration. Papaverine was also administered 15 min after captopril. In FW eels this manipulation caused hypotension only after the papaverine injection, followed by a partial recovery. Osmolality was unaffected, the previously observed papaverine-induced dipsogenic response was blocked, and the rise in plasma AII concentrations was smaller than with papaverine only. In SW eels there was an immediate hypotension after captopril administration with full recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "162": "1. The study was undertaken in male patients aged 61-73 years with essential hypertension. 2. The patients had previously had their blood pressure controlled with the drug studied. 3. A randomized crossover study compared the effect of different drug doses on peak (3 h) and trough (24 h) blood pressure compared to placebo. 4. All drug doses used lowered blood pressure at peak response and the responses with different doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were similar. The peak response to felodipine had some dose dependency. 5. Trough blood pressure was not different from placebo with enalapril, 5 and 10 mg, perindopril, 2 mg, felodipine, 2.5 mg but was different with enalapril, 20 and 40 mg, perindopril, 4 and 8 mg and felodipine, 5 and 10 mg. 6. Trough peak ratio was dose dependent, with the greatest dependency seen with enalapril which has the shortest half-life. 7. When low doses of enalapril (5 or 10 mg), perindopril (2 mg) or felodipine ER (2.5 mg) are used it is important to check blood pressure prior to the next dose to ensure that control is achieved and maintained.", 
    "163": "1. Experiments were designed to evaluate the hypothesis that cyclo-oxygenase products modulate the influence of angiotensin II (AII) on the renal juxtamedullary microvasculature of enalaprilat-treated rats. 2. The in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique was utilized to provide access to afferent arterioles, efferent arterioles and descending vasa recta located in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. 3. Baseline afferent arteriolar diameter was 20.8 +/- 1.9 microns in kidneys subjected to cyclo-oxygenase blockade (1 mumol/L piroxicam), a value significantly lower than that observed in untreated kidneys (26.1 +/- 1.0 microns). Baseline diameters of efferent arterioles and outer medullary descending vasa recta did not differ between untreated and piroxicam-treated groups. 4. Topical application of 1 nmol/L AII reduced blood flow through outer medullary descending vasa recta by 22 +/- 6% in untreated kidneys and by 24 +/- 7% in piroxicam-treated kidneys. 5. In untreated kidneys, AII (0.01-100 nmol/L) produced concentration-dependent afferent and efferent arteriolar constrictor responses of similar magnitudes. Neither afferent nor efferent arteriolar AII responsiveness was significantly altered in piroxicam-treated kidneys, although afferent responses exceeded efferent responses at AII concentrations > or = 10 nmol/L. 6. We conclude that endogenous cyclo-oxygenase products exert a vasodilator influence on juxtamedullary afferent arterioles under baseline conditions. Although cyclo-oxygenase inhibition had little effect on juxtamedullary microvascular responses to AII, the response to high AII concentrations may be modulated by cyclo-oxygenase products in a manner which delicately alters the relative influence of the peptide on pre- vs postglomerular resistances.", 
    "164": "The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril on mesenteric vascular hypertrophy and urinary albumin excretion was explored in a normotensive model of experimental diabetes. Serial measurements of albuminuria were performed in Sprague-Dawley control, diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with ramipril. Over 24 weeks, urinary albumin excretion showed a continuous rise in the untreated diabetic rats. Ramipril prevented the increase in albuminuria over the whole study period. After 6 months, animals were perfused with glutaraldehyde and sacrificed for measurement of mesenteric vessel wall/lumen ratio and kidney weight. Diabetes was associated with increased mesenteric wall/lumen ratio and kidney weight. ACE inhibition, despite no effect on glycemic control, attenuated mesenteric vascular hypertrophy but did not decrease kidney weight. In addition to the well-described renoprotective effects of ACE inhibition in diabetes, this class of agents may have a favorable effect on diabetic vascular disease.", 
    "165": "Several studies have shown that lowering of blood pressure slows the rate of progression of diabetic renal disease. Some placebo-controlled studies have also shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease or stabilize albuminuria in incipient nephropathy and slow the rate of progression of advanced nephropathy. However, it is not yet clear if prolonged treatment with ACE inhibitors or with other agents exerts a specific renoprotective effect in incipient diabetic nephropathy. It is proposed that such an effect should be independent from changes in systemic blood pressure and should be characterized by amelioration of the rate of rise of albumin excretion rate (AER) and the rate of fall of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and independence from changes in other parameters known to influence AER (glycemic control, protein intake, sodium intake). In addition, there should be evidence that the potentially reversible effects of therapeutic intervention on AER and GFR are translated to long-term changes in renal function and structure. This paper reviews the evidence on which the concept of renoprotection is based, with particular reference to choice of end points, heterogeneity of study groups, and complexities of the disease process, and relates this evidence to the natural history of nephropathy in type I and type II diabetes. Based on the above, an assessment is made of the comparative effects of ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive agents on AER and GFR. It is suggested that longitudinal intra-individual analysis of both variables may be necessary in order to determine whether ACE inhibitors exert greater renoprotection than calcium channel blockers or other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "166": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with perindopril on renal vascular structure were studied in control and streptozotocin diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 weeks. After kidneys were perfusion-fixed at systolic blood pressure, morphometric analysis of vascular structural changes in the media of the renal vasculature at the cortico-medullary junction was performed. Vascular hypertrophy was present in the diabetic vessels, as assessed by an increase in medial cross-sectional area for a given lumen size. This relative increase in medial area was prevented by perindopril treatment, consistent with an antitrophic effect on diabetic kidney vessels by ACE inhibition. The diabetic kidney had an increased proportion of small vessels less than 50 microns diameter at the cortico-medullary junction, perhaps representing diabetes induced angiogenesis. This subpopulation of vessels was reduced in number after perindopril treatment. Our data support a role for increased activity of angiotensin converting enzyme as a mechanism for vascular hypertrophy, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy and nephropathy.", 
    "167": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have been proven to be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction. Despite evidence from several large-scale randomized trials, the use of ACE-I in patients with heart failure remains relatively low. In part, the failure to achieve more widespread use of ACE-I in patients with heart failure may be due to physician's perceptions of the side effects associated with ACE-I, such as angioedema, renal dysfunction, cough, and hypotension. Many of these side effects are thought to be due to ACE-I-induced bradykinin accumulation. It is possible to inhibit the effect of angiotensin II without increasing bradykinin levels using an angiotensin II type I blocking agent such as losartan. How effective losartan is compared with an ACE-I is uncertain, however. Some of the beneficial effects of ACE-I have been attributed to bradykinin accumulation, and therefore ACE-I might have an advantage compared with an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist such as losartan. On the other hand, angiotensin II may be produced by non-ACE-I-dependent mechanisms, which would suggest that an angiotensin II type I receptor blocking agent would be advantageous. To determine the relative safety and efficacy of an ACE-I, which results in bradykinin accumulation and inhibitors of angiotensin II, versus an angiotensin II type I receptor blocking agent, which does not result in bradykinin accumulation, we have begun the Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly (ELITE) trial, which will compare the safety and efficacy of captopril and losartan in elderly patients with heart failure.", 
    "168": "Modification of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by renin inhibitors may be an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The development of clinically useful renin inhibitors has been hampered by a variety of pharmacologic problems, most notably the poor oral bioavailability of these peptide-related compounds. Peptidomimetic renin inhibitors that have been stabilized to enzymatic degradation in conjunction with optimizing physical characteristics amenable to intestinal absorption offer the greatest promise to date. Studies in animal models demonstrate that renin inhibitors are capable of reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressures without causing reflex tachycardia. The response appears to be sustained with chronic administration. The beneficial cardiovascular effects of these compounds have been confirmed in the few studies conducted in patients with hypertension and in those with congestive heart failure. Further development of renin inhibitors is warranted.", 
    "169": "We evaluated the acute hemodynamic effects of ciprokiren (Ro 44-9375), a new potent renin inhibitor, in sodium-depleted dogs. After dogs were sodium depleted by administration of furosemide, they were anesthetized, and effects of increasing doses of ciprokiren (0.1-3 mg/kg) or placebo on arterial blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), coronary blood flow (CBF), left ventricular (LV) + dP/dtmax, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were evaluated. Ciprokiren dose-dependently decreased arterial BP and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), beginning at the 0.1-mg/kg dose and having maximal effect at 1 mg/kg. Ciprokiren did not change heart rate (HR), LV + dP/dtmax or coronary vascular resistance. Finally, a maximal effective dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (cilazapril 1.0 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) had no additional hemodynamic effect. At 0.1 mg/kg ciprokiren, arterial BP was reduced, with no change in PRA, showing the dissociation between hemodynamic effects and inhibition of renin in plasma. Acutely, renin inhibition with ciprokiren produces a marked peripheral vasodilation which appears to be dissociated from the renin inhibition in plasma and which is not increased by additional ACE inhibition.", 
    "170": "We wished to elucidate the effects of the calcium-sensitizing positive inotropic agent MCI-154 and its combined use with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on postischemic contractile dysfunction. Anesthetized dogs underwent a 30-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Regional myocardial segment shortening in the ischemic LAD area was assessed by sonomicrometry. Myocardial segment shortening decreased in response to the LAD occlusion and remained decreased during 2-h reperfusion. The intravenous infusion of MCI-154 (0.1 or 0.3 micrograms/kg/min) initiated 10 min after occlusion and throughout reperfusion significantly improved the recovery of segment shortening. The alleviation of the postischemic contractile dysfunction by MCI-154 was augmented when the animals were treated with a bous injection of enalapril (0.3 mg/kg) 15 min before ischemia followed by an infusion of the drug (0.003 mg/kg/min). The pretreatment with enalapril alone (0.3 mg/kg plus 0.003 mg/kg/min or 1 mg/kg plus 0.01 mg/kg/min) did not alleviate the postichemic dysfunction, however, although it decreased systemic blood pressure (BP). Ischemic bed size, myocardial necrosis (by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), and collateral blood flow (by colored microspheres) were similar in all experimental groups. These results indicate that MCI-154 improves the postischemic contractile function of dog heart, whereas enalapril fails to improve it. ACE inhibitors may also augment the efficacy of cardiotonics on postischemic dysfunction.", 
    "171": "The positioning of a nonocclusive silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery results in the formation of a neointima under a morphologically continuous endothelium. We wished to determine whether oral treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevents or retards intimal thickening and whether this is related to the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of such drugs. Silicone collars were placed around the left carotid artery of 104 male New Zealand white rabbits for 14 days. The contralateral carotid artery was sham-operated. Three ACE inhibitors were administered from 7 days before collar placement until the end of the experiment: zabicipril (0, 0.03, 0.10, or 0.30 mg/kg/day), moexipril (0, 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg twice daily, b.i.d.), and enalapril (0 or 3 mg/kg/day). Each group consisted of 6-12 animals. BP and plasma ACE activity were measured in the nonanesthetized rabbits after 3-week treatment. To evaluate intimal thickening, we measured the cross-sectional area of intima and media. The positioning of the collar led to significant intimal thickening after 14 days. Although the ACE inhibitors decreased BP (zabicipril, 9, 16, 16%; moexipril, 10, 22, 31%; enalapril, 15%) and plasma ACE activity (zabicipril, 87, 88, 92%; moexipril, 79, 92, 93%; enalapril, 88%) significantly and dose dependently, they did not reduce intimal thickening or the cross-sectional area of the media. Angiotensin II does not play a dominant role in collar-induced intimal thickening in rabbits. Furthermore, reducing the BP of normotensive rabbits does not alter neointima formation in this model.", 
    "172": "To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on nephrosclerosis in salt-loaded, partially nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we evaluated the effects of angiotensin II (ANGII) blockade on the progression of nephrosclerosis with an angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1rec) antagonist [TCV-116 (TCV)] and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) at the doses equivalent in reducing systemic blood pressure (BP). SHR were five/sixths nephrectomized and were fed a high-salt diet. In addition to being significantly preventive against an increase in systolic BP, both TCV and enalapril significantly attenuated the increases in proteinuria and the renal histopathological alterations. Transcription of AT1rec mRNA in the remnant kidney was enhanced with the progression of nephrosclerosis, but was inhibited by TCV as well as enalapril. In these aspects, there were no apparent differences between effects of TCV and enalapril. The RAS system plays an important role in nephrosclerosis in partially nephrectomized SHR despite a high-salt diet, and direct ANGII blockade certainly protected the kidney against hypertensive injury in this model.", 
    "173": "Endothelin (2, 5, and 10 pmol/kg/min) was infused into the renal artery of conscious dogs, producing graded and progressive reductions in renal blood flow (RBF) without initial vasodilatation, parallel reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and reduced Na+ excretion, but little change in urine flow. Pretreatment of the dogs with either ibuprofen (20 mg/kg orally) or aspirin (30 mg/kg p.o.) did not significantly alter the effects of endothelin (5 pmol/kg/min) on RBF, GFR, or Na+ excretion. However, endothelin caused antidiuresis in these cyclooxygenase-inhibited dogs, indicating that the effects of endothelin on water reabsorption were prostanoid mediated. Treatment with captopril (1.5 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg/h) did not significantly alter any of the responses to endothelin. The local effects of endothelin in the kidneys of conscious dogs were vasoconstriction and reduced Na+ excretion which were not mediated or modified by either angiotensin II or prostanoids.", 
    "174": "We investigated the effect of imidapril, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on augmentation of airway microvascular leakage induced by bradykinin (BK) and substance P (SP) in guinea pigs and compared it with those of enalapril and captopril. The three ACE inhibitors significantly potentiated BK- and SP-induced airway microvascular leakage in a dose-dependent manner. In spite of the compatible or higher ACE inhibitory activity of imidapril, its potentiating activity in BK-induced leakage was lower than those of enalapril and captopril both by single administration (0.3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and repeated administration for eight days (0.1-10 mg/kg/day, p.o.). The potentiating activities of the three ACE inhibitors were suppressed by pretreatment with a BK2-receptor antagonist, but not by neurokinin 1 and neurokinin 2 antagonists, suggesting that neurokinins may not be involved in BK-induced leakage under the conditions used. On the other hand, the potentiating effect of imidapril in SP-induced leakage was weaker than those of enalapril and captopril only after single high doses. The present study shows that the ACE inhibitors have different activity in potentiation of the airway microvascular leakage induced by BK, which may be ascribable to the difference in their inhibition of BK hydrolysis. This evidence may partly explain the smaller incidence of dry cough induced by imidapril compared with other ACE inhibitors when clinically used as antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "175": "1. Hypertensive transgenic (TGR(mRen-2)27) (abbreviated to TG) rats (n = 6) and their normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) control strain (n = 7) were chronically instrumented for the measurement of cardiac haemodynamics. The hypertension in TG rats (mean blood pressure 181 +/- 9 mmHg) was entirely attributable to a reduction in total peripheral conductance (TG rats = 169 +/- 7, SD rats = 292 +/- 15 microliters min-1 mmHg-1 100g-1) since cardiac index was not different in the two strains (TG rats = 30.5 +/- 1.2, SD rats = 29.5 +/- 1.6 ml min-1 100g-1). 2. In other animals instrumented for the assessment of regional haemodynamics, the extent of peripheral vasoconstriction was similar in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds in the TG rats (reduction in vascular conductance relative to SD rats = 42%, 46% and 49%, respectively). 3. During an 8 h observation period with saline infusion, or following injection of losartan (10 mg kg-1) in SD rats there was no hypotension or regional vasodilation. With infusion of the endothelin antagonist, SB 209670 (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1), there was a slight hypotension, but no significant vasodilation; co-administration of losartan and SB 209670 caused a similar profile of effect, although the hypotension was increased. 4. With the same experimental protocol in TG rats, losartan caused a biphasic, progressive fall in mean arterial blood pressure accompanied by renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilation. Although the response to SB 209670 was not biphasic, its hypotensive and vasodilator effects were not different from those of losartan after 8 h. In the combined presence of losartan and SB 209670, mean arterial blood pressure (116 +/- 5 mmHg) was significantly lower than with SB 209670 (132+/-4 mmHg) or losartan(136 +/- 6 mmHg) alone, and renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular conductances (61 +/- 3, 90+/-14 and 52+/-4 [kHz nmHg-1]103, respectively) were higher than the corresponding values following either SB 209670 (49 +/- 4, 52 +/- 4 and 34 +/- 3 [kHz mmHg- 1]103, respectively) or losartan (43 +/- 5, 59 +/- 13 and 35+/-4 [kHz mmHg-1]103, respectively) alone. These results indicate the maintenance of hypertension inTG rats is dependent upon renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstriction, mediated by angiotensinII (AII) and endothelin (ET). Since we found that plasma ET-1 levels in TG rats (12.06+/-2.87 pmol 1-1)were lower than in SD rats (21.53 +/- 3.94 pmol 1-1), then it is possible that locally-generated, rather than circulating ET-l contributes to the widespread vasoconstriction in TG rats.", 
    "176": "1. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of endogenous bradykinin to the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects exerted by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). 2. Adult SHRs were treated daily for 8 days with either perindopril (3 mg kg-1), or a selective angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (10 mg kg-1) both given orally--these two doses being equipotent in inhibiting angiotensin I (AI)-induced vascular responses--or distilled water (controls). After pithing, the animals were instrumented for determination of blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, regional (renal, mesenteric, hindlimb) blood flows (pulsed Doppler technique) and corresponding vascular resistances. Afterwards, half of the animals of each group were given the selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, used in a dose (10 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) that achieved B2 receptor blockade, the other half received saline (10 microliters kg-1, i.v.). Haemodynamic responses to increasing frequencies of spinal cord stimulation were then measured. 3. Pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to AI were significantly and similarly reduced in both perindopril- and losartan-treated groups. Perindopril and losartan both decreased to a similar extent the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. 4. In the dose used, icatibant did not affect any of the investigated haemodynamic parameters in any of the experimental groups. Furthermore, icatibant did not affect the stimulation frequency-response curves in the control animals and did not modify the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects exerted by perindopril and by losartan. 5 Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous bradykinin does not, through B2 receptor activation, contribute to the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects of ACEIs in SHRs.", 
    "177": "1. The interaction of ramipril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme, with renal lithium handling was analysed in conscious normotensive Wistar rats and compared with the known increase in renal tubular lithium reabsorption induced by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin. 2. The rats were treated for five days with ramipril (1 mg kg-1 day-1 orally), indomethacin (2.5 mg kg-1 day-1 intramuscularly) or their solvents. Lithium chloride (16.7 mg kg-1 intraperitonealy) was given as a single dose on the fifth day and renal functions were measured. 3. Ramipril induced a decrease in renal lithium clearance which was correlated with the decrease in the quantity of filtered lithium and the increase in the tubular fractional reabsorption of the metal. Ramipril also reduced the systolic blood pressure of the rats by about 15 mmHg. 4. In the absence of any effect on creatinine clearance or systolic blood pressure, indomethacin increased renal fractional lithium reabsorption and led to an increase in plasma lithium levels, as previously reported by our group. 5. In conclusions, our results indicate that ramipril decreases renal lithium excretion in Wistar rats, when given orally at a dose of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 over five days.", 
    "178": "Although a major goal in the treatment of chronic heart failure is to improve daily physical activity levels, this has not been assessed quantitatively. An increased daily activity level may be reflected by an increase in daily energy expenditure. In the present study, measurements of energy expenditure with a commercially available ambulatory calorimeter were first validated using cardio-pulmonary exercise tests in 5 normal volunteers. The energy expenditure measured by the calorimeter correlated well with that estimated from oxygen uptake (r = 0.89). Subsequently, the daily energy expenditure was serially measured with the calorimeter during long-term administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril for 24 weeks in 8 patients with chronic heart failure. Changes in echocardiographic parameters and exercise capacity were also studied. Peak oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold assessed with symptom-limited maximal bicycle exercise were significantly increased 12 weeks or more after the initiation of treatment (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Left ventricular fractional shortening substantially, but not significantly, increased during this period (P < 0.1). These results strongly suggest that an overall improvement in heart failure was achieved after long-term ramipril therapy. The energy expenditure during daily activities was also significantly increased after ramipril therapy for 24 weeks (P < 0.01). Thus, the daily energy expenditure increased with improvement of heart failure, probably reflecting an increase in daily activity levels. We conclude that calorimetric measurement of daily energy expenditure is a novel and simple technique for quantitative evaluation of the effect of therapy on daily physical activity levels in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "179": "Inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is known to enhance coronary blood flow via partial suppression of angiotensin II and potentiation of bradykinin. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the ACE inhibition induced changes in blood flow in myocardial regions perfused by intact or stenotic coronary arteries. Seven domestic swine were submitted to an 82% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery with the circumflex artery left intact to serve as control area. Regional coronary blood flows were measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in the total area perfused by each coronary artery and in the subepicardial and subendocardial regions of each area separately, at rest and after treatments with captopril, losartan and a bradykinin antagonist given consecutively. We found a significant increase of total flow in both the stenotic and intact areas after captopril. Losartan caused a significant fall in systemic blood pressure with no further changes in overall coronary blood flow and the bradykinin antagonist produced a small but nonsignificant decline in total coronary flow. However, further separate analysis of subregions showed that subendocardial regions had a sharper increase in flow after captopril, and a significantly greater decline after bradykinin inhibition than subepicardial regions, whereas losartan tended to shunt blood from the subendocardial to the subepicardial regions. The results indicate that augmentation of coronary blood flow after ACE inhibition is not further enhanced by angiotensin II blockade and is in part mediated via potentiation of endogenous bradykinin, which exerts a preferential vasodilatory effect on the subendocardial regions of the myocardium.",

Data were obtained from 2,897 cases including 1,422 elderly (> or = 65 years old) and 1,475 non-elderly hypertensives (< 65 years old) collected from Sapporo Medical University Hospital and related medical facilities. In the total group of 2,879 cases, frequencies of use of hypotensive drugs were as follows: Ca antagonists, 76.3%, beta-blockers, 31.4%; ACE-inhibitors, 25.1%; diuretics, 18.1; alpha 1-blockers, 10.5%; potassium sparing diuretics, 8.8%. In the elderly group, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors were used less frequently than in non-elderly hypertensives. On the contrary, diuretics were administered more frequently in elderly than in non-elderly subjects. Comparing the usage of hypotonics among different types of medical facilities, higher frequencies of use of beta-blockers and diuretics were observed in the university hospital than in general hospitals and private hospitals or clinics. ACE-inhibitors were used less frequently in private facilities than in the university hospital and general hospital. In summary, Ca antagonists were used most frequently in both non-elderly and elderly subjects, and in all three different types of medical facilities. Other hypotonics were used differently according to patients age. There was differences in the usage of drugs apart from Ca antagonists among the three different types of medical facilities.", 
    "181": "The elements for the synthesis and activity of the vasopressor angiotensin II (AII) are present in the mammalian ovary. In the present investigation, the effects of AII were determined on three parameters of steroidogenic function in porcine granulosa cells in vitro: the accumulation of progesterone, the cellular content of the enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase delta 5-4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD), and the accumulation of mRNA for 3 beta-HSD. Cells were incubated with LH (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of AII (10(-7) M) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-7) M); doses of AII from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M in the presence or absence of LH; the AII reactor antagonist saralasin (10(-6) M) in the presence of AII or in combination of AII and LH; and AII in the presence or absence of (Bu)2 cAMP. The results demonstrate that LH increased progesterone, 3 beta-HSD message, and 3 beta-HSD content. Both PMA and AII interfered with the LH-induced progesterone accumulation, reducing the response by 50% or more. All also abrogated the LH-induced increases in 3 beta-HSD mRNA and 3 beta-HSD enzyme content in porcine granulosa cells. The AII inhibition was dose-dependent. The AII receptor antagonist saralasin blocked the inhibitory effects of AII on LH-induced steroidogenic events. AII interfered with the (Bu)2 cAMP induction of steroidogenesis and 3 beta-HSD mRNA and enzyme accumulation when (Bu)2 cAMP was present at a concentration of 30 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "182": "A protein, Bm91, which was first identified as a protective vaccine antigen from the tick Boophilus microplus, has regions of very strong amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian carboxydipeptidases or angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE; E.C. 3.4.15.1). This protein is now shown to share many biochemical and enzymatic properties with mammalian carboxydipeptidases. It is enzymatically active in a conventional assay for ACE using hippuryl-Gly-Gly as substrate. The hydrolysis of the C-terminal nonapeptide of the insulin B chain proceeds by sequential removal of carboxy-terminal dipeptides. The similarities extend to the dependence of activity on pH and added salt. Bm91 is inhibited by two well-characterized inhibitors of the mammalian enzymes, the drug Captopril and a nonapeptide, and the inhibition occurs in similar concentration ranges to those effective with the mammalian enzymes. However, the natural substrates of the tick enzyme are unknown. Angiotensin I itself is a poor substrate and the enzyme's natural substrates are likely to be one or more of the pharmacologically active peptides occurring in insects and arthropods.", 
    "183": "Although the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension is mainly explained as a response to an increased pressure load and wall tension, the relation of left ventricular mass with blood pressure is usually weak, even when 24-hour blood pressure monitoring is used. Other factors have therefore been considered, such as anthropometric and demographic characteristics, differences in life-style, genetic influences and neurohumoral factors. Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on neurohumoral factors and it has been suggested that these properties may influence their potency to reduce left ventricular mass, mainly on the basis of open single-drug studies. Several prospective randomized comparative studies have however been performed to assess whether some (classes of) drugs are more effective than others in reducing left ventricular mass. A meta-analysis of such studies, comparing diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and/or converting enzyme inhibitors, suggests that the reduction of left ventricular mass with each of these classes is similar to the reduction obtained with the other 3 classes statistically combined. Of particular interest is the observation that the 4 studies which compared a converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist concluded that the effect on left ventricular mass was not significantly different. There is evidence, however, that drugs such as minoxidil and hydralazine, do not reduce left ventricular mass.",

In 18 patients, the oral daily dose of digoxin was increased from a mean of 0.20 +/- 0.07 to 0.39 +/- 0.11 mg/day corresponding to an increase in the serum digoxin concentration from 0.67 +/- 0.22 to 1.22 +/- 0.35 ng/mL. Radionuclide and echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction; maximal treadmill time; heart failure score; serum concentrations of norepinephrine, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic factor, and antidiuretic hormone; and plasma renin activity were obtained before and after the increase in digoxin dose. Subsequently, 9 patients were randomized to receive digoxin and 9 to receive placebo and radionuclide ejection fraction measured after 12 weeks. With the higher dose of digoxin compared with the lower dose, there was a significant increase in radionuclide ejection fraction from 23.7 +/- 9.6% to 27.1 +/- 11.8% (P = .007). No significant changes were noted in heart failure score; exercise tolerance; serum concentrations of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor, and antidiuretic hormone; and plasma renin activity. There was, however, an increase in serum aldosterone concentration. Twelve weeks after the patients were randomized to receive digoxin or placebo, there was a significant decrease in ejection fraction (from 29.4 +/- 10.4% to 23.7 +/- 8.9%) in the placebo group but not in patients who continued to receive digoxin (P = .002).",

    "187": "Intimal hyperplasia is an exaggerated proliferative response to arterial intimal injury. A successful means of limiting this hyperplastic response would significantly improve patency rates of vascular reconstruction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease the proliferation and synthetic function of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, which have been implicated in the production of intimal hyperplasia. We performed a dose-response study of enalapril to assess the level at which maximal suppression of intimal hyperplasia occurs. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 grams underwent standardized carotid artery balloon catheter endothelial denudation to induce intimal hyperplasia. Six groups of ten animals each were treated with daily intramuscular injections of one of the following doses of enalapril (mg/kg): 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, and 0.150. A control group (n = 10) was treated with saline. Injections were started two days before injury and continued for 4 weeks, at which time the injured arteries were pressure-fixed in vivo and harvested. EVG-stained histologic cross-sections were measured by planimetry to determine the amount of intimal hyperplasia, which was calculated as the percentage of the arterial lumen replaced by the lesion. Enalapril suppresses the development of intimal hyperplasia in a dose-responsive manner in this model. No further suppression is achieved above a dose of 0.125 mg/kg.", 
    "188": "Extracts of head parts prepared from the leech Theromyzon tessulatum hydrolyse the Gly3-Phe4 bond of synthetic [D-Ala2, Leu5]enkephalin and the Gly-His bond of benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu. The metabolism of benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu was completely inhibited by captopril, consistent with an angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Such an enzyme has recently been isolated from T. tessulatum. However, the enkephalin hydrolysis by captopril (100 microM) was inhibited to a maximum of 70%. The residual activity hydrolyzing enkephalin was inhibited by phosphoramidon, consistent with the presence of endopeptidase-24.11, a mammalian enzyme implicated in the metabolism of neuropeptides. This enzyme was isolated using four steps of purification including gel-permeation and anion-exchange chromatographies followed by reverse-phase HPLC. This neuropeptide endopeptidase (of approximate molecular mass 45 kDa) hydrolyses, at pH 7 and 37 degrees C, both the Gly3-Phe4 bond of synthetic [D-Ala2, Leu5]enkephalin and the Phe8-His9 bond of angiotensin I. Cleavage of [D-Ala2, Leu5]enkephalin yields, respectively, the Tyr-D-Ala-Gly and Phe-Leu peptides with a specific activity of 29 nmol Tyr-D-Ala-Gly.min-1.mg protein-1 (Km 95 microM). The hydrolysis of angiotensin I yields angiotensin II and the dipeptide His-Leu with a specific activity of 1.2 nmol angiotensin min-1.mg protein-1 (Km 330 microM). The metabolism of these peptides was totally inhibited by phosphoramidon. This study therefore provides biochemical evidence for neuropeptide-degrading endopeptidases in leeches.",

Those patients with admission serum creatinine levels from 97 to 133 mumol/L and > 133 mumol/L were compared with patients with creatinine levels < 97 mumol/L. Gender, body mass index, comorbidity, cognitive status, new intake of nitrates, number of daily administrations, and daily dosage, as well as intake of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were examined as possible confounders. Fifty-six patients had headaches that had a causal link with intake of nitrates. Compared with the lowest creatinine group, after adjustment for potential confounding variables, the odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for headache caused by nitrates associated with increasing serum creatinine levels were 0.6 (95% CI, 0.3 to 1.1) and 0.2 (95% CI, 0.0 to 1.2), respectively (p for trend = 0.013). Increasing age was inversely associated with headache (odds ratio for 10-year increase, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5 to 0.7]).

As a consequence, tissue edema (interstitial and/or cellular) develops and likely impairs the traffic of nutrients and waste products to and from the cellular mass, and/or challenges the microcirculation, leading to organ damage. Kidney dysfunction is measured by conventional clearance methods (renal hemodynamics and tubular function).

In addition to the circulating renin-angiotensin system, a local renin-angiotensin system appears to be present in the brain, and angiotensin II receptors have been identified in cerebral blood vessels. In this study we tested the hypothesis that endogenous angiotensin II attenuates dilatation of the cerebral vessels during hypoxia.",

Blood flow was measured four times: under control conditions, after 15 and 30 minutes of hypoxia, and after 15 minutes of reoxygenation. This was a control group to characterize changes in CBF during hypoxia. In group 2 (n = 11), blood flow was measured as in the previous group except that an infusion of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 IV) was started with the onset of hypoxia and continued through reoxygenation to the end of the experiment. The goal of this group was to examine whether endogenous activation of receptors for angiotensin II influences increases in CBF during hypoxia. In a separate series of experiments we examined the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on the hypoxic response. Thus, in one group of rabbits we measured CBF in the same manner as in group 1 (n = 13). In another group of rabbits we also measured blood flow as in group 1 except that rabbits received 10 mg/kg of the ACE inhibitor captopril before the control measurement (n = 11).

To rule out the possibility that saralasin produced non-specific attenuation of cerebral vasodilatation, we tested the influence of hypercapnia on CBF in the absence and presence of saralasin. During normocapnia, CBF values were not significantly different in the absence and presence of saralasin (57 +/- 17 and 64 +/- 6 mL.min-1.100 g-1, respectively; P > .05). Hypercapnia increased CBF similarly in the absence and presence of saralasin (81 +/- 22 and 91 +/- 19 mL.min-1.100 g-1; PaCO2 = 61 +/- 2 and 60 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; P > .05).",

Based on proposed reaction mechanisms for other zinc hydrolases, we have synthesized inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase and evaluated their effects on the formation of LTB4 from LTA4 using both purified enzyme and intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The two most effective inhibitors, an alpha-keto-beta-amino ester (compound IV) and a thioamine (compound VIII), exhibited IC50 values of 1.9 +/- 0.9 and 0.19 +/- 0.12 microM (mean +/- SD, n = 4), respectively. Compounds IV and VIII were also potent inhibitors of LTB4 biosynthesis in ionophore stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes with IC50 < 200 nM. At higher concentrations, the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid was also inhibited with IC50 approximately 10 microM for both substances. In contrast, leukocyte 15-lipoxygenase and platelet LTC4 synthase activity were not inhibited by these substances at the highest concentrations tested, 50 and 10 microM, respectively. Compounds IV and VIII thus exhibit selectivity among enzyme activities in the arachidonic acid cascade. In conclusion, we describe two compounds that are among the most potent and selective inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase and LTB4 biosynthesis by intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes, described thus far.",

In the persistent-benefit analyses, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $3,700 to $10,400/quality-adjusted life-year, depending on age. The outcome was generally not sensitive to changes in estimates of variables when they were varied individually over wide ranges. In a \"worst-case\" analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for captopril therapy remained favorable ($8,700 to $29,200/quality-adjusted life-year) for 60- to 80-year old patients but were higher ($217,600/quality-adjusted life-year) for 50-year old patients.",

    "216": "Previous studies suggest that while lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is reduced during chronic hypoxia, inhibitors of ACE attenuate hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. In an attempt to explain this paradox we investigated the possibility that whole lung ACE activity may not reflect local pulmonary vascular ACE expression. The experimental approach combined in vivo hemodynamic studies in control and chronically hypoxic rats, measurement of whole lung ACE activity, and evaluation of local pulmonary vascular ACE expression by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Total lung ACE activity was reduced to 50% of control activity by 5 d of hypoxia and remained low for the duration of the study. Immunohistochemistry showed a marked reduction of ACE staining in alveolar capillary endothelium. However, an increase in ACE staining was observed in the walls of small newly muscularized pulmonary arteries at the level of alveolar ducts and walls. In situ hybridization studies showed increased signal for ACE mRNA in the same vessels. Inhibition of ACE by captopril during chronic hypoxia attenuated pulmonary hypertension and markedly reduced distal muscularization of small pulmonary arteries. In addition, we demonstrated marked longitudinal variation in ACE expression along the normal pulmonary vasculature with the highest levels found in small muscular arteries associated with terminal and respiratory bronchioles. We conclude that local ACE expression is increased in the walls of small pulmonary arteries during the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, despite a generalized reduction in alveolar capillary ACE expression, and we speculate that local arteriolar ACE may play a role in the vascular remodeling associated with pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "217": "11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD) catalyzes the interconversion of cortisol and its inactive metabolite, cortisone, and protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from activation by cortisol. Sodium and fluid retention is a well documented phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but it is not known whether diabetes-associated alterations in cortisol metabolism contribute to its pathogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated some aspects of cortisol metabolism by measuring urinary metabolites of cortisol and cortisone in eight microalbuminuric and eight normoalbuminuric IDDM patients and eight matched control subjects. In both IDDM groups, the overnight excretion of tetrahydrocortisol (THF), allo-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-THF), and tetrahydrocortisone (THE) was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Both the allo-THF/THF ratio, a parameter of 5 alpha/5 beta-reduction of cortisol, and the cortisol to cortisone metabolite ratio (THF+allo-THF/THE), which reflects the overall direction of the cortisol to cortisone interconversion, were lower in the IDDM groups (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). In the combined subjects (n = 24), allo-THF, allo-THF/THF, and THF+allo-THF/THE were inversely correlated with hemoglobin A1c (r = -0.69, P < 0.001; r = -0.61, P < 0.01; and r = -0.58, P < 0.01, respectively). Upper arm segmental blood volume, estimated by an electrical impedance technique, was positively correlated with the cortisol to cortisone metabolite ratio in both the control subjects (r = 0.77; P < 0.05) and the IDDM patients in whom it was measured (r = 0.56; P < 0.05; n = 13), whereas the regression line was shifted leftward in IDDM (i.e. a lower ratio at the same blood volume; P < 0.03, by analysis of covariance). In seven microalbuminuric IDDM patients, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg daily for 6-12 weeks), resulted in a moderate further lowering of the cortisol to cortisone metabolite ratio (P < 0.05). The present data suggest a chronic hyperglycemia-related impairment in the reduction of corticoids to tetrahydro metabolites and an imbalance in 11 beta HSD. Altered 11 beta HSD activity is unlikely to be primarily responsible for the sodium and fluid retention in IDDM. Moreover, an additional mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition might be provided by an effect on 11 beta HSD activity.",

Basal renin mRNA concentrations were 1575 +/- 127 fg/micrograms total RNA in kidney, 52 +/- 7 in hypothalamus, 7.9 +/- 0.7 in adrenal, and 4.7 +/- 0.5 in atria. In two-kidney, one clip rats, renin mRNA in the clipped kidney was increased 5.4-fold (P = .00001) and 2.3-fold (P = .001) on each respective day after clipping and in the unclipped kidney was decreased by 27% (P = .01) and 38% (P = .04). In adrenal, 3.9-fold (P = .004) and 1.7-fold (P = .02) increases were seen on days 19 and 40, respectively, and a decrease of 57% (P = .02) was found in a hypothalamic block at day 19 but not at day 40. The decrease in hypothalamus was abolished by 1% oral NaCl, which reduced renin mRNA by 37% in the clipped kidney and by 30% in the adrenal but did not lead to any change in the unclipped kidney or hypothalamus at day 40. Hypothalamic renin mRNA was also decreased by enalapril compared with increases of sixfold to ninefold in other tissues. In conclusion, we have quantified a decrease in hypothalamic renin mRNA in two-kidney, one clip rats 19 days after clipping that can be abolished by NaCl loading, whereas in the adrenal, renin mRNA was increased. Similar relative tissue-specific changes were also seen in enalapril-treated rats.", 
    "219": "The mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition influences renal perfusion and function has assumed growing importance as alternatives for blocking the system have emerged. Neither renin inhibitors nor angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists are likely to trigger responses similar to ACE inhibitor-induced involvement of kinins, prostaglandins, or nitric oxide. Several observations suggest species variation in the contribution of these pathways to the renal response to ACE inhibition. In humans, recent investigation suggests that virtually all of the renal response is due to a fall in Ang II formation. Perhaps most persuasive is the surprising observation that the renal hemodynamic response to renin inhibitors exceeds by more than 50% the response to ACE inhibition in healthy humans. To the extent that kinins or prostaglandins contribute to the renal response to ACE inhibition, one would anticipate a smaller response to renin inhibition. Possible explanations include an unanticipated additional action of renin inhibitors, better tissue penetration of these highly lipophilic agents, or more effective blockade of Ang II formation through an action at the rate-limiting step or non-ACE-dependent Ang II generation. Substantial evidence favors the latter two possibilities. Whatever the explanation, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that the undoubted therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibition in renal injury, documented most rigorously for type I diabetes mellitus, might be exceeded with the newer classes of agent.",

ACE inhibitor therapy has shown benefit in patients with impaired LV function. Identifying post-MI patients at risk for sudden death and preventing fatal arrhythmias has proven difficult. Class I antiarrhythmics should be avoided. Amiodarone and perhaps sotalol appear promising, but large-scale trials are still ongoing.",

Hypertrophy and fibrosis were morphometrically determined. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of simple regression and multivariate data analysis (cluster and correspondence analysis). SHR have higher cardiac mass and fibrosis, more VPB, and a decreased HR. Cluster analysis demonstrated that trandolapril was only effective in SHR. Trandolapril significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and VPB incidence and increased the HR. Simple regression analysis showed that VPB incidence correlated to both hypertrophy and fibrosis. Correspondence analysis evidenced a strong correlation between hypertrophy, fibrosis, and VPB, but only for severe hypertrophy, and the correlation disappeared for moderate hypertrophy.",

Abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and a predisposition to the generation of fatal ventricular arrhythmias are often associated with the development of the disease. Although the underlying cause of sudden death in these patients remains to be unequivocally elucidated, abnormally increased cardiac sympathetic nervous activity may be involved.", 
    "225": "Twenty-two patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV with left ventricular ejection fraction of 18 +/- 1%) and 29 healthy male volunteers participated in this study. By combining direct sampling of internal jugular venous blood via a percutaneously placed catheter with a norepinephrine and epinephrine isotope dilution method for examining neuronal transmitter release, we were able to quantify the release of central nervous system monoamine and indoleamine neurotransmitters and investigate their association with the increased efferent sympathetic outflow that is variably present in treated patients with this condition. Mean cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 145% higher in treated heart failure patients than in healthy subjects (P < .05), with norepinephrine release from the heart in 6 of 22 patients being more than the highest control value. Raised internal jugular venous spillover of epinephrine (26 +/- 12 versus 2 +/- 4 pmol/min, P < .05) and of norepinephrine and its metabolites (2740 +/- 480 versus 875 +/- 338 pmol/min, P < .05), indicative of increased central nervous system turnover of both catecholamines, occurred in cardiac failure and was quantitatively linked to the degree of activation of the cardiac sympathetic nervous outflow, as was the jugular overflow of the principal serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.", 
    "226": "An association between the degree of activation of central monoaminergic neurons and the level of sympathetic nervous tone in the heart was identified in treated patients with heart failure. Epinephrine neurons in the brain may contribute to the sympathoexcitation that is seen in this condition, with the activation of sympathoexcitatory noradrenergic neurons, most likely those of the forebrain, playing an accessory role.", 
    "227": "Based on the epidemiologic data of the Framingham heart study, arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease are the most frequent etiologic factors for the development of heart failure. In the pressure overloaded heart, hypertrophic growth of the myocardium includes the enlargement of cardiac myocytes stimulated by ventricular loading. Non-myocyte cell growth involving cardiac fibroblasts may also occur but is not primarily regulated by the hemodynamic load. Cardiac fibroblast activation is responsible for the accumulation of fibrillar type I and type III collagens within the interstitium while vascular smooth muscle cell growth accounts for the medial thickening of resistance vessels. This remodeling of the cardiac interstitium represents a major determinant of pathological hypertrophy in that it accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and impaired coronary vasodilator reserve, leading to ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction and ultimately to the appearance of symptomatic heart failure. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in regulating the structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment, including the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition that was found to prevent myocardial fibrosis in the rat with renovascular hypertension. In rats with genetic hypertension, established left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal diastolic stiffness due to interstitial fibrosis, and reduced coronary vasodilator reserve associated with medial wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril was able to restore myocardial structure and function to normal. These cardioreparative properties of ACE inhibition may be valuable in reversing left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "228": "Chronic mechanical stress of the heart by arterial hypertension is a primary cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. The cardiac renin-angiotensin system is often found activated in conditions of increased afterload or mechanical stress of myocytes. Cardiac expression of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is increased resulting in elevated cardiac angiotensin II formation. This has been demonstrated in stretched cardiac myocytes in vitro as well as in animal models of pressure overload hypertrophy (supravalvular aortic stenosis and spontaneously hypertensive rats) and in human pressure overload hypertrophy (aortic stenosis). Functional consequences of elevated angiotensin II levels may be vasoconstriction of the coronary vasculature and a deterioration of diastolic function of the hypertrophied heart. Local formation of angiotensin II may also have proliferative effects on cardiac myocytes and connective tissue cells. Angiotensin II may, thus, be an important factor causing development and progression of left ventricular hypertrophy by itself. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been found to be an effective treatment of hypertensive heart disease, probably better than any other antihypertensive medication. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy has been achieved by blockade of the angiotensin II pathway either by administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker. The animal model of supravalvular aortic stenosis has been used to show beneficial effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on hypertrophy and survival. In this rat model regression of left ventricular hypertrophy by ACE-inhibition or angiotensin II type 1-receptor blockade could be demonstrated by serial echocardiographic analyses while afterload of the left ventricle was still elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In fact, the false-negative rate for captopril scintigraphy is very low. Possible reasons for false-negative scans have not been well documented. A fifty-two-year-old man was evaluated and found to have renovascular hypertension on two occasions, at initial presentation and again eight months later (restenosis had occurred). Renovascular hypertension was present on both occasions as judged by decline of blood pressure following angioplasty of right renal artery stenosis (approximately 80% and approximately 70% stenosis on the two occasions, respectively). However, ACE-inhibitor renal scanning with 99mTc MAG-3 gave disparate results on the two occasions. The first study using oral captopril (25 mg) indicated a low probability of renal artery stenosis, whereas the second study done with the patient regularly taking lisinopril (10 mg daily) was markedly positive. Possible reasons for the initial negative study include poor absorption of oral captopril or inadequate inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by the 25 mg dose.",

In the present study, we aimed to determine in conscious roosters whether 1) hypotension evoked by atenolol or practolol, which selectively inhibit cardiac beta-receptors in mammals, is more potent than that evoked by propranolol, and 2) the renin-angiotensin (ANG) system and/or catecholamines are involved in beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced hypotension. Mean arterial pressure (171.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg) and heart rate (281 +/- 4 beats/min) of chronically cannulated roosters (n = 38) were markedly reduced by acute infusion or repeated injections (14 days) of propranolol, atenolol, or practolol, but not by SQ-14,225 (ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor) or [Sar1, Thr8]ANG II (nonselective ANG receptor antagonist). None of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers, however, showed cardioselectivity. The resting PRA of conscious roosters (1.27 +/- 0.09 ng.ml-1.h-1, n = 38) was low and did not change significantly after chronic or acute treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers except for a slight decrease induced by practolol. PRA increased after SQ-14,225. The plasma levels (pg/ml) of norepinephrine (701.9 +/- 76.0), epinephrine (337.2 +/- 57.1), and dopamine (299.1 +/- 39.0) of conscious roosters were further increased by propranolol. Practolol also increased dopamine significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "237": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibits formation of angiotensin II and, by inhibition of kinin metabolism, may also increase vascular bradykinin. The present experiments were done in sodium-depleted, conscious, unrestrained marmosets (n = 5-11) to examine the contribution of bradykinin to ACE inhibitor-induced hypotension. Aortic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were monitored via telemetry. After sodium depletion (low-sodium diet and furosemide), captopril (1 mg/kg po) caused a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (-34 +/- 3 mmHg, maximally, from 79 +/- 2 mmHg) but no change in HR compared with vehicle treatment. The bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE-140 (1 mg/kg sc) significantly inhibited the hypotensive response to captopril and caused marked tachycardia (+133 +/- 14 beats/min from 214 +/- 8 beats/min). HOE-140 (1 mg/kg sc) followed by vehicle administration had no effect on MABP but increased HR similarly. The hypotensive response to captopril was inhibited by HOE-140 regardless of the order of administration or the route of captopril administration (by mouth vs. subcutaneously). The hypotensive response to a renin inhibitor, A-72517 (3 mg/kg sc), was not inhibited by prior HOE-140 administration despite a similar HOE-140-induced tachycardia. These data suggest that the hypotensive effect of captopril in sodium-depleted, conscious marmosets is dependent on functional bradykinin B2 receptors. Also, blockade of B2 receptors uncovers marked tachycardia in this model, suggesting a tonic effect of bradykinin on control of HR in marmosets.", 
    "238": "Although angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to attenuate the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats, the precise mechanism of this protective effect remains unknown. Thus we utilized specific angiotensin II (ANG II)-receptor antagonists to investigate whether ANG II is involved directly in the hemodynamic and structural changes of pulmonary hypertension, and we tested whether the protective effects of ACE inhibition can be attributed partly to potentiation of bradykinin. During 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia, rats received, via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps, either 1) the ACE inhibitor captopril, 2) captopril plus the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist CP-0597, 3) the ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, 4) the ANG II type 2 receptor antagonist PD-123319, or 5) saline. At 14 days, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) was reduced (P < 0.05) in hypoxic rats treated with captopril (26.6 +/- 0.8 mmHg) or losartan (24.4 +/- 1.0 mmHg) compared with saline (32.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg) but was unaffected by PD-123319 (29.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg). Right ventricular hypertrophy was reduced in hypoxic rats treated with captopril or losartan compared with saline-treated rats. Morphometry showed less medial thickening and peripheral muscularization of small pulmonary arteries in hypoxic animals treated with captopril or losartan. Coadministration of CP-0597 did not reverse the protective effects of captopril on pulmonary vascular remodeling. These results suggest a novel role for endogenous ANG II, acting through the type 1 receptor, in the vascular remodeling associated with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in this model can be attributed to reduced ANG II production rather than potentiation of bradykinin.", 
    "239": "The pathogenesis of renal scarring in chronic cyclosporin nephropathy is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade by enalapril and losartan in a salt-dependent model of cyclosporin-associated chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). Rats kept on normal or low-salt diet were given cyclosporin, cyclosporin+enalapril, cyclosporin+losartan, cyclosporin+enalapril#losartan, or vehicle for 14 and 28 days. Cyclosporin reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in rats fed either diet, but only salt-depleted animals developed significant TIF. Cyclosporin also impaired renal concentrating ability and caused tubular enzymuria. Renin-angiotensin system blockade decreased blood pressure (BP) and promoted afferent arteriolar vasodilatation. Losartan reduced plasma renin activity and prevented cyclosporin-induced increment of cortical alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA. Renin-angiotensin blockade did not improve GFR and tubular function; however, it strikingly prevented TIF development, even in presence of very low BP. Rats treated with cyclosporin, hydralazine, and furosemide achieved BP values similar to losartan or enalapril groups, but there was no protection against interstitial fibrosis development. These results suggest that cyclosporin-related chronic interstitial injury is mediated by angiotensin II and that the mechanisms promoting the interstitial scarring can be dissociated from glomerular and tubular dysfunction in cyclosporin nephropathy.", 
    "240": "Pregnant women are advised against using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors due to reports of adverse effects on human fetuses. This study examined ACE binding and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding in fetuses of rats treated with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril (16 mg/kg/day fosinopril, p.o. in 4 divided doses, from gestational day (gd) 13 to gd 18). Binding of the potent radiolabeled ACE inhibitor 125I-351A to ACE in the lung and aorta of gd 19 fetuses of fosinopril-treated dams was reduced by 56 and 44%, respectively, compared to fetuses from vehicle-treated dams, indicating that fosinopril or its active metabolite, fosinoprilat, crosses the placental barrier and inhibits fetal ACE. Fetal Ang II receptor binding of 125I-Sar1,Ile8 Ang II was not altered in most of the tissues examined, although reductions in binding in the adrenal of fetuses of fosinopril-treated dams approached statistical significance.", 
    "241": "The effects of 7-methoxytacrine (7-MEOTA), a less toxic derivative of tetrahydroaminoacridine, on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecular forms were investigated in vitro. AChE molecular forms were separated by sucrose gradient sedimentation from homogenates of the frontal cerebral cortex prepared with buffer containing Triton X-100 (soluble + membrane-bound enzyme). Two molecular forms, namely 10S and 4S corresponding to globular tetrameric (G4) and monomeric (G1) forms, respectively, were detected; their molecular weights were 220,000 and 54,000 Da. A significantly higher sensitivity to 7-MEOTA of G4 than of G1 forms was observed. The Ki values were 0.21 +/- 0.07 microM for the former and 0.70 +/- 0.15 microM for the latter. The differential inhibition of AChE molecular forms by 7-MEOTA is discussed in relation to its possible clinical application for treatment of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, in which a reduction of brain cholinergic neurotransmission is believed to play a role.", 
    "242": "Several growth factors have been implicated in the derangements of cellular metabolism and proliferation that occur in diabetes, eg. kidney mesangial expansion, retinal neovascular formation, and acceleration of atherosclerosis in large vessels. These phenomena contribute to the development and progression of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular disease. Pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing growth factor alterations, among other actions in diabetic vasculopathy, include a multitude of classes of drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, lipid-lowering drugs, and somatostatin analogs. New potential interventions, ie, antisense oligonucleotide local delivery, are being applied in growth factor research and may prove beneficial in diabetic macrovascular disease.", 
    "243": "Human neutrophil leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase is a zinc-containing metalloproteinase with aminopeptidase activity and can be inhibited by some metalloproteinase inhibitors. Human airway epithelial cells also contain an LTA4 hydrolase enzyme that has some novel properties, suggesting that this enzyme may be functionally and structurally unique. Thus, we questioned whether the epithelial cells were studied either intact or disrupted. Of the metalloproteinase inhibitors examined, only captopril, bestatin, and fosinoprilat had appreciable inhibitory activity for LTA4 hydrolase in disrupted epithelial cells. Concentration-inhibition curves to captopril, bestatin, and fosinoprilat revealed IC50 values of 430 microM, 7 microM, and 1 mM, respectively, for disrupted-cell LTA4 hydrolase activity. In contrast to its effects on neutrophils, 1,10-O-phenanthroline had no significant effect on disrupted epithelial cell hydrolase activity and had only minimal effects when this activity was partially purified (179-fold). LTA4 hydrolase concentration-inhibition curves examined in intact cells with captopril, bestatin, and 1,10-O-phenanthroline revealed IC50 values of 63, 70, and 920 microM, respectively. Aminopeptidase activity in disrupted epithelial cells was inhibited by amastatin, bestatin, and 1,10-O-phenanthroline (IC50 values of 500 nM, 1 microM, and 17 microM, respectively), but not by captopril at the highest concentration tested, 10 mM. These findings are in contrast to prior studies in neutrophils. When neutrophils were stimulated with A23187 after treatment with captopril, transcellular synthesis of LTB4 was inhibited more effectively than direct synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (43.8 +/- 2.5 vs 18.5 +/- 4.7%; N = 8, P < 0.02). We conclude that LTA4 hydrolase activity of human airway epithelial cells is inhibited by some metalloproteinase inhibitors, but that the profile of inhibition is distinct from that for the neutrophil enzyme. These data provide additional information that LTA4 hydrolase in the epithelial cell is a novel enzyme, distinct from that found in the neutrophil.", 
    "244": "Recently we demonstrated that the unique stereoelectronic relationships inherent in the structure of plasmenylethanolamine facilitate membrane fusion, and we postulated the existence of a membrane fusion protein which could exploit the propensity of plasmenylethanolamine molecular species to adapt an inverted hexagonal phase [Glaser & Gross (1994) Biochemistry 33, 5805-5812]. We now report a cryptic membrane fusion activity in rabbit brain cytosol, which requires separation from an endogenous inhibitor to express its activity, and demonstrate that vesicle fusion catalyzed by this protein is highly selective for membrane vesicles containing plasmenylethanolamine. The cytosolic protein catalyzing membrane fusion activity was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential column chromatographies, revealing a single 38-kDa protein band after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Automated Edman degradation demonstrated that the purified protein is an isoform of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was confirmed by Western blot analysis utilizing polyclonal antibodies and by solution-state inactivation of membrane fusion activity by a monoclonal antibody directed against GAPDH. Both GTP-affinity and Mono Q chromatographies resolved GAPDH isoforms that catalyzed dehydrogenase activity from the GAPDH isoform that catalyzed membrane fusion activity. The purified fusion protein was calcium-independent, resistant to treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, and possessed an obligatory requirement for plasmenylethanolamine and cholesterol. High-resolution stopped-flow kinetic analysis of plasmenylethanolamine-facilitated membrane fusion demonstrated that one tetramer of the GAPDH isoform catalyzed one fusion event between two vesicles containing plasmenylethanolamine every millisecond (on average). Collectively, these results constitute the first description of a protein which can catalyze the fusion of vesicles at a rate which satisfies the mathematical constraints imposed by the observed rates of fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in vivo.", 
    "245": "During the 1980s data became available from randomized trials concerning the clear benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly. In three large communities, we examined the impact of these findings on rates of treatment, use of specific antihypertensive drugs, and rates of elevated blood pressure as well as distributions of levels.", 
    "246": "In 1981 the National Institute on Aging initiated population-based cohort studies in the residents of three communities who were 65 years and older. East Boston, Mass; Washington and Iowa counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Conn. Participation rates ranged from 80% to 85% across sites with 10,294 community-dwelling participants in the combined cohorts. Baseline evaluation included inhome blood pressure assessment and medication inventory. Repeated in-home evaluations occurred 3 and 6 years after baseline and follow-up rates ranged from 71% to 88%.", 
    "247": "Use of antihypertensive drugs increased over time in all three communities: the age- and sex-adjusted rates of use were between 14% and 32% higher in 1988 and 1989 relative to 1982 and 1983. Parallel declines in the use of thiazide diuretics occurred in all three populations along with large increases in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. In East Boston and New Haven mean systolic blood pressure decreased substantially over time and the prevalence of elevated systolic pressure (> or = 160 mmHg) decreased overall as well as by age and sex. In Iowa the mean levels of systolic blood pressure were lowest at baseline and increased slightly.", 
    "248": "The reported evidence about the benefits of treatment for hypertension in the elderly was followed by substantial increases in treatment rates. The use of drugs with proven efficacy declined while the use of newer agents with theoretical advantages, not yet tested in clinical trials of mortality, increased. In the United States, the ongoing therapeutic efforts to lower elevated blood pressure in elderly populations may be contributing to the continuing decline in cardiovascular and stroke mortality.", 
    "249": "The effect on kidney function fo treatment of cardiac failure with ACE-inhibitors was examined retrospectively in a material of 87 consecutive patients. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether concomitant treatment with diuretics or existing generalised atherosclerosis as indicated by ongoing treatment with nitrates could be a risk factor concerning reduction of kidney function. In 11.9% of the patients an increase in S-creatinine of > 30% was observed during the first weeks of treatment. It was only necessary to stop treatment in two of these patients. In the remainder S-creatinine decreased again during ongoing treatment. In another 10.7% of patients an increase of 20-30% in S-creatinine was observed. Seventy-two point six percent of the patients had unchanged kidney function during treatment with an ACE-inhibitor. Ongoing treatment with diuretics did not seem to be a risk factor for developing reduced kidney function, whereas significantly more patients on treatment with nitrates, indicating generalised atherosclerosis, developed reduced kidney function during treatment with ACE-inhibitors. It is recommended to control kidney function before, one to two weeks and two to three months following initiation of treatment with ACE-inhibitors and to pay special attention to patients with generalised atherosclerosis.", 
    "250": "The use of ACE-inhibitors has increased greatly during the last years. They were first used in treating hypertension, but nowadays cardiac diseases, mainly cardiac failure, are common indications. This means that the drugs are used in the treatment of more elderly patients who often have generalised atherosclerosis. This means that the patients must be controlled more often after initiation of treatment, especially concerning kidney function, since treatment with ACE-inhibitors can cause pronounced changes in renal haemodynamics and kidney function. This review focuses on the effects of ACE-inhibitors on renal haemodynamics and kidney function, which may be positive, with preservation of kidney function in diabetic and other chronic nephropathy, or negative, for example in cases with atherosclerotic stenosis of large or small renal arteries. It is concluded, that in cases of diabetic nephropathy an ACE-inhibitor is the \"drug of choice\" for treatment of hypertension. Furthermore the ACE-inhibitors seem to reduce the rate of deterioration of renal function and proteinuria in other kidney diseases. It is emphasized, that during treatment with ACE-inhibitors kidney function must be controlled before and following one to two weeks of treatment, if the dose is changed and in all cases following two to three months of treatment. Special attention should be given to patients with atherosclerotic manifestations e.g. angina.", 
    "251": "This paper reports the purification of an angiotensing-converting like enzyme (ACE) of ca. 120 kDa from extracts of head membranes of the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. After solubilization with Triton X-114, the ACE-like enzyme contained in the detergent-poor fraction was separated using five steps of purification including gel permeation and anion exchange chromatographies followed by reverse-phase HPLC. The first 23 amino acid residues of the N-terminal part (GLDPELSPGCFSADEAGAQLFAE) of the purified S-pyridylethylated leech ACE established by automated Edman degradation revealed ca. 87% sequence identity with the N-terminal sequence of the guinea pig ACE. This enzyme cleaves the hyppuryl-His-Leu substrate with a specific activity of 5600 nmol hyppurate min-1 mg protein-1. Hydrolysis of this substrate by ACE-like enzyme is inhibited at 80% by 10 microM captopril or 10 microM lisinopril (IC50 of 200 nM and 50 nM, respectively). This enzyme is close in sequence and in activity to single domain vertebrate ACE. This is the first N-terminal sequence of an ACE-like enzyme determined in invertebrates.",

    "256": "Kininogen-deficient Brown Norway Katholiek rats (BN-Ka) excrete little urinary kinin, compared with normal rats of the same strain (BN Kitasato rats (BN-Ki)). Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt treatment increased systolic blood pressure in both rats, but much faster in BN-Ka than in BN-Ki. Daily subcutaneous administration of ebelactone B (15 and 5 mg/kg/day), a rat urinary carboxypeptidase Y-like kininase inhibitor, significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in BN-Ki, but not in BN-Ka. This treatment significantly increased urinary Na+ excretion and reduced Na+ concentration in the erythrocytes in BN-Ki, but not in BN-Ka. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (5 mg/kg/day s.c.), did not reduce the systolic blood pressure in either BN-Ki or BN-Ka. These results suggested that ebelactone B has promise as a preventive agent for the development of hypertension acting through the inhibition of urinary kinin degradation.", 
    "257": "A systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg is a more significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease than a diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg, regardless of a patient's age. Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension significantly reduces the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, even in patients who are over 80 years of age. Non-pharmacologic measures and behavior modification should be tried for three to six months in a patient with mildly elevated blood pressure (140 to 160 mm Hg/90 to 100 mm Hg). If these measures fail or the patient has target-organ disease or multiple cardiac risk factors, medication may be prescribed earlier. Half the usual recommended dose should be initially prescribed in the frail elderly. Long-acting diuretics or beta blockers are recommended first-line agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and alpha blockers have not been shown to reduce mortality in hypertensive patients who do not have comorbid disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit hypertensive patients with heart failure, and calcium channel blockers may help those with angina, especially vasospastic angina.", 
    "258": "Several hundred phosphinic peptides having the general formula Z-(L,D)Phe psi (PO2CH2)(L,D)Xaa'-Yaa'-Zaa', where Xaa' = Gly or Ala and Yaa' and Zaa' represent 20 different amino acids, have been synthesized by the combinatorial chemistry approach. Peptide mixtures or individual peptides were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the rat brain zinc endopeptidases 24-15 and 24-16. Numerous phosphinic peptides of this series act as potent (Ki in the nanomolar range) mixed inhibitors of these two peptidases. However, our systematic and comparative strategy led us to delineate the residues located in P2' and P3' positions of the inhibitors that are preferred by these two peptidases. Thus, endopeptidase 24-15 exhibits a marked preference for inhibitors containing a basic residue (Arg or Lys) in the P2' position, while 24-16 prefers a proline in this position. The P3' position has less influence on the inhibitory potency and selectivity, both peptidases preferring a hydrophobic residue at this position. On the basis of these observations, we have prepared highly potent and selective inhibitors of endopeptidase 24-15. The Z-(L,D)Phe psi-(PO2CH2)(L,D)Ala-Arg-Met compound (mixture of the four diastereoisomers) displays a Ki value of 70 pM for endopeptidase 24-15. The most selective inhibitor of endopeptidase 24-15 in this series, Z-(L,D)Phe psi (PO2-CH2)(L,D)Ala-Arg-Phe, exhibits a Ki value of 0.160 nM and is more than 3 orders of magnitude less potent toward endopeptidase 24-16 (Ki = 530 nM). Furthermore, at 1 microM this selective inhibitor is unable to affect the activity of several other zinc peptidases, namely endopeptidase 24-11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase M, leucine aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidases A and B. Therefore, Z-(L,D)Phe psi (PO2CH2)(L,D)Ala-Arg-Phe can be considered as the most potent and specific inhibitor of endopeptidase 24-15 developed to date. This new inhibitor should be useful in assessing the contribution of this proteolytic activity in the physiological inactivation of neuropeptides known to be hydrolyzed, at least in vitro, by endopeptidase 24-15. Our study also demonstrates that the combinatorial chemistry approach leading to the development of phosphinic peptide libraries is a powerful strategy for discovering highly potent and selective inhibitors of zinc metalloproteases and should find a broader application in studies of this important class of enzymes.",

All patients had advanced heart failure, as evidenced by a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.16 +/- 0.01 and a mean maximal oxygen consumption of 13.6 +/- 0.6 mL.kg-1.min-1 despite digitalis, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (if tolerated). After a 3-week, open-label, up-titration period, 49 of the 56 patients were assigned (in a double-blind fashion using a 2:1 randomization) to receive either carvedilol (25 mg BID, n = 33) or matching placebo (n = 16) for 14 weeks, while background therapy remained constant. Hemodynamic and functional variables were measured at the start and end of the study. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the carvedilol group showed improved cardiac performance, as reflected by an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P = .005) and stroke volume index (P = .010) and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and systemic vascular resistance (P = .003, .002, and .017, respectively). In addition, compared with placebo, patients treated with carvedilol benefited clinically, as shown by an improvement in symptom scores (P = .002), functional class (P = .013), and submaximal exercise tolerance (P = .006). The combined risk of death, worsening heart failure, and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (P = .028), but carvedilol-treated patients had more dizziness and advanced heart block.",

Either as a cause of adverse events or as a marker of haemodynamic status, augmented neurohumoral activation is associated with decreased short- and long-term survival. Although the predictive value of neurohumoral assessment is generally reduced after adjustment for demographic, clinical and haemodynamic variables in multivariate models, recent data suggest that determination of circulating neurohormone concentrations may provide significant, independent prognostic information in cases of acute myocardial infarction. The clinical usefulness of neurohumoral determination as a risk stratification tool and as a method of identifying patients who might benefit from therapeutic intervention remains to be established.", 
    "263": "The membrane-bound form of aminopeptidase P (aminoacylprolyl-peptide hydrolase) (EC 3.4.11.9) was purified 670-fold to apparent homogeneity from rat lung microsomes. The enzyme was solubilized from the membranes using a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The purification scheme also resulted in homogeneous preparations of dipeptidylpeptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19). Aminopeptidase P had a subunit molecular weight of 90,000, which included at least 17% N-linked carbohydrate. The molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography varied from 220,000 to 340,000, depending on the conditions used. The amino acid composition was determined and the N-terminal sequence was found to be X1-Gly2-Pro3-Glu4-Ser5-Leu6-Gly7-Arg8-Glu9-As p10-Val11-Arg12-Asp13-X14-Ser15- Thr16-Asn17-Pro18-Pro19-Arg20-Leu21- X22-Val23-Thr24-Ala25-. Aminopeptidase P cleaved the Arg1-Pro2 bond of bradykinin with a kcat/Km of 5.7 x 10(5) s-1 M-1. N-Terminal fragments of bradykinin including Arg-Pro-Pro, but not Arg-Pro, were also cleaved. The enzyme was shown to have four binding subsites (S1, S1', S2'. S3'), the first three of which must be occupied for hydrolysis to occur. Neuropeptide Y and allatostatin I were hydrolyzed at the Tyr1-Pro2 bond and Ala1-Pro2 bond, respectively. The pH optimum for Arg-Pro-Pro cleavage was 6.8-7.5 in most buffers. The enzyme was most stable in the range of pH 7.0-10.5 in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol). NaCl inhibited activity completely at 2 M. Mn2+ had variable effects on activity, depending on its concentration and the substrate used. Various peptides having an N-terminal Pro-Pro sequence were inhibitory. The enzyme was also inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid, apstatin, and captopril. The carboxyalkyl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ramiprilat and enalaprilat, inhibited activity in the micromolar range only in the presence of Mn2+.", 
    "264": "Clinical management of acute myocardial infarction has been strongly influenced by large, simple trials (mega-trials) with unrestrictive protocols and limited data collection. The design has been adopted to increase statistical power to a maximum. Its validity rests on an effective randomisation procedure and intention-to-treat analysis of deaths. Experience has shown that mega-trials tend to generate effect-estimates nearer the null than those from conventional trials or meta-analyses. When a small or absent observed treatment effect (or subgroup effect) in a mega-trial contrasts with the results of conventionally designed trials, it is necessary to assess both null bias and failure to increase the true treatment effect to a maximum in the mega-trial. Null bias will arise when the contrast between treatment and no-treatment, or between subgroups, is blunted either by non-protocol therapy or by inaccuracy of data, including misclassification between subgroups. Each is more likely with an unrestrictive design. To increase the true treatment effect to a maximum, trial conditions must be specified with insight into mechanism, dose-dependence, and time-dependence. The mega-trial design is therefore unsuited to an exploratory role. These issues are illustrated by the examples of nitrates, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and magnesium in acute myocardial infarction but have general relevance to the validity and generalisability of simple trials.", 
    "265": "The cellular mechanisms following myocardial infarction remain poorly characterized. It is believed that an inflammatory and immunologic process may be involved and that the beneficial effects of enalapril on remodeling may, in part, work through an immune mechanism. To characterize the effect of enalapril on immune alterations in the late phase of ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction, rats underwent left coronary artery ligation followed by 6 weeks of either enalapril or placebo treatment. Infarct sizes, heart weights, and volumes were compared. Peripheral and splenic leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets, along with T cell blastogenesis, were quantified in enalapril treated rats 6 weeks after coronary ligation and compared to untreated control rats. Additionally, antibody production to a de novo antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, was assessed with and without treatment. Average infarct size was equivalent among enalapril-treated myocardial infarction rats and untreated infarct rats. There was, however, less left and right ventricular hypertrophy in the enalapril treated group. Enalapril completely prevented the 42% increase in white blood count, the 88% increase in neutrophils, and the 28% increase in lymphocyte count seen in untreated infarct rats. Both untreated and enalapril treated rats tended toward a decrease in T helper:suppressor ratio. All rats treated with enalapril, however, had a significant increase in the T helper:suppressor ratio versus untreated control rats (F = 3.6, P = .018). Blastogenesis was markedly increased in T cells from infarcted animals. This was mitigated by treatment with enalapril. Additionally, immunoglobulin G antibody production was significantly lessened in rats treated with enalapril. The results of this study suggest that alterations in immunoregulatory cell type and function occurs following myocardial infarction. The beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril may be, in part, due to its mitigating effects on immune cell release and activation following myocardial infarction.", 
    "266": "To clarify whether in vivo expression of growth factors in the glomerulus is induced in a hypertensive animal model, we investigated the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B chain, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptors in glomeruli of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We also investigated the effects of treatment with cilazapril, and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, on this expression. First, the expression of PDGF B chain, TGF-beta, and Ang II receptors from the glomerulus were investigated using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in SHR and WKY rats. Although there was no significant difference in PDGF B chain, TGF-beta, and Ang II receptors from the glomerulus were investigated using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in SHR and WKY rats. Although there was no significant difference in PDGF B chain, TGF-beta or Ang II receptor expression between SHR and WKY rats at the age of 7 weeks, the PDGF B chain expression of 16-week-old SHR was significantly higher (4.4-fold) than that of age-matched WKY rats. Next, we administered oral cilazapril at a dose of 10 mg/kg to 13-week-old SHR daily for 3 weeks. The systolic blood pressure in SHR treated with cilazapril was significantly lower than that in control SHR. After administration of cilazapril for 3 weeks, we examined the in vivo expression of growth factors and Ang II receptors in the glomerulus. The PDGF B chain expression was suppressed by treatment with cilazapril (2.5-fold) as compared with nontreated SHR. No alteration in TGF-beta or Ang II receptor expression was detected. We did not find any histological changes in the kidneys of SHR, WKY rats or cilazapril-treated SHR, and cilazapril treatment did not suppress the glomerular size. These findings indicate that the expression of PDGF B chain in the glomerulus preceded the appearance of histological changes in SHR and that the administration of cilazapril inhibited the expression of PDGF B chain without affecting the glomerular size. This suggests that angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors directly suppress the Ang II-induced PDGF B chain promotion in the glomerulus of SHR at the established hypertensive stage.", 
    "267": "Previously we have found that administration of thiorphan alone or in combination with bestatin exerts antitumor effect in mice, including reduction of B16 melanoma tumor growth and prolongation of survival time. These data prompted us to extend our studies to estimate the effect of treatment with thiorphan, captopril and bestatin on lung metastases in mice. Administration of thiorphan alone at a dose of 25 micrograms/mouse or in combination with bestatin (50 micrograms) or captopril (5 mg/mouse) decreased the number of spontaneous metastases in lungs of Lewis lung carcinoma bearing mice. Neither the injections of bestatin, captopril nor bestatin in combination with captopril influenced the number of lung tumor colonies. Treatment with thiorphan at a dose 25 micrograms augmented cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. These observations explain partly the mechanism of action of thiorphan.", 
    "268": "The influence of captopril and ritanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist) on the serotonin-induced contraction of isolated tail artery of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive (2K, 1C-RHR) and normotensive rats was studied. Captopril, administrated in a single dose of 100 mg/kg, po or in a dose of 30 mg/kg/day, po for one week, diminished the systolic blood pressure in both groups of rats. Ritanserin (0.01 mg/kg/day, sc for one week) administrated alone or in combination with captopril (30 mg/kg/day) evoked such effect only in 2K, 1C-RHR. The reactivity of rat tail artery isolated from 2K, 1C-RHR to serotonin was significantly higher than that obtained from normotensive ones. Captopril given in a single dose or chronically did not change the serotonin-induced contraction of rat tail artery in normotensive rats. The attenuation of serotonin contractile effect was registered in hypertensive rats pre-treated with captopril. Administration ritanserin with or without captopril also inhibited the response to serotonin in both groups. The stronger effect was observed after administration of ritanserin with captopril in 2K, 1C-RHR than in control group. Our results indicate, that in 2K, 1C-RHR the reactivity of rat tail arteries to serotonin is enhanced and this effect can be reduced by chronic captopril administration.", 
    "269": "In the present study, we explored whether or not a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor provokes cough in awake guinea-pigs. Inhalation of phosphoramidon at a concentration of 10(-6) M did not cause cough, but increasing the concentration to 10(-5) M caused cough with a latency of about 10 to 12 min. Inhalation of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, did not cause cough, even at high concentrations of 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) significantly increased the number of coughs caused by substance P and capsaicin. Capsaicin-induced coughs were more easily produced in bronchitic guinea-pigs than in normal guinea-pigs. However, there was no significant difference in the number of phosphoramidon-induced coughs between normal and bronchitic guinea-pigs. Phosphoramidon-induced coughs were significantly depressed by codeine (20 mg/kg, p.o.) and CP96345 (2 mg/kg, i.v.). The present results provide new evidence for the proposed idea that neutral endopeptidase may regulate the occurrence of cough.", 
    "270": "In this preliminary study, fibroblasts derived from uterine endometrium as a substitute for normal endometrial stroma were used to analyse the stromal role in uterine endometrium, which depends on oestrogen for growth. C-Ha-ras expression and tyrosine kinase (TK) activity in the fibroblasts were increased by oestradiol, and the increase was diminished by progesterone. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), an activator of TK, also increased c-Ha-ras expression. The combination of both oestradiol and EGF at maximum effective concentration exerted no additive and synergistic effect on induction of c-Has-ras expression. Pretreatment with tyrphostin, an inhibitor of TK, abolished the oestrogen-inducible expression of c-Ha-ras. Oestrogen might lead to rapid induction of c-Ha-ras expression in endometrial stroma, at least in part, via the activation of TK for the early stages of oestrogen dependent growth in endometrium.", 
    "271": "We studied 25 patients with hypertension documented through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to know the antihypertensive effect of Lisinopril and its action throughout the day. ABPM was done in all patients after two weeks of washout (phase 1). Then patients took 20 mg daily of Lisinopril during four weeks and after that ABPM was repeated (phase 2). Finally, those patients who persisted with high blood pressure received 40 mg daily of Lisinopril during four more weeks and again ABPM was repeated (phase 3). We found statistic difference in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure among the three phases. During the first phase there were 17 patients (68%) with high blood pressure and this number decreased to 8 (32%) in the second one and to 7 (28%) in the third phase. The results show that Lisinopril has satisfactory antihypertensive effect in about 40% of patients. Nevertheless 20% of the case remained with high blood pressure despite treatment with 40 mg of Lisinopril. On the other hand, both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased satisfactory during the night with the dosage received in the morning. We concluded that Lisinopril has moderate effect when it is given as monotherapy and, it has satisfactory effect all over the day.",

The study consisted of a 4-week placebo washout phase and a 12-week active treatment phase. Patients with mild-to-moderate, uncomplicated essential hypertension were considered for participation in the study. To enter the treatment phase of the study, a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg was required. Patients received either 50-mg losartan once daily or 5-mg enalapril once daily at randomization. The dose of enalapril could be titrated to 10 mg after 4 weeks and 25 mg of HCTZ could be added after 8 weeks, based on measurements of SiDBP at clinic visits. The dose of losartan remained at 50 mg; 12.5 mg of HCTZ could be added after 8 weeks. Changes in the treatment regimen at each step were required if SiDBP remained > or = mm Hg. Doses of the diuretic were chosen based on commercially available forms of the test agents in combination with HCTZ. Trough blood pressure, heart rate, and safety parameters were measured at 4-week intervals during the treatment phase of the study. Significant reductions in mean SiDBP and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) were achieved at all time points (4, 8, and 12 weeks) with both treatments. No significant differences between treatment groups for mean changes in SiDBP or SiSBP were observed overall. At study end, patients receiving the losartan regimen had a mean reduction in SiDBP of 10.3 mm Hg, whereas patients in the enalapril regimen had a mean reduction of 9.8 mm Hg. Likewise, the percentage of patients reaching goal blood pressure reduction was not significantly different between groups. The mean reduction in SiDBP-- but not SiSBP--in black patients was slightly greater in the losartan group than in the enalapril group (SiDBP, 10.0 mm Hg losartan vs 8.0 mm Hg enalapril; P = 0.02). Similarly, losartan patients aged 65 years and older had a slightly greater decrease in SiDBP than comparable enalapril patients (12.7 mm Hg vs 8.7 mm Hg; P = 0.03). The importance of these differences between subgroups must be clarified by additional studies. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated. A regimen of losartan alone or in combination with HCTZ was effective in treating patients with essential hypertension and was comparable to a regimen of enalapril alone or in combination with HCTZ. However, treatment with losartan was associated with a lower incidence of cough.",

    "278": "The mechanism of the cough associated with ACE inhibitor treatment is unrelated to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system because treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors has not caused similar problems. Other substrates of ACE have been implicated, and the side effect has been linked in particular to an accumulation of bradykinin or tachykinins in the airways with consequent stimulation of vagal afferents that subserve the cough reflex, particularly the non-myelinated or C fibres. Some of the effects of bradykinin in particular may be due to secondary activation of prostaglandins (PG), especially PGE2 and PGI2. Anecdotal evidence that cyclooxygenase inhibitors prevent the cough has not been sustained in well controlled clinical trials, but recent evidence suggests that inhaled cromoglycate may have a significant inhibitory effect. The mechanism of action of cromoglycate is not well understood but evidence of inhibition of local neural reflexes has been inferred, mostly from animal studies. The observation seems unlikely to have much practical benefit for it is difficult to envisage routine use of an inhaled agent to prevent a drug side effect. The question of whether ACE inhibitors are safe in patients with asthma is still open, and most rechallenge studies have shown little effect on lung function. Data from one large-scale surveillance study suggest that a few individuals may experience dyspnoea and wheezing but no causal relationship has been established.",

This may be a problem in patients with severe congestive heart failure, so that it is important to monitor the effect of the ACE inhibitor in this group. Hyperkalaemia can develop in patients with severe renal impairment and potassium plasma levels should be monitored. Renal impairment is another potential problem and in hypertensive patients renal function should be measured before, and a few weeks after, starting treatment. This is especially important when there is any possibility of fibromuscular hyperplasia or atheroscerotic renal artery stenosis. NON-PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEM: In addition to a cough, which is the most common problem, skin rashes, loss of taste, haematological effects and angioneurotic oedema are also encountered.

Two-day-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were injected with streptozotocin or vehicle as control. UNX was performed at 3 weeks of age, and enalapril or nicardipine was administered in drinking water from 7 weeks of age. Uninephrectomy (UNX) markedly exacerbated hypertension and renal injury in the nondiabetic and diabetic SHR. Enalapril and nicardipine comparably reduced blood pressure in UNX diabetic SHR. However, serum creatinine was significantly elevated in the nicardipine-treated group as compared with the enalapril-treated group at 24 weeks of age (nicardipine-treated group, 67 +/- 4 microM; enalapril-treated group, 49 +/- 3 microM; P < 0.01; untreated group 57 +/- 4 microM). Furthermore, the incidence of glomerular sclerosis was similar between untreated and nicardipine-treated groups, whereas it tended to be reduced in the enalapril-treated group. In a separate experiment of diabetic SHR without UNX, enalapril therapy significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and albuminuria (P < 0.01). This study showed that a renoprotective effect was seen in enalapril but not in nicardipine in UNX diabetic SHR despite the comparable reduction of blood pressure. This suggests that enalapril may be more effective than nicardipine in delaying the progression of a severe form of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "284": "Hypertension occurs in 50% of the elderly persons in industrialized societies. This disorder of the regulation of the arterial blood pressure has different manifestations in different age groups. The young hypertensive usually has an increase in cardiac output and a normal peripheral vascular resistance. The elderly patient with hypertension exhibits a decreased cardiac output and an increased peripheral vascular resistance. In the elderly hypertensive there is a progressive anteriolar narrowing and there is hardening of the largest arteries. The vascular disease that contributes to the hypertension in the elderly also causes hypoperfusion of the target organs. During the aging process there is a decrease in cardiac output, glomerular filtration rate, vital capacity, renal plasma flow and maximal cardiac rate. There are changes in the kidneys and the liver that influence the way different medications are handled by the body. The main findings of the Australian, EWPHE, Coope & Warrender, SHEP, STOP-HYP and MRC studies of hypertension in the elderly have been summarized. The intervention studies have proven that the treatment of hypertension in the elderly patient is efficacious and decreases the mortality and morbidity due to coronary and cerebrovascular events. The pharmacologic agents available for the treatment of hypertension in the elderly are the diuretics, beta blockers, vasodilators, calcium-channel blockers, adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The morbidity and mortality benefits derived from antihypertensive trials are greater for the older than for the younger patients. The pharmacologic antihypertensive agents to be used in older patients will also depend upon the presence or not of associated illnesses in which some agents might be harmful or contraindicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We examined the effects of ACE inhibitor treatment and its withdrawal on angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin I (Ang I) in plasma, kidney, adrenal, heart, aorta, brown adipose tissue, lung, and brain of male SHR and normotensive Donryu rats. Rats were administered either vehicle or perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) from 6 to 10 weeks, from 6 to 20 weeks, and from 6 to 10 weeks, followed by perindopril withdrawal from 10 to 20 weeks. Angiotensin peptides and plasma levels of renin, angiotensinogen, ACE, and aldosterone were measured at 10 and 20 weeks of age. Perindopril reduced BP of both SHR and Donryu rats, although only SHR showed a reduction of BP of 19 mm Hg after perindopril withdrawal, associated with a reduction of 5% in heart weight/body weight ratio. Perindopril reduced the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio in all tissues by > 50%, with strain- and tissue-specific differences in the effects of perindopril on the levels of individual angiotensin peptides. None of the changes in Ang II levels persisted after perindopril withdrawal. In contrast to those of Donryu rats, plasma angiotensinogen levels of perindopril-withdrawn SHR were 14% lower than those of vehicle-treated SHR (p = 0.0356). Although the lower BP of perindopril-withdrawn SHR was not associated with an alteration in Ang II levels, the suppressed plasma angiotensinogen levels may have contributed to the lower BP of these rats. Alternatively, another action of perindopril, such as a change in cardiovascular structure, may have been responsible for the reduced BP of perindopril-withdrawn SHR.", 
    "295": "The effects of growth hormone (GH) plus insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were tested in an experimental model of cardiac failure treated with chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Myocardial infarction was induced in rats by left coronary artery ligation. Two weeks after ligation, the animals received either captopril (2 g/L in drinking water) or water for 3 months. The rats were then given either GH (2 mg/kg/day) plus IGF-1 (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 14 days. Captopril treatment decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (p < 0.05), and increased cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) (p < 0.05). GH/IGF-1 or captopril+GH/IGF-1 treatment decreased MAP, LVEDP, and SVR (p < 0.05), and increased left ventricular maximum dP/dt, CI, and SVI (p < 0.05). The increases in CI and SVI were significantly greater in the captopril+GH/IGF-1-treated animals than in those treated with captopril alone (p < 0.05). The beneficial effect of captopril in reducing cardiac hypertrophy was preserved in the captopril+GH/IGF-1 group. The results indicate that GH/IGF-1 and captopril can improve cardiac performance in congestive heart failure by independent and complementary mechanisms.", 
    "296": "We investigated the effects of chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril on cardiac and vascular noradrenergic neurotransmission as related to cardiovascular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). SHRs were treated with fosinopril at \"high dose\" (SHR-HD, 25 mg/kg/day) or \"low dose\" (SHR-LD, 1 mg/kg/day) from the 6th to the 12th week of age, and compared to age-matched untreated SHRs (SHR-C) and Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY). Blood pressure was significantly reduced in SHR-HD but not in SHR-LD when compared to SHR-C. The antihypertensive dose of fosinopril reduced both cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, whereas the low dose was effective only in reducing vascular hypertrophy. Several differences in presynaptic and postsynaptic cardiovascular noradrenergic neurotransmission were observed between SHR-C and WKY rats (increased cardiac norepinephrine concentration, down-regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, reduced alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor response of small mesenteric arteries to exogenous norepinephrine). All these differences were abolished by ACE inhibitor treatment, both at antihypertensive or at subantihypertensive doses. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic ACE inhibition may exert an inhibitory modulation on the peripheral adrenergic transmission, which is not related to blood pressure reduction. This modulation does not appear to be a determinant in preventing the development of cardiac hypertrophy but may play a role in the regression of vascular structural alterations in spontaneously hypertensive rats.",

XR510 was shown to inhibit the specific binding of [125I]Sar1,Ile8-Ang II for AT1 and AT2 subtype binding sites in rat adrenal membranes with IC50 of 0.26 and 0.28 nM, respectively, and in human tissues with subnanomolar binding affinity. In isolated rabbit aorta, XR510 exerted insurmountable Ang II antagonism with a Kb value of 4 nM. In conscious renal hypertensive rats, XR510 decreased blood pressure (BP) with intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) ED30 of 0.08 and 0.27 mg/kg, respectively. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), repeated daily oral dosing of XR510, losartan, and enalapril at 30 mg/kg/day decreased BP similarly. In conscious furosemide-treated dogs, XR510, given either intravenously or orally, decreased BP. These results suggest that XR510 is an orally active and selective Ang II receptor antagonist with equal binding affinities for AT1 and AT2 receptor binding sites.", 
    "298": "Marked neuro-endocrine activation in patients with heart failure indicates a worse prognosis and a greater prognostic benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors. However, although the incidence of heart failure rises rapidly with age, relatively little is known about activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous system in patients with heart failure over the age of 75 years. This study was undertaken to investigate plasma concentrations of neurohormonal variables in elderly patients referred to the cardiac clinic with a presumptive, but unconfirmed, diagnosis of heart failure, and to compare these values to plasma concentrations found in age-matched normal subjects. Fifty patients referred with a diagnosis of heart failure were studied. All were receiving a diuretic but not an ACE inhibitor. Patients with renal, haematological and valve disease were excluded. Routine biochemistry and neurohormonal measurements were performed at their first visit, together with an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and a full clinical examination by an experienced cardiologist. An echocardiogram and Doppler study was also performed and the diagnosis of heart failure either confirmed or refuted. Plasma concentrations of neuro-endocrine variables in healthy elderly subjects were similar to our normal laboratory range in younger subjects with the exception of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (40 +/- 6 pg.ml-1, normal range < 40) and noradrenaline (5.7 +/- 0.7 nmol.l-1, normal range < 2.8). Impairment of left ventricular systolic function was confirmed in 38 of the 50 symptomatic patients (76%) and was associated with increases in plasma concentrations of active renin (58 +/- 8 IU.mol-1, P < 0.001 compared to healthy elderly subjects), angiotensin II (23 +/- 5 pg.ml-1, P < 0.008), noradrenaline (7.7 +/- 1.2 nmol.l-1, P < 0.01) and atrial natriuretic peptide (121 +/- 18 pg.ml-1, P < 0.002). Plasma concentrations were similar in normal subjects and those receiving treatment for heart failure but in whom the diagnosis was not confirmed. A weak relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and left ventricular fractional shortening was demonstrated (r = -0.5, P < 0.001). Using an upper limit of ANP in the healthy elderly subjects of 62 pmol.ml-1 (mean + SD), plasma concentrations of ANP in the population with suspected heart failure had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 66% for the diagnosis of heart failure among elderly patients in the community or where access to echocardiography is limited. Left ventricular diastolic filling (assessed by Doppler) was abnormal in healthy elderly subjects and patients with heart failure, and appeared of limited value in the diagnosis of heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction. This study confirms that the renin-angiotensin system is activated in elderly patients with heart failure treated with diuretics. ANP may be helpful in diagnosing heart failure where it appears to have a complimentary role to echocardiography.", 
    "299": "The effects of perindopril and metoprolol on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and function were studied in 47 essential hypertensive patients with LVH. Previous antihypertensive drugs were discontinued for at least 2 weeks, after which patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. 25 subjects were treated with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily in the morning (Group A) and 22 subjects with metoprolol 25 to 62.5 mg twice daily (Group B). The subjects were evaluated before and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment by use of echocardiography. Before treatment LV mass indexes (LVMI) of two groups were respectively 143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 and 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2 (P > 0.05). In Group A, reduction of LVMI occurred after 4 weeks of treatment, and more pronounced after 8 weeks (from 143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 to 126.6 +/- 15.3 g/m2, P < 0.001), whereas reduction of LVMI occurred only after 8 weeks in Group B (from 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2 to 133.4 +/- 13.2 g/m2, P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in LVMI between the two groups after 8 weeks. LV systolic function remained unchanged, whereas E/A increased significantly (P < 0.001) in two groups after 8 weeks. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with perindopril and metoprolol induced a significant regression of LVH associated with improvement in LV diastolic performance. Perindopril, compared with metoprolol, was more effective in reversing LVH.", 
    "300": "We investigated the effects of captopril on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted by T98G glioma cells and their invasiveness in vitro. On gelatin zymography, captopril inhibited gelatinolytic activities in the culture media of T98G cells. This inhibitory effect was reversed by the presence of excess zinc. In an in vitro invasion assay, invasion into the reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) by T98G glioma cells was inhibited by captopril in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was also reversed by the addition of zinc to the culture media. However, at the effective concentration of captopril for the prevention of tumor cell invasion it did not inhibit the motility, adhesion to Matrigel or proliferation of T98G cells. These findings suggest that captopril inhibits the invasiveness of T98G glioma cells due to its MMP inhibitory activity, chelating zinc ions at the active center of MMPs.",

After a 20-min control period, an AVP V1-receptor antagonist (d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP) was injected into six conscious resting dogs. Thirty minutes after AVP V1-receptor blockade, dogs were exposed to sequential 20-min periods of 5 and 6.5% inspired CO2 in air. A second protocol (no AVP V1-receptor blockade) was conducted as a control. As predicted, AVP V1-receptor blockade enhanced ventilation during inhalation of 6.5% CO2 in association with an increased metabolic rate and increased plasma angiotensin II (ANG II). In eupneic dogs, stimulation of respiration by AVP V1-receptor blockade is mediated by ANG II. A third protocol with ANG II-receptor blockade (intravenous infusion of saralasin) combined with AVP V1-receptor blockade indicated that ANG II mediated the increase in metabolism and the augmented ventilation during inhalation of 6.5% CO2. We conclude that during acute hypercapnia of sufficient magnitude, and perhaps duration, AVP inhibits an ANG II-mediated stimulation of metabolism and respiration.",

Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the development and maintenance of hypertension before the development of renal failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated for treatment of hypertension before the development of renal failure, but in severe renal failure these agents may cause further deterioration in renal function. Treatment of hypertension may not retard the progression of renal failure but is necessary for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "303": "Chronic consumption of the highly specific angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was found to decrease the activity of the enzyme in the rat hypothalamus and striatum and to enhance it in the pituitary and blood serum. The agent also increased the activity of carboxypeptidase N in the serum and that of carboxypeptidase H in the pituitary. Reserpine, a catecholaminergic blocking agent, reduces the pituitary and serum activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme and activates soluble carboxypeptidase H in the pituitary and striatum and membrane-bound carboxypeptidase in the hypothalamus and striatum. Possible mechanisms of action of captopril and reserpine on the activity of the enzymes in question, as well as a contribution of these enzymes to their antihypertensive effect are discussed in the paper.",

For this aim 669 hypertensive patients have been randomized in a double blind, parallel study to the monotherapy or to the association. The follow-up was of 12 weeks, after a run-in wash-out period of 3-4 weeks. Seated blood pressure and heart rate were measured in all 4 outpatients visit and blood was withdrawn for serum electrolytes, glycemia, serum creatinine, uric acid and lipoprotein profile. 338 patients were randomized to the association and 331 to monotherapy with a slight prevalence of women. Mean age (58 +/- 9 and 56 +/- 10 years), pretreatment seated blood pressure (165 +/- 14/102 +/- 5 and 166 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mmHg) and heart rate (77 +/- 9 heart/min in both group) were similar in the two groups. Seated blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups (-22.8/-16.8 mmHg in the association group and -18.8/-13.4 mmHg in the monotherapy group), however the blood pressure reduction in patients treated with the association was slightly, but significantly, greater. Lipid profile, blood glucose, serum potassium and creatinine and uric acid were slightly worsened in the monotherapy group, while there were no changes or a mild improvement in patients treated with the combination of diuretic and the ACE-inhibitor. In conclusion the association lisinopril 20 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/die causes a blood pressure reduction slightly, but significantly, greater than with a higher dose of the diuretic monotherapy, without any negative interference on lipid profile, blood glucose and serum potassium.",

Blood pressure (BP) and peripheral renin were used as response variables. All patients had discontinued their anti-hypertensive medication and were not salt depleted. In all patients selective renal angiography was performed irrespective of the results of the captopril test. Twenty patients proved to have uni- or bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) giving a prevalence of 43%. After the placebo and after captopril there were no significant changes (absolute or proportional) in BP values between patients with essential hypertension or RAS, either for all measurements or if only the fall in BP was taken into account. The receiver operator characteristic curves of both baseline and post-captopril peripheral renin levels indicate that the captopril test does not discriminate appropriately between patients with essential hypertension and RAS. Therefore, we would not advise the use of the captopril test as a screening test for RAS in hypertensive patients in whom a high level of clinical suspicion for RAS is already present.",

    "307": "Over the past two decades there has been an increasing interest in hypertension as a risk factor for diabetic renal disease and in particular for the possibility of early antihypertensive intervention. Therefore, it would seem timely to review the history of hypertension in diabetes, with special reference to renal disease and the need for normotension, in a manner resembling glycaemic control. Elevated blood pressure (BP) associated with diabetes mellitus has been recognized since the beginning of the century and was initially particularly documented in association with the demonstration of the striking histological lesion in glomeruli, starting with the observation of Kimmelstiel and Wilson in 1936. These patients in many cases also showed hypertension, as confirmed in several subsequent reports, very similar to the studies of Kimmelstiel and Wilson. However, the development was hampered by the lack of effective antihypertensive agents and also by some who believed that elevated BP could be of importance to preserve renal function in these individuals. Indeed, it was suggested that reduction of BP could mean permanent deterioration in renal function. BP remained very high in the standard care of diabetic patients up to the middle 1970s. At this time it was documented that elevated BP was very closely related to development of diabetic renal disease in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic (IDDM) patients, and studies also showed a correlation between blood pressure and rate of progression. This correlation stimulated research in intervention, and indeed in the 1980s and 1990s several long-term studies reported that antihypertensive treatment can reduce the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from about 12 ml min-1 yr-1 down to about 2 ml min-1 yr-1 in the most optimistic reports; usually a mean level of 2-5 ml min-1 yr-1 is achievable by antihypertensive treatment, in clinical situations where glycaemic control often is far from perfect. Many studies have also documented that BP starts to rise in the early phase of incipient diabetic nephropathy characterized by microalbuminuria. This is a stage with well-preserved GFR and therefore probably an ideal stage for intervention in these at risk patients. Many studies, in particular those employing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors based on important pathophysiological concepts proposed by Brenner, have shown that microalbuminuria can be reduced or stabilized by early antihypertensive treatment, just as we see with optimized glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors have also been widely used in patients with overt nephropathy and the rate of decline in GFR has been reduced considerably.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ACE-I) on noradrenergic transmission in the rat central nervous system. 2. Slices of rat hypothalamus and medulla oblongata were prepared and prelabelled with [3H]-norepinephrine. Slices were continuously superfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and electrical stimulation (1 Hz) was performed. 3. Captopril significantly inhibited the stimulation-evoked [3H]-norepinephrine release from rat hypothalamic slices in a dose-dependent manner (S2/S1 ratio: control 0.904 +/- 0.025, n = 6, captopril 1 x 10(-5) mol/L 0.617 +/- 0.043, n = 6, P < 0.05, captopril 5 x 10(-5) mol/L 0.547 +/- 0.037, n = 6, P < 0.05). However, the basal release of [3H]-norepinephrine was not affected by captopril. 4. Captopril also reduced the stimulation-evoked [3H]-norepinephrine release in the medulla oblongata (S2/S1 ratio: control 0.878 +/- 0.018, n = 6, captopril 3.3 x 10(-5) mol/L 0.624 +/- 0.046, n = 6, P < 0.05). 5. These results show that captopril might inhibit the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release in rat hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the neurosuppressive effect of captopril are still uncertain, the finding suggests that the inhibition of noradrenergic transmission might be related to the central action of the ACE-I.", 
    "309": "This study was designed to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with cilazapril on vascular reactivity of aorta and mesenteric artery from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Cilazapril (5 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally twice a day for 4 weeks. Results demonstrated that acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation in aorta and mesenteric artery from SHR was significantly less than that from WKY, cilazapril-treated WKY, and SHR. The impairment of ACh-induced relaxation in SHR was significantly reversed after cilazapril treatment and there were no significant differences among WKY, cilazapril-treated WKY, and SHR. Meanwhile, both N omega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA; 10(-4) mol/L) and methylene blue (MB; 10(-5) mol/L) completely blocked the vasodilator response to ACh in aorta but only partly inhibited in mesenteric artery from WKY, cilazapril-treated WKY, and SHR. These LNNA- and MB-resistant vasodilator responses to ACh in mesenteric artery were only slightly inhibited by TEA (10(-3) mol/L) but not by indomethacin (5 x 10(-6) mol/L). These findings suggest that there may be an unidentified endothelium-dependent relaxing factor(s) (EDRF), which exists in the endothelium and may participate in the modulation of blood pressure in SHR. Results further demonstrate that the antihypertensive effect of cilazapril may be partly mediated by the reversing function of endothelium to release EDRF and LNNA-resistant, unidentified relaxing factor(s).",

Both inhibitors are reversibly inactivated on chelation with Cu2+ or Zn2+. Irreversible inactivation occurs on standing in aqueous and acidic solution or in ammonium hydroxide at room temperature and more rapidly on heating. In 4 M sodium hydroxide solutions BAY o 6997 is completely stable, and BAY q 1313 still remarkably stable even on longer heating to 80 degrees C.

Its two main aims are to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and the effects on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 19,193 patients have been recruited and randomized and one-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability and other available data after 12 months of follow-up of all patients. Special reference will be given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 6,113) as compared to younger patients (< 65 years, n = 13,080). On average, the target group < or = 90 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure has reached 86 mmHg, the target group < or = 85 mmHg has reached 83 mmHg and the target group < or = 80 mmHg has reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of patients that has obtained their target blood pressures is 84% in the target group < or = 90 mmHg, 72% in the target group < or = 85 mmHg and 57% in the target group < or = 80 mmHg at 12 months of follow-up. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age) the percentage of patients at target is higher for all target groups, being 86, 76 and 61%, respectively, at 12 months. Antihypertensive treatment is initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure is not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, is given. Further dose adjustments are made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth and final step a diuretic may be added. Side effects have been relatively few in this large multinational series of intensively treated hypertensive patients. Only ankle edema, 2.6% and 3.0%, and coughing, 1.3% and 0.8%, in young and elderly patients, respectively, exceed a frequency of 1%, and 88% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy felodipine after one year.

    "315": "Captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which has been used extensively in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In recent years, animal and human studies have demonstrated that captopril attenuates left ventricular remodelling (structural changes and enlargement) which occurs after myocardial infarction, and can lead to left ventricular dysfunction and increased risk of death. Subsequently, large clinical trials have shown reduced mortality and morbidity in patients receiving captopril or other ACE inhibitors (in addition to standard therapy) after acute myocardial infarction. Results of the 4th International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4), a factorial trial which randomised more than 58,000 patients, indicate that captopril, initiated within 24 hours of myocardial infarction and titrated to 50 mg twice daily for 1 month, significantly reduced overall mortality at 5 weeks after randomisation compared with placebo (7.19 vs 7.69%; p = 0.02). This corresponds to an absolute benefit of 5 lives saved per 1000 patients treated with captopril over this period. Furthermore, the survival advantage appeared to be maintained at 1 year post-infarction. Although both high- and low-risk patients were included in the ISIS-4 trial, the greatest survival benefit of captopril occurred in patients at greater risk of mortality, such as those with signs of heart failure or previous infarction. A significant relative reduction in overall mortality of 19% was seen in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (but not overt heart failure or ongoing ischaemia) after acute myocardial infarction treated with captopril in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study. Captopril was started within 3 to 16 days after myocardial infarction and titrated to 50 mg 3 times daily for a mean duration of 42 months. In this high-risk group of patients, approximately 40 to 50 lives were saved per 1000 patients treated with captopril over this period. This was similar to survival benefits demonstrated with other ACE inhibitors following acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients in other large randomised trials. Cost-effectiveness analyses using data from the SAVE trial indicate that captopril compares favourably with other interventions used for survivors of myocardial infarction. In general, captopril was well tolerated by patients in SAVE, ISIS-4 and other studies in this clinical setting. Thus, when added to standard therapy after acute myocardial infarction, early or late administration of captopril improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity, particularly in selected high-risk patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

All dogs were unmedicated and had no other diseases. The PRA was high in the dogs with mitral valvular insufficiency (median 3.44 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 2.59 to 8.66 ng/mL/h) compared with the controls (median 2.51 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 1.44 to 3.58 ng/mL/h).

Without proof of reintroduction, and on the basis of clinical observations, the attribution appears plausible. Similar observations have been made for other molecules in this class of medication, such as captopril (Lopril). A review of literature regroups recent data concerning psychotropic effects of ACEIs. Several reports claim that captopril clearly acts as an antidepressant. Studies on the mood or the quality of life of treated hypertensive patients show ACEIs to have an euphoric-type positive effect compared to other anti-hypertensive treatments. Captopril and perindopril also act like potential antidepressants in experimental models of antidepression. Furthermore, pharmacologic data confirm that the most lipophilic ACEIs penetrate the central nervous system and argue in favor of the role of these molecules in activating central opioides. As these data provide evidence of mood swing in some patients, but also of an overall benefit in hypertensive populations, the clinical importance of the antidepressant effect of ACEIs needs further investigations.",

The PAC was not significantly increased in the early stage of DCM (NYHA class I). It was concluded that in dogs with DCM, the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was increased in NYHA functional classes III and IV, and that the increase was correlated with the severity of the disease. The fact that the RAS tended to be activated in dogs with asymptomatic DCM supports the rationale of early therapeutic intervention with inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) as first line therapy in congestive heart failure.",

    "325": "Although lithium continues to be regarded as the treatment of choice for bipolar disorders, the clinical use of this mood stabiliser is associated with an extremely narrow therapeutic range. Relatively minor increases in serum concentrations may induce serious adverse sequelae, and concentrations within the therapeutic range may result in toxic reactions. The safety of combining lithium with other medications, therefore, is a major concern, and extensive clinical experience has served to identify several significant drug interactions. Lithium removal from the body is achieved almost exclusively via renal means. As a result, any medication that alters glomerular filtration rates or affects electrolyte exchange in the nephron may influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of lithium. Concomitant use of diuretics has long been associated with the development of lithium toxicity, but the risk of significant interactions varies with the site of pharmacological action of the diuretic in the renal tubule. Thiazide diuretics have demonstrated the greatest potential to increase lithium concentrations, with a 25 to 40% increase in concentrations often evident after initiation of therapy. Osmotic diuretics and methyl xanthines appear to have the opposite effect on lithium clearance and have been advocated historically as antidotes for lithium toxicity. Loop diuretics and potassium-sparing agents have minor variable effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have also been associated with lithium toxicity, although the relative interactive potential of specific NSAIDs is difficult to determine. Small prospective studies have demonstrated large interindividual differences in lithium clearance values associated with different NSAIDs. A growing body of evidence also suggests that ACE inhibitors may impair lithium elimination, but further investigations are needed to identify patients at risk. Anecdotal reports have linked numerous medications with the development of neurotoxicity without an apparent effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of lithium. Antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and calcium antagonists have all be implicated in a sufficient number of case reports to warrant concern. As these medications have all been commonly coadministered with lithium, the relative risk of serious interactions appears to be quite low, but caution is advised.",

In both countries, physicians adhered to the cut-off levels of their national guidelines in the case of the 48-year-old man. Minnesota physicians did not use age as a modifying factor for treatment cut-off levels, as did Swedish physicians.

Minnesota physicians reported cut-off levels close to national guidelines. For 65-year-old patients, Swedish physicians reported applying a higher cut-off level than indicated by guidelines.

As a consequence of the differing national guidelines and the identified physicians' practice habits in the two medical communities, it is likely that the segments of the populations treated and the drug costs differ substantially.", 
    "334": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the incidence of future coronary artery thromboses in postmyocardial infarction patients. A possible prothrombotic role for the angiotensin system has been postulated, and support for this has been provided by a recent study that demonstrated that an infusion of angiotensin increases levels of the prothrombotic plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). In the current study the authors have investigated the effect of two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI in 33 congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. Blood samples were obtained pretreatment and then at weeks 1, 12, and 24 after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy for measurement of tPA antigen and PAI activity levels. The results of the study indicated that the initiation of ACE inhibitors had no significant effects on tPA antigen or PAI activity levels at the time points studied, and no significant differences were demonstrated between captopril and enalapril. The results suggest, therefore, that ACE inhibitors do not affect tPA antigen or PAI activity in CHF patients, and thus another mechanism is probably responsible for the observed decrease in coronary artery thromboses in post-MI patients treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "335": "Endothelin is the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor yet discovered. Its three isoforms play leading roles in regulating vascular tone and causing mitogenesis. The isoforms bind to two major receptor subtypes (ETA and ETB), which mediate a wide variety of physiologic actions in several organ systems. Endothelin may also be a disease marker or an etiologic factor in ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, renal failure, myocardial and vascular wall hypertrophy, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Specific and nonspecific receptor antagonists and ECE inhibitors that have been developed interfere with endothelin's function. Many available cardiovascular therapeutic agents, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium-entry blocking drugs, and nitroglycerin, also may interfere with endothelin release or may modify its activity. The endothelin antagonists have great potential as agents for use in the treatment of a wide spectrum of disease entities and as biologic probes for understanding the actions of endothelin in human beings.", 
    "336": "It has been proposed that the contribution of myocardial tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II (Ang II) formation in the human heart is low compared with non-ACE pathways. However, little is known about the actual in vivo contribution of these pathways to Ang II formation in the human heart. To examine angiotensin II formation in the intact human heart, we administered intracoronary 123I-labeled angiotensin I (Ang I) with and without intracoronary enalaprilat to orthotopic heart transplant recipients. The fractional conversion of Ang I to Ang II, calculated after separation of angiotensin peptides by HPLC, was 0.415 +/- 0.104 (n = 5, mean +/- SD). Enalaprilat reduced fractional conversion by 89%, to a value of 0.044 +/- 0.053 (n = 4, P = 0.002). In a separate study of explanted hearts, a newly developed in vitro Ang II-forming assay was used to examine cardiac tissue ACE activity independent of circulating components. ACE activity in solubilized left ventricular membrane preparations from failing hearts was 49.6 +/- 5.3 fmol 125I-Ang II formed per minute per milligram of protein (n = 8, +/- SE), and 35.9 +/- 4.8 fmol/min/mg from nonfailing human hearts (n = 7, P = 0.08). In the presence of 1 microM enalaprilat, ACE activity was reduced by 85%, to 7.3 +/- 1.4 fmol/min/mg in the failing group and to 4.6 +/- 1.3 fmol/min/mg in the nonfailing group (P < 0.001). We conclude that the predominant pathway for angiotensin II formation in the human heart is through ACE.", 
    "337": "To address the question as to how zona glomerulosa (ZG) cell angiotensin II (Ang II) secretion is regulated, we developed an immuno-cell blot assay to measure its secretion from single cells. We compared these results with those obtained from population studies using a superfusion system. Modulation of Ang II secretion was investigated acutely (by administrating potassium [K+] or captopril) and chronically (by feeding the animals low or high sodium diets). The area of secretory cells, halo areas, and halo intensities varied widely but were highly significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with each other. A disproportionate amount of Ang II was secreted by a small number of large cells. When K+ concentration was increased from 3.6 to 0 mM, superfused ZG cells increased their Ang II secretion 2.32 +/- 0.59-fold. Administration of captopril reduced the K(+)-stimulated Ang II secretion 1.24 +/- 0.07 fold. These findings were reflected in the cell blot assay as a change in the frequency distribution of halo area by K+ and captopril in the same direction as in the population study. In both conditions, the percentage of secretory cells did not change significantly from control. Superfused ZG cells from rats on a low sodium diet secreted 1.85 +/- 0.58-fold more Ang II than cells from sodium-loaded rats (p < 0.05, n = 6). The cell blot assay confirmed these findings with sodium restriction significantly increasing (P < 0.001) both the halo area and its frequency distribution to a larger portion of high secreting cells. However, in contrast to acute treatment with K+ or captopril, the number of secretory cells also doubled. Thus, the individual ZG cell uses two mechanisms to modify Ang II production. In response to acute stimulation and suppression, the amount of Ang II secreted per cell is modified without changing the number of secretary cells. With chronic stimulation, both the amount of Ang II secreted per cell and the number of secretary cells increase.", 
    "338": "The CHO cell mutant FD 1.3.25 exhibits both increased accumulation and altered distribution of endocytosed fluid phase tracers. Neither the rate of tracer internalization nor the kinetics of recycling from early endosomes was affected, but exocytosis from late endocytic compartments appeared to be decreased in the mutant. Endocytosed tracer moved more rapidly to the cell poles in FD1.3.25 than in wild type cells. An abundant 36-kD polypeptide was found associated with taxol-polymerized microtubules in preparations from wild type and mutant; in the former but not the latter this polypeptide could be dissociated by incubation of the microtubules in ATP or high salt. The 36-kD polypeptide co-electrophoresed in two dimensions with the monomer of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Analysis of cDNA clones showed that the mutant is heterozygous for this enzyme, with approximately 25% of the GAPDH RNA containing a single nucleotide change resulting in substitution of Ser for Pro234, a residue that is conserved throughout evolution. Stable transfectants of wild type cells expressing the mutant monomer at approximately 15% of the total enzyme exhibited the various changes in endocytosis observed in FD1.3.25.",

    "340": "This review describes vascular changes in atherosclerotic and hypertensive vessels as well as effects of treatment. Changes in vascular structure in both atherosclerosis and hypertension are characterized by thickening of the vessel wall and vascular \"remodeling.\" Remodeling tends to preserve the size of the lumen in atherosclerotic vessels and results in a smaller lumen in hypertensive vessels. Changes in vascular function are characterized by preservation of smooth muscle relaxation, with the exception of activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, and dysfunction of endothelium. Regression of atherosclerosis, by treatment of hyperlipidemia, results in quite rapid removal of lipid from the vessel wall but with inconsistent improvement in maximal vasodilator capacity. In contrast, endothelial function improves during regression of atherosclerosis, and hyperresponsiveness to serotonin subsides rapidly. Effective treatment of hypertension produces regression of vascular hypertrophy, and some approaches (especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) are effective in correcting vascular remodeling. Endothelium-dependent relaxation generally improves during antihypertensive treatment. Reduction in pulse pressure may be more important than reduction in mean arterial pressure in reversing the structural and functional abnormalities of hypertensive vessels.",

Beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure was concomitantly measured by a Finapres device that allowed diameter-pressure curves and compliance-pressure curves (Langewouters' formula) to be calculated for the entire systolic-diastolic blood pressure range. Arterial compliance was expressed as the area under the compliance-pressure curve normalized for pulse pressure (compliance index).

To clarify this issue we infused the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or the angiotensin II receptor blocker CV 11974 into transgenic and normotensive Sprague-Dawley Hannover control rats. We eliminated any other neural or endocrine regulatory differences between transgenic and control rats by renal denervation and infusion of vasopressin, aldosterone, corticosterone, and norepinephrine in sufficient quantities to occupy all receptors. Sodium excretion increased from 3.4 +/- 1.2 to 10.1 +/- 0.5 mumol/min per gram kidney weight in transgenic rats when renal perfusion pressure was increased from 158 to 201 mm Hg. Captopril (4 mg/kg) and CV 11974 (0.1 mg/kg) shifted the pressure-natriuresis curve of transgenic rats leftward, so that sodium excretion was threefold higher at similar renal perfusion pressures (150 to 160 mm Hg). Similarly, fractional sodium and water excretion curves were shifted leftward, so that values for transgenic and control rats were no longer different.

    "363": "Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated mainly with an ACE inhibitor (delapril, n = 980) or a Ca antagonist (n = 956) for 12 months, and the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events as well as drug-related side effects were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the clinical backgrounds of the two groups. In both groups, the blood pressure was decreased significantly from 1 month of treatment onwards, with the degree of reduction being greater in the Ca antagonist group throughout the study period (p < 0.001). Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events occurred in 11 out of 980 patients in the delapril group and 18 out of 956 patients in the Ca antagonist group (p = NS). Cerebrovascular disease developed in 5 delapril-treated patients and 11 Ca antagonist-treated patients, and heart disease developed in 5 and 7 patients, respectively (both p = NS). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was significantly more common in the delapril group than in the Ca antagonist group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events between the two groups, and the results suggested that blood pressure reduction per se did not necessarily lead to a parallel decrease in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications.", 
    "364": "Over 50 million people in the United States are hypertensive. Renovascular disease accounts for 3-5% of these hypertensive patients. Because renovascular hypertension is potentially curable, much effort has been devoted to detecting and treating renal artery stenosis. Conventional angiography has been traditionally used to diagnose renal artery stenosis. However, because of its invasiveness and cost, conventional angiography cannot be utilized as a screening test in all patients who may have renal artery stenosis. Several noninvasive studies have been advocated for screening in hypertensive patients who may have renovascular disease. However, the accuracy of these noninvasive studies is widely variable, and appropriate use of these noninvasive studies needs to be better defined. Appropriate use of diagnostic imaging examinations for hypertensive patients depends on the index of suspicion for renovascular disease and on the patient's renal function. If certain clinical findings suggest the possibility of renovascular disease, then conventional angiography/intraarterial digital subtraction angiography should be performed. Captopril renography or duplex Doppler sonography could also be utilized if angiography is not desired or is contraindicated because of impaired renal function or a contrast allergy. Magnetic resonance angiography appears to be most helpful in a small, select group of patients who are likely to have proximal renal artery stenosis.", 
    "365": "We investigated the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of nitroglycerin tolerance in rings of rabbit thoracic aorta mounted in tissue baths and precontracted with 10(-6) M norepinephrine. The vasorelaxant effects of acetylcholine were measured before and after 1 h treatment with 5 x 10(-4) M nitroglycerin. The acetylcholine dose-response curve shifted to the right after the induction of nitroglycerin tolerance. Pretreatment with captopril (a sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), but not with M-1 (a metabolite of delapril and a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) restored acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine also restored reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation. These results suggest that the sulfhydryl group plays a major role in restoration of reduced acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in the presence of nitroglycerin tolerance.", 
    "366": "The physiatrist can now be instrumental in prolonging the survival of individuals with neuromuscular disease by using respiratory muscle aids. As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "367": "This study examined, in anesthetized dogs, the possible interactions between nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin II (ANG II) in mediating the renal response to an extracellular volume expansion (ECVE). It was found that the intrarenal maintenance of ANG II levels (group 1) or the intrarenal NO synthesis inhibition (group 2) did not induce changes in renal hemodynamics but reduced (P < 0.05) the ECVE-induced increments in sodium excretion and fractional lithium excretion (FeLi). In the third group, ANG II synthesis was inhibited during NO synthesis blockade. It was found in this group that the NO synthesis inhibition reduced the ECVE-induced increment in sodium excretion (P < 0.05) but did not modify the ECVE-induced increment in FeLi. These results suggest that the increase of proximal sodium reabsorption induced by the No synthesis inhibition is mediated by endogenous ANG II levels. In the fourth group, it was observed that NO synthesis inhibition, during the intrarenal maintenance of ANG II levels, induced a decrease of renal blood flow (P < 0.05) and reduced the natriuretic response to ECVE to a lower level (P < 0.05) than that observed in groups 1 and 2. The results of this group suggest that endogenous NO modulates the vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic effects of ANG II during an ECVE. In summary, the results of this study suggest that there is an important interaction between NO and ANG II in mediating the renal response to an ECVE.", 
    "368": "Two groups of six dogs were studied during 4 control days and 4 days of reduced renal perfusion pressure (rRPP) servo controlled at 20% below the individual dog's 24-h mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) during control days, i.e., below the threshold for renin release. On rRPP days, endogenous activation of plasma aldosterone and angiotensin II was inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The dogs were kept on a high-Na and high-water intake. Unlike studies during rRPP alone, there was no Na and water retention during rRPP+captopril. Glomerular filtration rate dropped by approximately 9%, and MABP remained in the range of control days. Plasma renin activity rose to values 14 times greater than control, whereas plasma aldosterone decreased by approximately 60%. Atrial natriuretic peptide remained in the range of controls. In conclusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition can prevent the otherwise obligatory Na and water retention and systemic MABP increase during a 20% reduction in renal perfusion pressure. This is achieved most likely via the captopril-induced fall in angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone levels.", 
    "369": "To assess the role of angiotensin (ANG) II in both the increased heart rate (HR) and the impaired baroreceptor reflex control of HR that characterize the chronic phase of coarctation hypertension (CH), we compared basal HR, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and baroreflex sensitivity of coarcted hypertensive rats treated chronically with losartan, captopril, or vehicle. Baseline HR was recorded daily, and MAP and reflex HR changes and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured in coarcted and sham-coarcted rats on the 5th day after coarctation. Both captopril (10 mg.kg-1.day-1 po) and losartan (10 mg.kg-1.day-1 po) caused a small nonsignificant reduction of hypertension (132 +/- 5 and 133 +/- 5, respectively, vs. 147 +/- 9 mmHg in vehicle-treated rats), but equally inhibited the late tachycardic phase (-37 +/- 13 and -29 +/- 12 beats/min in captopril- and losartan-treated groups, respectively, vs. +79 +/- 19 beats/min in vehicle treated rats). Similar results were obtained for other groups of coarcted hypertensive rats after suppression of PRA by bilateral nephrectomy. Although hypertensive levels were the same during both treatments, only losartan given orally or intracerebroventricularlly (1.25 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) was effective in improving the reflex bradycardia. The depressed reflex tachycardia was corrected by chronic oral treatment with losartan. The data suggest that the tachycardia occurring in the chronic phase of CH is mediated by blood-borne ANG II and that the normalization of the reflex control of HR by losartan is achieved by blockade of type I receptors of ANG II in central areas accessible to oral or centrally administered losartan but not to oral captopril.", 
    "370": "To determine whether neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE) influence coronary hemodynamics, we compared the effects of inhibiting NEP, ACE, or both before and after isoproterenol (50 mg/kg ip). We measured flow and resistance using radioactive microspheres in 90 anesthetized rats which received the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (2.5 mg/kg), the ACE inhibitor captopril (2.5 mg/kg), both combined, or vehicle alone. Before isoproterenol, inhibiting NEP, ACE, or both increased left ventricular blood flow by 48 +/- 10 (SE), 33 +/- 9, and 10 +/- 6%, respectively, and decreased left ventricular vascular resistance by 26 +/- 6, 31 +/- 10, and 10 +/- 6%, respectively. After isoproterenol, NEP inhibition augmented the decrease in left ventricular vascular resistance (25 +/- 6% decrease within 90 s of isoproterenol vs. 8 +/- 5% in controls). ACE inhibition did not augment the decrease in resistance but inhibiting both enzymes did so to a lesser extent than inhibiting NEP. These effects cannot be explained by vascular responses secondary to changes of myocardial oxygen consumption. We conclude that NEP and ACE are regulators of myocardial blood flow.", 
    "371": "The incidence of in-hospital acute renal failure (ARF) due to drugs is estimated at 20% of all patients hospitalized for ARF. According to recent surveys, analgesic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now more frequently involved than antibiotics. The incidence of ARF in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is increasing. More than half of the patients have a non-oliguric course. Acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis are found in most biopsied cases. The mortality rate ranges between 6% and 12%. Most patients recover but 15% to 20% have some degree of residual renal impairment, particularly older and oliguric patients, those with previous chronic renal insufficiency and whose ARF period is prolonged. The long-term renal effects of NSAIDs is a concern. ARF due to drugs is a preventable disease since two-thirds of patients received inappropriately high or prolonged doses of the offending drug and or were patients at risk to develop ARF.", 
    "372": "Prerenal acute renal failure is defined as a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate due to a primary disturbance in renal hemodynamics in the absence of any structural kidney damage. In case of moderate hypotension or hypovolemia, a number of adaptative systemic and intrarenal responses preserve renal perfusion and filtration rates, particularly by inducing a marked reduction in preglomerular arteriolar resistance and an increase in postglomerular resistance. However, these mechanisms are inherently limited. In the presence of advanced circulatory failure or iatrogenic pharmacologic interventions compromising these renal defense mechanisms, prerenal failure becomes evident. Therefore, prerenal failure may occur during acute hemodynamic disturbances due to hypovolemia or systemic vasodilatation, in severe cardiac failure, in cirrhosis with ascites, and in certain clinical situations following administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The treatment depends on the underlying cause.", 
    "373": "Secondary prevention is critical following myocardial infarction. Infarct expansion leads to cardiomegaly, which may adversely affect prognosis. Infarct expansion seems to be associated with hypertension, anterior location, persistent (probably sudden) occlusion of the infarct artery, and poor collateralization. Prevention of cardiomegaly by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and possibly nitrates, seems to improve survival. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors seem to delay the onset and the frequency of congestive failure and recurrent myocardial infarction.",

In the present study, we compared the cardiovascular and renal effects of SB 203220 and captopril in rats with chronic renal failure induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. Preliminary studies indicated that SB 203220 (600 ppm in the diet) and captopril (250 mg/l in drinking water) significantly attenuated the pressor activity of exogenous angiotensin II and angiotensin I, respectively. After 5/6 nephrectomy, significant hypertension was observed such that at 6 weeks, systolic blood pressure had reached 176 +/- 9 mm Hg. Both SB 203220 (128 +/- 18 mm Hg) and captopril (131 +/- 7 mm Hg) significantly attenuated the hypertension. Urinary protein excretion increased progressively after renal ablation (from 7 to 124 mg/day), and this was attenuated by both SB 203220 (32 +/- 7 mg/day) and captopril (42 +/- 6 mg/day). Assessment of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen indicated that SB 203220 but not captopril resulted in maintenance of renal function, close to that observed in control rats. Both SB 203220 and captopril attenuated the renal and left ventricular hypertrophy associated with 5/6 nephrectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The objective of these investigations was to examine the roles of bradykinin, angiotensin II, and nitric oxide in the cardioprotective effects of ramiprilat.",

Animals were treated intravenously with either saline solution, ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg), the bradykinin2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (1 microgram/kg), ramiprilat + HOE 140, angiotensin II (2.5 ng.kg-1.min-1), the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (20 mg/kg), ramiprilat + angiotensin II, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), or ramiprilat + NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.",

Pretreatment with HOE 140 or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abolished the cardioprotective effect of ramiprilat. Neither stimulation nor antagonism of angiotensin II receptors altered infarct size from the saline control level. Also, when isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation, ramiprilat (100 mumol/L) and bradykinin (10 nmol/L) improved cell viability (approximately 60%), and the protective effect of both agents was reversed by administration of HOE 140 (10 mumol/L).", 
    "382": "These results indicate that the in vivo cardioprotective effect of ramiprilat can be abolished by antagonizing bradykinin receptors or inhibiting nitric oxide synthase, and that the effect is not related to angiotensin II receptor activity. The potential bradykinin-sparing property of ramiprilat may promote increased bradykinin-stimulated nitric oxide production leading to cardioprotection. Part of the cardioprotective effects of ramiprilat/bradykinin/nitric oxide may occur locally as demonstrated by the in vitro results using isolated cardiomyocytes.", 
    "383": "The follow-up of living kidney donors demands medical as well as psychological competence. In the postoperative period, attention focuses on pain management, early detection of wound complications and the prophylaxis of thromboembolism. Regular visits of the donor who may easily feel neglected should be as much part of the transplant team's post-operative routine as visits of the recipient. The later phase of recovery emphasizes strengthening abdominal wall and lumbar muscles as well as the gradual increase of physical activity. Long-term follow-up focuses on the early detection of arterial hypertension and proteinuria. Antihypertensive therapy in nephrectomized donors should include an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II antagonist. In Switzerland, the long-term course after living donation is prospectively monitored by the Swiss Registry for Living Donors founded in 1993. The registry is responsible for the regular timing of follow-up examinations and assures transparency of the origin of the kidneys used for living donation in Switzerland. The registry heavily relies on the collaboration of the donor's family physicians.", 
    "384": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may regress left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without decreasing blood pressure (BP). The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of low and high doses of lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist TCV116 (TCV) on LVH and hemodynamics in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Lisinopril (0.5 and 3 mg/kg per day) and TCV (0.3 mg/kg per day) were given to 8-week-old male SHR daily for 2 weeks. Untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) served as controls. Untreated SHR had a greater left ventricular (LV) weight than WKY (p < 0.01). Lisinopril (3 mg/kg per day) decreased both LV weight and BP. Lisinopril (0.5 mg/kg per day) significantly decreased LV weight, but not BP. In contrast, although TCV significantly decreased BP, LVH was not suppressed. Renal blood flow (RBF) in untreated SHR was less than that in WKY (p < 0.05), but was increased with either lisinopril (3 mg/kg per day)-treated rats (p< 0.05). These findings suggest that factors other than afterload reduction play a role in the regression of LVH with lisinopril, whereas a longer duration of treatment and/or a higher dose may be necessary with TCV. Despite the decrease in BP, TCV normalized RBF in SHR, perhaps due to the blockade of renal angiotensin II.", 
    "385": "In the past two to three decades, the practice among hypertension specialists has been to lower blood pressure with the strong assumption that morbidity and mortality would be reduced. This was largely based on large clinical trials done in the 1960s and 1970s that did not include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers. Performing large clinical trials is expensive and the results often do not apply to individual patients. Until recently, noninvasive methods to monitor end-organ effects of elevated blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors were limited. The development of high-resolution ultrasound and evolving magnetic resonance technology will allow early detection of heart and blood vessel changes and will make monitoring of the progression and regression of disease possible. This will allow better selection of treatment programs for each patient.", 
    "386": "Recent clinical investigations have provided new insights into physiologic alterations taking place as heart failure progresses. As a result, new end points may be more relevant to monitor in patients, rather than the classical assessment of severity based on subjective evaluation of functional capacity. Structural changes of the myocardium, referred to as remodeling, have profound effects on the performance of the left ventricle and on long-term prognosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction may serve as a clinical marker for remodeling changes. Remodeling changes involve hypertrophy of the muscle mass, dilation of the left ventricle, and a change in the shape of the ventricle. Histologically, these changes are produced by myocyte lengthening, interstitial growth, and myocyte slippage. The consequences of remodeling include an abnormal bio-energetic state because of the augmented wall stress and accentuated myocardial oxygen consumption. The elevated wall stress promotes further hypertrophy. Superimposed on the remodeling changes is neurohormonal activation. Both remodeling and neurohormonal activation are directly related to mortality. An experimental canine model has been used successfully to investigate the potential impact of pharmacologic intervention on remodeling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate have been shown in clinical trials to reduce long-term mortality and increase ejection fraction. The effects of these drugs appear to be mediated in part by alterations in remodeling and neurohormonal activation. Thus, left ventricular ejection fraction can be used as a clinical marker for remodeling processes, and plasma norepinephrine levels can be used as a marker for neurohormonal activation.", 
    "387": "Hypertrophy of the overloaded heart, characterized by an increased number of sarcomeres, provides an adaptive, short-term response. However, when cardiac overload is long-standing, the hypertrophic response appears to cause shortened myocyte survival. The mechanisms responsible for the deleterious effects of chronic myocardial hypertrophy may include a maladaptive growth response of the mature heart. Because terminally differentiated adult cardiac myocytes have little or no capacity to divide, stimuli that promote growth in the overloaded adult heart cannot lead to normal cell division. Instead, overload initiates an unnatural growth response that appears to shorten cardiac myocyte survival, possibly because the same growth factors that mediate the hypertrophic response of the adult heart can also induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). The converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates, which have growth-inhibitory as well as vasodilator effects, may improve prognosis in heart failure by inhibiting the production of transcription factors. These transcription factors stimulate both the unnatural growth response to overload and stimuli that lead to apoptosis. Since both beta-adrenergic agonists and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, can stimulate production of similar transcription factors, evidence suggests that beta blockers and vesnarinone improve the prognosis in patients with heart failure possibly because of their ability to inhibit maladaptive growth.", 
    "388": "The end-stage heart failure phenotype is characterized by marked dyspnea on exertion, edema, and overwhelming fatigue, and by a high incidence of sudden death. Patients who display the end-stage phenotype have transitioned from a normal phenotype with myocardial damage at a cellular level. This transition appears to be mediated by events at both the cellular and molecular levels. Until recently, it was generally believed that this transition was irreversible. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the phenotype can be changed with pharmacologic agents. These agents have been demonstrated to improve exercise capability, increase ventricular function, and improve symptoms. Important recent studies have shown that pharmacologic agents can substantially alter the high mortality rates associated with the end-stage heart failure phenotype. As we learn more about the molecular and cellular events that initiate and support the transition from cardiac compensation to decompensation, we will be able to improve our pharmacologic targeting and, we hope, be able to delay the development of the end-stage heart failure phenotype to an even greater degree.", 
    "389": "Ventricular aneurysms are circumscribed, thin-walled fibrous, noncontractile outpouchings of the ventricle. The majority are apically located, true aneurysms of the left ventricle (LV) that occur as a consequence of transmural myocardial infarction (MI). The precursor of aneurysm formation appears to be infarct expansion early after acute MI and occurrence generally relates to infarct size. The presence of underlying hypertension and the use of steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may promote aneurysm formation. The clinical sequelae include congestive heart failure (CHF), thromboembolism, angina pectoris, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Late rupture is a particular complication of false aneurysms in which the pericardium is the aneurysm wall. The diagnosis may be suspected by the clinical finding of a diffuse, pansystolic apical thrust, persistent ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, and distortion of the cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. This can be confirmed using echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, and cardiac catheterization. The latter has the additional advantage of being able to delineate the coronary anatomy. Management involves prevention, specific therapy for the various clinical manifestations, and surgery. Therapeutic interventions with thrombolytic agents, aspirin, heparin, and beta blockers that are applied early in the evolution of an MI may limit infarction size, thereby reducing the tendency toward infarct expansion and aneurysm formation. Patients with mild CHF can usually be controlled with the standard combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin. Thromboembolism is best prevented by anticoagulation with warfarin for at least 3 months after the acute MI. The choice of pharmacotherapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be guided by electrophysiologic studies. The treatment of patients with angina pectoris utilizes conventional therapeutic modalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Similarly, the proportion of patients undergoing various cardiac procedures differed among regions (range for angiography, 52 to 81 percent of patients; angioplasty, 22 to 35 percent; and coronary-artery bypass surgery, 9 to 17 percent) and was lowest in New England. The regional use of cardiac procedures was closely related to their availability, except in New England. After the analysis was adjusted for clinical and hospital variables, patients in New England were found to be less likely to undergo angiography than patients in the other regions (odds ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.42). There was no apparent relation between the use of cardiac procedures and rates of recurrent infarction or death at 30 days or 1 year.",

Intraperitoneal infusion of benazepril or valsartan at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day produced dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure after 12 weeks which were not significantly different from each other. During the infusion, valsartan-treated animals gained weight at the same rate as controls, but all infusion rates of benazepril significantly suppressed normal weight gain, despite both compounds having similar antihypertensive effects. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, benazepril (3 and 10 mg/kg/day) significantly increased glucose disposal but did not significantly affect insulin disposal in insulin/glucose tolerance tests. In contrast, none of the infusion rates of valsartan significantly affected glucose or insulin disposal. Finally, compared to controls benazepril and valsartan were without effect on the fasting basal plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and K+. The results demonstrate that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonism have similar antihypertensive effects, but express differences on body weight gain and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in the conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat.",

Of these deaths, 20 were classified as probably (nine) or possibility (11) drug-related. Only two of the deaths were recognized as such by the clinicians in the ward.

    "397": "The pathophysiology and natural history of diabetic nephropathy are described, and recent developments in its prevention and treatment are discussed. Diabetic nephropathy can occur in both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetics. It is characterized by arterial hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive loss of renal function. Although the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated, hyperglycemia with altered intraglomerular hemodynamics is an important contributor to the initiation and progression of the disease. Concurrent hypertension aggravates progression of the disease. Currently accepted strategies to slow the progression of diabetic renal disease have focused on antihypertensive therapy, strict glucose control, and restriction of dietary proteins. Recent publications support the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have a unique ability, independent of their antihypertensive effect, to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Investigational agents (e.g., aminoguanidine) may prove helpful in the management of the condition. Information about the prevention of diabetic nephropathy has grown significantly in the past few years.",

Ramipril and losartan increased PRA values from 7.5 +/- 1.6 to 86 +/- 6 and 78 +/- 22 ng of AngI per h per ml and renin mRNA levels from 112 +/- 9% to 391 +/- 20% and 317 +/- 10%, respectively. Inhibition of prostaglandin formation with indomethacin did not influence basal or ramipril-affected PRA. Basal renin mRNA levels also were unchanged by indomethacin, while increases in renin mRNA levels after ramipril treatment were slightly reduced by indomethacin. Inhibition of NO synthase by nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) reduced PRA values to 3.2 +/- 0.9, 34 +/- 13, and 12.1 +/- 2.7 ng of AngI per h per ml in control, ramipril-treated, and losartan-treated animals, respectively. Renin mRNA levels were reduced to 77 +/- 14% under basal conditions and ramipril- and losartan-induced increases in renin mRNA levels were completely blunted after addition of L-NAME. The AngII antagonists, furthermore, induced an upstream recruitment of renin-expressing cells in the renal afferent arterioles, which was also blunted by L-NAME. These findings suggest that renin mRNA levels are tonically increased by NO and that the action of NO is counteracted by AngII.",

When cilazaprilat (3 micrograms/kg per minute) was infused into the bypass tube for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow due to partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow increased from 30 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 2 mL/100 g per minute despite there being no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (43 +/- 1 mm Hg). The ratio of myocardial endocardial flow to epicardial flow increased during an infusion of cilazaprilat. Both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were increased (fractional shortening: 4.1 +/- 0.6% to 8.9 +/- 0.6%, P < .001; lactate extraction ratio: -55.7 +/- 3.3% to -36.7 +/- 3.9%, P < .001). During an infusion of cilazaprilat, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood was markedly increased. The increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was attenuated by HOE-140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors; coronary blood flow: 35 +/- 2 mL/100 g per minute), and by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; coronary blood flow: 34 +/- 2 mL/100 g per minute). Intracoronary administration of bradykinin mimicked the beneficial effects of cilazaprilat. Cyclic GMP content of the coronary artery was increased by cilazaprilat compared with the untreated condition in the ischemic myocardium. In the denervated hearts, the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was not attenuated. On the other hand, CV11974, an inhibitor of angiotensin II receptors, slightly increased coronary blood flow to 34 +/- 2 from 30 +/- 1 mL/100 g per minute.",

When captopril 50 mg and losartan 50 mg were given alone, the magnitude of their effects on blood pressure, plasma active renin, Ang I, and aldosterone was similar, whereas the kinetics of their effects were different, reflecting differences in drug pharmacokinetics. The losartan-captopril combination completely suppressed the rise in plasma Ang II induced by losartan 2 hours after drug intake (3.3 +/- 3.6 pg/mL versus 20.3 +/- 19.1 pg/mL, respectively, P < .05). Six hours after drug intake, the losartan-captopril combination induced a significantly greater decrease in mean blood pressure than that produced by either losartan or captopril alone (73 +/- 7 mm Hg versus 79 +/- 8 mm Hg versus 81 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively, P < .05).

By either method, the analytes are quantified over the range of 25-1000 ng/ml with good accuracy and precision.

    "408": "Calcium antagonists are well accepted in the prevention of ischaemia in patients with chronic stable angina, unstable angina, variant angina, and silent ischaemia, and in the treatment of hypertension. Although all of these compounds increase myocardial oxygen supply by reducing coronary tone and decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing systolic pressure and myocardial contractility, the magnitude of these effects may differ from one agent to another. Some calcium antagonists, such as verapamil and diltiazem, reduce heart rate and attenuate heart rate increases in response to stress, while in contrast, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine may cause reflex increases in heart rate. These differences may be of importance in light of epidemiologic evidence that lower heart rates are associated with a reduced long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality, and experimental data showing that a lower heart rate may protect against the development of atherosclerosis. Calcium antagonists also inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation which may contribute to their anti-ischaemic effects. Clinical trial data suggest that calcium antagonists may stay the progression of atherosclerosis. Mechanisms underlying an anti-atherosclerotic effect may include attenuation of endothelial dysfunction, prevention of LDL, peroxidation, stimulation of LDL receptor activity, inhibition of superoxide radical generation, and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell growth. Heart-rate-controlling calcium antagonists, such as verapamil and diltiazem, may reduce reinfarction rates following acute myocardial infarction and thus may have a role in post-infarction patients who do not show evidence of heart failure. Their use in heart failure patients receiving an angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) is under investigation in several large trials. Because calcium antagonists have a mechanism of action different from ACE-I, the pairing of a heart-rate-controlling calcium antagonist with an ACE-I might be expected to offer additive cardioprotective and vascular protective effects.", 
    "409": "To examine whether changes in renomedullary osmolality and the activity of the renin-angiotensin system may influence the ability of the renal medulla to exert an antihypertensive function, rats were exposed to several manoeuvers. These affected either the medullary osmolality or the renin-angiotensin system (salt or saccharose load, salt depletion, treatment with captopril alone or in combination with salt depletion). A comparison of the antihypertensive capacity of the renal medulla was studied by transplanting renal medullae from the various groups into one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rats. A significant and quantitatively similar reduction in blood pressure was observed in hypertensive rats that received transplants of the medullae from control, salt or saccharose loaded rats and captopril treated rats. In contrast, medullae from salt depleted rats did not affect blood pressure when transplanted into hypertensive animals. The addition of captopril restored the antihypertensive function of renal medulla in salt depleted rats. The results do not support the view that osmolality of the renal medulla regulates its antihypertensive capacity, and suggest that angiotensin II may restrain renomedullary antihypertensive function.", 
    "410": "ACE inhibitors have the potential to affect myocardial ischaemia in patients with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction and ischaemic cardiomyopathy after long-term treatment. However, anti-ischaemic effects are virtually absent in stable effort angina during short-term therapy, which suggests different mechanisms of action in different patient subtypes. Long-term treatment in left ventricular dysfunction may lead to a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and ischaemia as a result of ventricular remodelling, possibly supported by structural coronary vascular effects, i.e., an improved endothelial function and vasodilator capacity. An alternative mechanism by which ACE inhibitors may affect ischaemia, is through modulation of ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and subsequent systemic vasoconstriction. Depending on the severity of ischaemia, pronounced catecholamine activation and stimulation of the circulating renin-angiotensin system occur, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction and an increase in afterload. These changes are marked in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Moreover, a change from net catecholamine release to uptake in the ischaemic area is observed. Although the clinical significance of the latter observation is still unclear, sympathetic activation may lead to coronary vasoconstriction in stenotic areas where normal endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilatation has become impaired. In the resting patient, enalaprilat and perindoprilat significantly reduce myocardial ischaemia, not by a direct effect on the oxygen supply-demand ratio, but through modulation of neurohormonal activation, in particular of sympathetic activation during ischaemia, and, subsequently, by preventing systemic vasoconstriction. These effects are pronounced in left ventricular dysfunction, at least where perindoprilat is concerned. The possibility that ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function in concert with their modulating effects on ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and hence influence the occurrence of myocardial ischemia during long-term treatment needs further evaluation.", 
    "411": "Left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction, through long-term left ventricular chamber dilatation and increased wall stress can result in alteration of the contractile properties of the non-infarct zone, impairment of the systolic and diastolic performances of the left ventricle, and eventually congestive heart failure. Left ventricular remodelling is influenced by several factors, among which the role of systemic and tissue renin angiotensin systems is determinant. Pharmacological interventions on the renin angiotensin systems were shown to limit left ventricular remodelling and reduce mortality from acute myocardial infarction in rats and humans, although the results of some trials remain controversial. To date, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors have only been demonstrated in patients with a low residual ejection fraction. Recent observations of changes in left ventricular chamber dilatation and left ventricular wall hypertrophy occurring over the course of time after acute myocardial infarction allow better definition of the subset of patients who are at risk of progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. An akinetic surface >20%, a left ventricular ejection fraction <0 x 40, an anterior location of the infarction, a stroke volume <31 ml.m(-2) during the acute phase, and persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery are the most powerful predictors of late left ventricular function impairment. Some issues remain controversial, such as the optimal time for introducing ACE inhibitors after the onset of symptoms, the potential additive effects of ACE inhibitors given in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy, and the role of systemic angioplasty of the infarct-related artery.", 
    "412": "Experimental myocardial infarction is a model of cardiac overload in which part of the cardiac muscle is removed. The resulting left ventricle insufficiency depends on the size of the infarct and time. The infarcted area remodels, due to proteolytic activity of inflammatory cells and collagenogenesis from fibroblast activity. The phenotype of the residual healthy cardiac muscle undergoes modification, and there are peripheral vascular changes which are partly dependent on the activation of pressor systems and/or inactivation of dilator systems. The changes are proportional to the infarct size at any given time after induction of the model. The degree of right ventricular hypertrophy and the drop in arterial pressure are upstream and downstream markers of the loss of left ventricular function and therefore indicate the extent of the remodelling. The increase of type V3isomyosin, the amount of subendocardial collagen, and the biosynthesis, storage and secretion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) are all proportional to the infarct size and the degree of cardiac overload. The level of urinary cGMP is also correlated with infarct size. These indices show ventricular remodelling, increased stress and energy restriction of the residual healthy cardiac muscle. The activation of peripheral pressor systems also depends on infarct size. They reflect the influence of defective cardiac pumping on the kidney, liver, brain and endothelium. Massive infarcts are accompanied by an increase in circulating renin and in renal renin content, by a decrease in angiotensinogen due to its consumption by renin, and to its insufficient hepatic synthesis, and by an increase in vasopressin secretion and biosynthesis in the hypothalamus. Converting enzyme inhibition has beneficial effect in this model by lowering cardiac load. It reduces arterial pressure, reverses bi-atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy, reduces the changes in the myosin isoenzyme patterns, and normalizes subendocardial fibrosis and the level of ANF. Although the effects of converting enzyme inhibition are beneficial in this model, they are restricted by their inability to normalize the load and stress when the initial loss of cardiac contractile material exceeds 40%.", 
    "413": "Three types of dysfunction of the coronary circulation have been described in experimental models of hypertension associated with left ventricular hypertrophy: (1) reduced coronary reserve, (2) a relative decrease in perfusion of subendocardial layers, (3) a shift to the right, i.e. to higher pressures, of the circulation pressure autoregulation range. These abnormalities are also observed in hypertensive patients, although it is significant that they do not appear to be related to the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy. The exact causes of these abnormalities have yet to be elucidated. Left ventricular hypertrophy does not seem to be an essential factor, although in certain experimental models of hypertension, there does appear to be a mismatch between the development of the coronary vasculature and hypertrophy of the myocytes. The stresses in vessels due to the increase in systolic, and especially intraventricular diastolic pressure can be viewed as additional aggravating factors. The essential abnormalities are structural and/or functional alterations in arterial walls. The structural alterations are reflected by a narrowed lumen due to parietal thickening. This may result from growth of muscle fibres (hypertrophy or hyperplasia) or collagen tissue and/or remodelling of tissues with no overall change in mass. Functionally, the reduced ability of the arteries to stretch, resulting from endothelial alterations may also play a role in the abnormalities observed in hypertensive patients. In our studies, we examined the effect of the antihypertensive drug perindopril on the coronary circulation in renovascular hypertensive rat (two kidneys--1 clip). We found that this inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) led to a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with a return to normal of the coronary reserve. Other studies using either this model or the spontaneously hypertensive rate has also pointed to a beneficial action of ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive agents on the coronary circulation with reversal of the structural alterations in arterioles. Coronary disease is the main cause of mortality in hypertensive patients. Ironically, antihypertensive therapy has yet to live up to its promise of reducing significantly either the incidence or severity of coronary disease in such patients. Specific alterations of the coronary circulation may account for the relative failure of antihypertensive drugs, despite their proven efficacy in other systems (e.g., stroke prevention). The coronary circulation is unique in certain important respects. It is tightly regulated, maintaining an almost constant flow rate over a wide range of aortic arterial pressures (40-160 mmHg). Extraction of oxygen by the myocardium is almost maximal under resting conditions, and so the circulatory reserve depends almost entirely on the capacity to increase blood flow. This reserve is quite large since there may be a 4 to 5-fold increase in coronary flow rate in response to effort. Another significant detail is that myocardial contraction may lead to an interruption of coronary flow, especially in the deep subendocardial layers, which thus tend to be perfused solely during diastole. This last factor can be seen as the Achilles heel of the coronary circulation, which may be severely limited by myocardial hypertrophy, especially in patients with hypertension.", 
    "414": "In order to compare the long-term effects on ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy of hydralazine and lisinopril we studied 30 patients, all males, still hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mm Hg) despite combined beta-blocker/diuretic therapy and with echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index > or = 1.31 g.m(-1)). They wer randomized to receive hydralazine slow release 50 mg/ chlorthalidone 12.5 mg) for 6 months. Casual blood pressure, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), M-mode echocardiogram, plasma renin activity and plasma catecholamines were evaluated before the randomization and after 6 months of treatment. Both drugs significantly reduced casual as well as daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, without statistical differences between the two treatments. Lisinopril was significantly more effective than hydralazine in reducing night-time systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly reduced by lisinopril and increased by hydralazine. Left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by lisinopril but not by hydralazine. The results of linear regression and multiple regression analysis suggested that the lisinopril-induced decrease in both day- and night-time blood pressure might account for the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas the lack of left ventricular hypertrophy regression during hydralazine treatment could be due mainly to the reflex sympathetic activation induced by the drug.", 
    "415": "Angiotensin had a dual action on the epididymal half of rat vas deferens. It potentiated electrical stimulated contraction and exerted a direct contractile effect on the muscle. The potentiation of electrically stimulated response may be mediated by presynaptic facilitation of neurotransmitter release. Muscular contractile response to angiotensin is concentration dependent. Angiotensin II was found to be much more potent than angiotensin III, and the order of potencies was angiotensin II > angiotensin I > angiotensin III. The presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 microM chymostatin, 50 microM bacitracin, 10 microM leupeptin and 10 microM pepstatin) did not alter the contractile activity of angiotensin II. In contrast, angiotensin I (10 nM)-induced contraction was significantly reduced in the presence of ACE inhibitor SQ 20881 (500 nM). The angiotensin II induced contraction was not reduced by CGP 42112, a specific AT2 receptor antagonist, but was significantly inhibited by losartan, a specific AT1 receptor antagonist. Losartan shifted the dose-response curve of angiotensin II to the right with a pA2 value of 8.68. In addition, p-aminophenylalanine6 angiotensin II, which is proposed as an AT2 receptor agonist, did not induce contraction. It is concluded that the AT1 receptor predominantly mediates angiotensin-induced contraction in epididymal rat vas deferens.", 
    "416": "Administration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce vascular proliferation following endothelial injury as well as progression of renal disease in various animal models. These effects might be due to interference with cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) since they have been implicated in regulating the effects of vascular cell growth factors such as fibroblast- and platelet-derived growth factors. We investigated the in vitro synthesis of IL-1 and TNF from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of various ACE-inhibitors. Captopril dose-dependently suppressed the IL-1 beta-induced synthesis of TNF by 74% (P < 0.01) and the IL-1 beta-induced synthesis of IL-1 alpha by 60% (P < 0.01). Cytokine synthesis induced by lipopolysaccharide was less affected. At concentrations suppressing TNF and IL-1, captopril did not reduce the synthesis of complement C3 in the same cells. Enalapril and cilazapril also suppressed cytokine-induced cytokine synthesis. Ramipril, lisinopril, perindopril and spirapril had no significant effect on TNF synthesis suggesting that the effect was not related specifically to the inhibition of ACE. Accumulation of mRNA for IL-1 and TNF were not affected by captopril, suggesting a posttranscriptional effect. We conclude that certain ACE-inhibitors suppress IL-1 and TNF synthesis at a posttranscriptional level and might therefore influence cytokine-mediated cell growth.", 
    "417": "To determine whether the control of blood pressure has a consistent effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy with macroalbuminuria in diabetic patients with differing serum levels of creatinine, we evaluated the relationship between mean blood pressure and the yearly rate of increase in serum creatinine concentration in two groups: one with macroalbuminuria and a serum creatinine concentration less than 2 mg/100 ml (group 1), and the other with macroalbuminuria and a serum creatinine concentration of 2 mg/100 ml or more (group 2). Both groups showed a positive relationship between the mean blood pressure and the yearly rate of increase in serum creatinine concentration. However, when the yearly rate of increase in serum creatinine concentration was compared in patients from both groups with matched mean blood pressures of less than 100 mmHg, it was greater in patients of group 2 than in patients of group 1. Thus, although a beneficial effect of blood pressure control on the progression of diabetic nephropathy was found in both groups, the effect was less in patients with macroalbuminuria and a serum creatinine concentration of 2 mg/100 ml or more when mean blood pressure was controlled at less than 100 mmHg.",

Among the unique actions of these two classes of drugs are their effects on matrix proteins apart from their effects in reducing arterial pressure.",

    "427": "NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HYPERTENSION AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Epidemiological data indicate a strong and consistent link between hypertension and coronary artery disease. This does not mean that hypertension is the cause of coronary artery disease. Less than a quarter of the risk of developing coronary artery disease can be attributed to raised blood pressure. Furthermore, in individuals, hypertension is only weakly predictive and hence blood pressure cannot be relied upon to identify those with a particularly high risk. EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE ON CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The results of outcome trials, largely in men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, demonstrate that a modest short-term reduction in blood pressure confers a reduction in coronary artery disease events of about 16%, against the expectation from observational studies of about 22.5%. Explanations for the apparent shortfall include the putative theory that metabolic effects of the drugs used in the trials (mainly thiazides and beta-blockers) offset the beneficial effect of the blood pressure reduction. However, from consideration of epidemiological findings, it is clear that a large proportion (over 75%) of events in hypertensive patients is unlikely to be preventable by managing the elevated blood pressure alone. TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Since arterial pressure interacts in a more than additive manner with coincident coronary risk factors, treatment should be initiated on the basis of overall risk and directed by predictors of myocardial infarction. In addition to a sustained level of blood pressure, these predictors include established coronary artery disease, older age and cigarette smoking. BEYOND BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION: Whether metabolically neutral antihypertensive drugs can reduce the shortfall between expected and observed benefit remains uncertain. However, some newer agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists) appear to have an effect on vascular structure and function that is independent of blood pressure reduction. If these advantages are confirmed in clinical trials, these drugs offer the prospect of a much greater impact on coronary artery disease than currently obtained.", 
    "428": "HYPERTENSION AND ARTERIAL HEMODYNAMICS: One of the characteristics of hypertension is an impairment in arterial hemodynamics. Any definition of hypertension has to take account of oscillatory fluctuations during the cardiac cycle, that is, fluctuations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure around mean arterial pressure. These fluctuations are determined by ventricular ejection, arterial distensibility and the timing of arterial wave reflections. EFFECTS OF AGING ON LARGE ARTERIES: Larger arteries stiffen progressively with age, due to medial and intimal thickening. This alteration can be described as a decrease in arterial distensibility (Di = delta D/delta P x D, where D is the diameter of the artery and P is the blood pressure). The most obvious consequence of arterial stiffening is an increase in the amplitude of pulse pressure, caused by an increase in systolic pressure and a decrease in diastolic pressure. Two mechanisms underlie this increase in pulse pressure: a higher incident pressure wave generated by the left ventricle into a stiffened aorta and an increase in the velocity of the pressure wave traveling forward and back in the arterial tree. In young subjects, the reflected wave causes an increase in the early diastolic wave, but in older people the reflected wave is summed with a late systolic wave, causing a dramatic increase in central systolic pressure. These phenomena affect left ventricular function adversely, increasing myocardial oxygen consumption and tending to decrease coronary blood flow. Furthermore, the increased systolic blood pressure induces left ventricular hypertrophy. EFFECTS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS: Although all classes of antihypertensive drugs can reduce blood pressure, only some can decrease arterial distensibility. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists have been shown to decrease the stiffness of conduit arteries and dilate peripheral arteries. This may account for the superiority of these drugs in regressing left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "429": "IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION: The results of basic and clinical research in hypertension over the last 30 years have shown that this disease cannot be treated merely by inducing vasodilation and a fall in blood pressure. The development of high blood pressure is associated with changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and with the development of organ damage, mainly of the heart and kidneys. It is now clear that different elements of blood pressure control mechanisms can lead to hypertension, emphasizing the need to select the appropriate type of hypertensive drug in treating different patients. COMBINATION OF CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS AND ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS: Calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors have synergistic effects on sodium and fluid balance and on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Thus a combination of these two antihypertensive drug classes is likely to be beneficial in certain subgroups of patients with hypertension. Large clinical trials are needed to determine whether this is indeed the case.",

    "431": "With the evolution of pharmacological treatment of hypertension, various classes of agent (diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists and alpha 1-blockers) have become available for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy. As monotherapy, each type of agent will normalize blood pressure in about half of all hypertensive patients. Replacing one drug with another that acts through a different mechanism improves the probability of controlling blood pressure. Another way to increase the number of responders is to increase the dose; however, this often results in more side effects. A preferable way of improving efficacy is to combine low doses of drugs that have different impacts on the cardiovascular system, thus opposing the compensatory responses that tend to limit the blood pressure drop.", 
    "432": "Low-dose drug combinations are generally well tolerated and the treatment of hypertension can be simplified by using fixed-dose combinations. These combinations have the potential to become a valuable alternative in the initiation of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "433": "INTRODUCTION OF THE TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: The mean antihypertensive effect of a drug, measured just before the next dose in a multiple-dose regimen, is generally used as a criterion for approval by regulatory agencies. However, for many short-acting drugs very high doses may be required to maintain some antihypertensive activity at the end of the dosing interval. This may lead to an excessive reduction in blood pressure at the time of peak drug effect. In order to avoid unnecessarily large doses, regulatory agencies have introduced a new standard, the trough:peak ratio, which may be 50-60% but should should ideally be higher. BENEFITS OF HIGH TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: A high trough:peak ratio indicates a long duration of action. This may provide a better risk:benefit ratio compared to shorter acting antihypertensive agents by giving optimal therapeutic coverage for 24 h or even longer. Greater benefit may be gained from better control of overnight blood pressure, especially in the early morning hours when both a steep rise in blood pressure and a higher rate of cardiovascular events have been observed. Large swings in blood pressure may occur when the peak is too high in relation to the trough, increasing blood pressure variability, which may in turn increase target organ damage. A high trough:peak ratio may protect the patient against drug-induced blood pressure fluctuations. It may also produce fewer adverse effects as the blood pressure may fall further and the onset of action may be more gradual. This, together with an effective single daily dose, may increase patient compliance. Furthermore, an antihypertensive effect that lasts more than 24 h protects the patient against a rapid loss of blood pressure control when a dose is omitted or delayed. TROUGH:PEAK RATIO OF AVAILABLE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS: We performed a literature survey to evaluate the practical relevance of the trough:peak ratio and to determine how it might help in the choice of antihypertensive agents. The results suggested that not all single daily doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists had a trough:peak ratio of > 50%. We conclude that specially designed, prospective clinical trials should be conducted to address this issue.", 
    "434": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)1 mediates inflammation, participates in T cell stimulation by certain antigenic peptides, and influences the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB). ACE is elevated in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by increased BBB permeability. ACE inhibitor captopril suppresses certain immune functions and inhibits inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. We studied the effect of captopril on Lewis rat EAE, an animal model of MS. Fourteen rats with EAE were treated with captopril 30 mg/kg daily from immunization to day 21 post-immunization, and compared with 14 untreated rats. Severity scores and lymphocyte reactivity to myelin basic protein and mitogen were measured. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference between the mean and cumulative clinical scores of captopril-treated and untreated animals. Lymphocytes from captopril treated EAE rats at the peak of disease severity had diminished responses to MBP and concanavalin A. The data suggest a significant beneficial effect of captopril in Lewis rat EAE. Further studies including other inhibitors of ACE or of other peptidases with immune, inflammatory or BBB role, may identify potentially valuable immunopharmacologic agents.", 
    "435": "Nitric oxide is an important regulator of vascular tone, as evidenced by the marked increase in blood pressure produced by the inhibition of its synthesis. Furthermore, nitric oxide may be implicated in the modulation of vascular growth, although in vitro and in vivo studies have provided conflicting results. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition, with or without antihypertensive treatment, on the structure of the basilar artery in the rat. Rats were treated for 6 weeks with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/kg/day) alone or in combination with verapamil (100 mg/kg/day) or with trandolapril (1 mg/kg/day). Untreated rats served as controls. The structure of perfused and pressurized basilar arteries were analyzed in vitro using a video dimension analyzer. Chronic L-NAME treatment increased systolic arterial pressure (229 +/- 5 vs 147 +/- 3 for controls; p < 0.05) and the media to lumen ratio of the basilar artery (0.22 +/- 0.02 vs 0.15 +/- 0.01 for controls; p < 0.05). This structural alteration was mainly due to remodeling (remodeling index: 76%), but not to growth (growth index: 8%, NS). The concomitant administration of verapamil and trandolapril prevented the increase in blood pressure (154 +/- 6 and 146 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively) and the structural changes produced by L-NAME (Media/lumen ratio: 0.15 +/- 0.01 and 0.14 +/- 0.01 mmHg, respectively). In fact, a positive correlation was observed between the media to lumen ratio and the systolic arterial pressure (r = 0.6; p < 0.001). The effect of the two antihypertensive treatments, as well as the correlation between the wall to lumen ratio and the arterial pressure, suggest that the remodeling of the basilar artery depends mainly on the elevation of arterial pressure with little contribution of the L-arginine pathway. Furthermore, the very small and non significant increase in the cross-sectional area of the basilar arteries from L-NAME-treated rats (growth index of 8%), suggest that nitric oxide does not play an important role in the modulation of normal cerebral vascular growth in vivo.", 
    "436": "We have previously shown that in hypertensive patients, the response of normal coronary arteries to sympathetic stimulation evoked by the cold-pressor test (CPT), and the endothelial-mediated flow-dependent coronary vasodilation were impaired. The immediate effects of the converting-enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat (PER) have been evaluated in 10 untreated hypertensive patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and results have been compared to the normal responses of 10 control subjects. Diameter changes of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (pLAD) and coronary flow velocity in distal LAD have been measured at baseline, during CPT, during recontrol, and after 10 mg papaverine (PAP) injection in the mid portion of the LAD. Measures have been repeated after intravenous infusion of 1 mg PER, and at the end of the procedure after 2 mg intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). Left ventricular dimensions and systolic function, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol were within the normal range. In hypertensive patients before PER, pLAD constricted in response to the CPT and no diameter change was observed after PAP, despite the increase in flow velocity in the 2 conditions (+63 +/- 27%, and +412 +/- 77%, respectively; all p < 0.001). In control subjects, pLAD dilated significantly in these 2 conditions. In hypertensive patients after PER, pLAD dilated similarly to control subjects in the 2 conditions. Endothelium-independent coronary dilation to ISDN was comparable in the 2 groups of patients. In conclusion, PER restores a normal coronary response both to sympathetic stimulation due to CPT and to flow increase in hypertensive patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and without any other coronary risk factors.", 
    "437": "The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a one-month treatment period with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg/day) on the endothelial reactivity in epicardial right coronary arteries (CA) of 26-30 week-old SHRs. For this purpose, segments of CA were mounted in an arteriograph where wall thickness and internal diameter (ID) were continuously monitored while intraluminal pressure (IP) was controlled. In the absence of flow and under an IP of 30 mmHg, IDs were not significantly different in control compared to those of treated SHR arteries (microns, 250 +/- 8 vs 240 +/- 7). In preconstricted preparations (5HT, 10 microns extraluminally) C/E curves were constructed by adding acetylcholine (AC, 0.01-10 microM) or bradykinin (BK, 0.01-10 microM) in the bath. On the other hand, the effect of a stepwise increase in intraluminal flow (50-450 microliters/min; IP = 30 mmHg) of perfusion solution was observed. The effects of subsequent additions of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed. Maximal relaxations were expressed as percent of maximal contractions. Results were as follows: [table: see text] These results show that the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by AC and BK were significantly increased in coronary arteries of treated compared to control SHRs whereas the flow-induced relaxation seemed to remain unaffected in our experimental conditions. From these data, it can be concluded that a short period of ACE inhibition in SHRs is able to improve the endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by agonists in the coronary arterial bed.", 
    "438": "The mid frequency component (MFC = 66-128 mHz) of blood pressure is an index of sympathetic vascular control. To investigate the effect of bisoprolol (B) and ramipril (R) treatment (TT) on the short-term variability of systolic blood pressure (SBP) diastolic blood pressure (DPB) and heart rate (HR) reactivity during mental stress, we studied 54 mild essential untreated hypertensive patients (24 men, 45 +/- 9.6 years, BP > 160/90 mmHg after a 15-days placebo run-in period) who were randomly assigned to double blind treatment (B: 10 mg/day: n = 28 and R: 5 mg/day: n = 26). A Stroop Word Color Conflict Test (SWCCT) was performed before and after 2 months of treatment. Hemodynamic parameters (BP and HR) were measured by a non invasive device (Finapres 2300E, Ohmeda-Maurepas) and underwent spectral analysis (SBP: mmHg.Hz-1/2, HR: beats/min.Hz-1/2, Anapres 1.2, Notocord-Orgametrie Systems, Igny-Lille) at rest and during SWCCT. The sympathetic vascular activity was assessed by calculating the area of the mid-frequency component (MFC = 66-128 Hz).",

    "441": "The pathological chain of events that stretches from the earliest atheromatous lesion to end-stage myocardial failure and death is amenable to attack in many places. It may well prove that a multifaceted intervention offers the best therapeutic option. Two important cardiovascular therapies, the calcium entry blockers and ACE inhibitors, may offer more than their effects on vascular tone and remodeling. Both have actions on the basic process of atheroma. Individually, or more challengingly in combination, they may strike at the basic pathogenesis of atherosclerosis yet still provide their more general beneficial effect on vasomotor tone. Whilst clinical data are yet scant, there is a plausible biological basis for their coprescription.", 
    "442": "Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor. High blood pressure per se is not a disease but a hemodynamic alteration associated with vascular disease. Two classes of drugs are especially effective in lowering blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular complications, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists. The hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are complementary. While ACE inhibitors inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and reduce sympathetic outflow, calcium antagonists dilate large conduit and resistance arteries. Certain calcium antagonists, such as verapamil, lower heart rate. In the blood vessel wall, the local vascular effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are also complementary. While ACE inhibitors inhibit activation of angiotensin I into angiotensin II and prevent the breakdown of bradykinin (which stimulates nitric oxide and prostacyclin formation), calcium antagonists inhibit the effects of vasoconstrictor hormones such as angiotensin II at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing calcium inflow and facilitating the vasodilator effects of nitric oxide. Calcium antagonists reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and atherosclerosis. In hypertensive animals, verapamil and trandolapril normalize endothelial dysfunction. In large angiographic trials, nifedipine and nicardipine reduced the development of new atherosclerotic plaques. After myocardial infarction, verapamil reduces mortality and cardiac events in patients without heart failure. In contrast, ACE inhibitors are effective after myocardial infarction in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Urinary albumin excretion rate decreases during ACE inhibitor therapy or with a calcium antagonist such as verapamil; combination of the two drugs has an additive effect. In resistance arteries, hypertension is associated with an increased media/lumen ratio. ACE inhibitors, but not beta-blockers, markedly improve these structural changes. In summary, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists have a complementary profile, both in their hemodynamic and local vascular action. Hence, combination therapy with these two classes of drugs appears particularly useful in patients with hypertension, not only to lower blood pressure, but hopefully to achieve improved cardiovascular protection.", 
    "443": "The increased mortality after myocardial infarction is related to the risk of reinfarction, sudden death, and the development and progression of heart failure; in congestive heart failure it is due to the progression of heart failure and sudden death. ACE inhibitors have been proven to prevent cardiovascular events, especially the progression of heart failure, in postinfarct patients with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure in the SAVE and AIRE trials. In patients with congestive heart failure, ACE inhibitor treatment has prevented cardiovascular death and reduced morbidity due to progressive heart failure in the SOLVD trials. In post-myocardial infarction patients, the calcium antagonist nifedipine did not affect mortality or morbidity; diltiazem improved prognosis in patients without congestive heart failure and in patients with non-Q-wave infarction; and verapamil improved prognosis by prevention of reinfarction and sudden death. Combination treatment with both verapamil, which has pronounced antiischemic properties and prevents sudden death and reinfarction, and an ACE inhibitor, which prevents the progression of heart failure, is a possibility for future cardiovascular therapy that should be evaluated.", 
    "444": "The current treatment of survivors of acute myocardial infarction is now largely based on sound scientific principles, supported by the results of large and well-designed clinical trials. These have demonstrated that aspirin, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents reduce mortality and reinfarction in selected groups of patients. It remains uncertain whether these different treatments are additive and whether there are beneficial or undesirable interactions. In addition to informing us about the effectiveness or otherwise of these and other drugs, we have learned much about the conduct, analysis, and limitations of clinical trials in this context. The selection of patients for the various treatments is a matter of opinion because the results of the trials are open to a variety of interpretations. In assessing trials, one must be sure that they have been conducted on the intention to treat principle and that surrogate and composite end points have not been inappropriately used. In applying the results of trials to one's own practice, one must take into account the problems of extrapolation and subgroup analysis.", 
    "445": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are in common use for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Whereas they are, in general, well tolerated, a dry cough can develop which, on occasion, requires termination of therapy. The reported prevalence of cough with ACE inhibitor therapy has varied from 0.2 to 25%, depending upon methods of data collection, analysis and symptom reporting. 2. To evaluate the prevalence of cough in Chinese patients receiving ACE inhibitors, interviews were carried out in 191 patients in Hong Kong who were taking therapy which included captopril or enalapril for hypertension or heart failure, and 382 patients matched for sex and age receiving alternative medications which excluded an ACE inhibitor (controls). Patients and controls were interviewed in a blinded manner by the same interviewer using a common adverse-effect questionnaire. 3. Persistent cough was reported in 44% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor (46% of those receiving captopril and 41.8% of patients taking enalapril), and in 11.1% of the controls (P < 0.001). The prevalence of other adverse reactions was similar, with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. The complication of cough was not related significantly to age, sex, underlying disease, drug dosage or smoking status. 4. This study indicates that cough is a common side effect of treatment with ACE inhibitors in Hong Kong Chinese, although in most patients cessation of therapy is not required. Whether Chinese are particularly susceptible to ACE-inhibitor cough requires a formal prospective study comparing Chinese and non-Chinese patients.",

Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment with perindopril (by 9%) and with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 6%). Cardiac index increased with perindopril (by 6%), because of an increased stroke index (by 5%), but amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide did not change cardiac function. Systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly more with perindopril (by 14%) than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 8%). The distensibility of the common carotid artery was significantly enhanced by perindopril (by 16%), but not changed by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (1% difference). The difference between perindopril and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide for carotid distensibility was statistically significant. The compliance of the common carotid artery tended to be increased more by perindopril (by 7%) than by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide, which induced a 5% decrease in carotid compliance.

    "476": "Hypertensive emergency is a condition in which there is elevation of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the presence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive urgency is a condition where the blood pressure is elevated (diastolic > 120 mmHg) with the absence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive emergencies are best managed with parenteral drugs and careful intraarterial blood pressure monitoring. Hydralazine has been widely used in treatment of hypertension in eclampsia and preeclampsia, and its safety has been demonstrated in these patients. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has the most reliable antihypertensive activity, which begins immediately after its administration and ends when the infusion is stopped. As with diazoxide, it should be used with caution in patients with impaired cerebral flow. SNP is the preferred drug in obtaining controlled hypotension in patients undergoing neurovascular surgery. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful in patients prone to myocardial ischemia, but should be avoided in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Esmolol is effective in controlling both supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and severe hypertension. Its short onset of duration of action make it useful in the emergent setting, but because of its negative inotropic effect its use should be avoided in patients with low cardiac output. Verapamil should not be used in patients with preexisting conduction abnormalities. Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator without a significant direct depressant effect on myocardium. As with other afterload reducing agents, it should not be used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors generally cause cerebral vasodilatation, enalaprilat may be particularly beneficial for patients who are at high risk of developing cerebral hypotensive episodes secondary to impaired cerebral circulation. Fenoldopam, a selective post-synaptic dopaminergic receptor (DA1) has been shown to be effective in treating severe hypertension with a lower incidence of side effects than SNP. Hypertensive urgencies can usually be managed with oral agents. Oral nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, and nimodipine have all been shown to be effective in these situations.", 
    "477": "As in hypertension, the addition of a second active drug is believed to enhance treatment efficacy; however, the extent to which a combination of two low-dose drugs outperforms conventional monotherapy remains uncertain. Established treatments of angina comprises nitrates compounds, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, which are often given in combination. Beta-blockers are major players in this field as they inhibit the tachycardia induced by nitrates and calcium antagonists; there is therefore a pathophysiological justification for their use in combination therapy, supported by repeated confirmation of positive clinical effect. The most widely chosen calcium antagonists are dihydropyridines; verapamil may impair conduction. However, it is not clear whether combination enhances the effects of the individual antianginal substances. Diuretics are for most clinicians the keystone treatment of heart failure; diuretics are often combined with other drugs, e.g. amiloride and spironolactone. The latter also have a beneficial effect on myocardial structure (myocardium/collagen ratio). ACE-inhibitors are of proven clinical efficacy, and, in addition, have a beneficial effect on survival. They combine well with diuretics: because the diuretic stimulates renin release, the ACE-inhibitor can be given at a lower dose (enhancement of effect). There are, however, certain drawbacks (hypotension, hyperkalemia with antialdosterones). The results of combining ACE-inhibitors with calcium antagonists and beta-blockers await investigation. The ISIS studies demonstrated the advantages of combining beta-blockers, thrombolysis and aspirin in acute infarction. ACE-inhibitors have recently been added to the regimen with a positive effect (extended survival), especially in the presence of a decreased ejection fraction (SAVE, AIRE, GISSI 3 and ISIS 4 studies).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "478": "The standard treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension is monotherapy chosen from one of the five main classes of antihypertensives following the World Health Organisation and Joint National Committee guidelines. If first-line monotherapy fails, the physician must decide whether to increase the dose, choose a drug from a different class or add a second antihypertensive. However, greater efficacy must not be obtained at the cost of an unacceptable increase in side-effects. Sequential monotherapy is partly based on the impossibility of predicting the blood pressure response to a given antihypertensive. The validity of this strategy is supported by the findings of the Materson study, which suggest combination therapy only after the failure of at least two monotherapies. The aim of combination therapy is to optimize treatment by using two different classes of antihypertensives with synergistic effects. The anticipated advantages are ease of use, the enhancement or addition of the antihypertensive effects, and the possibility of administration to a wide population. This has led to the development of fixed combinations which are low-dosed to reduce the incidence of side-effects. Validated combinations (dosed differently according to the medicinal product) include: beta-blocker + diuretic, beta-blocker + dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor + diuretic and in the future, ACE-inhibitor + calcium antagonist. The pharmacokinetic interaction of beta-blocker + DHP at the hepatic level must be considered to assess the efficacy of this combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "479": "The main goal of combination therapy in current antihypertensive treatment strategy is to achieve an additive or hopefully synergistic effect at a lower dose, hence with fewer side-effects. In reality, no one antihypertensive has a monolithic action profile: the therapeutic effect is the combined result of one or several individual effects, and the consequence of one of several adaptive mechanisms involved in physiological regulation. The action profiles of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors provide a good example of this complexity. The strategy for therapeutic use of an antihypertensive, including possible combination with another drug, thus depends on the level of impairment in the target structure (beta-adrenergic receptor, converting enzyme, calcium channel etc.), modulation of other target structures by the drug, and on the amplitude of counter-regulatory mechanisms that may be brought into play, whether directly or indirectly. The latter have greatest impact on the long-term outcome of antihypertensive treatment, in terms of myocardial hypertrophy, vascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis. Despite the multiple pharmacological and pharmacokinetic interactions leading to the development of increasingly sophisticated activity profiles and despite the use of increasingly focussed combination therapies, we must not forget that the role of many potential pharmacological targets still awaits investigation.", 
    "480": "Several different strategies may underlie the development of combination products for the treatment of hypertension or other disease states. Some of these approaches may be more rational and justifiable than others. Amongst those which can clearly be justified are: (1) improved convenience (and compliance) in patients with an established need for two separate treatments; (2) increased efficacy over monotherapy; (3) reduced side-effects over monotherapy; (4) increased efficacy and reduced side-effects. As far as relevant pharmacokinetic issues are concerned, it is advisable to avoid pharmacokinetic interactions between the two components based on either induction or inhibition of drug metabolism or modification of protein binding as these will add unpredictable variability to the response to the drugs. Compatible if not similar pharmacokinetics are only of relevance if there is a close correlation between plasma concentration and effect for both components independently. Of more importance are dynamic issues, including the mechanism of action. It is preferable to use drugs with differing complementary mechanisms rather than identical mechanisms. It is not essential that the drugs have a similar duration of effect but the dose frequency will be determined by the drug with the shortest duration of effect. These principles provide a sound basis for the development of combination regimens in hypertension including an ACE-inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic and also the combination of a beta-blocker with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. The combinations have been established to have a role in the management of hypertension.", 
    "481": "Recent studies are reviewed dealing with the putative roles of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system in the development of pressure-overload hypertrophy and the subsequent transition from adaptive hypertrophy to diastolic dysfunction, impaired systolic function and cardiac failure. The results of these studies, which employed the aortic banded rat model of cardiac hypertrophy, indicate that the intracardiac conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) is significantly increase in hypertrophied hearts compared with hearts from age-matched, sham-operated controls, and that Ang II may have a direct effect of slowing relaxation and altering diastolic tone in the hypertrophied heart. Furthermore, in patients with aortic stenosis and severe baseline abnormalities of diastolic relaxation and filling, acute intracardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, totally in the absence of any systemic effect on neurohormones, improved diastolic function. ACE inhibition was found to reduce net ACE activity and to increase plasma renin activity in aortic banded animals compared with untreated banded controls. There was also a trend for circulating noradrenaline levels to be increased at this stage of transition to failure in the untreated banded animals but ACE inhibition tended to restore the levels back to normal. In ACE inhibitor-treated animals, left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure was significantly reduced, despite the persistent elevation of systolic pressure, but not yet restored completely to normal. In untreated, banded animals the transition to cardiac failure was evidenced as an increase in both systolic and diastolic dimensions with a reduction in fractional shortening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "482": "Losartan is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents called 'angiotensin II antagonists'. It selectively and completely blocks the binding of angiotensin II at the angiotensin type 1 receptor-a unique mechanism of action different from all the other classes of antihypertensive agents. Losartan is as effective as other commonly used antihypertensive agents, but it permits convenient dosing and is better tolerated. On the strength of current data on its safety and efficacy, losartan should be considered a valuable option for many hypertension patients in whom angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists would be used. Although the administration of losartan produces beneficial effects and may be cost effective, long term data regarding morbidity and mortality in hypertension are needed.", 
    "483": "A choice of many antihypertensive strategies is now offered for the treatment of the hypertensive patient with renal insufficiency. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to be the drugs of choice since they not only lower blood pressure but also reduce some important risk factors that may cause progressive loss of renal function, such as intraglomerular hypertension, angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced glomerular growth, proteinuria and hyperlipidemia. Indeed, several clinical studies now show that ACE inhibitors offer renal protection beyond the lowering of systemic blood pressure. The new class of Ang II receptor antagonists and its first representative losartan has not yet been tested clinically for its renal protective efficacy. The first signs, however, look promising, since losartan appears to induce changes in several identified risk factors to the same extent as ACE inhibitors, such as renal vasodilation, and a fall in proteinuria and serum lipids. The challenge will be to discover the differences between ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists and to use them to the future advantage of the renal patient.",

The efficacy and safety of losartan have been assessed in double-blind, controlled clinical trials conducted in approximately 3700 patients with uncomplicated mild, moderate and severe essential hypertension. Overall, losartan, whether administered alone or in combination with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was effective and well-tolerated in these clinical trials, with an incidence of adverse experiences similar to that of placebo. The antihypertensive effects of losartan 50 mg once daily were similar to those of 20 mg once daily of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. The antihypertensive effects of losartan 50 to 100 mg once daily were similar to those of the calcium channel blocker felodipine 5 to 10 mg and to those of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol 50 to 100 mg once daily. Losartan was shown to have a smooth antihypertensive profile throughout the 24 h period following dosing, which mirrors the diurnal variability of blood pressure. The addition of 12.5 mg HCTZ to 50 mg losartan produced an additional significant antihypertensive response. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the antihypertensive effect of losartan when assessed by demographic subgroups of age or sex; there is a smaller antihypertensive response in Black patients. The most common patient-reported, drug-related, clinical adverse experience, with an incidence greater than that of placebo, was dizziness (2.4% versus 1.3%).

    "490": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are highly effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship among the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors, ACE inhibition and plasma angiotensin II levels is complex. During chronic therapy with ACE inhibition, plasma angiotensin II levels return to normal despite a continued antihypertensive effect. Recent studies show that a conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in tissues can proceed despite complete ACE inhibition. In the search for a potential ACE inhibitor-resistant angiotensin II-forming enzyme activity in human heart tissue, chymase was identified as a major angiotensin II-forming enzyme. In primates, chymase-like angiotensin II-forming activity is localized in a number of tissues including the heart, blood vessels and lungs. Within the human heart, mast cells and endothelial cells are the sites of synthesis and storage of chymase, but a high level of the secreted chymase is also found in the cardiac interstitium, associated with the extracellular matrix. Mammalian chymases may be divided into two distinct structural groups, alpha and beta. alpha-chymases, such as human chymase, are highly specific and efficient angiotensin II-forming enzymes. beta-chymases, including several rat and mouse chymases, have a broad substrate specificity like chymotrypsin and do not form angiotensin II. In humans and baboons only a single chm gene of the alpha-subtype can be identified. By using an angiotensin I analogue that is selectively converted to angiotensin II by chymase and not ACE, a functional chymase-dependent angiotensin II formation has recently been demonstrated in conscious baboons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "491": "Hypertensive mechanisms are postulated to play a major role in the progressive glomerulosclerosis (GS) after renal mass reduction. But, in contrast to converting enzyme inhibitors, BP reduction by calcium channel blockers, has not provided consistent protection. Radiotelemetric BP monitoring for 7 wk was used to compare nifedipine (N) and enalapril (E) in the rat approximately 5/6 renal ablation model. After the first week, rats received N, E, or no treatment (C). The overall averaged systolic BP in C (173 +/- 7 mmHg) was reduced by both E and N (P < 0.001), but E was more effective (113 +/- 2 vs. 134 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.01). GS was prevented by E (2 +/- 1 vs. 26 +/- 5% in C) but not by N (25 +/- 6%). GS correlated well with the overall averaged BP in individual animals of all groups, but the slope of the relationship was significantly steeper in N compared with C+E rats (P < 0.02), suggesting greater pressure transmission to the glomeruli and GS for any given BP. Since autoregulatory mechanisms provide the primary protection against pressure transmission, renal autoregulation was examined at 3 wk in additional rats. Autoregulation was impaired in C rats, was not additionally altered by E, but was completely abolished by N. These data demonstrate the importance of autoregulatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of hypertensive injury and suggest that calcium channel blockers which adversely affect pressure transmission may not provide protection despite significant BP reduction.",

The role of blood pressure and/or other cardiovascular uremic risk factors in cardiac remodeling is still uncertain. To determine the extent to which improvement of kidney function and the control of uremia-related risk factors are associated with a reduction of myocardial injury, we evaluated the effect of dietary protein restriction or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on cardiac structure in remnant kidney rats. One week after subtotal nephrectomy, Wistar rats were allocated to receive drinking water solution (group 1), 5 mg/kg per day lisinopril (group 2), or a low-protein diet (6%) (group 3) for 12 weeks. Group 2 and 3 showed a comparable efficacy in preventing the expected rise in creatininemia, urinary protein excretion, and glomerulosclerosis.

The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular mass and intracardiac collagen content appeared to be dissociated from anemia, sympathetic activity, and hyperlipidemia.

Indomethacin administration did not potentiate the increase in blood pressure induced by L-NAME. However, the concurrent administration of both inhibitors almost totally blunted the vasodepressor action of ramipril. By contrast, losartan administration in the presence of L-NAME and indomethacin increased blood pressure to a level similar to that after losartan plus L-NAME. Hoe 140 did not modify either blood pressure or the hypotensive effects of losartan or ramipril. Increases in diuresis and water intake were observed during ramipril administration.

Diameters were measured with the use of an ultrasonic echo-tracking system (12 MHz) under flow (2 mL/min) (F+) or no-flow (Fo) conditions, with intact endothelium (Endo+) or after endothelium removal (Endo-). The role of tissue RAS was assessed by incubating isolated carotid arteries with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE I; lisinopril, 10(-6) mol/L) or with a specific antagonist of angiotensin II AT1 receptors (AT1A; losartan, 10(-6) mol/L). In addition, maximal dilation of carotid arteries was measured after poisoning with KCN (100 mg/L). In all experiments, KCN significantly increased carotid diameters (WKY, 23 +/- 0.9%; SHR, 19 +/- 0.8%; P < .001 versus control conditions). In intact carotid arteries, flow caused significant dilation in WKY (7 +/- 0.5%, P < .001) but had no effect in SHR. In the presence or absence of flow, ACE I and AT1A induced similar dilations in both strains, and a specific antagonist of bradykinin B2 receptors (Hoe 140, 10(-7) mol/L) had no effect on ACE I-induced dilation. After endothelium removal, carotid artery diameters were significantly increased (P < .001) in both strains, although more in SHR (13 +/- 0.8%) than in WKY (8 +/- 1.1%) (P < .001). Also, flow did not modify the diameter of deendothelialized vessels and ACE I had no effect in either strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Pathogen-free rats were inoculated with either Sendai virus suspension or sterile viral growth medium into each nostril. Five days later, we measured airway and esophageal blood flows before and immediately after injection of SP or histamine into the left ventricle of rats in both groups using a modification of the reference-sample microsphere technique. Viral infection potentiated the increase in airway blood flow evoked by SP but not by histamine. We also examined the effect of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the SP-induced increase in airway blood flow. Both phosphoramidon (NEP inhibitor) and captopril (ACE inhibitor) potentiated the increase in airway blood flow produced by SP in pathogen-free rats. In the presence of both peptidase inhibitors, a submaximal dose of SP increased blood flow to a similar level in infected and pathogen-free rats. Thus decreased activity of both ACE and NEP may be involved in the exaggerated increase in airway blood flow evoked by SP in virus-infected rats.",

In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study, 22 patients were given 1.5-2.0 mg captopril/h i.v., while 24 patients were given placebo. Medication was started between 2 and 18 h from the onset of infarction. The two groups were matched for age, infarct location, and time of intervention. With the exception of one patient in either group, all were concurrently given nitroglycerin. The necrosis parameters were provided by the quantitative measurement of the QRS complex. The Q wave decreased with captopril treatment (-0.003 mV), but increased with placebo (+0.14 mV, p < 0.05). The number of ventricular premature beats at 24 h from the start of treatment was 25/h with placebo, and 9/h with captopril (p < 0.02). Ventricular fibrillation occurred seven times in the placebo group, but did not occur in the captopril group. The creatine kinase infarct weight was 59 gram-equivalents (gEq) with placebo, and 45 gEq with captopril (p = NS). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 12 mmHg with captopril treatment.

    "522": "The pathophysiology of heart failure is closely associated with neuroendocrine changes. Activation of these humoral systems apparently serves as a compensatory mechanism for the failing circulation. However, overshoot of such mechanisms may further depress cardiac function by increasing afterload, resulting in a vicious cycle of reflex neuroendocrine activation. Corollary decreases in renal function activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well, which further contributes to the cycle of downward-spiralling cardiac function. Many hormonal factors are increased in congestive heart failure. While some influences are vasodilatory, the net effect is marked vasoconstriction. The level of activation of these systems apparently corresponds to the severity of heart failure. Furthermore, elevated levels of these hormones, including norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor, plasma renin, and plasma arginine vasopressin, may play a more direct role in worsening heart failure. In fact, elevated catecholamine levels are directly related to prognosis. Catecholamines increase myocardial oxygen demand and are also arrhythmogenic. Oral catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which work by similar mechanisms, have yielded increased mortality rates in heart failure trials. In contrast, mortality rates are reduced in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus, it is clear that neuroendocrine changes are not only a marker of the severity of heart failure, but also directly worsen it. Interventions that antagonize or diminish these neuroendocrine changes apparently benefit patients with heart failure.",

Levels of angiotensin II (AII) in fetal sheep are similar to maternal. 2. The fetal RAS plays a role in maintenance of arterial pressure. The extent to which it does so depends on the level of activity of the system. 3. The distribution of renin within the fetal rat kidney is much more widespread than in the adult. The fetal kidney, like other vascular beds has high levels of the AT2 angiotensin receptor subtype. With maturation the proportion of the AT1 receptor subtype increases. 4. Blockade of the fetal RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or with the non-peptide AII antagonist (losartan) caused a fall in fetal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and a rise in renal blood flow (RBF). AII reverses the fall in GFR even though RBF decreases. 5. The fraction of the filtered sodium load reabsorbed by the proximal tubule was not affected when the fetal RAS was blocked by captopril or losartan. High doses of infused AII had no effect on renal reabsorption of sodium, in the short term, but in the long term depressed fractional proximal reabsorption. 6.

    "524": "Results from SOLVD, SAVE, AIRE, GISSI-III, ISIS-IV, and the Chinese Captopril Trial suggest that therapy with ACE inhibitors, at least with enalapril, captopril, ramipril, and lisinopril, induce significant reduction in morbidity and mortality rates in patients with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and a wide range of ventricular function and myocardial infarction. SOLVD and SAVE results, in particular, demonstrate improved survival and reduced major ischemic events in patients with depressed systolic ventricular function. SOLVD points out that institution of ACE inhibitor therapy need not be done immediately post-myocardial infarction to accrue benefit. GISSI-III and ISIS-IV, on the other hand, suggest that use of ACE inhibitor drugs early post-myocardial infarction produces significant, albeit small, benefits when drugs are begun early post-event in conjunction with other routinely used therapeutic strategies. The prospective, well-designed, and well-controlled nature of these clinical trials, the consistency of their findings, and the high level of morbidity and mortality in placebo groups establish the importance of preventing ischemic events with the prescribed ACE inhibitors. Particularly important is the fact that none of these clinical trials were designed to determine optimal dose or frequency of administration of the ACE inhibitors chosen. Targeting dose principles were utilized and clinicians wishing to generate similar results in their own patient population should choose one of the ACE inhibitors studied and administer it in the manner described in hopes of achieving outcomes similar to those detailed in the summarized clinical trials. Finally, recommendations regarding post-myocardial infarction therapy with ACE inhibitors can be summarized. Patients having acute or remote infarction should have an assessment of ventricular function. All patients with depressed systolic function, whether they are or are not symptomatic, should receive a trial of an appropriate ACE inhibitor. Patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction should have an assessment of ventricular function early and, if the ejection fraction is low (probably < 50%), an appropriately chosen ACE inhibitor should be begun after 24 hours have elapsed. ACE inhibitor therapy should be begun in combination with other proven effective post-myocardial infarction treatment strategies. In patients with normal systolic function, advantages of ACE inhibitor therapy are less clear, but patients with large anterior wall myocardial infarction will likely benefit, even without objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Concomitant utilization of thrombolytic agents, aspirin, and beta blockers should not interdict use of ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "525": "Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular events in the elderly and it is present in more than 50% of acculturated populations over 60 years of age. Morbidity trials have clearly demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly in all subgroups examined, including diabetics, those over 80 years of age, those with or without electrocardiographic abnormalities, and in both men and women. These reductions in strokes, coronary events, and other hypertensive complications have been seen primarily with diuretic-based regimens, with or without potassium-sparing therapy. However, in the 1990s physicians are initiating diuretics less often for older patients with hypertension in spite of this scientific evidence. Low doses of diuretics have been well tolerated, successful in recent morbidity trials, and avoid much of the concerns about theoretical toxicities from diuretics, although higher doses have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Until calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-blockers, or some other class of antihypertensive agent has been demonstrated to be at least as effective as diuretics in reducing cardiovascular events or mortality, diuretics should be the first drug class to consider for the treatment of hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "526": "In genetic and acquired hypertension, a structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment of myocardium, including the accumulation of fibrillar collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the interstitium, represents a determinant of pathologic hypertrophy that leads to ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, to evaluate the potential benefit of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril in reversing the interstitial remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we treated 16-week-old male SHR with oral quinapril (average dose, 10 mg/kg body weight/day) for 20 weeks. Interstitial fibrosis was determined morphometrically using an automatic image analyzer. The amount of collagen was evaluated by measuring myocardial hydroxyproline concentration. Myocardial deposition of collagen molecules (types I, III, and IV) and other ECM components (fibronectin, laminin) was analyzed by immunohistochemical techniques using specific monoclonal antibodies. The activity of ACE was measured in left ventricular tissue by a fluorometric assay. In quinapril-treated SHR compared with 36-week-old untreated SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, we found 1) a lesser degree of LVH and a lesser level of blood pressure, 2) a lesser degree of interstitial fibrosis, represented by less interstitial collagen volume fraction (5.73 +/- 0.45% v 3.42 +/- 0.28%, P < .05; WKY, 3.44 +/- 0.66%), 3) a lower hydroxyproline concentration (1.09 +/- 0.05 mumol/L/g dry weight/100 g body weight to 0.81 +/- 0.05 mumol/L/g dry weight/100 g body weight, P < .05; WKY, 0.96 +/- 0.06 mumol/L/g dry weight/100 g body weight), 4) a lesser presence of collagen fibers, and 5) a lesser presence of collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, plasma glucose, and insulin responses to an oral glucose load (75 g), lipid profile, and urinary albumin excretion were evaluated before and after 8 weeks' administration of quinapril (10 to 40 mg/day). Quinapril produced a significant and comparable reduction of arterial blood pressure in both groups. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 114.8 +/- 0.9 to 94.2 +/- 1.1 (-17.9 +/- 1.5%) in the essential hypertensive group and from 118.4 +/- 1.6 to 96.2 +/- 1.4 (-18.4 +/- 1.6%) in the diabetic hypertensive group. In both essential hypertensives and diabetic-hypertensive subjects with microalbuminuria, quinapril significantly and comparably reduced the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE); UAE decreased from 32.5 +/- 5.5 micrograms/min to 14.7 +/- 3.7 micrograms/min (P < .05 v baseline) in the diabetic-hypertensive group and from 27.5 +/- 3.0 micrograms/min to 11.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/min (P < .05 v baseline) in the essential hypertensives. Altogether, a direct correlation was found between the initial level of UAE and the UAE reduction after quinapril (delta UAE) (r = 0.706, p < .05). Insulin and glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test and the lipid profiles were not modified by quinapril treatment. The results confirm that quinapril is an effective antihypertensive agent that additionally reduces microalbuminuria in both hypertensive diabetics and in patients with essential hypertension, without altering insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.",

The hypotensive potency of DU-1777 was not as marked as that of lisinopril in renin-dependent hypertensive models, i.e., two-kidney one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-1C RHR) (ED-20mmHg: 3.1 versus 1.0 mg/kg) or two-kidney two-clip renal hypertensive dogs (2K-2C RHD) (ED-20 mmHg: 2.5 versus 1.0 mg/kg), though the actions of the two drugs were both long-lasting and dose-related. When spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used, however, DU-1777 was as active as lisinopril (ED-20 mmHg: 17.9 versus 13.6 mg/kg). The most distinguishing results with DU-1777 were its hypotensive effects in renin-independent hypertensive models. In contrast to lisinopril, the drug produced a sustained and dose-related hypotensive effect in DOCA salt hypertensive rats (DOCA-HR) and one-kidney one-clip renal hypertensive rats (1K-1C RHR). There exists an inconsistency between the long duration of the agent's hypotensive action in all tested hypertensive models and its short duration of ACE inhibiting activity as demonstrated both in vivo and ex vivo. The sustained antihypertensive action of DU-1777 cannot be reasoned solely with respect to ACE inhibition, suggesting some additional mechanisms of action yet to be defined.",

Chronic medullary, but not intravenous, infusion of ACE inhibitor restores the impaired pressure natriuresis by improving medullary microcirculation in SHR.

This may be explained by the very number of families of drugs which may intervene during the evolution of coronary artery disease. A common mistake is to think that the results of therapeutic trials can be automatically applied in clinical practice. In order for the demonstrated effect of a product to lead to its automatic prescription, there must be confirmation that the importance of the expected benefits does not depend on the type of infarction. This is probably the case for aspirin and the reduction of cholesterol levels which seem to be effective irrespective of the characteristics of the initial infarction. On the other hand, the efficacy or dangers of anti-ischaemic drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or antiarrhythmics, is very dependent on the impact of the infarct on left ventricular function. The prescription of drugs after myocardial infarction depends on individual parameters which lead to the adaptation of consensus recommendations to each particular case.",

Since inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can lead to decreased production of angiotensin-II and increased levels of kinins (e.g., bradykinin), it is likely that both of these mechanisms might be involved in this phenomenon. However, it is not known whether and to what degree the accumulation of kinins contributes to the overall potentiation of natriuretic response to fenoldopam seen during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. In the present study, we have examined the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and angiotensin-II receptor antagonist losartan as well as bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 on fenoldopam-induced natriuresis. Intravenous infusion of fenoldopam (1 microgram/kg/min) for 30 min produced significant increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion without causing any changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure, a phenomenon suggestive of a direct tubular site of action. In animals treated with either the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist losartan, the diuretic and natriuretic effects of fenoldopam were potentiated to a similar degree. Whereas no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate occurred when fenoldopam alone was given to control rats, in animals treated with either enalaprilat or losartan, fenoldopam produced a modest but significant increase in glomerular filtration rate.

The sensitivity to insulin improved by 15% (p = 0.03) in the enalapril group and worsened by 17% (p < or = 0.01) in the atenolol group. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were not modified by any treatment. The improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by enalapril treatment appears to be an advantage as compared with atenolol treatment in hypertensive obese and dyslipidemic patients, whereas the BP-lowering efficacy of the two drugs is similar. Because this effect has been reported with other ACE inhibitors, it appears to be characteristic of the entire class of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "542": "Antagonists of the type 1 (AT1) angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor increase renin secretion and plasma Ang II levels, and the increased Ang II levels may counteract the effects of the antagonist. Moreover, other investigators have suggested that the reactive increase in Ang II levels may increase bradykinin (BK) levels through stimulation of the type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2). We investigated the acute effects of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (intraarterial injection of 10 mg/kg every 12 h) in male Sprague Dawley rats by measuring circulating angiotensin and BK peptides at 6, 12, and 24 h. Whereas acute losartan administration increased blood angiotensin levels four- to sixfold, blood BK levels were unchanged. We also investigated the effects of losartan administered for 8 days (10 mg/kg every 12 hours, by intraperitoneal injection) on circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin and BK peptides, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Losartan increased plasma renin levels 100-fold; plasma angiotensinogen levels decreased to 24% of control; and plasma aldosterone levels were unchanged. Ang II levels in plasma, adrenal, lung, heart, and aorta were increased 25-, 8-, 3.5-, 2.4-, and 14-fold, respectively, by losartan administration. By contrast, kidney Ang II levels decreased to 71% of control, accompanied by a decrease in kidney levels of BK-(1-7) and BK-(1-9). No other tissue showed a change in BK peptide levels, except for a reduction in blood levels of BK-(1-8) to 43% of control. Plasma ACE increased by 13-50%, but tissue ACE levels were unchanged. These data demonstrate that losartan has tissue-specific effects on endogenous levels of angiotensin and BK peptides and indicate that increased BK levels do not contribute to the actions of losartan. The absence of a reactive increase in endogenous kidney levels of Ang II indicates that this tissue is likely to be the most sensitive to AT1 receptor antagonism.", 
    "543": "Primary and secondary hypertension differ with regard to circadian blood pressure (BP) profiles. To evaluate the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to circadian BP regulation, we studied cardiovascular effects of the angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in animal models of primary and secondary hypertension after morning and evening dosing. Systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured telemetrically in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and transgenic hypertensive rats (TGR[mRen-2]27). Losartan (0.3 to 30 mg/kg) or enalapril maleate (10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) either at 0700 or 1900 h. Baseline SBP/DBP and HR showed significant circadian rhythmicity in both strains. The 24-h means in SBP/DBP were 190/127 mm Hg in SHR and 200/139 mm Hg in TGR. TGR showed a reversed circadian profile in BP, with peaks occurring during the daily resting period, whereas HR peaked at night. Losartan reduced BP dose dependently; reductions in TGR were significantly greater and obtained at 30-fold lower doses than in SHR. Maximum decreases induced by losartan were similar to those induced with enalapril 10 mg/kg. Both drugs reduced BP in TGR more effectively when applied at 0700 than at 1900 h, resulting in a normalized circadian BP profile. Our results demonstrate that the RAS is involved in both the pathomechanism of hypertension and in the inverse circadian BP pressure pattern in TGR.", 
    "544": "A multistage sampling method is proposed in dose-response trials, where dose adaptions can be performed in the preplanned adaptive interim analyses. The overall test for proving a dose-response relationship is performed by Fisher's product criterion for the p-values from the separate tests of a dose effect in the disjoint samples at the different stages. Based on these p-values decision boundaries for early stopping with the rejection of the global null hypothesis of no existing dose-response relationship are introduced. The power of the adaptive two-stage procedure using a particular adaptation rule is compared with the power of the test for a linear trend under analysis of variance assumptions in extensive simulations. The bias in estimation is also quantified. This procedure could be used for establishing a dose-response relationship without including a placebo treatment.",

    "552": "Recent observations indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition corrects renal transplant erythrocytosis (RTE). The mechanism for this association is not known. We examined the effect of ACE inhibition on hematocrit, erythropoietin (EPO), and renin substrate. ACE inhibition has been reported to suppress renin substrate, which is known to stimulate EPO and erythropoiesis. In 15 patients with RTE, hematocrit dropped from 52.8 +/- 0.6 (SEM) to 45.8 +/- 1.4% after 8 weeks of treatment with Enalapril, 2.5-20 mg/day. Serum EPO (normal range: 9-30 mU/ml) was high in one, normal in seven, and low in seven patients. ACE inhibition reduced EPO in patients with initial high or normal levels but induced no change in patients with initial low levels. ACE inhibition had no significant effect on renin substrate. In one patient who rejected his first graft, erythrocytosis recurred following a second, successful transplant. Treatment was discontinued because of cough in two patients and symptomatic drop in blood pressure in one patient. We conclude RTE is not caused by hypererythropoietinemia. In patients with normal circulating EPO, erythrocytosis may result from an increase sensitivity to EPO, and ACE inhibition lowered hematocrit by further reduction of this hormone. However, the finding of erythrocytosis in half our patients with suppressed EPO, suggests the participation of non-EPO-mediated mechanism(s). The recurrence of RTE in a patient after a second transplant raises the additional possibility of patient-specific factors in the pathogenesis of this disorder. In contrast to other reports, we documented side-effects (cough, hypotension) in three (20%) of our patients. Our clinical experience, coupled with prior reports of spontaneous resolution of RTE in some patients, suggests that intermittent courses of ACE-inhibition may be the optimal strategy in the use of this form of therapy for RTE.", 
    "553": "The present study was undertaken to characterize the direct chronotropic effect of bradykinin in isolated spontaneously beating atria of the guinea pig. Bradykinin caused concentration-dependent increases in the beating rate of atria. In contrast, the active metabolite of bradykinin and the typical bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, Des-Arg9-bradykinin, had no effect on the beating rate of atria. Inhibition of converting enzyme or neutral endopeptidase by captopril or SQ-28603, respectively, did not affect beating rate but potentiated bradykinin-induced increase in beating rate. The potent bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140, antagonized bradykinin-induced chronotropic effect. In contrast, the bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist, Lys-[Leu8]Des-Arg9-bradykinin, had no effect. The increase in beating rate caused by bradykinin was not affected by blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors, cyclooxygenase, or nitric oxide synthesis using atenolol, indomethacin and N omega-nitro-L-arginine, respectively. Unlike bradykinin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II caused very small or no change in beating rate in the presence or absence of captopril and SQ-28603. These results indicate that bradykinin causes a direct positive chronotropic effect which is mediated by activation of bradykinin B2 receptors independently of prostaglandins and beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "554": "The administration of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, produces glutathione (GSH) depletion in tumors, making them sensitive to drugs and radiation. During the process, it also depletes GSH from normal tissues. Certain tumors require frequent doses of BSO for several days to produce GSH depletion. In this study, we determined that this chronic GSH-deficient condition lowers the antioxidant defense of the lung by diminishing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and the levels of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Impaired antioxidant defense leads to enhanced lipid peroxidation, as indicated by increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and conjugated dienes. The alteration of protein thiols by lipid peroxidation, is responsible for altered Ca2+ homeostasis, which, in turn, leads to cell injury. Cell injury was confirmed by elevated activities of angiotensin converting enzyme and lactate dehydrogenase, increased levels of protein and lactate, and histopathological changes.",

Therapy should be selected on the basis of the individual patient's needs and diseases, the potential for adverse events, the monitoring required, drug costs, and the expected duration of therapy.

When administered to anaesthetised salt-replete dogs, GR138950 caused renal vasodilatation and significant increases in sodium and urine excretion. No change in glomerular filtration rate was observed indicating that the natriuresis was a consequence of inhibition of tubular sodium reabsorption. Qualitatively similar but less marked changes in renal function were observed in response to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, although in contrast to GR138950, captopril also caused a small but significant fall in mean blood pressure. Intra-renal artery infusion of exogenous angiotensin II resulted in dose-related renal vasoconstriction and decreases in urine excretion, sodium excretion, fractional excretion of sodium and glomerular filtration rate. These renal effects of angiotensin II were all markedly antagonised by GR138950. We conclude that GR138950 is an effective antagonist of the renal haemodynamic and excretory actions of endogenous and exogenous angiotensin II.",

We found that the receptor subtype AT2 represents the dominant receptor in normal and failing human myocardium. Angiotensin II receptors were found on isolated human cardiac fibroblasts where angiotensin II stimulated cellular proliferation via an as yet undetermined subtype. In end-stage human heart failure, angiotensin II receptors are characteristically downregulated at the protein and messenger RNA level. In a chronic rat model, the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan led to a downregulation of angiotensin II receptors in the liver, kidney, adrenal cortex and medulla. Downregulation of these receptors may represent an important mechanism by which AT1 receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system.",

    "579": "Pharmacological differences between ACE inhibitors and losartan could affect comparative efficacy and/or safety. In addition to angiotensin I, ACE has other substrates (e.g. kinins). Blocking the metabolism of kinins with ACE inhibitors could be beneficial (e.g. vasodilation) and/or elicit side effects (e.g. cough) which will not be produced by losartan. Non-ACE pathways of angiotensin II formation have been described (e.g. angiotensin I convertase) which may limit the ability of ACE inhibitors to prevent formation of angiotensin II in all tissues. Losartan blocks angiotensin II responses irrespective of the route or site of angiotensin II formation. Two binding sites for angiotensin II are widely accepted, AT1 and AT2. Losartan blocks only AT1 sites while ACE inhibitors functionally block angiotensin II interaction with both sites. Since the physiological role for AT2 sites is unknown, the relevance of this difference between ACE inhibitors and losartan is questionable.",

In animal models that reflect complications of hypertension, such as kidney dysfunction, cardiac and vascular hypertrophy and stroke, losartan and ACE inhibitors are also equally effective. From these results, kinin potentiation and lack of inhibition of angiotensin I convertase do not lead to differences in pharmacological efficacy between ACE inhibitors and losartan. Therefore, with respect to therapeutic efficacy, results in animal models indicate that losartan will display the beneficial pharmacology of ACE inhibitors without the detrimental side effects attributed to kinin potentiation.", 
    "581": "Losartan (DuP 753, MK-954) is the prototype of a new class of orally active, non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists able to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system specifically and selectively without the agonistic effects of the peptide receptor antagonists, e.g. saralasin, or the bradykinin-potentiating effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "582": "The preclinical pharmacology of angiotensin II receptor blockade is exemplified by the experience with losartan. Over 1200 abstracts and papers have been published from studies in which losartan has been used to explore the role of angiotensin II in a wide range of normal and pathological states. Losartan has also proved useful in further defining the heterogeneity of angiotensin II receptors. According to current nomenclature, losartan represents the prototype antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor family (AT1a and AT1b) and does not possess significant affinity for the so-called AT2 receptor. Virtually all of the known actions of angiotensin II, e.g. those defined by angiotensin II itself, saralasin, ACE inhibitors or renin inhibitors, are blocked by losartan, emphasizing the major role of AT1 receptors in mediating the responses of angiotensin II. Although the AT2 receptor has now been cloned, the function of this receptor remains poorly understood.", 
    "583": "Preclinical studies with losartan have suggested that this agent produces inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system comparable to that of ACE (and renin) inhibitors, without the bradykinin-potentiating effects. In several models of experimental and genetic hypertension losartan has proved to be an orally effective antihypertensive agent with a long duration of action and similar efficacy to that of ACE and renin inhibitors. In animal models of renal disease losartan significantly decreases proteinuria, provides protection against diabetic glomerulopathy and increases survival in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. A growing number of experimental studies have also shown that losartan inhibits neointimal proliferation and markedly reduces or prevents cardiovascular hypertrophy/remodeling and cardiac failure mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists have added another dimension to the arsenal of drugs manipulating the renin-angiotensin system. These agents do not have the experimental limitations of the peptide antagonists and ACE inhibitors.",

    "585": "The objectives of treating hypertension are to achieve adequate control of blood pressure (BP) and maintain it under tight control. Maintenance of tight control of BP will most likely prevent stroke, heart attack, and heart failure, cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and quite possibly preserve or improve renal function. The last two salutary effects combined will further reduce the morbidity and mortality in the treated hypertensive subjects. Choice of antihypertensive drugs is of significant importance so that our efforts to control hypertension do not grossly alter the quality of life. The cost of therapy is also an important consideration. Thus, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and central inhibitors that are relatively inexpensive and adequately lower BP should be a common choice. However, if drowsiness interferes with work, or impotence becomes a threat for the marital partner or significant other, adjustment has to be made. The metabolic abnormalities consisting mainly of impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolemia, and insulin resistance often induced by these relatively inexpensive drugs have put calcium channel blocker and ACE inhibitor group of drugs on the top of the list for antihypertensive therapy. They are far more expensive, yet offer no greater antihypertensive advantage than a diuretic or central inhibitor, except in special circumstances.", 
    "586": "Renal and electrolyte complications occur commonly in elderly patients with heart disease. Renal function declines with age. A seemingly normal serum creatinine level in the geriatric patient often represents a creatinine clearance of 60 ml/min or less. It is important to measure or estimate the creatinine clearance in an older patient with a borderline high or elevated serum creatinine level before administering renally excreted drugs. The Cockcroft and Gault formula is recommended for estimating the creatinine clearance in such patients. Impaired renal function can also predispose to drug-induced hyperkalemia in geriatric patients; the most common offending drugs are potassium chloride supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly patients should be evaluated for renal artery stenosis if they have worsening of previously stable hypertension, new-onset hypertension, or progressive renal impairment on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Risk factors and management guidelines for radiocontrast nephropathy in the elderly are also discussed.", 
    "587": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril, lisinopril and enalapril-maleate (the latter being a prodrug that has to be converted into enalaprilat), and bradykinin were investigated in the presence or absence of indomethacin and bradykinin receptor antagonists in dog renal arterial rings precontracted with either prostaglandin F2 alpha or phenylephrine. At a high precontraction level (10 microM of prostaglandin F2 alpha), captopril did not relax the arteries. However, when the tension was low (0.5 microM), both captopril and lisinopril produced endothelium-dependent relaxations. The maximum relaxations for captopril and lisinopril were 57 +/- 6% and 64 +/- 15%, respectively. Enalapril-maleate failed to relax the renal arteries even when the vascular tone was low. In endothelium-intact arteries precontracted with phenylephrine (0.2 microM), captopril and lisinopril produced a maximum relaxation of 60 +/- 9% and 29 +/- 5%, respectively, in arteries with intact endothelium, whilst responses to enalapril-maleate were inconsistent. Renal artery rings with rubbed endothelium failed to relax in response to bradykinin or captopril. We observed significant variations in both captopril- and lisinopril-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in one tenth of the preparations. The relaxations to bradykinin and captopril were not affected by indomethacin (3 microM), whereas they were markedly attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine (0.1 mM). The bradykinin-antagonist, N alpha-adamantane-acetyl-D-Arg-(Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7)BK, or the specific bradykinin2 receptor antagonist, HOE140, completely abolished the relaxation responses to captopril and reduced the potency of bradykinin, but failed to affect the acetylcholine-induced responses. The results suggest that the relaxant effect of captopril is mediated by endogenous bradykinin or by activation of bradykinin receptors. The proposed mechanisms by which captopril relaxes the renal arteries are: (1) inhibition of tissue kininase II, which leads to accumulation of endogenous bradykinin; (2) shift in angiotensin I metabolism towards (a) relaxant angiotensin derivative(s); and (3) interaction with bradykinin receptors.", 
    "588": "The present brief review summarizes the evidence for the possibility that endogenously released bradykinin plays a major role in protecting the heart against the consequences of acute myocardial injury. This evidence includes the facts that kinins are generated under myocardial ischemia; that when they are administered, they are cardioprotective (e.g., antiarrhythmic); that drugs that enhance the release of bradykinin from the ischemic heart reduce the ischemic injury and, conversely, drugs that block bradykinin receptors attenuate the reduction in ischemic injury resulting from the release of, or administration of, bradykinin. The possible mechanism of bradykinin in the cardioprotection afforded by ischemic preconditioning is summarized. Ischemic preconditioning can be defined as the marked reduction in the severity of ischemic changes that result from coronary artery occlusion when that occlusion is preceded by brief periods of myocardial ischemia, either regional or global, induced, for example, by complete or partial coronary artery occlusion or by rapid ventricular pacing. The possible mechanisms of cardioprotection elicited by bradykinin (and ischemic preconditioning) are summarized. The most likely is the generation of cyclic GMP within the ischemic myocardium following bradykinin-stimulated nitric oxide generation and release from endothelial cells.", 
    "589": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) not only reduce angiotensin II synthesis but also potentiate endogenous kinins. In addition to their antihypertensive actions, accumulated evidence has demonstrated an improvement by ACEIs of cardiac function, cardiac structural and metabolic status, and myocardial blood flow in conditions such as cardiac ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial infarction. The mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive and cardioprotective actions of ACEIs are under intensive investigation. A reduction of angiotensin II synthesis is undoubtedly responsible for a major part of the antihypertensive effects of ACEIs. However, in experimental renal hypertension but not in genetic hypertension, bradykinin potentiation has been shown to partially mediate the acute and chronic antihypertensive actions of these drugs. In addition, experimental observations suggest that bradykinin potentiation plays a pivotal role in the cardioprotective effects of ACEIs.",

This article reviews the current status of research on kinin antagonists, describes their chemical properties, and delineates recent advances that have occurred with the advent of the second generation of kinin antagonists. The data collected with these antagonists support the assumption that kinins are implicated in inflammation and tissue injury as endogenous agents. Their importance, however, is not limited to the role as mediators of tissue injury and inflammation, as kinin antagonists have enabled the identification kinins as potential endogenous cardioprotective substances, also contributing to the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical studies are currently being performed in asthma, postoperative pain, anaphlyactoid reactions during low density lipoprotein apheresis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and suspected sepsis, head injury, and hantavirus infections to investigate the utility of kinin antagonists as therapeutic agents.",

Captopril (0.3-3 mg kg-1) or saline were administered by intravenously 10 min before coronary ischaemia. The left main coronary artery was then occluded for 7 min, followed by 7 min of reperfusion. Captopril caused a marked decrease in mean arterial blood pressure which was transient at 0.3 and 1 mg kg-1, and at doses of 1 and 3 mg kg-1, it produced marked bradycardia. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) on ischaemia was significantly reduced the captopril at a dose of 3 mg kg-1 only and on reperfusion at doses of 1 and 3 mg kg-1. At the same doses, captopril significantly reduced the mean duration of ventricular fibrillation (VF) on reperfusion. The incidence of mortality resulting from reperfusion-induced irreversible VF in the control group decreased from 42.9% to 14.3% (NS), 21.4% (NS) and 7.7% (P < 0.05) in captopril at 0.3, 1 and 3 mg kg-1, respectively.

The paired control groups received water. During this treatment, the systolic blood pressure was measured non-invasively with a W+W/BP recorder after preheating of the conscious animals. After these procedures, the rats were anaesthetized, the baseline mesenteric blood flow (MBF, volts) was recorded with a pulsed Doppler flow-meter and the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) heart rate and mesenteric vascular resistance were also measured. The captopril treatment failed to alter the body weight of SHRs and WKY. In the normotensive group, the MAP was not altered, but the MBF was moderately increased. In contrast, the MAP of the SHRs was markedly decreased, and the MBF was significantly increased. The basal MBF of the SHRs was significantly lower than that of the WKYs. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system may exert a tonic vasoconstrictor action on the mesenteric vasculature in SHRs. The increased mesenteric vascular resistance therefore plays an important role in the increased total peripheral resistance in the development of hypertension in SHRs.",

In this study we assessed the echocardiographic morphological and functional findings after renal transplantation of two homogenous groups of transplanted patients with normal renal function. The first (A) with spontaneously normotensive patients, the second (B) with moderate hypertension treated mainly with Ace inhibitors. Analysis of these data highlights two noteworthy results: the similar left ventricle hypertrophy found in both groups and the existence of better diastolic compliance among the hypertensive transplanted patients. If this is confirmed by studies currently in progress, the importance of Ace-inhibitors treatment in remodelling cardiac dysfunction after long term dialysis treatment might be seriously considered.", 
    "594": "This study evaluated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in 17 non-obese hypertensive patients (aged 45.6 +/- 2.2 years, body mass index 24.0 +/- 0.5 kg/m2, mean +/- S.E.M.) with (n = 8) and without glucose intolerance (n = 9) and compared the results with those of 16 age-matched non-obese normotensive subjects with (n = 7) and without glucose intolerance (n = 9). The hypertensive patients without glucose intolerance showed a significantly lower insulin-mediated glucose disposal and a compensating increase in second-phase insulin secretion compared with normotensives without glucose intolerance. In hypertensives with glucose intolerance, insulin-mediated glucose disposal was significantly lower and second-phase insulin secretion was comparable to that in normotensives without glucose intolerance. After 3 months of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with oral administration of delapril, blood pressure was significantly reduced in the hypertensives with glucose intolerance (n = 9). The insulin-mediated glucose disposal significantly (P < 0.01) recovered from 6.0 +/- 0.81 to 8.0 +/- 0.71 mg/kg per min. The second-phase insulin secretion tended to be lower (but not significantly) but insulin clearance increased from 15.4 +/- 0.85 to 19.1 +/- 1.42 ml/min (P < 0.05). These data show that in hypertensive patients without glucose intolerance insulin resistance might compensatorily augment second-phase insulin secretion and lead to hyperinsulinemia. In hypertensives with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance might induce postprandial hyperglycemia, which leads to hyperinsulinemia because of second phase insulin secretion at a level similar to that of normotensives.", 
    "595": "The local concentration of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the renal microenvironment is not only controlled by the generation of this peptide but also by its enzymatic degradation. Angiotensinase A (ATA; aminopeptidase A, A.C.3.4.11.7) is a major exopeptidase of the glomerulus involvement in the metabolism of ANG II. We studied the glomerular mRNA levels of ATA in a remnant kidney model 1-12 weeks after 1 1/3 nephrectomy. Functional parameters (systolic blood pressure and albuminuria) demonstrated the progression of renal disease in this model. Glomerular ATA enzyme activity significantly increased 1-5 weeks after nephrectomy and returned to control levels 12 weeks after ablation. In general, changes in steady-state mRNA expression for ATA were rather small. mRNA expression for ATA in isolated glomeruli as evaluated by northern blots was slightly increased 1 and 3 weeks after 1 1/3 nephrectomy but was suppressed 5 and 12 weeks after renal ablation compared to age-matched 2-kidney controls. Treatment of animals with the ACE inhibitor ramipril for 5 and 12 weeks partly inhibited the decrease in ATA transcripts after 1 1/3 nephrectomy and stimulated expression in 2-kidney controls whereas the ACE inhibitor decreased glomerular ATA enzyme activity in nephrectomized rats at 5 weeks. Isolated glomeruli from normal controls superfused with 10(-6) M ANG II for 60 min demonstrated no change in ATA transcripts. Our results show that ATA steady-state mRNA levels are slightly elevated early (1-3 weeks) after renal ablation, and are subsequently suppressed (5-12 weeks). ATA enzyme activity is also increased early and returned (12 weeks) to levels measured in age-matched 2-kidney controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Within 1 h, fuorsemide led to pronounced diuresis and natriuresis, to a rise of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (which ist low in neonatal pigs) by 1.8 times, increased the excretion of renal prostaglandins (especially the vasoconstrictor, thromboxane B2 (TXB2 and PGF2a) and raised the PRA significantly. Under captopril, the PRA rose significantly, whereas there was no unequivocal change in the excretion of renal prostaglandins. There was a pronounced decline of the sodium and potassium excretion in the urine with a fall in the concentrations of electrolytes in serum and of the hematocrit. Under indometacin, the excretion of all prostaglandins in the urine declined (this decline was most pronounced for PGE2). There was also a decrease in sodium excretion, whereas there was no significant change in PRA. It can be concluded from the results that the effects of the investigated drugs on the pig neonate kidney is at least partially attributable to an influence on hormonal factors.",

Patients were treated with 0.5 to 1 mg of cilazapril once daily or a combination of cilazapril and other antihypertensive drugs once daily for 48 weeks. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) throughout the study with no significant changes in heart rate and no adverse effects such as cough. There were no significant changes in body mass index or serum levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c, fructosamine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), or apolipoproteins (apo A-I, apo C-II, apo C-III, apo B, and apo E). Cilazapril caused a significant increase (P < 0.05) in levels of apo A-II and a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the apo B:apo A-I ratio, an index of arteriosclerosis.

Seventeen patients (8 men, 9 women; 6 whites, 11 blacks) completed both phases of the study, which consisted of two 5-week treatment periods separated by 2 weeks of placebo treatment. Each drug was randomly allocated to half the patients as the first drug and half as the second drug they received. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was carried out on the day before treatment and the last day of each active treatment. Both drugs were effective and well tolerated but isradipine was more effective overall than captopril in lowering BP (9.4% vs 3.9%, respectively; P < 0.02). Black patients had significantly higher BP at baseline than white patients; furthermore, black patients responded better to isradipine than to captopril. White patients had a smaller decrease in blood pressure with both drugs than did black patients, but white patients still attained a lower diastolic BP with captopril than did black patients (88 +/- 2 mm Hg vs 96 +/- 9 mm Hg; P < 0.01). There was no correlation between the pretreatment plasma levels of pressor hormones (plasma renin activity, catecholamines, and arginine vasopressin) and the magnitude of BP response to either drug, but the decrease in BP in response to captopril correlated significantly with the increase in plasma renin activity during treatment (r = -.84; P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "601": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to restore the impaired endothelial function in hypertension, but the mediators underlying the promoted endothelium-dependent dilatation have not been fully characterized. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10-week-long quinapril therapy (10 mg kg-1 day-1) on responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. 2. Endothelium-dependent relaxations of noradrenaline (NA)-precontracted rings to acetylcholine (ACh) and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) were similar in WKY rats and quinapril-treated SHR and more pronounced than in untreated SHR. The nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated the relaxations in both WKY groups and quinapril-treated SHR, and completely inhibited them in untreated SHR. When endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization was prevented by precontraction of the preparations with potassium chloride (KCl), no differences were found in relaxations to ACh and ADP between the study groups. In addition, in NA-precontracted rings the L-NAME- and indomethacin-resistant relaxations to ACh were partially prevented by apamin, an inhibitor of calcium-activated potassium channels. 3. Interestingly, in quinapril-treated SHR but not in the other groups, exogenous bradykinin potentiated the relaxations to ACh in both NA- and KCl-precontracted arterial rings. 4. Contractile sensitivity of endothelium-intact rings to NA was reduced in SHR by quinapril, and was more effectively increased by L-NAME in quinapril-treated than untreated SHR. 5. In conclusion, since the relaxations to ACh and ADP in quinapril-treated SHR were augmented in the absence and presence of NO synthesis inhibition but not under conditions which prevented hyperpolarization, enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation after long-term ACE inhibition can be attributed to increased endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization. However, the potentiation of the response to ACh by exogenous bradykinin in quinapril-treated SHR, as well as the increased attenuating effect of the endothelium on NA-induced contractions in these animals appear to result from enhanced endothelium-derived NO release.", 
    "602": "Hypertension was found to be associated with sympathetic overdrive but it is still debated if the antihypertensive agents can differently affect the stress response in hypertensive subjects. Through a psychophysiological study, we evaluated the effect of verapamil (V) and enalapril (E), both as monotherapy and association. Office BP was successfully reduced (< 145/90 mmHg) in 11 patients treated with V (V-Resp) and in 10 patients treated with E (E-Resp). Both the drugs were prescribed in 9 patients (V+E) who did not sufficiently lower their blood pressure (N-Resp) with monotherapy. Patients performed three stressors (color word stroop, cold pressor and handgrip). Extracardiovascular and hemodynamic functions were measured during baseline, stress and recovery periods. The response was evaluated adding the changes occurred in every phase of the psychophysiological session. This was performed before run-in and after any modification of the therapeutic intervention. The emotional arousal (phrontalis muscular contraction, skin conductance, peripheral temperature) was reduced when BP was normal. No change in BP reactivity was found. HR response decreased in V-Resp and cardiac output increased in E-Resp while the vascular reaction was restrained in E-Resp and V-Resp. This was reduced also in N-Resp when they assumed V+E and normalized their arterial pressure. The findings indicate that the sympathetic reactivity may be modified by the therapy. In particular, verapamil restrained the cardiac stress response without lowering the cardiac output and was advantageously associated with enalapril to control the psychophysiological response in more resistant hypertensive patients.",

The thiol containing ACE inhibitor, captopril has been reported to inhibit isolated NADPH oxidase. The above effect of captopril, if present in intact cells, could contribute to the ability of this drug to alleviate neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. We have, therefore, investigated the effect of captopril on the oxidative activity of intact human isolated neutrophils. 2. The effects of captopril on neutrophil oxidative activity were compared with those of enalaprilat (a non-thiol ACE inhibitor) and N-mercaptopropionyl glycine (MPG) (a simple thiol). 3. The oxidative response of PMA-stimulated neutrophils measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence was not affected by any of these test agents. The thiol captopril and MPG (but not enalaprilat) caused an initial delay in luminol chemiluminescence production by PMA-stimulated neutrophils. 4. Captopril and MPG (but not enalaprilat) increased, rather than decreased oxygen uptake, when added to PMA-stimulated neutrophils. Thiol oxidation was determined to be, at least partly, responsible for the excess oxygen uptake observed. 5. NADPH oxidase activity in intact neutrophils was not affected by captopril, MPG or enalaprilat. The inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity is unlikely to contribute to the therapeutic effects of captopril and other thiols.", 
    "612": "1. The role of vasoactive peptide systems in the pulmonary vasculature has been studied much less extensively than systemic vascular and endocrine effects. The current understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and natriuretic peptide systems (NPS) in the pulmonary circulation is therefore reviewed. 2. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, the main vasoactive component of the RAS, are elevated in pulmonary hypertension and may interact with hypoxaemia to cause further pulmonary vasoconstriction. Pharmacological manipulation of angiotensin II can attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction but larger studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in established pulmonary hypertension. 3. Although all the known natriuretic peptides, ANP, BNP and CNP are elevated in cor pulmonale, only ANP and BNP appear to have pulmonary vasorelaxant activity in humans. ANP and BNP can also attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, suggesting a possible counter-regulatory role for these peptides. Inhibition of ANP/BNP metabolism by neutral endopeptidase has been shown to attenuate development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension but this property has not been tested in humans. 4. It is also well established that there are potentially important endocrine and systemic circulatory interactions between the RAS and NPS. This also occurs in the pulmonary circulation and in humans, where at least BNP acts to attenuate angiotensin II induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. This interaction may be particularly relevant as a mechanism to counter-regulate overactivity of the RAS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Dogs of various breeds, ages, and weights were included in the study. Replicates of 2 dogs each were formed, using separate allocation schedules for dogs with MR or DCM. One dog within each replicate received placebo tablets (vehicle tablets without enalapril) PO sid or bid, and the other dog received enalapril tablets at approximately 0.5 mg/kg sid or bid, based on individual need. In addition to the experimental drug, all dogs, except 1 in the placebo group, received furosemide; 73.3% of the dogs in the placebo group and 78.3% of those in the enalapril group received digoxin. Doses of enalapril or placebo were administered for approximately 28 days.

    "615": "Diuretics have long been accepted as the traditional first-line treatment of the patient with symptomatic heart failure whatever its aetiology or dysfunctional stage. Their acceptance in this role is based on the rapid improvement in congestive symptoms experienced by most patients, which is arguably greater than that induced by any other currently available anti-heart failure drug. This symptomatic efficacy and their universal clinical acceptance as first-step treatment for the patient with symptoms of heart failure has precluded formal examination of their impact on prognosis. Evidence from indirect studies suggests that when used alone they may not be able to prevent clinical deterioration, possibly due to excitation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. When such excitation is suppressed by concomitant administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, relief of congestive symptoms is enhanced and the morbidity and mortality risk of heart failure significantly reduced. Studies on the mechanisms of diuretic resistance have demonstrated the synergy of diuretic activity when low doses of diuretics acting at different sites of the nephron are used in combination. Diuretics remain the cornerstone of treatment for symptoms in congestive heart failure but their overall efficacy is substantially improved when combined with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "616": "During the last 20 years, physicians have generally regarded heart failure as a haemodynamic disorder in an attempt to explain patients' symptoms and disability. This model led to the widespread evaluation of peripheral vasodilators and the development of novel positive inotropic agents, but long-term use of these drugs failed to improve symptoms and was frequently accompanied by an increase in the risk of death. These clinical observations raised concerns about the validity of the haemodynamic hypothesis and led to the development of alternative models of heart failure--most importantly, the neurohormonal hypothesis. According to the neurohormonal model, heart failure develops and progresses because endogenous neurohormonal systems that are activated by the initial injury to the heart exert a deleterious effect on the circulation. Recognition of the importance of neurohormonal activation has led to the intense interest in the use of neurohormonal antagonists--converting--enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers--in the treatment of chronic heart failure. The results of randomized clinical trials with a variety of neurohormonal antagonists have been encouraging, and widespread acceptance of these drugs is expected to lead to clinical benefits for many patients.", 
    "617": "In the initial phase of heart failure, cardiac output and pressure are maintained by increasing sympathetic drive and by cell hypertrophy. Elevated end-diastolic volume, a reduced ejection fraction and a higher filling pressure also occur. Only in more severe heart failure, when cardiac output cannot be maintained, do symptoms appear which may vary between congestion, exercise intolerance, left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias or a combination of each. Drug treatment has principally two aims: first, to improve symptoms, second, to influence prognosis, which is very poor in advanced heart failure. Symptom improvement will also depend on whether the condition is acute, subacute or chronic heart failure. In the acute situation diuretics are normally the first choice of treatment, whereas in chronic heart failure the ACE inhibitors have proved themselves to be the drugs which most improve prognosis. The role of digitalis, still frequently used, remains unclear, and its importance will be revealed when the results of ongoing studies are announced.",

    "626": "Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists failed to alter the development of hypertension in this animal model. However, agents such as captopril (CAP) and losartan (LOS) which interfere with the renin-angiotensin system effectively prevented the development of hypertension. When tolerance occurred in the presence of doxazosin (DOX) or phenoxybenzamine, there was an enhanced sensitivity to the blood pressure lowering influence of LOS. In the presence of CAP, at a dose that did not retard the development of blood pressure in the SHR, DOX treatment significantly offset the development of hypertension in this strain. These results suggest that a functional tolerance to agents that interfere with the sympathetic nervous system is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was associated with a normalization of the enhanced contraction of the mesenteric vascular bed seen in preparations from the SHR and a suppression in the development of the vascular amplifier. The results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system is unable to maintain an elevated blood pressure in the SHR during interference with the functioning of the renin-angiotensin system. Conversely, under conditions of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, angiotensin II can maintain an elevated blood pressure in the SHR.",

Blockade of ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1) in newborn rats induced an arrest in nephrovascular maturation and renal growth, resulting in altered kidney architecture, characterized by fewer, thicker, and shorter afferent arterioles, reduced glomerular size and number, and tubular dilatation. Inhibition of ANG II generation in tadpoles induced even more marked developmental renal abnormalities. Blockade of ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2) in newborn rats did not alter renal growth or morphology. Results indicate that ANG II regulates nephrovascular development, a role that is conserved across species.",

This article provides a review of the literature concerning the relationship between hypertension, hypertensive therapy and salivary function. A case report is presented to illustrate changes in salivary function in response to different types of antihypertensive medications.", 
    "629": "Nitroglycerin (NTG) has been used for more than a century for the relief of angina pectoris and is regarded as an extrinsic donor of nitric oxide (NO). Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), is reported to have beneficial effects on survival in acute myocardial infarction. In this study, a hybrid compound of NO and ACEI, S-nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap), was synthesized, which was characterized by its molecular structure. Its coronary effects in chronically instrumented dogs were compared with those of NTG and captopril. S-NO-Cap (50 micrograms/kg i.v.) increased epicardial coronary diameter (CoD) by a maximum of 5.2% for more than 20 min. NTG (15 micrograms/kg i.v.) increased CoD by a maximum of 4.6% for 10 min, i.e., the effect was equipotent with that of S-NO-Cap (50 micrograms/kg i.v.). However, S-NO-Cap produced its maximal CoD increase more slowly than NTG did. Both S-NO-Cap and NTG transiently increased coronary blood flow. However, NTG had a more potent effect than S-NO-Cap (28.4 vs. 40.8 ml/min, respectively). Captopril, on the other hand, had almost no effect on either CoD or coronary blood flow. Thus, the vasodilatory action of S-NO-Cap more closely resembled that of NTG than that of captopril. Therefore, S-NO-Cap may dilate coronary arteries by virtue of its NO moiety rather than by its ACEI properties. These findings indicate that S-NO-Cap is a potential antianginal drug.", 
    "630": "The aim of our prospective study was to evaluate putative progression promoters, kidney function, and prognosis during long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy. Eighteen consecutive hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetes patients with nephropathy (mean age, 33 years) who had not been treated previously were all treated with captopril in combination with frusemide or bendrofluazide. The four patients who were refractory to this regimen also received nifedipine. Treatment was continued for a median of 8.9 years (range, 6.3 to 9.8, years). Renal function was assessed every 6 months by measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (single-bolus 51Cr-EDTA technique) and albuminuria by radioimmunoassay. Baseline values (+/- SE) were mean arterial blood pressure 146/93 +/- 3/1 mm Hg, albuminuria (geometric mean +/- antilog SE) 982 +/- 1.2 micrograms/min, and GFR 98 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induced a significant reduction during the whole treatment period of blood pressure (137/85 +/- 3/1 mm Hg; P < 0.01) and albuminuria (392 +/- 1.4 microns/min; P < 0.01), and the rate of decline in GFR was 4.4 +/- 0.7 mL/min/yr, in contrast to previous reports of 10 to 14 mL/min/yr (natural history). Univariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the rate of decline in GFR and mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.58, P = 0.01), albuminuria (r = 0.67, P < 0.01), hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.69, P < 0.01), and serum total cholesterol concentration (r = 0.51, P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "631": "Chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction results in interstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney. Both an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, SC-51316, ameliorate the increased production of extracellular matrix protein in the tubulointerstitium of the obstructed kidney. Blockade of angiotensin II synthesis or inability of angiotensin II to bind to its receptor lessened the increased levels of mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta and collagen IV found in the obstructed kidney of untreated rats. A monocyte/macrophage infiltration was present in the obstructed kidney of untreated rats or rats treated with the angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In contrast, this infiltrate was almost completely absent in the obstructed kidney of rats treated with enalapril. The reason for this different effect of enalapril compared with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist on the macrophage infiltrate seen in obstructive nephropathy has not been elucidated. We conclude that both an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and a receptor antagonist of angiotensin II ameliorate the tubulointerstitial fibrosis that follows complete unilateral ureteral obstruction in the rat. We suggest that an increased level of angiotensin II has a major role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis following ureteral obstruction.", 
    "632": "Diastolic heart failure, in the absence of LV systolic dysfunction, is a common clinical condition that can be demonstrated in as many as one third of patients with congestive heart failure. Diastolic dysfunction caused by abnormalities in LV filling can be a result of many pathologic conditions, including hypertrophy, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, or myocardial ischemia. The major physiologic determinants of LV filling can be divided into cellular mechanisms, hemodynamic characteristics, and hormonal influences. Cellular mechanisms for impaired LV inactivation are determined by the handling of calcium within the myocyte during excitation-contraction-relaxation coupling. The hemodynamic characteristics of LV diastolic filling are determined by loading conditions, the time constant of isovolumic relaxation, heart rate, ventricular nonuniformity, pericardial restraint, myocardial elasticity, chamber compliance, and coronary blood flow. The sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are important modulators of diastolic filling, directly or indirectly. The diagnosis of heart failure is confirmed by a combination of clinical tests including invasive and noninvasive techniques, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Treatment of medical conditions in which diastolic heart failure is a prominent component include pharmacotherapy with calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, diuretic agents, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. Certain conditions associated with diastolic filling abnormalities such as pericardial disease or severe ischemic heart disease may be best managed by surgical or percutaneous intervention. Future research will include further delineation of the cellular mechanisms of active myocardial relaxation and clinical investigation into treatment directed at improving outcome.", 
    "633": "The iv administration of L-arginine, a precursor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide, is known to decrease blood pressure in humans by its direct vasodilatory effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether L-arginine infusion modifies the renin-angiotensin (Ang)-aldosterone system as well as blood pressure and renal hemodynamics. L-Arginine and saline vehicle were iv administered to 10 healthy male subjects in random order on different days. L-Arginine infusion (500 mg/kg over 30 min) decreased mean blood pressure (from 81.2 +/- 2.7 to 74.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and renal vascular resistance (from 0.085 +/- 0.007 to 0.074 +/- 0.006 mm Hg/mL.min; P < 0.01) and increased heart rate (from 60.3 +/- 2.7 to 69.7 +/- 2.1 beats/min; P < 0.001) and renal plasma flow (from 616.6 +/- 37.8 to 701.0 +/- 49.2 mL/min; P < 0.05). L-Arginine reduced serum Ang-converting enzyme activity (from 10.4 +/- 0.6 to 8.9 +/- 0.5 nmol/mL.min; P < 0.05) and plasma Ang-II (from 19.3 +/- 3.3 to 12.7 +/- 2.8 pg/mL; P < 0.001), but had no effect on PRA or the glomerular filtration rate. The saline vehicle did not alter any of these parameters. The iv administration of L-arginine (endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide) may reduce the plasma Ang-II concentration by inhibiting Ang-converting enzyme. The mechanism by which L-arginine infusion decreases blood pressure can be at least in part explained by inhibition of the renin-Ang system.", 
    "634": "We studied vascular sodium pump activity and its regulation by vasoactive agents and endothelium in cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Baseline sodium pump activity (ouabain-inhibitable 86Rb+ uptake) was similar in cells from both rat strains. Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 increased ouabain-inhibitable 86Rb+ uptake more in SHR than WKY cells, whereas no effects were obtained with sodium nitroprusside, 8-bromo-cGMP, or iloprost. We examined the influence of endothelium on vascular sodium pump activity either by coculturing smooth muscle and endothelial cells or by using conditioned medium. Both coculture for 24 hours with endothelial cells and treatment with conditioned medium increased smooth muscle cell sodium pump activity, this effect being higher in SHR cells. These results suggest that the endothelium may modulate sodium pump activity in the underlying smooth muscle by releasing a diffusible compound, which is more active on SHR smooth muscle. The conditioned medium obtained in the presence of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-1-converting enzyme, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and nitric oxide synthase had no effect on the ability of conditioned medium to increase sodium pump activity, suggesting that angiotensin II, endothelin-1, eicosanoids, and nitric oxide are not involved in this stimulatory effect. The nature of the possible endothelial factor involved is still unknown, but it possesses a molecular weight between 25 and 50 kD, is heat stable, and is sensitive to trypsin treatment. We propose it could be a growth factor.", 
    "635": "The antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril administered in doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/d was compared in 207 white patients and 91 black patients with mild to moderate hypertension following a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design. Trandolapril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, trandolapril lowered baseline sitting diastolic pressure in both white and black patients. A comparison of the antihypertensive response of the two populations revealed that the black patients required between two and four times the dose of trandolapril to obtain a response similar to that observed in the white patients. A dose of 1 mg/d trandolapril resulted in a 6.1 mm Hg mean decrease in baseline sitting diastolic pressure for white patients; a similar response (-6.5 mm Hg) was observed in the black patients at 4 mg/d. In contrast to the population differences in blood pressure, the decreases in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were similar for both populations. An evaluation of trandolaprilat levels revealed that there were no racial differences in the trandolaprilat concentrations required to achieve a given degree of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Therefore, it appears that the antihypertensive response of black patients is not completely explained by a reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. The lack of response at a lower dose but increasing response at a higher dose could reflect another vasodepressor activity of trandolapril or just be evidence of reduced sensitivity of high blood pressure in blacks to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "636": "It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may induce a significant regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy not only through blood pressure reduction but also as a possible consequence of growth factor inhibition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril, given either at a hypotensive high dose or a nonhypotensive low dose, on structural and functional alterations of mesenteric resistance arteries and on cardiac mass in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fosinopril was administered in the drinking water from 6 to 12 weeks of age. Rats were killed at 12 weeks, and the ratio of heart weight to body weight was measured. Mesenteric arterioles were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph (Mulvany's technique). Vascular morphology (media-lumen ratio, media thickness) and endothelial function (response to acetylcholine) were then assessed. During the 6 weeks of treatment, systolic pressure in SHR treated with high-dose fosinopril was significantly lower compared with that in untreated SHR, whereas no difference was observed with low-dose fosinopril. In SHR treated with both high-dose and low-dose fosinopril, a statistically significant reduction of vascular structural alterations, in terms of both media-lumen ratio and media thickness, was observed. The ratio of heart weight to body weight was reduced only in SHR treated with high-dose fosinopril. An improvement in the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was observed in SHR treated with high-dose fosinopril compared with untreated SHR, whereas in SHR treated with low-dose fosinopril no improvement in endothelial function was detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

By means of univariate analysis, we studied clinical variables that were present on admission; age; sex; medical history of diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, stable angina, previous MI, cardiac failure, right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation; previous treatment with digoxin, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), antiaggregants or beta-blockers; location and extension of the acute MI, and thrombolysis.

Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in preventing the development of diabetic nephropathy. Incipient glomerular lesions were explored in streptozotocin-diabetic rats at a stage when glomerulosclerosis was not yet established. The modulation of such early glomerular lesions by a new ACE inhibitor (Trandolapril (T) at high or low doses was assessed.",

The rats were killed at 1, 3, and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment. The kidneys were studied using a powerful morphometric technique at optical microscopic level with an image analyzer to measure the following glomerular parameters to assess the development of incipient glomerular lesions: (a) total glomerular surface area, (b) glomerular tuft surface area, (c) mesangial surface area, (d) ratio of the mesangial surface area to the glomerular tuft surface area, and (e) mean thickness of the Bowman's capsule. In parallel, albuminuria was measured.",

They also demonstrated that ACE inhibitor given at a high dose is significantly effective in reducing glomerular hypertrophy and the expansion of the mesangial domain. ACE inhibitor given at a low dose tended to reduce glomerular hypertrophy and the expansion of the mesangial domain. Furthermore, ACE inhibitor at both doses completely abolished the albuminuria increase, maintaining the levels of albuminuria within the range of young nondiabetic rats.",

    "645": "High-density angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) binding is present in heart valve leaflets and the fibrous tissue that appears in the rat myocardium after either chronic administration of angiotensin II (AngII) or after myocardial infarction. This suggests that connective tissue ACE is independent of circulating AngII and that ACE may be an integral component of normal and pathologic tissue repair. To address this possibility the present study was undertaken. We sought to determine whether the ACE inhibitor lisinopril would attenuate fibrous tissue ACE binding and fibrous tissue formation in the myocardium of rats receiving AngII. Three experimental groups were examined: untreated, age-matched controls; rats receiving subcutaneous AngII (150 ng/min) by minipump for 2 weeks; and rats receiving AngII plus oral lisinopril (20 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Cardiac ACE binding density was localized and quantified by in vitro autoradiography with [125I]-labeled 351A, a tyrosyl derivative of lisinopril, while fibrosis was identified by light microscopy in serial sections stained with picrosirius red. Hematoxylin and eosin and anti-fibronectin antibody were used to identify cardiac myocyte necrosis.

    "646": "Dexamethasone (DEX) and captopril are effective drugs in the treatment of radiation nephropathy in experimental animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the relative effectiveness of the two drugs and to see if their combination is more effective than either drug alone. For this purpose both kidneys of 143 rats were exposed surgically and irradiated with 13-20 Gy gamma rays. The surrounding tissues, with the exception of a segment of lumbar cord, were shielded. Each group had free access to acidified drinking water containing either DEX (94 micrograms/l), captopril (500 mg/l), DEX (94 micrograms/l) + captopril (500 mg/l) or drug-free water. Dexamethasone treatment was stopped after 90 days, but animals continued to receive captopril until death. At approximately monthly intervals the animals were weighed and renal function (PUN, hematocrit, 51Cr-EDTA retention) was measured. A side effect of treatment with DEX and DEX+captopril was a reduced increase in body weight. Paralysis of the hind limbs developed in nine animals that received captopril and/or DEX treatment. The classical histological lesions associated with radiation myelopathy were not evident in these paretic rats. It is therefore suggested that paralysis may be attributed in part to drug-induced neurotoxicity in animals with impaired renal clearance. Macroscopically and histologically, nearly all the animals that survived more than 400 days had evidence of renal tumor development. Dexamethasone and/or captopril appear to selectively ameliorate glomerular compared to tubular damage, based on histological findings. All three experimental treatments delayed but did not stop the progression of lethal renal injury as measured by kidney function tests and survival time. Median survival times for nontreated and captopril-, DEX- and DEX+captopril-treated animals exposed to 14.5 to 19.0 Gy kidney irradiation were 175, 242, 261 and 395 days, respectively. The combination of captopril and DEX appears to be at least additive in that the therapeutic effect is equal to or greater than the sum of the therapeutic effect of the individual drugs. Dexamethasone appears to be as effective as or more effective than captopril in delaying renal failure."
