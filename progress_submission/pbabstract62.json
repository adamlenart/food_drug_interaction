The present study evaluated the effects of pH on octanol partitioning, and on the buccal absorption of enalapril and lisinopril, using in vitro techniques and buccal partitioning in human volunteer subjects.", 
    "1": "The partitioning of enalapril and lisinopril into n-octanol was examined over the pH range of 3 9 at room temperature.", 
    "2": "Enalapril exhibited maximal partitioning into the organic phase at pH 4 5; minimal partitioning was recorded at pH values 8 and 9. The partitioning of lisinopril into n-octanol was found to be maximal at pH 9 and minimal at pH 3. Using the buccal absorption technique, the partitioning of enalapril and lisinopril (0.5 mg), was examined in six healthy male volunteers from buffered solutions (pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). In the case of enalapril, lowest buccal partitioning occurred at pH 3, 8 and 9, while maximal partitioning occurred at pH 5; absorption of lisinopril was not extensive at any pH, but was greatest at pH 6. These results, in addition to the n-octanol partition coefficients, indicated that enalapril obeyed the normal lipid partition hypothesis with respect to buccal absorption. The buccal absorption of lisinopril also obeyed the lipid partition hypothesis over the pH range 3-7. These findings are in direct contrast to those for captopril. The buccal partitioning experiments were repeated at the maximal pH for absorption for each angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, but with the addition of cephradine (0.05 mmol x l(-1)).", 
    "3": "The data indicated that the presence of this peptide transport inhibitor had no effect on the buccal absorption of enalapril (0.06 mmol x l(-1)) and lisinopril (0.057 mmol x l(-1)), which suggests that both drugs do not share a common buccal absorption pathway with cephradine.", 
    "4": "While morphologic alteration of parts of the mitral valve apparatus (ventricular wall, papillary muscles, chordae tendineae, valve annulus and leaflets) may result in a loss of its functional integrity (primary mitral regurgitation, MR) mitral annulus dilatation following left ventricular enlargement or change in chamber geometry and consecutive opening of the angle between papillary muscles and valve annulus cause secondary MR. Irrespective of these etiologies MR is chronically progressive and much more than the severity of MR the grade of myocardial adaptation to the chronic volume overload is of prognostic significance. Inadequate myocardial adaptation is demonstrated by an increase of the echocardiographically determined radius (r) to wall thickness (Th) ratio (r/Th > 3.0), indicating increasing left ventricular wall stress or by an insufficient increase of the left ventricular ejection fraction (< or = 5% of resting values) under exercise conditions, e.g. with radionuclide angiocardiography (RNV). Stressecho may replace RNV in the future for this indication. Actually, stress echo is not reliable to determine changes in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest versus exercise because of systematic errors and error reproduction. There are preliminary reports on biochemical markers like noradrenaline or tumor necrosis factor alpha being helpful to determine the breakdown of myocardial adaptation mechanisms. Surgical intervention is indicated in chronic MR irrespective of the hemodynamic severity, if myocardial adaptation is inadequate. If mitral reconstruction, the surgical technique of choice, remains insufficient to restore normal valve function, mitral valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus is unavoidable. For a deceleration of the progressive volume overload in chronic MR for which a surgical intervention is not yet indicated, a long-term afterload reducing medical therapy preferably with long acting ACE-inhibitors seem to be prognostically favorable.", 
    "5": "POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS: Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) can intensify the glucose lowering effect of insulin or sulfonureas. This interaction has been observed in a few clinical cases and studied systematically in regional pharmacovigilance centers. LOW RISK RATE: This interaction occurs in certain patients with well-controlled diabetes who are given a CEI or when CEI dosage is increased. The risk of hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with CEI is very low and can be considered as negligible compared with the benefit of this class of well-tolerated renal-protective antihypertension agents. DRUG DEPENDENT: A larger number of cases of hypoglycemia have been reported with captopril and enalapril, probably because these two CEI have been marketed for a longer period. Captopril may have a stronger hypoglycemia effect than enalapril. It has been demonstrated with hyperinsulin euglycemic clamp that captopril improves sensitivity to insulin in healthy volunteers with normal blood pressure; with enalapril however, the increase in insulin sensitivity is less pronounced and non-significant. AN INDIRECT MECHANISM: Captopril, and to a lesser extent enalapril, indirectly increases insulin sensitivity by increasing circulating kinine which leads to vasodilatation in the muscles and increased glucose uptake in muscle tissue.",

    "7": "Beta-receptor antagonists are widely used for treatment of cardiovascular disease. In addition to direct effects on heart rate and cardiac contractility, recent evidence suggests that beta-receptor antagonists may also modulate the cross talk between the sympathetic nervous system and the cardiac natriuretic peptide system.", 
    "8": "Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and their second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were assessed in addition to anthropometric, hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters in a population-based sample (n = 672), of which 80 subjects used beta-receptor antagonists.", 
    "9": "Compared to subjects without medication, subjects receiving beta-receptor antagonists were characterized by substantially elevated ANP, BNP and cGMP plasma concentrations (plus 32%, 89% and 18%, respectively, p < 0.01 each). Analysis of subgroups revealed that this effect was highly consistent and present even in the absence of hypertension, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy or left ventricular dysfunction. The most prominent increase was observed in a subgroup with increased left ventricular mass index. By multivariate analysis, a statistically significant and independent association between beta-receptor antagonism and ANP, BNP and cGMP concentrations was confirmed. Such an association could not be demonstrated for other antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or diuretics.", 
    "10": "Beta-receptor antagonists appear to augment plasma ANP, BNP and cGMP concentrations. The current observation suggests an important contribution of the cardiac natriuretic peptide system to the therapeutic mechanism of beta-receptor antagonists.", 
    "11": "Patients with heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction are limited in their ability to tolerate exercise. Recent research has demonstrated that it is not a restricted cardiac output which limits exercise but an abnormality in the performance of a more peripheral component in the pathway of delivery of oxygen to the exercising muscles. Deficiencies in peripheral blood flow and skeletal muscle function and an exaggerated sensitivity to exercise-derived metabolic signals lead to early and profound exercise-induced fatigue and dyspnoea, the mechanisms of which we are only now beginning to understand. These findings raise the possibility of improving exercise tolerance by peripherally acting therapies such as exercise training of skeletal muscles in left ventricular dysfunction and chronic heart failure. Training has been shown to improve exercise tolerance at least as much as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in these syndromes; additionally, training improves ventilatory control, skeletal muscle metabolism and autonomic nervous system activity. As yet, the most appropriate forms of exercise therapy are not known nor is how best to choose the most suitable patients for this form of treatment. There is evidence that patients with at least moderate, and possibly severe but stable, heart failure can benefit from exercise rehabilitation, provided it is tailored to the capacity of the patient and certain safety considerations are taken into account.",

    "23": "Twenty patients with coronary artery disease underwent 24-h Holter monitoring for heart rate variability and blood sampling (6 hourly for 24 hours) after three consecutive treatment phases, (firstly with placebo, then bisoprolol, and finally quinapril). The effects on sympathovagal balance, hemostatic variables and the renin-angiotensin system activity were measured.",

Sympathovagal balance showed a sharp increase at approximately the same time but plasma renin activity did not rise until later in the day. Inspection of the 24-h profiles suggested that bisoprolol reduced sympathovagal balance and the morning peak of PAI-1 activity and antigen, with a small increase in tPA activity, although these changes were not significant. Quinapril produced a substantial rise in renin (p = 0.01) but did not significantly affect either PAI-1 or tPA. Sympathovagal balance was unaffected by quinapril.", 
    "25": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril does not affect either sympathovagal balance or the endogenous fibrinolytic system.

    "26": "To determine dose-related clinical and neurohumoral effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of three doses (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) of the long-acting ACE inhibitor imidapril.",

We studied 244 patients with mild to moderate CHF (New York Heart Association class II-III: +/-80%/20%), who were stable on digoxin and diuretics. Patients were treated for 12 weeks, and the main end points were exercise capacity and plasma neurohormones.", 
    "29": "At baseline, the four treatment groups were well-matched for demographic variables. Of the 244 patients, 25 dropped out: 3 patients died, and 9 developed progressive CHF (3/182 patients on imidapril vs. 6/62 patients on placebo, p < 0.05). Exercise time increased 45 s in the 10-mg group (p = 0.02 vs. placebo), but it did not significantly change in the 5-mg (+16 s), and 2.5-mg (+11 s) imidapril group, compared to placebo (+3 s). Physical working capacity also increased in a dose-related manner. Plasma brain and atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p < 0.05 for linear trend), while (nor)epinephrine, aldosterone and endothelin were not significantly affected. Renin increased in a dose-related manner, but plasma ACE activity was suppressed similarly (+/-60%) on all three doses.", 
    "30": "Already within 3 months after treatment initiation, high-dose ACE inhibition (with imidapril) is superior to low-dose. This is reflected by a more pronounced effect on exercise capacity and some of the neurohormones, but it does not appear to be related to the extent of suppression of plasma ACE.", 
    "31": "Since the discovery at the end of the seventies of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), numerous clinical data became available in the indications for which these agents were initialy developed, taking into account the putative role of renin angiotensin system: first in severe hypertension, secondly in moderate hypertension and then in heart failure. At the same time, an increasing interest was raised for \"evidence based medicine\" leading to a change in clinical study design: from clinical documentation of effects based on intermediate end points such as blood pressure, serum lipids, serum electrolytes or physical training capabilities to clear demonstrations through double blind placebo controlled trial with a positive effect on morbi-mortality. This evolution was furthermore stimulated by advances of knowledge on physiopathological mechanisms as well as the emergence of new drugs within this therapeutic class both stimulating clinical research. In that prospective, three examples are obvious: treatment of myocardial infarction, slowing down of the progression of diabetic nephropathy and of chronic renal failure. All these new indications for ACEI were obtained though large morbi-mortality clinical studies which are reviewed in this article. Finally, clinical studies are running with ACEI in order to demonstrate a possible effect on primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbi-mortality in high risk populations results which should be available at the beginning of the next century.", 
    "32": "Several recent studies have provided clear evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors slow the progression of renal disease. These effects are mainly independent from a comitant reduction in systemic blood pressure. Thus, angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts other effects on the kidney which are involved in the loss of renal function. Ang II induces proliferation of cultured mesangial and glomerular endothelial cells. Our group was the first to demonstrate that Ang II stimulates hypertrophy of cultured proximal tubular cells. Ang II stimulates bioactivation and expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in tubular MCT cells. This Ang II-mediated expression of TGF-beta is due to an increase in transcriptional activity. A neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody attenuates the Ang II-induced increase in protein synthesis in MCT cells suggesting that the hypertrophy is mediated by synthesis and activation of endogenous TGF-beta. Proximal tubular cells undergoing Ang II-mediated hypertrophy are arrested in the G1-phase of the cell cycle and express typical G1-phase-associated genes. Induction of such G1-phase-associated early growth response genes have been also described in vivo after infusion of Ang II into the renal artery. This G1-phase arrest depends on the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CdK) inhibitor p27Kip1. p27Kip1 expression is stimulated after incubation of LLC-PK1 cells with Ang II or TGF-beta and binds to cyclin D1-CdK4 complexes, inhibits their kinase activity, and hampers G1-phase exit. Ang II stimulates transcription of collagen type IV in MCT cells. In addition to the classical a1 (IV) chain, a3 (IV) collagen, which has normally a restricted localization in the kidney, is also induced. This stimulation is mediated by endogenous synthesis and autocrine action of TGF-beta because a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody as well as TGF-beta antisense oligonucleotides attenuate Ang II-induced collagen type IV transcription and synthesis. In addition, Ang II exerts immunomodulatory effects on the kidney through the induction of chemokines such as MCP-1 and RANTES. In conclusion, Ang II has emerged as a multifunctional acting as a growth factor and a profibrogenic cytokine, and even having inflammatory properties.", 
    "33": "Conductance of alveolar capillary membrane (DM) and capillary blood volume (VC) are the subcomponents of the pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). In chronic heart failure, stress failure of the membrane provides a mechanism for reduced DM and subsequent impairment of DLCO. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves DLCO in patients with chronic heart failure. This study was aimed at investigating which of the two subcomponents of DLCO is affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Twenty-seven patients with NYHA class II to III chronic heart failure (group 1) and 13 age- and sex-matched normal subjects underwent pulmonary function testing with determination of DM and VC, while receiving placebo and 48 h and 1 and 2 months after starting enalapril treatment (10 mg twice daily). Nine similar patients (group 2) received isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg thrice daily) for a month then enalapril for another month, and underwent pulmonary function testing at 48 h and 1 month after starting treatments. Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in normal controls were not significant in the short- or mid-term. In group 1 patients, the only change observed at 48 h was a reduction in VC (probably due to a decrease in capillary pulmonary pressure). There was a marked increase in DM to a similar extent at 1 and 2 months, resulting in a significant improvement in DLCO despite a decrease in VC. In group 2 patients, nitrates failed to improve DLCO and DM, whereas enalapril was as effective as in group 1. These observations suggest a modulatory effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the membrane function which emerges gradually and persists over time and is probably dissociated from changes in pulmonary capillary pressure and VC. Chronic heart failure disturbs the alveolar capillary interface and increases gas diffusion resistance; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition restores the diffusive properties of the membrane and gas transfer, and protects the lung when the heart is failing.", 
    "34": "An imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide is importantly involved in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. Inflammatory stimuli and risk factors contribute to these alterations. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are commonly used cardiovascular drugs. To clarify the effect of felodipine and ramiprilat on the balance of these free radicals, we stimulated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASCs) with cytokines (human interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, lipopolysaccharide, and/or interferon-gamma) or high glucose in the presence and absence of these compounds. Felodipine, but not ramiprilat, concentration-dependently inhibited cytokine-induced NO production and NO synthase (NOS) mRNA induction. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine also inhibited cytokine-induced NO production and induction of inducible NOS mRNA. Moreover, felodipine inhibited cytokine-induced superoxide production both in the presence and absence of an NOS inhibitor, suggesting that it acted as a superoxide scavenger and not as an inhibitor of inducible NOS induction. High glucose treatment (22 mmol/L for 48 hours) also significantly increased superoxide production in HASCs, and this increase was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by felodipine but not by ramiprilat. These results suggest that felodipine may exert vascular protective effects by suppressing free radical generation in human smooth muscle cells during activation of inflammatory mechanisms and diabetic conditions.", 
    "35": "Increased plasma renin activity (PRA) has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition appears to reduce the risk of recurrent MI in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. These observations may be partially explained by an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and fibrinolytic system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of salt depletion on tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and antigen in normotensive subjects in the presence and absence of quinapril (40 mg BID). Under low (10 mmol/d) and high (200 mmol/d) salt conditions there was significant diurnal variation in PAI-1 antigen and activity and tPA antigen. Morning (8 AM through 2 PM) PAI-1 antigen levels were significantly higher during low salt intake compared with high salt intake conditions (ANOVA, F=5.8, P=0.048). PAI-1 antigen correlated with aldosterone (r=0.56, P<10(-7)) during low salt intake. ACE inhibition significantly decreased 24-hour (ANOVA for 24 hours, F=6. 7, P=0.04) and morning (F=24, P=0.002) PAI-1 antigen and PAI-1 activity (F=6.48, P=0.038) but did not alter tPA antigen. Thus, the mean morning PAI-1 antigen concentration was significantly higher during low salt intake than during either high salt intake or low salt intake and concomitant ACE inhibition (22.7+/-4.6 versus 16. 1+/-3.3 and 16.3+/-3.7 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.05). This study provides evidence of a direct functional link between the RAS and fibrinolytic system in humans. The data suggest that ACE inhibition has the potential to reduce the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events by blunting the morning peak in PAI-1.", 
    "36": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may be an important target for therapy in hypertension, although definitive data in humans are not available. An important question is whether antihypertensive drugs vary in their ability to cause the regression of LVH. Without adequately powered controlled comparisons, meta-analysis provides the best method of assessing the overall results of the numerous smaller published studies. A succession of meta-analyses have indicated a strong relationship between changes in blood pressure and LVH regression. We have reviewed studies conducted for 5 years since the first major meta-analysis. Methodology was found to have improved, and the overall ranking of drug classes according to their effects on LVH regression were: calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and lifestyle changes. Changes from earlier reports may reflect the use of new preparations within some classes of drugs and large studies are required to define whether this will be reflected in clinical outcomes.",

Sequences of 512 R-R intervals, during daytime, afternoon and night-time periods, were taken for an evaluation of spectral analysis (Box-Jenkins method). We then calculated the absolute and percentage power spectral density of the peak centred at 0.10 Hz (low-frequency peak) and at 0.25 Hz (high-frequency peak).", 
    "59": "At baseline, a daytime to night-time decrease in the low-frequency peak was detected in normotensives (P < 0.01) and in hypertensives without LVH (P < 0.01), while no change was observed in hypertensives with LVH. The power spectral density low-frequency peak during the daytime and night-time was significantly greater in hypertensives with LVH than in those without LVH (P < 0.001) and in normotensive subjects (P < 0.001). Fourteen of these patients with LVH were given effective long-term antihypertensive treatment and were studied again 20 days after the treatment had been withdrawn, when blood pressure had increased to pretreatment values. In eight patients showing a reduction in LVH, we found a significant decrease in the power spectral density low-frequency peak and an increase in the high-frequency peak during daytime and night-time in respect to basal conditions, and circadian variations in the spectral indices of heart rate variability were restored. In contrast, in six patients without reversal of LVH, the power spectral density low-frequency peak did not change in respect to basal conditions and remained significantly higher in comparison with the patients with LVH regression.", 
    "60": "A reduction in LVH may be associated with restoration of daytime to night-time cardiac autonomic control, as evaluated by a power spectral analysis of the heart rate.", 
    "61": "The purpose of this study was to assess the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in the development of diabetes-associated mesenteric vascular hypertrophy and in the antitrophic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "62": "Streptozotocin-induced diabetic and control Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril or to no treatment and were killed 1 or 3 weeks after the streptozotocin injection. Blood was collected and mesenteric vessels removed. Mesenteric vascular weight was measured and TGF-beta1 and alpha1 (type IV) collagen messenger (m)RNA levels were analysed by Northern analysis. Immunohistochemical analyses for TGF-beta1 and type IV collagen were also performed.", 
    "63": "The diabetic rats had increased mesenteric vessel weight at 3 weeks but not at 1 week and a concomitant rise in mesenteric TGF-beta1 and in alpha1 (type IV) collagen mRNA levels. Ramipril treatment attenuated mesenteric vessel hypertrophy and prevented the increase in TGF-beta1 and alpha1 (type IV) collagen mRNA levels after 3 weeks of diabetes. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that diabetes was associated with increased TGF-beta1 and type IV collagen protein and extracellular matrix accumulation in mesenteric vessels, and this increase was reduced by ramipril treatment.", 
    "64": "These results support the concept that TGF-beta is involved in the changes associated with diabetic vascular disease, and suggest a mechanism by which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert their antitrophic effects.", 
    "65": "Comparison of patients treated for chronic heart failure at a large hospital with patients included in major treatment studies published during the past ten years yielded important information. The former series was characterised by greater proportions of the elderly and of women than were the series recruited to the often cited ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor studies. Although only patients with systolic dysfunction were recruited to the latter studies, a substantial body of evidence suggests the prevalence of severe heart failure among patients with normal systolic function to increase with increasing age. Thus, as many as 50 per cent of all elderly patients with chronic heart failure may have normal systolic function. In most cases, the heart failure is probably due to diastolic dysfunction, a condition that still lacks both a simple diagnostic procedure and a well-documented treatment.", 
    "66": "Vesnarinone, an inotropic drug, was shown in a short-term placebo-controlled trial to improve survival markedly in patients with severe heart failure when given at a dose of 60 mg per day, but there was a trend toward an adverse effect on survival when the dose was 120 mg per day. In a longer-term study, we evaluated the effects of daily doses of 60 mg or 30 mg of vesnarinone, as compared with placebo, on mortality and morbidity.", 
    "67": "We enrolled 3833 patients who had symptoms of New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less despite optimal treatment. The mean follow-up was 286 days.", 
    "68": "There were significantly fewer deaths in the placebo group (242 deaths, or 18.9 percent) than in the 60-mg vesnarinone group (292 deaths, or 22.9 percent) and longer survival (P=0.02). The increase in mortality with vesnarinone was attributed to an increase in sudden death, presumed to be due to arrhythmia. The quality of life had improved significantly more in the 60-mg vesnarinone group than in the placebo group at 8 weeks (P<0.001) and 16 weeks (P=0.003) after randomization. Trends in mortality and in measures of the quality of life in the 30-mg vesnarinone group were similar to those in the 60-mg group but not significantly different from those in the placebo group. Agranulocytosis occurred in 1.2 percent of the patients given 60 mg of vesnarinone per day and 0.2 percent of those given 30 mg of vesnarinone.", 
    "69": "Vesnarinone is associated with a dose-dependent increase in mortality among patients with severe heart failure, an increase that is probably related to an increase in deaths due to arrhythmia. A short-term benefit in terms of the quality of life raises issues about the appropriate therapeutic goal in treating heart failure.", 
    "70": "In addition to effects on survival, hemodynamics, and exercise capacity, quality of life has become an important outcome of therapy for chronic heart failure. A large clinical trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril reports that certain domains of health-related quality of life (HRQL) have a long-term impact on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function, regardless of symptoms of heart failure at diagnosis. Results of large-scale clinical trials that measured the impact of several different ACE inhibitors on quality of life in these patients suggest benefits of the drugs, but data are confounded by a definite placebo effect. Studies are further confounded by high noncompletion rates for sicker patients, particularly beyond 1 year. Because measurement tools varied and different quality of life domains were evaluated, direct comparison of studies is problematic. Typically, HRQL measurements in patients receiving ACE inhibitors showed small improvement or did not differ significantly from those in placebo-treated patients with long-term follow-up, although short-term trials (< 6 mo) showed some benefit. Moreover, multicenter trials such as SOLVD, V-HeFT II, and ramipril studies indicated that ACE inhibitors do not compromise and may actually improve certain components of quality of life in a large number of patients with chronic heart failure secondary to reduced left ventricular systolic function while having favorable effects on survival, exercise capacity, hemodynamics, or symptoms.", 
    "71": "Although published literature shows a clear relationship between poor patient compliance with antihypertensive medication and failure to achieve blood pressure control, the association between treatment choices and compliance is less clear. Patient behavior in randomized controlled trials differs from that in actual practice; studies of this difference are therefore required to consider real-world evidence. Studies of actual practice have used a variety of measures of patient behavior, which makes comparisons difficult. In addition, they often have mingled patients receiving antihypertensive treatment for the first time and established hypertensive patients--groups that generally have quite different levels of compliance. This article briefly reviews the literature concerning therapeutic choices and patient compliance with hypertensive medications, including a recent study of persistence using treatment data from the provincial health plan of Saskatchewan, Canada. The Saskatchewan analysis was a rigorous examination of actual practice treatment for hypertension, which demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with the highest 1- and 4.5-year persistence rates and the lowest discontinuation rates among calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and diuretics. These findings may hold important implications for physicians when choosing an initial antihypertensive therapy, and point to the potential importance of the excellent safety and tolerability profiles of new antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "72": "Hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic factors contribute to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The presence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for total mortality and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Direct cardiac effects of LVH include an increased risk of developing of congestive heart failure, an increased risk of arrhythmic events, and a reduced coronary flow reserve, promoting myocardial ischemic episodes. In addition, hypertension may promote the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis. The prognostic implications of LVH underscore the importance of diagnostic procedures. The electrocardiogram has a high specificity to identify patients with LVH but the sensitivity is fairly low. Echocardiography provides higher sensitivity and also gives important information, such as the pattern of left ventricular geometry, which is of prognostic importance, and the presence of diastolic dysfunction, which is an early abnormality in the evolution of hypertensive LVH. Reversal of LVH appears to improve prognosis. Reduction of blood pressure is one important component in the regression of LVH. Important quantitative differences exist between drug classes in the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy despite similar antihypertensive effects, suggesting other factors to be of importance in the regression of left ventricular mass. LVH is reduced more by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors than by other antihypertensive drug classes, suggesting an effect on structural myocardial changes beyond that provided by the reduction of blood pressure. Recent data suggest that angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) have quantitatively similar effects on left ventricular mass as do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A comparative trial of the AIIRA irbesartan and the beta-blocker atenolol demonstrated that despite similar reductions in blood pressure, the reductions attained in left ventricular mass with irbesartan were progressive and numerically greater than those attained with atenolol. Taken together, these findings provide circumstantial evidence for an important role of angiotensin II acting on angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors in the development or maintenance of cardiac hypertrophy. Confirmation of the favorable effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AIIRAs on left ventricular mass in larger trials, including those assessing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, will be of major importance in the future treatment of hypertension.", 
    "73": "The number of cases of diabetic nephropathy is increasing, especially among patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is difficult to prevent the occurrence or progression of NIDDM, and current levels of treatment are below standard. According to one study, actuarial 5-year survival rates are only about 38% for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 9% for those with NIDDM receiving renal replacement therapy. Because cardiovascular diseases are responsible for more than half of these deaths, hypertension, as a major contributing factor to cardiac death, is a crucial component in the therapy for such patients. It is well established that lowering blood pressure is an important preventive measure to be taken in patients with diabetic nephropathy; blockade of the renin-angiotensin system offers benefits beyond lowering blood pressure in type I diabetic nephropathy. Two major trials are currently underway to determine the effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists on nephropathy in patients with NIDDM. The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) has already enrolled approximately 85% of the proposed 1650 NIDDM patients to be randomly assigned to placebo, irbesartan or amlodipine. Baseline characteristics of the initial cohort are presented. In light of the well-documented case for blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetes, the potentially superior blockade afforded by angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the superior tolerability of these agents, trials such as the IDNT take on special importance for the treatment of diabetic patients. From these data may come the justification for the belief that angiotensin II receptor antagonists impart greater benefits in the treatment of diabetes than merely their well-documented role in lowering blood pressure.", 
    "74": "The renin-angiotensin system is a widely studied hormonal system that comprises substrate-enzyme interactions, the end result of which is the production of the active peptide angiotensin II. Because angiotensin II affects blood pressure control, sodium and water homeostasis, and cardiovascular function and structure, a great deal of research effort has been directed toward blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II also may be involved in end-organ damage in hypertension, heart failure, and vascular disease.", 
    "75": "At least two subtypes of angiotensin II receptors have been identified, angiotensin type 1 (AT)1 and type 2 (AT2). The AT1 receptor mediates all the known actions of angiotensin II on blood pressure control. Additionally, research has indicated that the AT1 receptor modulates cardiac contractility and glomerular filtration, increases renal tubular sodium reabsorption, and cardiac and vascular hypertrophy. Less is known about the function of the AT2 receptor. Evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor inhibits cell proliferation and reverses the AT1-induced hypertrophy. Indeed, these receptors are thought to exert opposing effects.", 
    "76": "This newly introduced class of drugs is able to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system at the receptor level by specifically blocking the AT1 receptor subtype. These drugs induce a dose-dependent blockade of angiotensin II effects, resulting in reduced blood pressure, urinary protein, and glomerular sclerosis. It is postulated that AT1 receptor antagonists may provide end-organ protection by blocking angiotensin II effects via the AT1 receptor, leaving the AT2 receptor unopposed. Consequently, these agents may reduce the morbidity and mortality that result from myocardial infarction and other conditions resulting from structural alterations in the heart, kidney, and vasculature.", 
    "77": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether the renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) following 5/6 renal mass reduction is due in part to the potentiation of kinins. Three groups of rats with 5/6 renal mass reduction were studied during the 14 weeks following surgery. One group received no therapy (control); the second group was treated from the beginning with the ACEI ramipril (1 mg/kg/day) added to the drinking water, and the last group received ramipril plus a beta2-bradykinin antagonist, HOE 140 (500 microg/kg/day) via osmotic minipumps. Plasma creatinine did not change in any group during the study. Urinary protein excretion rose in the controls from 9.18+/-1.6 to 45.0+/-5.6 mg/24 h at the end of the study. In ramipril group proteinuria was prevented (initial 7.5+/-1.0 and final 8.6+/-0.8 mg/24h). The effect of ramipril was abolished by HOE 140 (initial 11.6+/-2.0 and final 38.9+/-11 mg/ 24 h). The systolic blood pressure of the controls increased from 106+/-2 to 144+/-5 mm Hg at the 14th week. Ramipril abolished the increase in systolic blood pressure. The effect of ramipril was reverted by HOE 140 (initial 108+/-2 and final 140+/-9 mmHg). Control rats had more severe histopathologic changes. Those animals receiving ramipril + HOE 140 displayed less severe glomerular changes, while rats treated only with ramipril had mild alterations. Thus the glomerular injury score was 2.11+/-0.32 for controls, 1.53+/-0.52 for rats treated with ramipril + HOE 140, and 0.06+/-0.04 for rats treated only with ramipril. The glomerular area was 20,886+/-1,410, 19,693+/-2,200 and 14,352+/-3,200 microm2, respectively, for the 3 groups. These results suggest that the protective effect of ACEIs in the development of chronic renal failure is partially mediated by kinins.",

The identity of positive signals in such mass chromatograms was confirmed by comparison of the peaks underlying full mass spectra with the reference spectra recorded during this study. This method allowed detection of therapeutic concentrations of ACE inhibitors (benazepril, enalapril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, trandolapril, their metabolites, or both) and therapeutic concentrations of the AT II antagonist, valsartan, in human urine samples.

Four-week-old SHR were randomly allocated to oral treatment with verapamil (50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), trandolapril (0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), the combination of verapamil (50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) plus trandolapril (0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), or placebo for 4 months. A group of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) control rats received placebo for the same period of time. At the end of the treatment, mean blood pressure was lower in verapamil-trandolapril than in trandolapril SHR, but remained higher than in WKY. Verapamil had no effects on blood pressure. Equivalent reduction in aortic wall hypertrophy was obtained in all treated SHR. Trandolapril and verapamil-trandolapril combination produced a significant reduction of aortic collagen density compared with placebo SHR. Carotid total fibronectin, EIIIA fibronectin isoform and alpha5beta1 integrin, were higher in the media of placebo SHR than in WKY. EIIIA fibronectin isoform and alpha5beta1 integrin were reduced in verapamil-SHR compared with placebo-SHR and normalized in trandolapril and verapamil-trandolapril-SHR compared with WKY. SHR-placebo and SHR treated with either verapamil or trandolapril as single-drug treatment showed a 4-fold increase in total fibronectin compared to the WKY. Only SHR treated with verapamil-trandolapril combination had total fibronectin not significantly different from that of WKY. Carotid arterial distensibility increased only in verapamil-trandolapril treated rats. Multivariate analysis showed arterial distensibility to be negatively correlated to mean blood pressure (P < 0.0001) and total fibronectin (P < 0.01). In conclusion, chronic treatment with the verapamil-trandolapril combination significantly improved in vivo arterial distensibility in SHR. The most important effects of the combination on arterial mechanics compared to those of verapamil or trandolapril alone may have been the consequence of its stronger action on arterial pressure, arterial wall hypertrophy and total fibronectin density. However we suggest that, in addition to the structural effects, complete normalization of blood pressure is necessary to obtain normal arterial distensibility.",

    "112": "Evidence is available from animal and human studies that protein traffic through the glomerular capillary has a pathogenetic role in subsequent renal damage and that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear superior to other drugs in lowering proteinuria and the rate of renal function decline. This study compares the effect of ACE inhibition or angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blockade on urinary protein excretion and renal hemodynamics in 20 patients with IgA glomerulonephritis randomized to receive enalapril (20 mg/d) or irbesartan (100 mg/d) for 28 d in a double-blind study with two parallel groups. This study also evaluated whether addition of indomethacin (75 mg twice a day) to each of the two treatments resulted in a more potent antiproteinuric effect. Enalapril alone reduced total protein excretion (61% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin without changes in GFR and minor elevation in renal plasma flow. Also, patients randomized to receive the AngII receptor antagonist irbesartan for 28 d had lower proteinuria (55% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin at the end of the treatment period with similar renal hemodynamic changes. When indomethacin was added to enalapril treatment, a further significant reduction in urinary proteins and fractional albumin clearance was observed. In patients given irbesartan, the addition of indomethacin further reduced proteinuria and fractional clearance of albumin. The combined therapy with enalapril or irbesartan and indomethacin did not significantly affect GFR and renal plasma flow compared with baseline. These findings indicate that in patients with IgA glomerulonephritis the antiproteinuric effect of blocking AngII activity by either ACE inhibitors or AngII receptor antagonists is potentiated by indomethacin, an effect that occurred without impairment of renal function.",

    "114": "We conducted a 1-year prospective study of all the patients discharged from a tertiary hospital who had been treated for myocardial infarction from January 1 to December 31 1995. Three hundred and eighty surviving patients were consecutively discharged from the hospital. Seventy per cent of patients were treated with aspirin, 45% with beta-blockers, 27% with calcium channel blockers, 26% with ACE inhibitors, 40% with nitrates and 8% with cholesterol-lowering drugs after discharge from the hospital. In primary care, prescription of lipid-lowering drugs increased to 17%, while prescription of beta-blockers decreased to 34%. ACE inhibitor prescriptions at discharge were clearly more common in patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure (57%).",

    "116": "We report a neonate with neonatal hemochromatosis (NH), renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD), and hypocalvaria. NH is a fatal condition of the newborn, characterized by severe idiopathic liver failure of intrauterine onset and siderosis, intra- and extrahepatic, with sparing of the reticuloendothelial system. RTD is characterized by short, abnormally developed cortical tubules that lack proximal tubule differentiation. Although both NH and RTD have been reported as entities with a genetic component, similar findings can be secondary to in utero insults. Hypocalvaria has been reported in association with fetal hypoxia including that secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. This 38-week-old infant died at 8.5 h. The small nodular liver weighed 44 g. Grossly, the kidneys were normal. Hypocalvaria was present. Microscopically, the hepatic parenchyma was distorted by fibrous tracts, proliferation of bile ducts, and abundant iron deposition in hepatocytes. Extrahepatic siderosis in the pancreas, myocardium, and other organs was consistent with NH. Proximal convoluted tubules were not seen on routine stains and markers for proximal tubules were negative. Previous reports have linked NH with RTD and RTD with hypocalvaria. This infant had all three of these rare conditions, which have been hypothesized or shown to be due to genetic factors, hypoxia, or drugs. The etiology in this case is unknown.", 
    "117": "Increasing evidence supports an association between inflammation and plaque rupture. Macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells are a source of cytokines and growth factors, which contribute to ongoing inflammation during atherogenesis. In a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, we evaluated the effect of the ACE inhibitor quinapril on different parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of the plaque, such as the presence of chemokines (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), collagen I, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (PDGF-B). Since nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been implicated in the control of chemokine transcription and cell proliferation, we also investigated its activation and localization in the lesion. Quinapril administration for 28 days caused a down-regulation in arterial expression of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mRNA and protein). However, collagen I expression (mRNA and protein) was not modified. PDGF-B expression was reduced in both the intima and the media. Active NF-kappaB, found in both macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, was also reduced by quinapril. Nevertheless, no significant changes were noted in the mild neointima formation, although a certain trend toward normalization was found in the quinapril-treated group. In conclusion, our results show that quinapril treatment attenuates several parameters associated with inflammation within the atherosclerotic lesions that are controlled by NF-kappaB, although it has no effect on collagen I expression. Both effects could contribute to the stabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque.", 
    "118": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is thought to be the main enzyme to convert antiotensin I to the vasoactive angiotensin II. Recently, in the human heart, it was found that the majority of angiotensin II formation was due to another enzyme, identified as human heart chymase. In the human vasculature however, the predominance of either ACE or non-ACE conversion of angiotensin I remains unclear. 2. To study the effects of ACE- and chymase-inhibition on angiotensin II formation in human arteries, segments of internal mammary arteries were obtained from 37 patients who underwent coronary bypass surgery. 3. Organ bath experiments showed that 100 microM captopril inhibited slightly the response to angiotensin I (pD2 from 7.09+/-0.11-6.79+/-0.10, P<0.001), while 100 microM captopril nearly abolished the response to [pro10] angiotensin I, a selective substrate for ACE, and the maximum contraction was reduced from 83+/-19%-23+/-17% of the control response (P=0.01). A significant decrease of the pD2 of angiotensin I similar to captopril was observed in the presence of 50 microM chymostatin (pD2 from 7.36+/-0.13-6.99+/-0.15, P<0.039), without influencing the maximum response. In the presence of both inhibitors, effects were much more pronounced than either inhibitor alone, and a 300 times higher dose was needed to yield a significant contraction response to angiotensin I. 4 These results indicate the presence of an ACE and a non-ACE angiontensin II forming pathway in human internal mammary arteries.", 
    "119": "Arterial rings were prepared from the branchial artery, coeliac artery and ventral aorta of the Japanese dogfish Triakis scyllia and used to determine arterial contraction in a myograph. Noradrenaline caused a dose-dependent contraction (10(-9)-3 x 10(-6) M) that was completely inhibited by pre-treatment with 10(-7) M phentolamine. Homologous dogfish angiotensin II (ANG II) ([Asn1, Pro3, Ile5]-ANG II) also caused dose-dependent contraction (10(-9)-3 x 10(-6) M), but phentolamine had no effect on this response. Administration of dogfish angiotensin I (ANG-I) ([Asn1, Pro3, Ile5, Gln9]-ANG I) resulted in a contraction similar to that produced by ANG II and the effect could be blocked with 10(-7) M captopril. The mammalian ANG II receptor antagonists [Sar1, Ile8]-ANG II and [Sar1, Ala8]-ANG II caused dose-dependent contractions of coeliac artery rings, but were less potent than homologous ANG I and ANG II. These results show that the contractile effect of [Asn1, Pro3, Ile5]-ANG II is not mediated by the alpha-adrenergic system and contractions of arterial rings by noradrenaline and elasmobranch ANG II are mediated by separate vascular receptors. The elasmobranch ANG II vascular receptor may have co-evolved with the unusual structure of this peptide.", 
    "120": "Erythropoietin (EPO) therapy is a common and effective treatment for the correction of anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease. Simultaneous treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the control of hypertension and/or heart failure is often necessary. Recent reports in the literature have raised concern about a potential interaction between these drugs, with a resultant decreased EPO efficacy.", 
    "121": "To investigate whether this interaction occurs in chronic dialysis patients, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 175 patients receiving chronic dialysis. All study patients were treated with EPO for at least 3 months, and had normal iron indices. Patients were treated with ACE inhibitors for at least 3 months, at a constant daily dose for at least 1 month (group 1, n = 32), or did not receive ACE inhibitors (group 2, n = 143). Patients with infections or overt iron deficiency were excluded. Total weekly EPO doses and hematocrit (Hct)/hemoglobin (Hgb) values in the two groups were compared. Variables known to affect response to EPO were compared, including ferritin, transferrin saturation, dialysis dose and serum aluminum.",

The achieved Hct was 32.1 +/- 4.4% (group 1) and 30.5 +/- 4.0% (group 2) (p = 0.079). Similarly, Hgb, ferritin, transferrin saturation, Kt/V, and serum aluminum were not different. The dose or duration of ACE inhibitor therapy did not affect Hgb or Hct. Thus, ACE inhibitor therapy does not appear to affect response to EPO in chronic dialysis patients.",

However, similar to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, enalapril caused a 42% increase in renal cortical ATP citrate lyase activity. When given to humans, enalapril significantly decreased urinary citrate excretion and urine citrate concentration by 12% and 16%, respectively, without affecting plasma pH or electrolytes.", 
    "126": "Enalapril decreases urinary citrate in rats and humans. This is due, at least in part, to increases in cytosolic citrate metabolism through ATP citrate lyase in rats similar to that seen with chronic metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. The effects of enalapril on urinary citrate and renal cortical ATP citrate lyase occur independently of acidosis or hypokalemia but may be due to intracellular acidosis that is common to all three conditions.",

In smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, the angiotensin II synthesized by ACE increases mRNA expression and the activity of PAI-1, which promotes antifibrinolysis and the accumulation of extracellular matrix. Therefore, ACE and PAI-1 polymorphisms may have a synergistic effect on diabetic nephropathy and macroangiopathy.",

    "129": "Advanced diabetic nephropathy, defined as impaired renal function and diabetic retinopathy, was present in 98 patients. Manifest macrovascular diseases, confirmed by both clinical signs and physical and laboratory examinations, were present in 56 patients. There was no significant difference in the genotype distribution of ACE or PAI-1 polymorphisms between subjects with advanced nephropathy and those with normal renal function. There was no significant difference in the renal survival rate between patients with differing ACE or PAI-1 genotypes. Subjects with macroangiopathy had a higher frequency of the DD genotype than those without macroangiopathy. Subjects with both DD and 4G4G genotypes had a higher incidence of macroangiopathy than those with any other pair of genotypes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was no association between ACE or PAI-1 polymorphisms and diabetic nephropathy. The ACE DD genotype and its interaction with the PAI-1 4G4G genotype and the presence of advanced diabetic nephropathy were positively associated with macrovascular disease.", 
    "130": "These results indicate that the ACE DD genotype and its interaction with the PAI-1 4G4G genotype are independent risk factors for macroangiopathy, but not for the progression of diabetic nephropathy in NIDDM patients, and that the genotyping of PAI-1 and ACE polymorphisms, especially in patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy, may be useful for predicting and preventing macroangiopathy-related events.",

    "133": "Both enalapril and losartan reduced TGF-beta overproduction in a dose-dependent manner, showing a moderate reduction at doses known to control blood pressure in renal forms of hypertension. A maximal reduction in TGF-beta expression of approximately 45% was seen for both drugs starting at 100 mg/liter enalapril and 500 mg/liter losartan, with no further reduction at doses of enalapril up to 1000 mg/liter or losartan up to 2500 mg/liter. Co-treatment with both drugs was not superior to single therapy. Consistent with our hypothesis that reduction in TGF-beta expression is a valid target, other disease measures, including glomerular matrix accumulation, glomerular production and mRNA expression of the matrix protein fibronectin and the protease inhibitor plasminogen-activator-inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) closely followed TGF-beta expression.",

    "135": "The degree of involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in endothelial dysfunction was investigated by using a one-kidney, one-clip (1K,1C) model of renal hypertension. Male Wistar rats received 0.02% enalapril, 0.02% losartan, or tap water for 1 day before and for 48 h after the induction of renal artery stenosis or sham operation. The aorta of 1K,1C rats showed increased contraction and decreased relaxation responses produced by norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively, vs. control responses. Exposure to 10(-5) mol/l NG-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate augmented the contractile responses to norepinephrine to a greater extent in control rats than in the 1K,1C rats. The increased contraction and decreased relaxation responses to these agonists in the 1K,1C rats were normalized by enalapril or losartan. The addition of HOE-140 to the bath did not alter these normalized responses. Results suggest that angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction and reduces nitric oxide levels in 1K,1C rats. Such endothelial dysfunction enhanced the norepinephrine-induced contraction during the early-stage hypertension in 1K,1C rats.", 
    "136": "Plaque disruption promoted by local inflammation and oxidative stress seem to be the triggering mechanisms of acute coronary syndromes. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) play a key role in this inflammatory process. Within the inflammatory region, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) accumulation has been described, leading to enhanced production of local angiotensin II which stimulates adhesion molecule expression and increases oxidative stress (leading to excessive degradation of EDNO). According to recent clinical trials, drugs like statins or ACE inhibitors seem promising and could stabilize the plaque, probably by attenuation of the inflammatory process. Finally, as thrombus formation also plays a role in these acute coronary syndromes, another approach may be the use of antithrombotic therapy.", 
    "137": "Autonomic nervous system function in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), especially those with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN), displays an abnormal circadian pattern compared to normal subjects; this probably plays an important role in the onset of acute cardiovascular syndromes, which display a similar pattern of occurrence with a blunted late morning peak, and an increase of episodes during the night, in comparison to non-diabetic subjects. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, on the circadian pattern of heart rate variability (HRV), a reliable index of sympathovagal interactions, in patients with definite DAN.", 
    "138": "Normalised HRV frequency domain indices [high frequency power (HFP), reflecting vagal tone, low frequency power (LFP), reflecting both vagal and sympathetic (predominantly) modulation, and their ratio (LFP/HFP), indicative of sympathovagal balance] were assessed in 60 patients with DAN at baseline and one year after therapy with quinapril (n = 30), or placebo (n = 30) on a 24-hour 2-channel electrocardiogram with a solid state Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) and patients with DM without DAN (n = 30), were used as controls. The baseline circadian variation of fractional normalised power in DAN patients was abolished, with pronounced dominance of LFP over HFP during the whole 24-hour period. After one year of treatment, quinapril increased HFP, decreased LFP and improved their ratio, in the morning (07.00 a.m. to 15.00 p.m.) and night (23.00 p.m. to 07.00 a.m.) time intervals, with maximal effect in the night time interval (HFP = 20%, LFP = -8%, LFP/HFP = -31%; for all comparisons p < 0.05 vs baseline values and p < 0.001 vs one year of placebo).", 
    "139": "Quinapril increased HFP and decreased LFP as well as their ratio, all indicative of sympathetic predominance reduction, in patients with DAN at time intervals these indices were most adversely affected (morning and night). Since autonomic function is an important contributor in the pathogenesis of acute coronary events, malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, improvement of indices related to autonomic function in DAN patients in these time intervals may prove beneficial in clinical practice.",

    "147": "Drosophila melanogaster express two distinct angiotensin-I-converting enzymes (ACEs) called Ance and Acer, which display a high level of primary structure similarity. We have expressed Acer in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified the recombinant enzyme with a view to developing biochemical tools to distinguish between Acer and Ance. Purified Acer and Ance expressed in yeast were used to raise anti-Acer Ig and anti-Ance Ig that specifically cross-reacted with the respective enzyme on immunoblotting, but did not act as specific inhibitors. Acer cleaves the C-terminal dipeptides from benzoylglycyl-histidyl-leucine and [Leu5]enkephalin, and Acer and Ance are both able to act as endopeptidases, releasing the C-terminal dipeptideamide from [Leu5]enkephalinamide. However, Acer hydrolyses this substrate at a slightly faster rate than [Leu5]enkephalin, whereas Ance hydrolyses the peptide with a free C-terminus with a kcat 15-fold higher than [Leu5]enkephalinamide. In addition, Acer did not cleave angiotensin I. In contrast, Ance hydrolysed 25% of this substrate at an 8-fold lower enzyme concentration. Furthermore, Acer did not hydrolyse the synthetic substrates Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Arg-Arg and Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Lys-Arg, two partially processed putative locustamyotropin precursors, under conditions where Ance produced 82% substrate hydrolysis. Acer was inhibited by captopril, trandolaprilat and enalaprilat, with apparent Ki values in the nanomolar range, whereas lisinopril and fosinoprilat were less potent. We show that the two Drosophila ACEs are alternatively expressed in stages P1 (white puparium)-P15 (eclosion) of pupal development; Ance is expressed predominantly during stages P4-P7, whereas the ACE activity expressed during stages P9-P12 is mainly due to Acer suggesting different roles for the two enzymes during pupal development.", 
    "148": "Red blood cells usually replenish their ATP pools by glycolysis, fueled by glucose imported via the cell membrane. Mature red cells of some species (e.g. pig, chicken) have, however, been reported to show very low glucose transport. The subject of this study was the possible dependency of the level of a key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAD) on glucose transporter activity during the maturation of chicken red cells. The chicken pronormoblast cell line, HD3, was used as a model system. These cells contain higher levels of GAD and glucose transporter activities than normal chicken bone marrow cells, but reduce their levels during maturation. In an attempt to assess whether the decrease in GAD activity is regulated by the glucose transport, the chicken GLUT3 expressed under the control of viral promoter was introduced into HD3 cells by retroviral infection (pDOL-cGT3). Upon cell differentiation and maturation, both cells with and without the exogenous transporter decreased GAD activity. Butyric acid did not affect the regulation of GAD activity upon differentiation. These results show that the development of chicken red cells is manifested by reduction of their GAD activity and that this is not affected by their sugar transporter activity. The very low GAD activity in embryonic chicken red cells is thus due to a loss of this activity at an early stage in their development. Because of the very low glucose transport and GAD activities in mature chicken red cells, rates of glycolysis are likely to be low and suggesting an alternative pathway for ATP production in these cells.", 
    "149": "Normal blood pressure is a good marker of graft survival after renal transplantation, and effective antihypertensive treatment reduces the progression of graft damage. We conducted a long-term follow-up study of 88 hypertensive renal transplant recipients, all of whom were taking sustained cyclosporine A (CsA) immunosuppression. The patients were treated for at least three years, and initially received 240 mg/day of verapamil (N = 24, group I), 5 mg/day of enalapril (N = 24, group II) or 1 mg/day of doxazosin (N = 40, group III). Baseline creatinine did not differ in the three groups, but proteinuria was higher in the enalapril group (7 patients had proteinuria > 1.5 g/day). Treatment was withdrawn in 5 patients in the verapamil group, 5 in the enalapril group and 2 in the doxazosin group due to drug-related side effects. Blood pressure (BP) control at three years was equivalent in the three groups (systolic BP, group I 157 +/- 12; group II 149 +/- 19; group III 154 +/- 21; diastolic BP, group I 90 +/- 8.7, group II 84 +/- 9.8, group III 90.5 +/- 16; mean BP, group I 113 +/- 7, group II 106 +/- 10, group III 106 +/- 29). Two patients in group I, 3 in group II and 15 in group III required additional antihypertensive drugs. CsA levels increased in the verapamil-treated patients, allowing for an early decrease in CsA doses (1 year doses, 3.3 +/- 1 mg/kg body wt/day in group I, 4.3 +/- 1.6 in group II, 3.7 +/- 1.6 in group III). Six cardiovascular events occurred, 3 in group I, 1 in group II, and 2 in group III patients. One patient died in the enalapril group and another in the doxazosin group. Eight verapamil-treated patients, 8 enalapril-treated patients and 4 doxazosin-treated patients lost their grafts due to biopsy-proven chronic transplant nephropathy. In conclusion, the three antihypertensive agents are effective in reducing blood pressure, with no clear advantage of one above any other. Verapamil allows the CsA dose to be reduced, thus decreasing the cost of immunosupression. Enalapril can be a more effective antiproteinuric agent, but hyperkalemia or impaired allograft function may occur in patients with non-optimal allograft function. Doxazosin offers an excellent safety and efficacy profile, and when not efficient by itself in controlling blood pressure, is an ideal concomitant agent in hypertensive renal transplant patients.", 
    "150": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of dialysis patients with high blood pressure, however, they also have been associated with anaphylactoid reactions at the start of dialysis, when they have been used concomitantly with AN69 membranes. A multicenter, open six-month study was designed to test the tolerability and efficacy of losartan as antihypertensive in patients under hemodialysis (HD), with particular emphasis on the appearance of anaphylactoid reactions. HD patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels > or = 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 90 mm Hg, previously nontreated, treated but uncontrolled, or treated with a poor tolerability, were included. The study performed three controls: baseline, at month 3, and at study completion. DBP and SBP levels were measured on the six HD sessions previous to the three visits in addition to biochemical and hematology measurements. Four hundred and six patients were included. The mean age was 55 years, 42% were women, and 23.6% of the patients were dialyzed with AN69 membranes. There was a significant reduction in pre- and postdialysis SBP and DBP at three and six months. Fifteen patients discontinued the study due to adverse reactions related to losartan, and in seven of them the adverse reaction was hypotension. Only two patients have reported a possible anaphylactoid reaction on treatment with AN69, in one of them the HD session had to be stopped and losartan was discontinued. On the contrary, nine patients with a history of previous anaphylactoid reaction, with ACEIs and AN69, have not shown this complication with losartan and AN69. We conclude that losartan is a well tolerated antihypertensive by HD patients, with a very low incidence of adverse reactions, and a lower prevalence of anaphylactoid reactions than those detected with ACEIs and AN69.", 
    "151": "There is a clear relationship between hypertension and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Genetic predisposition to hypertension has been correlated to the risk of diabetic nephropathy in type I diabetes, and hypertension is a well known risk factor for developing nephropathy in patients with type II diabetes. Multiple studies have emphasized the importance of hypertension on renal disease progression, and blood pressure control with conventional antihypertensive drugs slows the rate of renal function loss in diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, evidence of the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on progression of renal damage has focused much interest on the therapeutic action of the RAS blockade. In patients with type I diabetes, blocking the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevents progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy, and in overt nephropathy decreases the gradual loss of renal function beyond its blood pressure lowering effect. Less clinical information is available in type II diabetic nephropathy, but our experience and some recent studies suggest that ACE inhibitors also have a renoprotective action in type II diabetes. The role of calcium channel blockers in diabetic nephropathy is not clear. Several short-term studies with the first generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonists showed a lower effect on urinary albumin excretion and a more rapid progression to renal failure than with ACE inhibitors. However, other calcium channel blockers, particularly of the non-dihydropyridine type, have been shown to have a beneficial effect on diabetic nephropathy, decreasing proteinuria and slowing progression.", 
    "152": "Cardiovascular events are the main cause of death in patients with chronic renal failure who are treated with hemodialysis. Hypertension is frequent among dialysis patients and may be a major cause of mortality, although epidemiological studies are controversial in this regard. This disparity in results may be the consequence of an inadequate definition of hypertension in dialysis patients as well as the interaction with hypertension with other risk factors such as malnutrition or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which are strong predictors of death. Although the goal of blood pressure in dialysis has not been established yet, it seems that predialysis blood pressure levels lower than 150/90 mm Hg must be achieved for patients to avoid complications. LVH is very frequent among dialysis patients and starts early in the progression of chronic renal failure. Hypertension is the main cause for its development, but other potentially reversible factors such as anemia, volume overload, secondary hyperparathyroidism, dose of dialysis or malnutrition may also be implicated. Hence, an adequate management of patients on hemodialysis must include the strict control of blood pressure, preferably with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, together with those early measures in order to avoid the development of the other causes of LVH or to treat them when they already exist.", 
    "153": "In patients with terminal renal failure, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is extremely common. It is found in approximately 60 to 80% of patients starting renal replacement therapy. The main causes of LVH are increased preload from hypervolemia and increased afterload from increased peripheral resistance, giving rise to a mixture of eccentric and concentric hypertrophy, but other factors (high cardiac output from anemia and arteriovenous (A-V) fistula, altered compliance of central arteries, and activation of local systems such as renin and endothelin) also play a role. The clinical importance of LVH derives from the fact that LVH is a predictor of cardiac death in dialyzed patients independent of blood pressure. LVH is accompanied by microvascular disease and by marked interstitial fibrosis (more than seen in non-renal patients with similar degrees of hypertension). Recent findings suggest that LV remodeling starts early and is seen even in normotensive patients with glomerulonephritis when GFR is still normal. The strategies to reduce LVH include reduction of hypervolemia, (near) normalization of hemoglobin and lowering of blood pressure, particularly by administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "154": "Data provided by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) registries document a progressive and striking increase in the incidence of hypertension-related ESRD over the years, and its prevalence supports the classic statement that the kidney may be a victim of hypertension. Two clinical conditions should be considered separately when the role of hypertension in progressive renal disease is discussed: (a) hypertension and primary renal disease and (b) progressive renal disease in essential hypertension. The appearance of systemic hypertension is one of the major risk factors for the progressive deterioration of primary renal disease both in experimental models and in humans. Strict blood pressure control is able to significantly reduce the disease progression to renal failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors probably show a better nephroprotective action than other antihypertensive agents. Long-lasting hypertension may induce ESRD in some patients through hypertensive nephrosclerosis. In many cases of progressive renal disease associated with essential hypertension, particularly in elderly Caucasians, atheromatous renovascular disease via renal artery stenosis and/or cholesterol microembolization represent the main cause of ESRD.", 
    "155": "The adaptive changes that accompany hypertension and involve the kidney, heart, and vessels, namely, muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, endothelial dysfunction and extracellular matrix increase can, in fact, be maladaptive and eventually lead to end-organ disease, such as renal failure, heart failure, and coronary disease. However, these changes vary markedly between individuals with similar levels of hypertension. Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous vasodilator and inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle and mesangial cell growth, is synthesized in the endothelium by a constitutive NO synthase (NOS). NO antagonizes the effects of angiotensin II on vascular tone and growth and also down-regulates the synthesis of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptors. In hypertension, the physiologic response to the increased shear stress and cyclic strain is to upregulate NOS activity in endothelial cells. Upregulation of vascular NOS activity is a homeostatic adaptation to the increased hemodynamic workload that may help in preventing end-organ damage. Indeed, hypertension-prone salt-sensitive rats manifest a decrease (instead of an increase) in vascular NOS activity when hypertensive; these rats develop severe vascular hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal injury. Studies in hypertensive humans suggest that, independent of the effects of salt on blood pressure, salt sensitivity may be a marker for susceptibility to the development of endothelial dysfunction as well as cardiovascular and renal injury. We hypothesize that in hypertension, recognition of markers of cardiovascular susceptibility to injury and the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved may open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. In this context, only those antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure and concomitantly restore the homeostatic balance of vasoactive agents such as angiotensin II and NO within the vessel wall would be effective in preventing or arresting end-organ disease.",

A total of 883 patients were randomized either to the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (CA) isradipine (2.5-5 mg twice a day) or to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg twice a day) and followed in double-blind fashion for 3 years.", 
    "158": "Both treatment groups had achieved comparable control of diastolic blood pressure, and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the glycemia indices, either at baseline or during follow-up. However, the excess isradipine events were noted to be clustered among those patients with elevated baseline levels of HbA1c who also experienced greater blood pressure reductions during follow-up.",

    "168": "Good glycemic control with metformin may reduce overall mortality in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (number need to treat [NNT] = 14 for 10 years), and improved blood pressure control reduced diabetes-related mortality (NNT = 15 for 10 years); improved glycemic control with agents other than metformin, or with combinations including metformin, does not reduce diabetes-related or overall mortality. Major cardiovascular events (CVE) in type 2 diabetes can be prevented by control of blood pressure with low-dose diuretics, atenolol, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (NNT = 10 to 20 for 5 to 10 years for primary prevention of one CVE); by use of aspirin (NNT = 45 for 5 years for primary prevention of one CVE); and by use of simvastatin to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (NNT = 6 for 5 years for secondary prevention of one CVE). Glycemic control (NNT = 19 for 10 years) and hypertension control (NNT = 6 for 10 years) slow the progression of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Retinopathy and nephropathy are more preventable than neuropathy. The benefits of glycemic control are less for patients with shorter life expectancy and are greater for those with the highest levels of Hb A1c because larger Hb A1c improvements can be achieved in such patients. Periodic screening of patients for eye, kidney, and foot complications is supported because effective early treatment of these complications is available.", 
    "169": "In patients with type 2 diabetes, control of hypertension reduces microvascular and macrovascular complications more than glycemic control does. Control of LDL cholesterol with statins, aspirin, and smoking cessation reduce major cardiovascular events. Metformin reduces overall mortality in obese patients with creatinine levels < 1.5 mg/dL. Glycemic control reduces microvascular complications. The evidence supports angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, atenolol, or low-dose diuretics for blood pressure control. Effective treatment of eye, kidney, and foot complications is available, and regular screening for these complications is justified.",

Preoperative ejection fraction, medications, and perioperative hemodynamics were recorded, and postbypass serum arginine vasopressin levels were measured. Vasodilatory shock was defined as a mean arterial pressure lower than 70 mm Hg, a cardiac index greater than 2.5 L/min/m2, and norepinephrine dependence. Predictors of vasodilatory shock were investigated by logistic regression analysis. The hemodynamic responses of patients who received arginine vasopressin infusions for vasodilatory shock after cardiopulmonary bypass for left ventricular assist device placement or heart transplantation were analyzed retrospectively.",

By multivariate analysis, an ejection fraction lower than 0.35 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use were independent predictors of postbypass vasodilatory shock (relative risks of 9.1 and 11.9, respectively). Vasodilatory shock was associated with inappropriately low serum arginine vasopressin concentrations (12.0 +/- 6.6 pg/mL). Retrospective analysis found 40 patients with postbypass vasodilatory shock who received low-dose arginine vasopressin infusions, resulting in increased mean arterial pressure and decreased norepinephrine requirements.",

Following another 4-week wash-out period, patients were crossed to the alternative regimen for further 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and of the active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured (by standard mercury sphygmomanometer, Korotkoff I and V) and insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 min of clamp and total glucose requirement (TGR) were evaluated.",

GIR, used as an indicator of insulin sensitivity, was significantly increased by lisinopril (+1.5 mg min(-1) kg(-1), P<0.05 vs baseline) but not by losartan (+0.42 mg min(-1) kig(-1), NS), the difference between the two drugs being statistically significant (P<0.05). TGR was increased by lisinopril (+7.3 g, P<0.05 vs baseline), whereas losartan did not significantly modify it (+1.9 g, NS).",

    "178": "Diabetic nephropathy has become the single most important cause of endstage renal failure in most countries of the Western world. Against this background, the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its blockade command considerable interest. In diabetic patients and in diabetic animals, the circulating components of the RAS are suppressed. Although the evidence is not completely uniform, there are indirect arguments (renal hemodynamic response to RAS blockade, AT1 receptor expression), however, which would be consistent with increased intrarenal action of angiotensin (ANG) II. There is solid evidence that ACE inhibitors effectively interfere with progression of micro-albuminuria both in IDDM and NIDDM. They also prevent progression of advanced renal failure in IDDM, while there is only preliminary evidence in this respect for NIDDM. ACE inhibitors are superior to conventional antihypertensive agents (with the possible exception of some calcium channel blockers), but such superiority is seen only when the levels of blood pressure are relatively high. In diabetic animals, treatment with ANG II receptor blockers interferes with the development of glomerular lesions. In acute and subacute studies on diabetic patients, ANG II receptor blockers reduced albuminuria (or proteinuria) more than beta-blockers. Head-on comparison of equipotent doses ACE inhibitors and ANG II receptor blockers in non-diabetic patients produced equal reductions in proteinuria. The long-term effects of ANG II receptor blockers on progression of advanced diabetic nephropathy is the object of two large international studies. The results will not be available before the year 2000.", 
    "179": "Ventricular remodeling following nonfatal myocardial infarction includes an excentric hypertrophy of the surviving myocardium, associated with hemodynamic overload. Disseminated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and phenotype changes of the surviving myocardium, such as a labile calcium homeostasis of the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, impaired beta-adrenergic signal transduction, interstitial fibrosis, and reduced coronary reserve are typical features of the overloaded, distended ventricular wall. They are considered as relevant for the myocardial dysfunction progressing to overt cardiac failure and for the enhanced mortality risk. Hemodynamic load and trophic angiotensin effects are assumed to cause this excentric hypertrophy, since systemic and local angiotensin formation in the overloaded myocardium is activated. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, cultured on distensible membranes, overload is mimicked by distension, and causes enhanced formation and release of angiotensin II, which results in AT1 receptor mediated trophic reactions of distended neonatal cardiomyocytes and in AT1-mediated apoptosis in distended adult cardiomyocytes. In experimental models of postinfarct remodeling, therapy with ACE inhibition or with AT1 blockade similarly normalizes myocardial hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and impaired coronary reserve. In patients with terminal heart failure, a reduction of apoptotic signs and a normalization of antiapoptotic gene expression is obtained by myocardial unloading under ventricular assist devices or by treatment with ACE inhibitors, and the latter therapy has been shown to improve survival. In contrast to general assumptions and to predictions from data in vitro, the improvements obtained by AT1 blocker therapy in vivo are mediated by bradykinin, as are those obtained under ACE inhibitors. Under AT1 blockade, bradykinin is probably activated due to stimulation of AT2 and other AT receptors.", 
    "180": "Tolerability and not efficacy is the limiting factor for long-term successful antihypertensive treatment. Since the discontinuation rate of first line antihypertensives may be as high as 50-60% over six months, it is important to develop new agents with an improved efficacy/tolerability ratio. Candesartan cilexetil is particularly promising in this respect. Candesartan is a potent and selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker that binds selectively and tightly (insumontable binding) to the receptor. Candesartan is not associated with any increased risk of cough or angiodema. It is an orally effective vasodilator that does not cause reflex tachycardia or first dose hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. In the dose range from 4-16 mg, once daily candesartan cilexetil is not associated with any dose-dependent adverse events and it is equally well tolerated in men and women and by older (> 65 years) and younger (< 65 years) patients. Furthermore, the drug has no adverse effect on glucose homeostasis or plasma lipid profile. In a double-blind comparison with losartan 50 mg od, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg once daily was significantly more effective in lowering the diastolic blood pressure at the end of the 24 h dose interval but was equally well tolerated. In meta-analyses of clinical trials, candesartan cilexetil showed a tolerability profile comparable to that of placebo therapy.", 
    "181": "Most antihypertensives have advantages and disadvantages. The ideal antihypertensive drug should be effective in lowering blood pressure, well tolerated, safe in the long term, and easy to use. Ideally, it should be relatively inexpensive. Most importantly it should reduce the risk of the adverse effects of high blood pressure, such as myocardial infarction, sudden death, stroke, heart failure, renal damage, and retinal changes. Most antihypertensive drugs effectively reduce blood pressure, are available as once daily preparations, and are safe long-term. Unfortunately, most antihypertensive drugs cause adverse effects in some patients and for few drugs is there good evidence that they protect the heart, the brain, the kidney, and the eye? Reducing the effects of Angiotensin II (using an ACE inhibitor) has been shown to reduce the incidence of coronary events, sudden death, heart failure, renal damage, and fundal changes. AT1 blocking drugs offer the same pharmacological advantages but also very good tolerability, in particular no cough. Therefore, they have the potential to meet all the criteria for an ideal antihypertensive drug.", 
    "182": "The cardiac renin angiotensin system (RAS) is the target for number of therapeutic interventions which proved successful in heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors belong to the most efficient strategies available and angiotensin receptor (ATR) antagonists may be comparably effective. The direct myocardial effects of both classes of substances depend on the cardiac ANG II receptors. Both subtypes, AT1 and AT2, are expressed in the human heart. AT1 is localized on myocytes, non-myocytes, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, nerve endings, and conduction tissues. AT2 has so far been found in fibrous tissue and endothelial cells. AT1 mediates myocyte hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, smooth muscle cell growth, endothelial adhesion molecule expression, and catecholamine synthesis. AT1 is downregulated in cardiac failure as well as in the hypertrophied transplanted heart, indicating that a 50% loss of AT1 does not impede cardiac hypertrophy. In heart failure therapy, AT1 antagonists differ from ACE inhibitors by their inhibition of the degradation of bradykinin. Bradykinin has a number intrinsic effect including vasodilation, proinflammatory actions, and modulation of fibrous tissue synthesis. In addition to bradykinin, the functional role of AT2 seems crucial for the therapeutic differences of AT1 antagonists versus ACE inhibitors.", 
    "183": "The behavior of the circulating renin-angiotensin system is well known; however, the actions of renin and the generation of angiotensin (ANG) II at the tissue level are less appreciated. We have used rat models to study this issue. We examined the cleavage of human angiotensinogen to ANG I by human renin and its inhibition by a human renin inhibitor in an isolated perfused hindlimb preparation from rats which express the human angiotensinogen gene. With this model, we were able to show that renin acts at the site of the vascular wall, rather than in the lumen, to generate ANG I, which is subsequently converted to ANG II. Furthermore, the cleavage is specifically dependent on renin and not on other lysosomal proteases. The renin gene is present in the vascular wall; however, whether or not renin is generated locally to act locally, or whether renin is taken up from the circulation to act locally was not clear. We used the same strain of transgenic rats to test this issue and showed that renin can be taken up by cardiac or coronary vasculature tissue and induces long-lasting local ANG II generation. Locally formed ANG I was converted to ANG II more effectively than infused ANG I. We did additional studies to examine the conversion step from ANG I to ANG II in the vessel wall. We perfused hindlimbs from Sprague-Dawley rats with ANG I and observed ANG II production, which was linear over a 10,000-fold concentration range of ANG I. However, when we increased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression in the vascular bed, which also increased ACE tissue concentrations, we were nevertheless able to demonstrate increased ANG II production with ACE upregulation. Taken together, these results demonstrate (1) the cleavage of local angiotensinogen to ANG I within the vascular wall by renin, (2) renin uptake from the circulation to evoke that local effect, and (3) a potential regulatory effect by vascular tissue ACE on ANG II production in the vessel wall. The findings support the notion of localized renin-angiotensin system-related effects on vascular function and structure.", 
    "184": "The aim of this study was to identify the similitudes and the differences in the epidemiology and prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents by analysis of trials of primary and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. The principal risk factors common to both pathologies are hypertension, smoking and increased LDL-cholesterol. However, the statistical significance with respect to causality differs from one pathology to the other. Similarly, the impact of preventive measures is not the same: the treatment of hypertension is more important in the prevention of cerebrovascular accidents than myocardial infarction; the situation is the other way around with respect to the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Of the therapeutic interventions, aspirin is effective in all stages of coronary artery disease but does not prevent cerebrovascular accidents in patients without documented atherosclerosis. Thrombolysis carries a much higher benefit/risk ratio in the treatment of myocardial infarction than in that of cerebral infarction. The so-called cardioprotective drugs, such as the betablockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, have only been used to any extent in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. These differences reflect the fact that cerebrovascular accident covers a range of diseases much more diverse than does myocardial infarction, and also that the brain is much more exposed to haemorrhage whereas cardiac haematoma is highly unusual. Finally, cerebral atherosclerosis is a later event than coronary atherosclerosis and this has epidemiological implications which are difficult to assess. In conclusion, the prevention of myocardial infarction and of cerebrovascular accidents may proceed theoretically by a common pathway but in practice, it is very different.", 
    "185": "Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin (ANG) synthesis, receptor activation, or both, in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) are responsible for initiating ANG-related salt appetite in normotensive rats. The present study was designed to test whether treatment with saralasin (Sar), an ANG II antagonist, in the MnPO area causes changes in saline (0.3 M NaCl solution) and water intakes in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), which is known to show greater salt appetite compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Treatment with Sar in the MnPO area produced significantly attenuated saline intake, but had no effect on water intake. The results may support the importance of the ANG system in the MnPO area for salt appetite, and suggest that a disorder in the system may cause abnormal salt intake in SHR.", 
    "186": "In numerous studies, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been clearly established to be a strong blood pressure (BP) independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In fact, increased echocardiographic left ventricular mass (LVM) has been shown to predict cardiovascular complications not only in patients with arterial hypertension, but also in the general population. Preliminary data revealed that regression of LVH reduced cardiovascular complications. As a consequence, regression of LVH emerged as a desirable goal in patients with echocardiographically determined LVH. These findings raised the question of whether certain antihypertensive drugs differ in their ability to reduce LVM. To resolve this issue, several comparative studies and some metaanalyses have been carried out. Regarding the available data until the end of 1996 including only double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical studies with parallel group design, we found that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced LVM by 12% (95% CI, 9.0-14.5%), calcium channel blockers by 11% (95% CI, 7.8-13.7%), beta-blockers by 5% (95% CI, 1.2-7.3%), and diuretics by 8% (95% CI, 3.9-11.1%) (overall: P < .01). A similar reduction was found for posterior and septal wall thickness. Thus, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers seemed to be more potent than beta-blockers in their ability to reduce LVH, with diuretics in the intermediate range. The role of new antihypertensive agents such as AT-receptor antagonists cannot be conclusively answered, because the available data source is too small at this time. In addition to the drug class, reduction of LVH seems to be determined by pretreatment LVM, decline in BP, and duration of drug treatment. Further prospective controlled trials will be required to finally evaluate whether the excellent reduction of LVH with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers can be transferred into improved cardiovascular prognosis.", 
    "187": "Chronic administration of enalapril in the aging mouse prevents myocardial fibrosis. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we studied 30 CF1 female mice that received enalapril (ENAL:20 mg/L) in their drinking water after weaning and 30 control (CONT) mice. Ten animals from each group were killed at 12, 18, and 24 months. Half of the samples were prepared for light microscopy (LM) and the other half for electron microscopy (EM). Cardiac histologic sections were studied by an image analyzer (Bioscan OPTIMAS 4.1). We performed the following measurements in cardiomyocytes: mitochondrial number, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) using immunohistochemical methods with EM, the percentage of cell cyclin, and apoptosis. The results obtained for CONT and ENAL, respectively were as follows. For cyclin (percentage of positive) our results were: 12 months 17.1+/-0.1% and 18.2+/-0.8%, 18 months 2.4+/-1.6% (P < .001), and 11.4+/-0.1% (P < .001), 24 months 1.2+/-1.3% (P < .001), and 8.2+/-1.2% (P < .001) with significant differences at 18 and 24 months. For the Feulgen method (cell/mm2) we found: 12 months CONT 89.7+/-1.2, ENAL 84.6+/-1.2; 18 months CONT 62.8+/-1.2, ENAL 98.7+/-1.3, and 24 months CONT 81.2+/-1.3, ENAL 112.3+/-1.4. Apoptosis (percentage of positive) was found to be 12 months 3.7+/-0.4% and 1.9+/-0.1%, 18 months 7.1 +/-0.3% (P < .001), and 1.5+/-0.1% (P < .001), 24 months 10.9+/-0.5% (P < .001) and 2.1+/-1.8% (P < .001), for CONT and ENAL, respectively; there were significant differences at 18 and 24 months. The number of mitochondria per cardiomyocyte were: 12 months 85.9+/-1.8 and 87.3+/-1.5, 18 months 69.2+/-1.5t and 82.2+/-1.8 (P < .001), 24 months 54.6+/-1.1 (P < .001) and 81.4+/-1.6 (P < .001) for CONT and ENAL respectively, with significant differences at 18 and 24 months. Mitochondrial SOD was found to be: 12 months 13.6%+/-0.2% (P < .05) and 17.8%+/-1.3% (P < .05), 18 months 7.1%+/-1.0% (P < .001) and 16.7%+/-1.6% (P < .001), 24 months 4.1%+/-0.5% (P < .001), and 12.4%+/-0.9% (P .001) for CONT and ENAL respectively, with significant differences at 12 months and at 18 and 24 months (ANOVA and contrast Scheffe's test). We conclude that chronic administration of ENAL modifies mitochondrial SOD at 12 months, whereas at 18 and 24 months ENAL was associated with higher mitochondrial SOD and a higher mitochondrial number with a greater cyclin expression, and a lower percentage of apoptosis. Enalapril may prevent myocardial fibrosis, possibly by causing changes related to enzymatic-mitochondrial or cellular cycle modifications.", 
    "188": "Although beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition have been demonstrated in ill (ischemic, failing) hearts, it has not been proved that ACE inhibition induces changes in healthy hearts. The question is of clinical relevance, as many hypertensive patients do not display cardiac damage at the onset of treatment with ACE inhibitors, and possible changes in cardiac work might turn out more or less advantageous in the development of hypertensive heart disease. In a refined working heart preparation allowing measurement of cardiac work, including the contribution of atrial work and paracrine cardiac regulation, effects of captopril on cardiac dynamics were assessed. Coronary overflow of bradykinin, norepinephrine, and lactate was measured. Hearts were perfused for 20 min with vehicle or captopril at 3 x 10(-8), 3 x 10(-7), 3 x 10(-6), and 3 x 10(-5) mol/L. At the highest concentration, captopril increased coronary flow. Extending previous studies, the present study demonstrates that, in a concentration-dependent manner, captopril decreased oxygen consumption and maximal left ventricular pressure although the bradykinin outflow was not affected. From these influences of the drug on cardiac work and metabolism in healthy hearts, a protective influence of captopril in acute, critical situations of cardiac malnourishment or cardiac overload may be derived.", 
    "189": "Patterns of antihypertensive drug use, the cost of this care and potential savings with changes of treatment patterns, were studied for all hypertensives treated at US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Data was aggregated by individual medication as well as by antihypertensive drug class. Cost estimates were based on median cost and number of units for each dosage form of each medication dispensed at all facilities. Potential savings were estimated by substituting beta-blockers or diuretics for calcium antagonists. In a subset of patients the prevalence of hypertension, and among hypertensives the prevalence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus, was determined. For these patients, patterns of treatment by antihypertensive drug class was examined. For all VA facilities, of the 10 most frequently prescribed antihypertensives in 1995, four were calcium antagonists, two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, two beta-blockers, and two diuretics. In 1996, this was changed by the addition of an ACE inhibitor and the subtraction of a diuretic combination. Calcium antagonists accounted for 37% of treatment days in 1995 and 35% in 1996, ACE inhibitor use went from 34% to 36%, beta-blockers from 17% to 18%, and diuretic use remained at 12%. In 1996, approximately 86.6 million dollars were spent on calcium antagonists, 51.8 million on ACE inhibitors, 7.9 million on beta-blockers, and 3.6 million on diuretics. The estimated annual cost savings for each 1% conversion of calcium antagonists to beta-blockers would be $713,000 and to diuretics $758,000. In a subset of 7526 hypertensive patients with known comorbid conditions, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors were also the most commonly used drug classes for all categories of patients, including those without coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors were the most commonly dispensed antihypertensives at VA facilities for both 1995 and 1996, with a small decrease in calcium antagonist use from 1995 to 1996. The cost implications of these practice patterns as compared with the primary use of diuretics and beta-blockers are enormous.",

    "191": "1. Our objective was to compare the effect of a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) compared with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) on the non-neurogenic regulation of the microvascular blood flow in hypertensive Type I diabetes patients with diabetic nephropathy.2. We performed a 1-year double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 48 hypertensive Type I diabetes patients with diabetic nephropathy. For comparison, 22 age-matched normotensive healthy control subjects were included. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment. The minimal vascular resistance and distensibility (stiffness) of resistance vessels in skin and skeletal muscle were measured using the local isotope washout method.3. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to the same extent in both groups: nisoldipine, 113+/-2.1 to 105+/-1.6 mmHg (P<0.001); lisinopril, 110+/-2.7 to 101+/-2.1 mmHg (P<0.002) (controls, 88+/-2.2 mmHg; P<0.0001 compared with diabetic patients). Nisoldipine improved the skin vascular distensibility from 28+/-3.3 to 43+/-3.8% (P<0.005) and decreased skin minimal vascular resistance from 16.9+/-1.0 to 13.6+/-0.8 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g (P<0. 02). Lisinopril had no significant effect on skin vascular distensibility (40+/-4.0% and 41+/-4.4%), but minimal vascular resistance tended to diminish (18.1+/-0.9 to 15.8+/-1.3 mmHg.ml-1. min.100 g (P=0.09). Nisoldipine significantly increased the skin distensibility (P=0.05) after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment compared with lisinopril.4. The control group had a skin vascular distensibility of 54+/-3.2% and a minimal vascular resistance of 10. 8+/-0.7 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g, both significantly different from the values in the diabetic groups (P<0.0001 for all). Skeletal muscle vascular distensibility was unaltered after 1 year of treatment with both nisoldipine (22+/-3.3% and 19+/-2.7%) and lisinopril (19+/-2.1% and 24+/-2.5%), but was reduced compared with a control value of 43+/-3.7% (P<0.0001 for diabetes patients versus controls). However, neither nisoldipine nor lisinopril had any effect on the increased minimal vascular resistance or the reduced skeletal muscle distensibility.5. Enhanced thickening of the basement membranes of the terminal arteriolar wall was found in skin biopsy specimens in 91% of diabetic patients and 38% only in control subjects (P<0. 000001 both before and after treatment for diabetic patients versus controls). There was no significant effect of antihypertensive treatment on arteriolar hyalinosis.6. The reduction in systemic blood pressure was identical during 1 year of treatment with nisoldipine or lisinopril. The abnormal arteriolar stiffness was more pronounced in the group treated with nisoldipine than with lisinopril and only nisoldipine compared with lisinopril improved the abnormal arteriolar stiffness and minimal vascular resistance in the skin. This suggests that nisoldipine can reverse the peripheral skin perfusion and thereby improve the local protection against development of ischaemic skin lesions in Type I diabetes patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "192": "1. Frequency-domain spectral analysis of stationary ECG R-R intervals was made by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in conditions of monitored arterial blood pressure and respiratory activity in diethyl-ether-anaesthetized and pithed adult rats. This technique yields a number of parameters which allow quantitative evaluation of the non-random distribution of the mean values obtained in time-domain studies. The frequency-analysis method enables the overall heart rate variability to be broken down into its various constituents, which are differently affected by physiological loading and capable of selective reactivity to pharmacological agents. 2. The low-frequency spectral component obtained by breaking down the total spectral density power, i.e. the appropriate variability signal (band width < 0.15 Hz) and a higher-frequency band corresponding to spontaneous (0.80-1.60 Hz) or artificially imposed (0.75 Hz) respiratory activity were estimated and their integrated areas evaluated as absolute powers or normalized fractional values. 3. The power of the high-frequency spectral component increased in all animal preparations under treatment with prazosin, dl-propranolol, endothelin-1 and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril. The power of the low-frequency band increased under alpha-r atriopeptin and ACE inhibitors in the pithed preparations only, and decreased in the anaesthetized animals. 4. The new power spectrum features and trends detected indicate that these time-independent, model-dependent cardiovascular and respiratory markers are subject to some form of complex peptidergic control. 5. The relative roles of the various factors operating in the genesis of these short-term changes in spectral power in the low- and high-frequency bands cannot be interpreted as indicating a reciprocal push-pull relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. 6. The study findings, however, can be interpreted as providing evidence of a different and to some extent alternative form of integrative cardiovascular control persisting in the pithed rats (i.e. in the 'peripheral', CNS-destroyed preparations). 7. New areas of theoretical and applied research are being developed in the (auto)classification of (iso)receptors and drug analogues through exploration of multiple physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters in the frequency-domain. Furthermore, model-independent frequency-domain methods not requiring stationary data will afford scope for even more significant developments by separating the overlapping dynamic processes from a whole series of correlated effects.",

    "199": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] possesses novel biological functions that are distinct from angiotensin II (Ang II). In coronary arteries, the octapeptide Ang II and the heptapeptide Ang-(1-7) exert opposing actions. Ang II elicits vasoconstriction and Ang-(1-7) is a vasodilator. Ang-(1-7) elicits vasodilation by an endothelium-dependent release of nitric oxide. Further, the vasorelaxant activity is markedly attenuated by the bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonist icatibant and does not appear to be associated with the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. Ang-(1-7) vasodilation is mediated by a non-AT1/AT2 receptor, since [Sar1Thr8]-Ang II, but neither candesartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, nor PD123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist, blocked the response. Specific and high affinity binding of 125I-Ang-(1-7) to the endothelial layer of canine coronary arteries was demonstrated using in vitro emulsion autoradiography. Binding was effectively competed for by either unlabeled Ang-(1-7) or the specific Ang-(1-7) antagonist [D-Ala7]-Ang-(1-7). Additionally, Ang-(1-7) potentiated synergistically BK-induced vasodilation. The EC50 of BK vasodilation (2.45 +/- 0.51 nmol/L vs 0.37 +/- 0.08 nmol/L) was shifted 6.6-fold left-ward in the presence of 2 mumol/L concentration of Ang-(1-7). The potentiated response was specific for BK, since Ang-(1-7) did not augment the vasodilation produced by either acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside; further, it was specific for Ang-(1-7), since neither Ang I nor Ang II augmented the BK response. In contrast to the vasodilator actions of Ang-(1-7), the potentiated response was not blocked by candesartan, PD123319 or [Sar1Thr8]-Ang II. Novel studies from our group demonstrate that Ang-(1-7) is both a substrate and inhibitor for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Ang-(1-7) was shown to retard the degradation of 125I-[Tyr0]-BK in coronary rings. These studies describe novel actions of Ang-(1-7) as a vasodilator and a local synergistic modulator of kinin-induced vasodilation in coronary arteries.", 
    "200": "Endothelins (ET) are 21-aminoacid peptides produced ubiquitously, which were discovered originally as endothelial products. These peptides may play important roles in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. As the pathophysiologic roles of endothelins in cardiovascular disease become increasingly apparent, the potential therapeutic use of endothelin antagonists or endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors is recognized. The main endothelin produced by the endothelium is ET-1. Endothelin-1 is overexpressed in the vascular wall of salt-dependent models of hypertension, such as DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, DOCA-salt-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl salt-sensitive rats, and in stroke-prone SHR, angiotensin II-infused rats and 1-kidney 1 clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats, but not in SHR, 2-K 1C hypertensive rats or L-NAME-treated rats. The vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1 may contribute to blood pressure elevation and its growth-promoting action to vascular hypertrophy in the hypertensive models which overexpress ET-1 in blood vessels. In rats without generalized activation of the endothelin system, expression of ET-1 is often enhanced in coronary arteries, which suggests a role for ET-1 in myocardial ischemia in hypertension. In rats overexpressing ET-1, ETA/B and ETA-selective antagonists lowered blood pressure slightly, and significantly reduced vascular growth, particularly of small arteries, suggesting that ET-1 has a direct effect on growth. Protection from renal injury and from stroke has also been demonstrated in hypertensive rats treated with endothelin antagonists. In normotensive human subjects endothelin-dependent tone can be shown in the forearm. In a study of mild hypertensive patients, the ETA/B antagonist bosentan reduced blood pressure similarly to an ACE inhibitor. Moderate to severe hypertensive patients presented enhanced expression of ET-1 mRNA in the endothelium of subcutaneous resistance arteries. In blacks with familial hypertension increased plasma levels of endothelin have been found. Thus, ET-1 may play a role in some experimental hypertensive models and in human hypertension. In summary, endothelial ET-1 may be overexpressed in the more severe forms of hypertension, and in certain special populations which may respond particularly well to endothelin antagonism. Endothelin antagonists may prove to be effective disease-modifying agents if in future clinical trials they are shown clinically to blunt vascular growth and endothelial dysfunction, reduce stroke and exert the cardioprotective and renal protective effects already reported in experimental hypertension. These agents could contribute to reduce the long-term complications of hypertension, which remains to be demonstrated in humans.", 
    "201": "The endothelial cell should be regarded as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ interacting with the blood streak and the interstitium. Kinins are vasodepressor hormones that may participate in local blood flow regulation as part of an autocrine-paracrine system. We have previously reported that tissue kallikrein, its mRNA and kininogen are present in vascular tissue. The present study was undertaken to examine the release of the components of this system from isolated perfused rat vessels. These vessels were perfused at 4 ml/min with physiological saline solution containing 3% Ficoll and 0.1% BSA. Kallikrein was released into the perfusate at a rate of 75 +/- 5 ng Bk/100 g bw/30 min (n = 10). Kininogen was released at a rate of 55 +/- 5 pg Bk/100 g bw/30 min. Pre-treatment with puromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, significantly reduces kallikrein and kininogen release. Vascular derived kinins were released at a constant rate of 38 +/- 6 pg Bk/100 g bw/30 min for at least 120 min. This basal kinin release was increased 3-fold when perfused with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat (p < 0.05). When purified kininogen was added to the physiological saline solution, immunoreactive kinins in the perfusate increased from 42 +/- 7 to 3140 +/- 210 pg Bk/100 g bw/30 min (n = 6; p < 0.002). Increase in flow rate (from 2 ml/min up to 4 ml/min and 8 ml/min) causes a parallel increase in the release of kinins (from 32 +/- 4 up to 48 +/- 6 and 62 +/- 8 pg Bk/100 g bw/30 min, respectively; p < 0.01); the increase may be due to the effect of shear stress upon the endothelial cells. The present data confirm that vascular tissue synthesizes and releases continuously kallikrein, kininogen and kinins. Vascular kinins induce potent vasodilatation through the release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarization factor, and some of the converting enzyme inhibitors effect may be explained by potentiation of vascular-derived kinins.", 
    "202": "We studied 120 patients (M:F 105:15, mean age 57.5 +/- 10.1 years) with acute myocardial infarction (MI) successfully treated with percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to analyze the influence of the resolution of the ST segment elevation and depression after intervention to 1 month composite endpoints of reinfarction or reocclusion, development of congestive heart failure (CF) and death. Sum of preintervention and postintervention ST segment elevation and depression and the rate of resolution of these ST segment elevations and depressions were recorded for every patient. A total of 17 (14.2%) composite endpoint events (events group) were recorded (7 reocclusion or recurrent MI, 9 CF, and 1 death). On univariate analysis, events group patients were older (53.3 +/- 9.9 vs. 58.8 +/- 9.1 years, P = 0.032), had lesser resolution of ST segment elevations (85 +/- 24% vs. 44 +/- 55%, P = 0.017) and depression (72 +/- 26% vs. 52 +/- 30%, P = 0.009), had greater preintervention ST segment elevation (17.49 +/- 12.95 mm vs. 28.38 +/- 20.41 mm, P = 0.045), had lower ejection fraction (59.3 +/- 10.2% vs. 43.6 +/- 9.4%, P < 0.001), and had more frequent multivessel disease (71% vs. 47%, P = 0.048) compared to the nonevents group. Time from angina to reperfusion, residual stenosis, sex, infarct location and infarct-related vessel distribution were similar. On multivariate analysis (logistic regression with backward likelihood ratio) only older age (P = 0.0752), lesser rate of resolution of ST segment depression (P = 0.0262) and lower ejection fractions (P = 0.0014) were retained as predictors of the composite endpoints. Relative risk conferred by less than 50% resolution of ST segment depressions for composite endpoints were 3.78 (95% CI 1.63-8.73). We conclude that the lack of resolution of the sum of reciprocal ST segment depressions identifies a subgroup of acute MI patients with greater morbidity after primary PTCA.",

One hundred patients from 16 outpatient treatment centers in the United States were included in this double-masked, randomized, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled study, with stratification according to sex. After a challenge phase with lisinopril and a placebo washout phase, patients were randomly allocated to receive losartan 50 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for a maximum of 8 weeks. The primary efficacy end point of the study was the presence or absence of dry cough during the double-masked period, as rated by the patient at each visit using a validated symptom assessment questionnaire. A secondary end point was the frequency of dry cough, as measured at each visit using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The incidence of dry cough was significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the losartan and placebo groups (87.5% vs 36.7% and 31.4%, respectively) at the end of the double-masked treatment period; there was no statistically significant difference between the losartan and placebo groups. Mean VAS scores showed that patients treated with lisinopril rated themselves as having a significantly higher frequency of cough than did patients treated with losartan or placebo (4.0 vs 1.2 and 1.5, respectively). Again, the difference between the losartan and placebo groups was not statistically significant. All treatments were otherwise well tolerated, and no serious clinical or laboratory adverse events were reported during the double-masked phase of the study. These results demonstrate that the incidence, severity, and frequency of dry cough in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough are significantly lower in those treated with losartan than in those treated with lisinopril and are similar to the incidence, severity, and frequency of dry cough in those receiving placebo.", 
    "208": "Trandolapril is an orally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been used in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF), and after myocardial infarction (MI). Trandolapril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that is hydrolysed to the active diacid trandolaprilat. Trandolapril 2 mg once daily provides effective control of blood pressure (BP) over 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with a trough/peak ratio of BP reduction (as determined by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) consistently > or = 50%. Trandolapril has similar antihypertensive efficacy to enalapril as indicated by several clinical trials. Combined therapy with trandolapril and sustained-release verapamil has a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Only limited data are available on the use of trandolapril in patients with CHF, although ACE inhibitors as a class are recommended as first line therapy in such patients. In the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, trandolapril 1 to 4 mg once daily resulted in an early and long term reduction in all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality, in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after an MI. Trandolapril therapy was commenced a mean 4.5 days after acute MI and continued for 24 to 50 months. At study end, the relative risk of death from any cause with trandolapril versus placebo was 0.78 (p = 0.001). The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Most adverse events are mild and transient in nature, and include cough, asthenia, dizziness, headache and nausea. Trandolapril has no adverse effect on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "209": "trandolapril has a favourable pharmacological profile and an antihypertensive efficacy at least comparable to that of other ACE inhibitors. The pharmacological characteristics of trandolapril allow it to provide good 24-hour control of BP with once-daily administration. Trandolapril has also demonstrated some efficacy in a small number of patients with CHF. In addition, trandolapril provides long term protection against all-cause mortality in patients with LV dysfunction after MI. The results of the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) study will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved LV function. Thus, trandolapril represents an effective, well-tolerated and convenient treatment option for patients with mild to moderate hypertension or LV systolic dysfunction after MI.",

Verapamil SR/trandolapril reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than the individual components in patients with diabetic or non-diabetic proteinuria. The antihypertensive efficacy of once daily verapamil SR/trandolapril (180/1 or 180/2 mg) for 8 weeks or 6 months is similar to that of atenolol/chlorthalidone (100/25 mg) and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg), and was at least as good as that of metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide (100/12.5 mg) in a small trial. The reduction in sitting or supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure is greater after verapamil SR/trandolapril (180/2 to 240/4 mg) than after monotherapy with verapamil SR (180 and 240 mg/day) or trandolapril (2 to 8 mg/day). Fewer cardiac events occurred after verapamil SR/trandolapril (240/1 to 360/2 mg/day) than after trandolapril (1 to 2 mg/day) in postmyocardial infarction patients with congestive heart failure. The incidence of adverse events after verapamil SR/trandolapril is similar to that of comparator drugs and the individual components of the combination.",

    "225": "The effect in vivo of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and enalapril and the calcium antagonist verapamil was studied in an experimental model using rat heart allografts. Daily post-transplant treatment of recipient rats (DA strain) with verapamil (75 mg kg-1 day-1) or captopril (40 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly prolonged survival of allografts from donors (PVG/c strain) when compared with an untreated control group (p < 0.05). No synergistic effect was observed when the two drugs were used for combined treatment. An equipotent does of enalapril (12.5 mg kg-1 day-1) caused no change in allograft survival of statistical significance. The results support the hypothesis that verapamil and captopril have effects on the immune reactivity in vivo, and that this is not a characteristic shared by all ACE inhibitors.",

In all, 56 patients were included in the main study, 4 refused to participate in the substudy, and 4 were excluded for logistical reasons. Echocardiography was performed at entry and after 6 months. Patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting during the follow-up period were excluded.", 
    "229": "At baseline, the patients had modest LV dysfunction, and mean AV plane displacement of 9.7 mm. During follow-up, AV plane displacement increased in ramipril-treated patients from 9.5 to 10.9 mm (p < 0.01). No statistically significant changes were seen in the placebo group.", 
    "230": "Ramipril improves LV systolic function in patients with clinical signs of heart failure and only modest systolic dysfunction after AMI. Measurement of AV plane displacement is a simple and reproducible method for detection of small changes in systolic function and may be used instead of ejection fraction in patients with poor image quality.", 
    "231": "Endothelial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an early event in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. This observation is consistent with the growing appreciation of the role of endothelium in maintaining cardiovascular health. Endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease are both linked to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking. Modification of these conditions improves both endothelial function and coronary artery disease outcomes. Dietary and lifestyle modifications and antioxidant vitamin supplementation have a beneficial effect on endothelial function, as do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents. Future studies will determine whether interventions that specifically target endothelial dysfunction can reduce rates of clinical disease.", 
    "232": "Menopause and essential hypertension are associated with a decreased compliance and distensibility of the arteries. ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve arterial distensibility. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), especially estrogens, could have a positive influence through their atheroprotective, vasodilative, and blood pressure-lowering effect. The vascular interactions of HRT and ACE inhibitors, like moexipril hydrochloride, have not been investigated so far. This trial was intended to assess the effect of combined sequential HRT for 25 days on acute changes in arterial distensibility after a single oral dose of 15 mg moexipril hydrochloride in postmenopausal women with borderline to mild essential hypertension. This study had a monocentric, randomized, parallel-group design, and was open for moexipril, and double-blind, and placebo-controlled for HRT. Assessment of arterial distensibility was by automatic noninvasive measurement of the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). The PWV and the pulse pressure decreased significantly after a single oral dose of 15 mg moexiprill. An influence of HRT on the changes in the PWV and pulse pressure could not be seen. The plasma concentrations of renin increased and of aldosterone decreased after moexipril administration. Arterial function improves after acute administration of 15 mg moexipril in postmenopausal women with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The changes in PWV and pulse pressure are of similar magnitude in women with and without HRT.", 
    "233": "Treatment of patients with severe heart failure by ACE inhibition is often limited by worsening of renal function. To evaluate whether trandolapril, a potent lipophilic ACE inhibitor, affects renal function in severe heart failure, we studied 12 patients with severe heart failure treated with only diuretics and digoxin. Patients received increasing oral dosages of trandolapril (0, 1, and 2 mg) on 3 consecutive days (A). Patients were then discharged on 2 mg trandolapril bid and re-evaluated 8 weeks later (B). Mean arterial and pulmonary wedge pressures decreased by maximal 14% and 43%, and stroke volume and work indexes increased by 24% and 20% at A and similarly at B (11, 45, and 25 ns and 33%, respectively). In contrast, heart rate, systemic resistance, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac index decreased by 6%, 23%, 29%, and 17%, respectively, at only A. Renal blood flow improved by approximately 40% both at A and B. In contrast, the glomerular filtration rate decreased by 25% at only B, whereas serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urine osmolality were unaffected during the study. Norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels decreased by approximately 30%, 60%, and 65%, respectively, at both A and B. Renin levels increased by 136% at A and remained elevated at B. Thus, whereas the initial systemic vasodilating and inotropic effects did not persist, long-term trandolapril results in sustained neurohormonal modulation, reduced preload, and improved organ perfusion, indicated by a persistent increase in renal blood flow and preservation of renal function in severe heart failure.", 
    "234": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy reduces complications of acute myocardial infarction (MI) even when the therapy is started very early after an acute event. This study sought to determine whether administration of ACE-I therapy prior to acute MI is related to subsequent patient morbidity and mortality.",

They experienced smaller MIs, as determined by peak creatine kinase elevation (1066 +/- 134 vs. 1510 +/- 95 IU; p < 0.05), and fewer Q-wave infarctions (p < 0.05) than did patients who were not receiving prior treatment. The severity of coronary artery disease, defined by an angiographic score, was similar for the two groups. Mortality rates, including patients resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation, were similar within the first 72 hours of admission (3% vs. 2%; p = NS), but patients receiving prior ACE-I therapy showed a greater long-term in-hospital mortality rate (14% vs. 5%; p < 0.05) related to more heart failure deaths. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age, treatment with digoxin prior to acute MI, and left ventricular ejection fraction after infarction, but not ACE-I therapy taken prior to infarction, as significant independent predictors of mortality and combined morbidity and mortality.", 
    "237": "In a group of patients experiencing an acute MI, those receiving prior ACE-I therapy were more likely to sustain fewer transmural MIs and smaller infarcts. Chronic ACE-I therapy may have cardioprotective effects during acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "238": "1. Early and late onset of angio-oedema. The report reviews angio-oedema as a rare but potential life threatening adverse effect associated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This class of drugs, widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, may often induce mild angio-oedema of the skin (face, lips, cheeks) but may rarely involve tongue, subglottis, pharyngeal and laryngeal tissues. Angio-oedema has been previously reported to occur early after start of treatment, mostly within the first 3-4 weeks. However, according to later reports since 1990, first onset may be delayed for months and even until 7 years of treatment. Analysis of patients exhibiting angio-oedema reported to the National Drug Commission in Germany revealed that the number of patients with late onset of angio-oedema is continually increasing over time. The percentage of patients with delayed onset ranging from after six months up to six years was as follows: 1992: 8.9% (of a total of n = 56), 1996: 28% (of a total of n = 79), and 1998: 54% (of a total of n = 46). Eleven cases of patients of the latter group were classified as life-threatening. 2. Recurrence of Angio-oedema. Furthermore, many patients experienced multiple episodes of angio-oedema because even clinicians in emergency departments are not familiar with the association between angio-oedema and ACE inhibitors. In our series from 1992 until early 1998 17% of 125 patients exhibiting angio-oedema had relapses with a maximum of seven events over a period of three years. 3. Widespread Use of ACE Inhibitors, Tactical Approach to Diagnosing Angio-oedema and Prevention of Relapses. Hence, from a practical point of view, it seems very useful to suggest that nowadays every angio-oedema is caused by ACE inhibitor treatment until it is definitely excluded by a thorough review of all medications. Thirteen ACE inhibitors gained more widespread application worldwide. Unfortunately, a large number of drug combinations (> 93) are meanwhile on the market. Therefore, much effort is needed to improve the knowledge and awareness of this insidious adverse effect by well-documented case reports. Moreover, each case of ACE inhibitor-associated angio-oedema should be immediately brought to the attention of the practitioner/cardiologist to emphasise that this class of antihypertensive agents is contraindicated in the affected person to prevent the occurrence of another potentially life-threatening event.", 
    "239": "The prognosis remains poor for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), despite reduced mortality rates resulting from the addition of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to traditional treatment regimens. Because much of the myocardial damage that occurs in patients with CHF may be related to sympathetic activation, interest in the use of beta blockers has grown. Recent studies have shown the benefits of beta blocker therapy in many patients with heart failure. Carvedilol, the first beta blocker labeled in the United States specifically for the treatment of heart failure, has been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction and may reduce mortality.",

VE/VCO2 was significantly lower for CAP at 30 W (p = 0.05) and, although lower at 75% VO2peak, did not obtain statistical significance (p = 0.22). The between group differences were larger at T2 and T3 when compared with T1.",

We report a case of simultaneous onset of small bowel and orofacial angioedema due to captopril. A 61-year-old black man with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure had been treated with captopril for 5 years. He had sudden swelling of the lips, face, and tongue, followed by nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other medications included aspirin, indomethacin, allopurinol, colchicine, and nifedipine. Examination showed swelling of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and neck; he also had midabdominal tenderness but no respiratory distress. Laboratory data were normal. A C1-esterase inhibitor level was normal. An ileus pattern was present on abdominal x-ray film. Angioedema was diagnosed, and all signs and symptoms resolved in 24 hours after captopril was discontinued. Clinicians need to be vigilant for bowel involvement from ACEI angioedema.", 
    "247": "There is increasing evidence that essential hypertension is associated with a panoply of metabolic abnormalities. Included in these abnormalities are insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, enhanced coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity, microalbuminuria, and platelet abnormalities and endothelial dysfunction. Visceral obesity appears to be the most common and predictive underlying factor for all of these metabolic abnormalities accompanying hypertension as well as increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. As the prevalence of obesity is increasing, there is cause for concern that CVD increases will parallel this risk factor, particularly in especially high-risk populations, such as African-American women. Other important risk factors, such as increased oxidative stress, may require special therapeutic strategies, including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin blockers as cornerstones of antihypertensive drug therapy.", 
    "248": "Pulsatile (burstlike) secretion of renin and aldosterone is positively coupled with a short time lag of about 10 to 20 minutes. We investigated how acute interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, ie, acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, alters the pattern of renin and aldosterone secretion. Eight healthy men (mean age, 22+/-1 years) were studied while on standardized salt intake. They were allocated on 2 occasions in random order to injection of placebo or 1.25 mg of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. Blood samples were obtained every 10 minutes for 24 hours for measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations. The hormone concentration profiles were analyzed using a multiparameter deconvolution technique; basal (tonic) and pulsatile hormone secretion was assessed. The regularity of pulsatile hormone secretion was analyzed using approximate entropy (ApEn). Cross-correlation and cross-ApEn analysis of renin and aldosterone secretion were performed to assess synchrony. Acute ACE inhibition caused an immediate burst of renin release and, in addition, significantly (P<0.01) increased 24-hour pulsatile and total renin secretion. It did not affect basal (nonpulsatile) renin secretion. The amplitude of renin bursts and the mass of hormone secreted per burst were significantly (P<0.01) increased, whereas the burst frequency (ie, number of secretory events) was unchanged. ApEn analysis revealed significantly (P<0.05) more regular renin secretion after ACE inhibition. In contrast, neither basal nor pulsatile aldosterone secretion was affected by administration of enalaprilat. Cross-ApEn analysis documented not only a maintained pattern of reproducibility (ie, synchrony) but also greater conditional regularity between pulsatile renin and aldosterone secretions with acute ACE inhibition. However, the quantitative strength of hormone coupling (assessed by cross-correlation analysis) was markedly diminished by enalaprilat treatment. The present findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis may not be completely uncoupled by acute ACE inhibition or that pulsatile renin and aldosterone secretion is driven by a common signal generator that is unaffected by ACE inhibition. In addition, a background basal and pulsatile aldosterone secretion not regulated by the renin-angiotensin axis may exist.", 
    "249": "The influence of chronic administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on blood pressure and sodium balance was evaluated in conscious Swiss Webster mice. Arterial pressure was measured with chronic indwelling catheters, and sodium balance was determined by infusing sodium intravenously in isotonic saline and collecting urine 24 h/d. Experiments to validate sodium balance measurements in mice demonstrated recovery of 100+/-3% of sodium intake under steady-state conditions (n=20 mice on 70 individual days, sodium intake range 160 to 1000 micromol/d). It was further demonstrated that mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and body weight were unaltered from 115+/-7 mm Hg, 646+/-12 bpm, and 34+/-0.6 g, respectively, as sodium intake was increased stepwise from 150 to 900 micromol NaCl per day. An additional validation group (n=7) demonstrated that daily and cumulative sodium balance can be accurately determined during and after the intravenous administration of an agent known to alter renal sodium handling (furosemide 50 mg. kg-1. d-1). Experiments were then performed to examine the influence of intravenous captopril infusion (40 mg. kg-1. d-1, n=7) in mice in which the daily sodium intake was fixed at approximately 200 micromol/d. This dose of captopril was determined to significantly decrease the pressor response to a 10-ng bolus of angiotensin I (Ang I) from 24+/-5 in the control state to 6+/-2 mm Hg (n=5). After 5 days of infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor, mean arterial pressure significantly fell from 114+/-3 to 58+/-2 mm Hg, body weight significantly decreased from 36+/-1 to 33+/-1 g, and cumulative sodium balance significantly decreased to -270+/-55 micromol. These parameters returned toward control during 5 postcontrol days. Results of this study demonstrate that accurate sodium balance measurements can be obtained from individual conscious mice over a 5-fold range of sodium intake. The experiments also indicate that converting enzyme inhibition has a potent influence to lower blood pressure in normal mice; the hypotensive response appears to be due in part to increased urinary sodium excretion.", 
    "250": "Clinical diabetic nephropathy is a well-recognized cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. The finding that microalbuminuria predicts progression to overt nephropathy has allowed early diagnosis and preventive interventions. Several studies have demonstrated that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slows down the rate of decline of the glomerular filtration rate in type 1 diabetes patients with established proteinuria. The renoprotective properties of the ACE inhibitor captopril extend beyond its antihypertensive effects. ACE inhibitors represent the most appropriate class of antihypertensive drugs for treating type I diabetes patients because of their efficacy and safety. When microalbuminuria is detected and confirmed in a diabetic child or adolescent, and if it persists despite 6-12 months of improved metabolic control, treatment with ACE inhibitors should be started, even if the child is normotensive. Careful follow-up of renal function is essential.", 
    "251": "Recent trials have linked calcium antagonists with adverse cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with diabetes. A closer examination of these trials (in particular the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes [ABCD] trial and the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial [FACET]) reveals a lack of data from which to draw conclusions of harm. In fact, based on the results of these trials and the recent Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Trial, one may conclude that the combination of a calcium antagonist with an ACE inhibitor is a rational therapeutic choice in patients with coexisting hypertension and diabetes.", 
    "252": "The results of 2 recently published studies have been interpreted as suggesting that calcium antagonists are unsafe for the management of hypertension in patients with diabetes. These 2 studies, the Fosinopril versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) and Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD), showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be preferable to calcium antagonists for managing hypertension in diabetic patients; they do not, however, show any harm attributable to calcium antagonists. Indeed, results of the FACET study suggest that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist is effective antihypertensive therapy. This suggestion is supported by findings in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Study, which revealed outstanding benefits of either a calcium antagonist alone or a calcium antagonist combined with an ACE inhibitor among diabetic patients with hypertension. The premature termination of the hypertensive arm of the ABCD study was puzzling because, although 2 of 13 subgroups of 1 of the 5 possible secondary endpoints in this part of the trial were apparently favorably affected by the use of the ACE inhibitor rather than the calcium antagonist, such a finding was compatible with chance alone. If the results of the FACET and ABCD studies are considered in the context of the best available data arising from large randomized controlled trials, one may conclude that calcium antagonists are not harmful or contraindicated in hypertensive patients with diabetes and that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist is effective for the management of hypertension in diabetic patients.", 
    "253": "Calcium antagonists comprise the most popular drug class for treatment of hypertension in Japan. More than half of Japanese clinicians use calcium antagonists as initial drug treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension and, despite recent controversies, their use continues to increase. Nearly a fourth of clinicians use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and 9% use beta-receptor blockers. There are 12 dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and 1 benzothiazepine agent in clinical use. Amlodipine is the most widely used agent in the class. Efonidipine and cilnidipine, recently developed in Japan, both have a slow onset of action and long-lasting hypertensive effect and possess characteristics unique to the class. Efonidipine dilates the efferent as well as the afferent arterioles of the glomerulus; therefore, it appears to have a more pronounced renoprotective effect than other calcium antagonists. Cilnidipine is a dual-channel antagonist, acting on both the peripheral neuronal N-type and vascular L-type calcium channels. It depresses the pressor response to acute cold stress but does not induce tachycardia by hypotensive baroreflex.", 
    "254": "Several trials have shown that antihypertensive drug treatment decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. They have also shown, however, that the risk is not decreased to the level of nonhypertensive patients. Trials are therefore underway to determine whether the benefits achieved by older drugs, such as diuretics and beta blockers, can be enhanced by using newer classes of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Among these trials, the International Nifedipine GITS Study of Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) is of special interest because it is the first study to address, in a prospective fashion, the prognostic influence of antihypertensive treatment (nifedipine GITS vs a combined thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretic) in hypertensive patients with concomitant risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy. This article briefly describes the rationale and design of the INSIGHT trial and cites the substudies and the preliminary data available.", 
    "255": "Macrovascular disease is the major cause of mortality in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension is an important factor contributing to this high prevalence. High blood pressure is about twice as common in persons with diabetes mellitus as in those without. Up to 75% of diabetes-related cardiovascular complications are attributed to hypertension. These observations are part of the rationale for recommendations for more aggressive lowering of blood pressure (to < 130/85 mm Hg) in persons with coexistent diabetes and hypertension. This may require therapy with a combination of antihypertensive agents. The Fosinopril versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET), discussed herein, supports the case for combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium antagonist in diabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "256": "As the population ages, the incidence of type 2 diabetes will increase as will the incidence of concomitant vascular complications. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Results from the recent Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial demonstrated an advantage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) over a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) with regard to the incidence of cardiovascular events over a 5-year follow-up period in hypertensive persons with type 2 diabetes. This trial was a prospective, randomized, blinded study comparing the effects of moderate blood pressure control (target diastolic pressure 80-89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control (target diastolic pressure 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of diabetic vascular complications. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as first-line antihypertensive therapy in terms of prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In 470 hypertensive patients, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions was significantly (p = 0.001) higher among those receiving nisoldipine (n = 25) compared with those receiving enalapril (n = 5). Comparison with previous studies suggests that the difference observed between nisoldipine and enalapril resulted from a beneficial effect of enalapril rather than a deleterious effect from nisoldipine. Since these findings in the ABCD trial are based on a secondary endpoint, they require confirmation. Nevertheless, they suggest that ACE inhibitors should be the initial antihypertensive medication used in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.", 
    "257": "Disorders in peripheral microcirculation are observed in arterial hypertension and may be improved by antihypertensive treatment. In this pilot study the authors measured capillary blood cell velocity in the finger nailfold in 14 patients (mean age 50 +/- 14 years, range 30-71 years; 9 men, 5 women) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a 3-week placebo period, patients received double-blind randomized treatment with either 0.2- to 0.4-mg moxonidine (n=7) or 2.5- to 5.0-mg cilazapril (n=7). Finger nailfold video capillaroscopy was performed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure was measured by conventional office technique. Capillary blood cell velocity, 1 minute after local finger cooling, increased in the Moxonidine group (0.65 +/- 0.53 mm/sec to 1.13 +/- 0.77 mm/sec; p<0.05) after 8 weeks treatment compared to the baseline. The increase in the Cilazapril group from 0.79 +/- 0.45 mm/sec to 0.93 +/- 1.03 mm/sec did not reach a level of statistical significance. Blood pressure decreased from 151 +/- 8/101 +/- 5 to 147 +/- 6/98 +/- 7 mmHg in the Moxonidine group and from 164 +/- 12/102 +/- 6 to 140 +/- 9/93 +/- 9 mmHg in the cilazapril group. Moxonidine increased nailfold capillary blood cell velocity 1 minute after local finger cooling in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This improvement of the peripheral microcirculation may be associated with reversal of vascular dysfunction in hypertension.", 
    "258": "The antihypertensive activity and pharmacokinetics of KD3-671 (previously named KT3-671), a nonpeptide AT1-receptor antagonist, were investigated in renal hypertensive dogs with normal or high plasma renin activity (PRA). A single administration of KD3-671 at 3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o., to the hypertensive dogs with high PRA dose-dependently reduced mean blood pressure (MBP), which was not correlated with plasma KD3-671 concentration. Significant increases in PRA and plasma angiotensin (Ang) II occurred 2 h after KD3-671 dosing. Enalapril at 3 mg/kg, p.o., also reduced MBP. Neither KD3-671 nor enalapril affected heart rate. When given orally once a day for 29 days to the hypertensive dogs with normal PRA, KD3-671 at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day dose-dependently reduced MBP, which was smaller than that in the dogs with high PRA. This was the case for enalapril. The hypotension induced by the first dose of KD3-671 or enalapril was consistently observed after doses 8, 15, 22, and 29. After cessation of repeated dosing, no rebound phenomenon in MBP was observed. Pharmacokinetic parameters of KD3-671 were not influenced by repeated dosing. KD3-671 markedly increased both PRA and plasma Ang II concentration at 2 h after dosing. These results suggest that KD3-671 may be useful for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "259": "It was previously observed that a significant regression of structural alterations and endothelial dysfunction in mesenteric small arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) may be obtained after therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It is not clear whether angiotensin II-type 1 receptor blockers may share this properties. We evaluated the effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril and of the angiotensin II-receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil on structural alterations of mesenteric small resistance arteries, on cardiac mass, and on endothelial function in SHRs. Seventy-three rats were included in the study. Sixteen SHRs were treated with enalapril and 21 with candesartan cilexetil, whereas 18 Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and 18 SHRs were untreated. Enalapril and candesartan cilexetil were administered in the drinking water from weeks 4 to 12 of age. Blood pressure was measured noninvasively every week. The rats were killed at the end of the treatment period, after 3 or 4 days of therapeutic washout. Heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) was measured. Mesenteric arterioles were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph (Mulvany's technique). Then the media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) was evaluated. In addition, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxation was evaluated by dose-response curves to acetylcholine (in the presence or absence of a bradykinin-receptor blocker and of indomethacin) and sodium nitroprusside. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by both drugs, compared with untreated SHRs, although the hypotensive effect was greater with enalapril than with candesartan cilexetil. A significant reduction of M/L of mesenteric small arteries and of HW/BW was observed in SHRs treated with candesartan cilexetil or enalapril. A significant improvement of endothelial function, as evaluated by a dose-response to acetylcholine, was observed. The acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation was similar after addition to the organ bath of a selective blocker of bradykinin receptors, thus suggesting a minor role (if any) of the increased local availability of bradykinin, as a consequence of inhibition of ACE, in the improvement of endothelial function observed after enalapril treatment. In addition to a satisfactory antihypertensive effect observed with both drugs, candesartan cilexetil and enalapril were proven to be equally effective in reducing structural alterations in mesenteric small resistance arteries, in normalizing cardiac mass, and in improving endothelial function. The inhibition of bradykinin breakdown does not seem to be involved in the improvement of endothelial dysfunction observed with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "260": "To assess the comparative effects of benazepril and nitrendipine monotherapies on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in hypertensive patients with echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy, patients with diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 100 mm Hg were randomized to benazepril, 10 mg, or nitrendipine, 20 mg, both given once or twice daily. After 4 weeks, only the responders (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) entered a 5-month maintenance period. At baseline, and after 3 and 6 months, LVMI was blindly estimated by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, for comparison, by means of echocardiography. Of the 50 randomized patients, three were excluded from the study as nonresponders after 4 weeks; moreover, two patients taking benazepril and one taking nitrendipine discontinued the treatment after 2 months for adverse effects. Both monotherapies reduced systolic and diastolic BP to a similar extent. After 3 months, MRI-estimated LVMI decreased by 21.5 g/m2 in the benazepril and 8.8 g/m2 in the nitrendipine group, with an adjusted mean difference between the two groups of 11.1 g/m2 (95% CI, 7.3-14.8 g/m2; p = 0.0001). After 6 months, it decreased by 23.6 g/m2 and 10.0 g/m2, respectively, with an adjusted mean difference of 11.3 g/m2 (95% CI, 7.5-15.5; p = 0.0001) in favor of benazepril. In conclusion, despite a similar antihypertensive effect, benazepril led to a greater reduction in MRI-measured LVMI than did nitrendipine (-16.2% vs. -7.2%) in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "261": "The aim of the study was to assess prestarium effects on central and renal hemodynamics, blood lipids in hypertensive subjects. Prestarium was given in a daily dose 4-6 mg to 30 patients with essential hypertension stage II free of cardiac decompensation and renal failure. Echocardiography, tetrapolar chest rheoplethysmography with assessment of hemodynamics, radionuclide tracing of renal blood flow, tests for cholesterol and blood electrolytes were made before treatment, on treatment weeks 2-3 and 12. It was found that prestarium lowers blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Myocardial conductivity was not affected, whereas renal circulation activated. Low-density lipoproteins cholesterol fell. No significant changes in electrolytes were seen. The drug was well tolerated. In view of good clinical effect and tolerance prestarium is recommended for treatment of essential hypertension stage II in the absence of cardiac decompensation and renal dysfunction.",

    "270": "During recent decades, heart failure has become one of, if not the, most important syndrome(s) in the cardiovascular area in terms of prevalence, morbidity, healthcare costs and mortality. Although heart failure treatment has developed rapidly and several novel approaches aimed at preventing or retarding worsening of failure are available in addition to those providing symptomatic relief, many patients are still treated inappropriately. This is particularly true for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which, despite the fact that only slightly more than 50% of heart failure patients receive this form of therapy, should be given to all patients with the syndrome, irrespective of the severity. Heart failure patients are under the care of different types of doctors, including general practitioners (estimated 80-85%) and internists and geriatricians (10-15%); cardiologists see relatively few patients. Pertinent studies in heart failure have, however, been performed by the latter group and, in general, awareness of the clinical usefulness and prescription of ACE inhibitors is therefore highest amongst these specialists. As the management of heart failure is transmural in nature, proper education of the different echelons is mandatory. Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure are pivotal in this process. However, it is not an easy task to prepare guidelines that are applicable in all circumstances and can be used by any kind of doctor involved in heart failure care. It is even more difficult to ensure the guidelines are implemented and it requires the input of both individual doctors and the national and international medical associations. The European Society of Cardiology is dedicated to this educational process and, through its Educational and Training Programme Committee and relevant Working Groups such as the Working Group on Heart Failure, has already set programmes into motion.", 
    "271": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown in several large studies to prolong life and prevent disease progression in patients with heart failure and to prevent progression of left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Despite this, it appears that a significant proportion of eligible patients are not receiving these agents and not obtaining their benefits. Patients in clinical trials are generally more selected and homogeneous than heart failure patients in the community. Clinicians may often feel that the typical clinical trial patient is not representative of many patients in their own practices and that trial results are often not generalizable to practice. It is only with the emergence of evidence from trials which more closely represent community practice and the promotion of agreed management guidelines that ACE inhibitors will be used more widely. Specialists and primary care practitioners need to provide an integrated approach to heart failure management to achieve optimal outcomes for patients.", 
    "272": "Technological change in cardiovascular medicine is extremely rapid and is likely to continue to accelerate. Society, of course, demands that new products and services are clinically effective in combating disease, reducing disability and extending life. Society also requires them to be cost-effective. Within this framework there is a vital need to produce authoritative information to assist in making very important healthcare decisions. A strategy for assessing both the effectiveness and the economics of cardiovascular disease management programmes has four discrete, mutually reinforcing tasks: (1) identifying the technologies that need to be assessed, (2) collecting data on the selected technologies, (3) synthesizing the data collected, and (4) disseminating the information collected. There is no single strategy to prevent a global financial crisis in heart failure care. However, a set of recommendations have been proposed as a means to overcome major obstacles. These recommendations have been elaborated mainly from a practical point of view and, while they are not meant to be exhaustive, they may represent an agenda for action. Future research, and especially experience relating to the economics and outcomes of heart failure care developments, will be of utmost interest and may act as a basis for further healthcare decisions.", 
    "273": "The proportion of heart failure patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has increased over time, however, these drugs continue to be underutilized in this syndrome. There are a number of possible explanations for the failure of physicians to prescribe these agents optimally: (1) failure to recognize that heart failure is an important public health problem worthy of treatment; (2) failure to appreciate fully the magnitude of the clinical benefit of ACE inhibitors in heart failure; (3) failure to understand that the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors fully justify the cost of these drugs; (4) concern that the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors outweigh their clinical benefits; (5) belief that the benefits observed in clinical trials do not translate into clinical practice. In reality, heart failure is a very common, extremely disabling, costly and deadly disorder. ACE inhibitors substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality related to heart failure, do this cost effectively and with a favourable risk-benefit ratio. Despite these facts, many patients are still denied ACE inhibitor therapy. An improved educational effort and clear and practical guidelines are essential if the uptake of ACE inhibitors is to increase.",

    "275": "Patients in the neurohumoral substudy (n = 534) of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study had their neurohormones measured at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months post-infarction, were followed 38 +/- 7 months and had these values related to prognosis. All patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% early post-infarction. Atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine and plasma renin activity decreased progressively over time. Patients with events had a persistent increase in these neurohormones with those dying within the first 24 months of follow-up having the greatest increase. Treatment with captopril affected only plasma renin activity (increase) and aldosterone (decrease). For patients who remained asymptomatic for the first 3 months post-infarction (n = 471), by multivariate analyses (all neurohormones together with non-neurohumoral risk factors), 3-month plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone were the most closely related to the development of severe heart failure or to the combined end-points (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or severe heart failure). No neurohormone was related to recurrent myocardial infarction or to cardiovascular mortality. When the last neurohormone measured prior to an event was considered along with non-neurohumoral risk factors (adjusted univariate), atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine were associated with prognosis indicating that a time-dependent analysis identified a closer relationship between neurohormones and events than that identified by 3-month values. However, by multivariate analyses atrial natriuretic peptide was the only neurohormone associated with an event, being associated with the development of severe heart failure (P < 0.001) and the combined end-points (P = 0.022). However, when neurohormones were considered as binary variables, activated or non-activated (defined as > 1.96 SD above the mean of age-matched controls), an association between activation of norepinephrine prior to recurrent myocardial infarction (P < 0.001) and combined end-points (P < 0.01) and between activation of aldosterone and severe heart failure (P < 0.05) was identified.", 
    "276": "Neurohumoral activation decreases progressively post-infarction, but only in patients with a good prognosis. In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% and asymptomatic post-infarction plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at 3 months, aldosterone levels appeared to be the neurohormones most closely associated with prognosis. Increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone and norepinephrine appear to be temporally most closely associated with events.",

The antihypertensive effect was investigated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The trial was terminated consistent with the protocol by 501 (73.1%) patients, 36 (5.3%) were eliminated early and in 148 (21.6%) the prescribed protocol was not respected. 413 patients (82.4%) terminated the trial on monotherapy, the remaining 88 (17.6%) had combined treatment from the 8th week onwards. When the trial with monotherapy was terminated the drop of blood pressure was more marked already during the 4th week and this trend proceeded during the 8th and 12th week, while in patients who had combined treatment from the 8th week the authors did not observe a drop of the blood pressure between the 4th and 8th week. The investigated laboratory indicators displayed insignificant changes within the range of normal values. The preparation was well tolerated, the total number of undesirable effects was 11% (three patients discontinued because of a cough).

The trial comprised 163 patients who were treated first for four weeks by a monotherapy with 2 mg trandolapril. After these four weeks patients who attained normal blood pressure proceeded with trandolapril treatment. Hypertensive patients who did not attain normal diastolic pressure levels were treated for another four weeks by a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR. After four weeks of treatment with trandolapril 62 patients of 163 (37%) had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR reduced the diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 71.6% of the patients resistant to treatment with 2 mg trandolapril and in another 15.6% of patients it reduced the diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or more. After two months of treatment 60 patients had a normal blood pressure due to trandolapril (37%) and another 73 patients (45%) treated by a combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR, i.e. a total of 133 patients (82%) who originally suffered from moderately severe hypertension, attained a normal diastolic blood pressure. The mean decrease of diastolic pressure after two months of treatment was 19.5 mm Hg in \"non-respondents\" to trandolapril monotherapy and 23.6 mm Hg in \"respondents\". The mean decrease of systolic pressure in \"non-respondents\" and \"respondents\" after trandolapril treatment was 19.5 mm Hg and 35.0 mm Hg resp. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil was not only effective but was associated with a minimum of undesirable effects. The incidence of headaches declined significantly. The combination of the above preparations is useful also because both preparations have a cardio- and nephroprotective effect and do not affect the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Treatment with a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR is indicated in moderately severe hypertension not responding to monotherapy, in particular when associated with diabetes, hyperlipoproteinaemia, ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.",

After a 4-week placebo run-in phase, 116 obese, postmenopausal women with primary hypertension were randomised into two treatment groups receiving once daily dosages of either moexipril 7.5 mg or atenolol 25 mg initially (mean age: 57 +/- 7 years in both groups; mean weight: 94 kg in the moexipril group and 89 kg in the atenolol group, corresponding to a body mass index (BMI) of 35.2 kg/m2 and 34.1 kg/m2 in both groups, respectively). After 4 and 8 weeks, the dosages were uptitrated to moexipril 15 mg, or if necessary to moexipril 15 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg, or to atenolol 50 mg and atenolol 50 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, in patients whose blood pressure was not sufficiently controlled. At endpoint, metabolic parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, glucose, insulin) were not significantly altered in either treatment group. Most frequent adverse events under monotherapy (moexipril/atenolol) were asthenia (5.3/13.0%), headache (13.2/21.7%), cough (7.9/6.5%), pharyngitis (21.1/8.7%) and peripheral oedema (5.3/13.0%). Overall at least one AE was reported in 66% of the patients treated with moexipril and in 78% of those treated with atenolol. Reduction of SSBP/SDBP at endpoint was 14.7 +/- 1.9/10.0 +/- 1.1 and 8.7 +/- 1.9/8.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg after treatment with moexipril and atenolol, respectively.

    "288": "Obstructive uropathy impairs nephron growth and function and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease in both adults and children. The major focus of this review article is to examine the evidence implicating a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in the pathophysiology of obstructive uropathy. Recent in vivo studies using specific kinin receptor antagonists and transgenic animals overexpressing or lacking various components of the kallikrein-kinin system have documented that kinins are involved in the regulation of renal function and blood pressure. Multiple roles have been proposed for kinins in obstructive uropathy. Renal kallikrein gene expression is suppressed in the kidney with chronic (>7 days) complete ureteral obstruction. In contrast, ureteral obstruction stimulates renin expression, creating a state of intrarenal angiotensin excess and kinin deficiency, which plays an important role in mediating the increased renal vascular resistance and decreased renal blood flow in the obstructed kidney. In addition to their hemodynamic effects, kallikrein and kinins influence tubular functions. For example, kallikrein influences urinary acidification in the distal nephron, suggesting that dysregulation of kallikrein expression may contribute to the acidification defect in the obstructed kidney. Also, kinins exert direct diuretic and natriuretic effects in the collecting duct and may be important in mediating the post-obstructive diuresis after the relief of urinary obstruction. The kinin substrate, kininogen, is a potent inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Unlike kallikrein, kininogen synthesis is upregulated in the kidneys and liver of animals with urinary obstruction. By neutralizing cysteine proteases, kininogen may protect the tubular epithelium of obstructed nephrons from excessive apoptosis. The beneficial actions of kinins and kininogens on renal hemodynamics, tubular function, and cell survival suggest that strategies aimed at increasing intrarenal kinins, eg, ACE-kininase II inhibitors and kallikrein gene therapy, may represent a useful adjunct in the medical treatment of obstructive uropathy.", 
    "289": "Numerous pathological processes are involved in the renal tubulointerstitial fibrogenic reaction that occurs after ureteral ligation. Central to these maladaptive events is a florid interstitial monocytic infiltration of the tubulointerstitium, which is preceded by a proximal tubular up-regulation of macrophage chemoattractants. Once within the peritubular and periglomerular space, these macrophages are capable of releasing a potent armamentarium of peptide growth factors. TGF-beta has been singled out as a pivotal growth factor mediating fibrogenesis owing to its multifaceted effects on fibroblasts, tubular cells, matrix metalloproteinases, and TIMPs. A growing body of experimental studies using the rat hydronephrosis model is now demonstrating that angiotensin II may, in addition to its well-known hemodynamic effect, also be pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic.", 
    "290": "To investigate how antihypertensive drugs with different pharmacological properties affect ambulatory blood pressure (BP) the JAPANESE Study Group developed a database of clinic and ambulatory BPs before and after antihypertensive treatment of patients throughout Japan. Drugs evaluated were nilvadipine (n = 195; b.i.d, 4-8 mg/day), amlodipine (n = 75; q.d., 2.5-10 mg/day), lisinopril (n = 80; q.d., 10-20 mg/day) and bisoprolol (n = 49; q.d., 5-10 mg/day). The relationship between basal ambulatory BP and the hypotensive effect on ambulatory BP during treatment was examined. All antihypertensive drugs significantly decreased both clinic BP and ambulatory BP. The hypotensive effect determined by measurement of clinic BP was significantly greater than that determined by ambulatory BP. The hypotensive effect was positively correlated with basal ambulatory BP. However, there was a quantitative difference in this characteristic among the drugs. The critical daytime systolic ambulatory BP below which a hypotensive effect was not observed was extrapolated to 128, 127 and 124 mm Hg with nilvadipine, amlodipine and bisoprolol, respectively, while that with lisinopril was 97 mm Hg. The slope of the correlation coefficient between basal daytime ambulatory systolic BP and hypotensive effect with lisinopril was significantly smaller than those with the other drugs (P < 0.0001). The slope for the relationship between night-time ambulatory systolic BP and the hypotensive effect with bisoprolol was the steepest (P < 0.0001). Antihypertensive drugs with different pharmacological properties exhibited differing hypotensive effects on the basal ambulatory BP. Such differences in efficacy of the drugs on the basal ambulatory BP may reflect adverse effects of the drugs and the prognosis of hypertension.", 
    "291": "Angiotensin II, the principal effector of the renin-angiotensin cascade, stimulates a variety of physiological responses that support blood pressure and renal function. Abnormal generation of angiotensin II also contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension, arterial diseases, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and proteinuric progressive renal diseases. It is well recognized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors effectively limit the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric renal diseases towards end-stage renal disease, a capacity not necessarily shared by other blood pressure lowering agents. Whether angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists have the same renoprotective effect as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in progressive renal diseases remains ill defined. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists as antiproteinuric agents have been used originally in animal models of renal disease progression. Results have shown that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers are as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in normalizing proteinuria in models of renal disease. Studies in humans are very few, but those that have been undertaken report consistent antiproteinuric effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists that are similar to those with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Long-term studies, however, are required to examine whether the antiproteinuric effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists can be translated into renoprotection.", 
    "292": "Previous experiments showed that enalapril (EN) treatment as well as enalaprilic acid, when added to the perfusion bath, diminish the inotropic response of the papillary muscles to isoproterenol (ISO). The main objective of this study was to evaluate, in normal rats, the effect of EN on basal contractility and inotropic response to ISO on the whole perfused ventricles (Langendorff preparation). Blood pressure (BP), increase in body weight (IBW), ventricular weight/body weight ratio (R) and concentration of ventricular proteins and DNA were also analyzed. Five groups were studied: EN10: 5 mg/kg/day, 10 days; EN21(L): 5mg/kg/day, 21 days; EN21(H): 15 mg/kg/day, 21 days. C10 and C21 were untreated controls. Cardiac contractility was evaluated by the maximal developed pressure, maximal rate of rise of pressure and maximal velocity of relaxation; no changes were found due to EN treatments either on basal conditions or on ISO stimulation. Significant differences (p<0.05 vs C21) were: lower BP and R in EN21(L) and EN21(H), slower IBW in EN21(H), decreased ventricular DNA in EN21(H). In conclusion, daily treatment for ten or twenty one days with enalapril does not change either basal cardiac contractile performance or inotropic response to ISO in the Langendorff preparation. Longterm treatment with EN seems to modify nuclear processes involved in cardiomyocite DNA content.", 
    "293": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have been shown to prevent impairment of endothelial cell function in Spontaneous Hypertensive rats (SHR). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of early, long-term captopril (ACE-I) treatment and its withdrawal on vascular reactivity in SHR. Three groups of male SHR were studied: 1) untreated SHR; 2) SHR treated with captopril in-utero and maintained on oral treatment post-weaning (SHRCAP); and 3) SHR treated with captopril in-utero followed by withdrawal of drug therapy at two months of age (OFFCAP). All rats were studied at six months of age. Isolated aortic ring segments were suspended in tissue chambers for measurement of isometric force. Ring segments were exposed to cumulative concentrations of serotonin or phenylephrine (3 x 10(-9)-3 x 10(-5) M). SHR demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to serotonin induced contraction. EC50 value were: SHR 3.6+/-1.4 x 10(-7)M, SHRCAP 9.5+/-0.5 x 10(-7) and OFFCAP 8.1+/-0.9 x 10(-7). Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) was markedly impaired in the SHR. Maximum relaxation (Rmax) to ACh was 61.1+/-1.6% of serotonin induced contraction versus 91.4 +/- 1.2% and 90.7 + 1.8% relaxation in SHRCAP and OFFCAP, respectfully (p<0.05). These data suggest that early, long-term treatment with captopril can prevent alterations in endothelial function observed in SHR even after ACE-inhibitor therapy has been stopped.", 
    "294": "We present results from a Swedish retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of felodipine-metoprolol (Logimax) and enalapril in hypertension. In the 8-week trial, the average reduction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the share of patients reaching target DBP were both significantly greater in the felodipine-metoprolol group. Cost of treatment (costs of drugs and physician visits) was somewhat higher in the felodipine-metoprolol group. After 8 weeks, an extra 4.8 mmHg reduction and an additional 22% of patients reaching target DBP were achieved with felodipine-metoprolol at the extra cost of SEK 19 (Swedish kronor, $US I=SEK 7.90). The incremental cost per mmHg reduction and per patient reaching target DBP was calculated at SEK 4 and SEK 86, respectively. Average cost-effectiveness ratios showed that the costs per mmHg reduction and per patient reaching target DBP after 8 weeks were 40 and 34% lower in the felodipine-metoprolol group, respectively. In conclusion, felodipine-metoprolol is cost-effective in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "295": "Sixty consecutive normotensive patients with unstable angina pectoris, who were on continuous intravenous isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) treatment and had not previously received angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or diuretics were randomly assigned to treatment groups receiving intravenous ISDN for 72 hours. No additional treatment was given to group A (n = 15). Captopril, in a test dose of 6.25 mg, and followed by 12.5 mg 3 times daily for 24 hours and 25 mg 3 times daily for the next 24 hours, was given to group B (n = 15). The same dose of captopril plus 40 mg of furosemide in the morning were given to group C (n = 15). Losartan, in a single dose of 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg after 24 hours was given to group D (n = 15). Nitrate tolerance was evaluated at 24-hour intervals at trough levels of each of the drugs by administering intravenous ISDN (1 mg bolus dose every 4 minutes) and recording the total ISDN test dose required to decrease the mean arterial blood pressure by > or =10%. Treatment with continuous ISDN only (group A) induced nitrate tolerance. The ISDN (mean +/- SD) test dose was 3.5 +/- 1.8 mg at baseline, increasing to 4.9 +/- 2.4 mg at 24 hours, and 8.0 +/- 3.0 mg at 48 hours. The addition of increasing doses of captopril to the continuous ISDN treatment (group B) completely prevented nitrate tolerance. Losartan, however, did not attenuate nitrate tolerance at 24 hours and attenuated it only partially at 48 hours. The addition of furosemide to captopril had no further effect on nitrate tolerance. Of 15 patients in group A (ISDN only), 4 (27%) experienced recurrent ischemic events requiring urgent coronary catheterization. No such events were recorded in group B (captopril), but did occur in 1 patient in each of group C (captopril plus furosemide) and D (losartan) (p = 0.083). Thus, the addition of captopril to the ISDN treatment regimen prevented tolerance to nitrates and improved angina control with apparent safety. Losartan also decreased nitrate tolerance, although to a lesser extent, and also improved angina control. The addition of furosemide to captopril conferred no further benefit.",

In one study of patients achieving intensified, strict control of blood pressure (target<140/85 mmHg) with either cilazapril or amlodipine, glomerular filtration rate declined by 2.03+/-0.66 ml/ min/1.73 m2 per year and 2.01+/-0.71 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively, in the subgroup with normoalbuminuria and by 2.15+/-0.69 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year and 2.33+/-0.83 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 per year, respectively, in the subgroup with microalbuminuria. Renal lesions in NIDDM patients were found to be structurally heterogeneous and glomerular filtration rate appeared to decline only in patients with renal structural changes typical of NIDDM.", 
    "298": "The extent of blood pressure control, rather than the method by which this is accomplished, is the most important factor in determining the evolution of incipient nephropathy in hypertensive NIDDM. The kidneys of microalbuminuric NIDDM patients are structurally heterogeneous with less than one-third of patients having 'typical' diabetic nephropathology.", 
    "299": "During the past two decades, major investigative interest has focused on the determinants of chronic renal disease and interventions that retard the inexorable progression to end-stage renal disease. Recent studies have provided a theoretic framework for anticipating that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and possibly calcium antagonists, may preferentially retard the progression of renal disease. Whereas the majority of available clinical trials have assessed the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, relatively few long-term studies have evaluated the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists in patients with nondiabetic renal disease. Recent observations suggest that the two classes of drugs act in a complementary manner to countervail pathogenetic mechanisms at the level of the mesangium. Such observations recently prompted randomized prospective studies that compare the renoprotective effects of calcium antagonist versus ACE inhibitor monotherapy in both diabetic patients and patients with nondiabetic renal disease.", 
    "300": "Hypertension, a known independent risk factor for end-stage renal failure, damages the kidney in multiple ways. It produces hemodynamic and mechanical stress, which may lead to glomerular endothelial dysfunction. Both of these mechanisms may lead to increased glomerular leakiness, hence proteinuria, which may damage the kidney further. Hypertension may also stimulate the production of vasoactive substances that, in turn, activate the production of cytokines and growth factors, leading to the production of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, the progression of renal failure is related to both systemic and glomerular hemodynamic changes and to the activation of vasoactive hormones, growth factors and cytokines.", 
    "301": "To protect the kidney, we need to control or prevent the occurrence of these factors. Therapy with effective antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has been shown to slow the progression of end-stage renal disease.",

Pressor responses to stepwise, incremental doses of angiotensin I were measured at 1 and 10 hours after dosing. The dose required to raise mean blood pressure by 20 mm Hg (PD20) was calculated individually, and the ratio of PD20 during enalaprilat to that during placebo (dose ratio, DR) was used for assessment of the extent of ACE inhibition. The pressor response was significantly attenuated at 1 hour after enalaprilat in both groups, but significant attenuation was evident at 10 hours after dose only in the II subjects. The DRs at both 1 hour (median, 5.43 versus 2.82, P=0.0035) and 10 hours (2.06 versus 0.84, P=0.0008) after enalaprilat were significantly higher in II subjects than in DD subjects.", 
    "304": "The effect of enalaprilat was significantly greater and lasted longer in normotensive men homozygous for the II ACE genotype. By multivariate analysis, ACE (I/D) genotype and plasma angiotensin II levels were predictive of >50% of the variation in response to ACE inhibition.", 
    "305": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has been shown to inhibit fibrogenesis in the lung, but the mechanisms underlying this action are unclear. Apoptosis of lung epithelial cells is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. For these reasons, we studied the effect of captopril on Fas-induced apoptosis in a human lung epithelial cell line. Monoclonal antibodies that activate the Fas receptor induced epithelial cell apoptosis as detected by chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA fragmentation, and increased activities of caspase-1 and -3. Apoptosis was not induced by isotype-matched nonimmune mouse immunoglobulins or nonactivating anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies. When applied simultaneously with anti-Fas antibodies, 50 ng/ml of captopril completely abrogated apoptotic indexes based on morphology, DNA fragmentation, and inducible caspase-1 activity and significantly decreased the inducible activity of caspase-3. Inhibition of apoptosis by captopril was concentration dependent, with an IC50 of 70 pg/ml. These data suggest that the inhibitory actions of captopril on pulmonary fibrosis may be related to prevention of lung epithelial cell apoptosis.",

These sex differences persisted after adjustment for all factors that could have influenced the choice of these antihypertensive drugs (indications and contra-indications for the four antihypertensive drug classes). The sex differences in antihypertensive drug use were smaller among hypertensives with a history of cardiovascular disease (adjusted PORs, female/male, for beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors, respectively, compared to diuretics were 0.80 with 95% CI 0.20-3.24, 0.40 with 95% CI 0.10-0.48 and 0.64 with 95% CI 0.12-3.39) than among those without such a history.",

Invasive treatment reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure from 157/99 to 140/87 mmHg and the number of antihypertensive drugs used from 2.6 to 1.4 in 16 patients (mean age 49 years). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was effective in four elderly patients. Cost-efficacy analysis Screening with CRG and invasive treatment cost US$15400 per successful invasive treatment Equally effective pharmacological treatment would have cost US$10400. Limiting the screening with CRG to the 173 patients with no obvious renal parenchymal disease and with hypertension at a younger age (< or =30 years) or unresponsive to two antihypertensive drugs (diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) would have yielded a prevalence of 12% and missed only one elderly patient who responded to ACE inhibition.

To help confirm the presence of renovascular hypertension, captopril renography was performed but showed no significant changes compared with baseline renography. Renography was performed again after losartan administration and showed impaired renal function.

The vasodilator responses to glyceryl trinitrate were impaired in patients (p < 0.02). In normal controls, serotonin produced initial dilatation, followed by vasoconstriction at high doses. In patients, no vasodilator responses were observed, only late vasoconstriction (p < 0.03).", 
    "327": "The vascular responses of patients are confirmed as being abnormal. The lack of response to L-NMMA suggests that nitric oxide does not contribute to basal vascular tone in patients with chronic heart failure. The responses to glyceryl trinitrate and to serotonin suggest that there is both smooth muscle and endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic heart failure.",

Hemodynamics and plasma catecholamine concentrations were studied. Before administration of enalapril, syncope induced by HUT was associated with vigorous hypotension and bradycardia. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were significantly elevated during NMS compared with the supine position before tilt. Oral enalapril rather than placebo produced a marked reduction in diastolic blood pressure during supine positioning before tilt. Administration of enalapril prevented HUT-induced NMS and increase of plasma catecholamine concentrations in all patients examined. Conversely, placebo had no effect in the majority of patients with NMS (12 of 15 subjects). Follow-up data showed that NMS disappeared in 14 (93%) of 15 patients treated with enalapril.",

All underwent full electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies at baseline and after 6 months of monotherapy, 29 with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 39 with calcium antagonists. QT dispersion was calculated by subtracting the shortest QT from the longest QT, in absolute value (QTmax - QTmin). It was also corrected with Bazett's formula (QTc dispersion). Left ventricular mass index was assessed according to the Devereux formula. After treatment, LVH decreased with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (from 155 to 130 g/m2, P < .001) and calcium antagonists (156 to 133/92/m2, P < .001). QT dispersion decreased both after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (from 82 to 63 ms) and calcium antagonist treatment (from 77 to 63 ms, both P < .001 ). There was a significant correlation of QT dispersion and left ventricular mass after therapy (r = 0.36, P < .005). There was a correlation of the degree of LVH and QT dispersion decrease (r = 0.27, P < .05).",

    "334": "Elevated urinary calcium and phosphate excretion have been observed in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). This may be related to a defect in tubular reabsorption. It is well known that converting enzyme inhibition decreases microalbuminuria and may prevent or retard diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether enalapril also improves the defect in calcium and phosphate reabsorption. We studied 16 children and young adults (age 12-21 years) with IDDM and persistent microalbuminuria before and during 12 weeks of enalapril treatment. Before treatment microalbuminuria, urinary calcium excretion, and fractional tubular phosphorus reabsorption (TPR) were 153+/-53 microg/min, 5.5+/-0.9 mg/kg per day, and 71.4+/-3.6%, respectively. At the end of the 12th week, microalbuminuria had decreased to 20.3+/-7.9 microg/min and calcium excretion to 3.3+/-0.4 mg/kg per day (P<0.01), while the TPR increased to 80.1+/-3.8% (NS). The renal threshold phosphate concentration increased from 1.8+/-0.15 to 2.92+/-0.23 mg/dl (P<0.01). The fasting serum glucose and hemoglobin Alc levels did not change significantly during the study. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 120.4+/-2.2 / 79.3+/-1.4 mm Hg and 110.5+/-1.8 / 71.3+/-0.9 mm Hg before and after 12 weeks, respectively. We conclude that enalapril treatment improves not only microalbuminuria but also abnormal calcium and phosphate excretion in microalbuminuric children with IDDM.", 
    "335": "Post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) is increasingly recognized as a complication of kidney transplantation. In this study we report the effect of the angiotesin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on hematocrit (Ht) and erythropoietin in four patients with PTE. Four renal allograft recipients with Ht greater than 51% were studied. Treatment was initiated with enalapril administered orally at a dose of 2.5 mg/day. All the patients had an increase of hemoglobin (Hb) (17.7 +/- 0.64 g/dl), Ht (54.5 +/- 1.29%) and red blood cell count (RBC) (584 +/- 19.2 x 10(4)/microliter). All patients responded to enalapril in 8 weeks with a significant decrease of Hb, Ht, and RBC. In one patient, the downward trend was more rapid and sustained, and treatment had to be discontinued to prevent the development of anemia. Serum erythropoietin showed normal in all four patients and remained unchanged during the study, even after discontinuation of enalapril treatment. Serum creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the study. These results suggest that PTE may not be dependent upon circulating erythropoietin and that enalapril treatment may be an effective treatment of PTE without renal dysfunction.", 
    "336": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) appears in about 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes (D1) and 15 to 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes (D2). It is preceded by microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is defined as an albumin excretion rate between 30 and 300 mg/24 h (on a 24-hour urine collection) or between 20 and 200 micrograms/min (on an overnight collection) in at least two out of three consecutive collections made within a 6-month period. Alternative screening techniques use either dipstick (Micral-Test II) or the albumin to creatinine ratio on an early morning urine sample (30-300 mg/g creatinine). Once persistent microalbuminuria is confirmed, 80% of type 1 diabetic patients and 20 to 50% of type 2 diabetic patients will progress to DN. In D2, microalbuminuria also represents a powerful predictor of early mortality from cardiovascular disease. Macroalbuminuria (AER > 300 mg/24 h, corresponding to a total protein excretion > 500 mg/24 h) will eventually lead to a end-stage renal insufficiency within 10 to 20 years. In D2, numerous patients will die from cardiovascular disease before reaching end-stage renal failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can slow down the evolution toward DN when prescribed when microalbuminuria appears. Screening for microalbuminuria should therefore be a part of the annual clinical assessment in every diabetic patient.",

While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Right ventricular long axis amplitude and rates of change were all reduced (p < 0.001), the onset of transtricuspid Doppler was delayed by 160 ms after the pulmonary second sound versus 40 ms in normals (p < 0.001) and overall RV filling time reduced to 59% of total diastole. Right ventricular relaxation was very incoordinate and peak E wave velocity was reduced. Peak RV to right atrial (RA) pressure drop, estimated from tricuspid regurgitation, was 45+/-6 mm Hg, and peak pulmonary stroke distance was 40% lower than normal (p < 0.001). With ACE-I, LV isovolumic relaxation time lengthened, E wave acceleration and deceleration rates decreased and RV to RA pressure drop fell to 30+/-5 mm Hg (p < 0.001) versus pre-ACE-I. Right ventricular long axis dynamics did not change, but tricuspid flow started 85 ms earlier to occupy 85% of total diastole; E wave amplitude increased but acceleration and deceleration rates were unaltered. Values of long axis systolic and diastolic measurements did not change. Peak pulmonary artery velocity increased (p < 0.01).",

This article reviews results from recent trials suggesting that the etiology of HF, and particularly whether it is ischemic or nonischemic, may influence the long-term prognosis and the response to treatment. Some studies, but not all, suggest that nonischemic HF has a better prognosis than ischemic HF. The data on the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in ischemic versus nonischemic HF are conflicting. Carvedilol, and recently, bisoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality in ischemic and nonischemic HF, whereas metoprolol has, to date, improved prognosis only in dilated cardiomyopathy. Better responses to digoxin, amlodipine and amiodarone have been reported in non-ischemic HF. There is at present no clear explanation for the apparent therapeutic differences between ischemic and nonischemic HF. Absence of a rigorous definition of \"nonischemic HF\" in many studies makes interpretation of the results difficult. Further studies to clarify the effects of etiology of HF on the response to treatment could be particularly important for preventing progression to more advanced stages, in which any type of drug therapy may have limited value in prolonging survival. An individualized therapeutic approach, based on etiology of HF and possibly other factors such as plasma drug levels or the levels of neurohormones, could result in major progress in treating HF patients.", 
    "353": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy results in an increase in cardiac output without an increase in heart rate suggesting a positive inotropic effect. This cannot be explained by changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin concentrations. Angiotensin converting enzyme may also metabolise vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a vasodilator and positive inotrope whose concentration in the heart declines in heart failure. We sought to determine whether changes in plasma VIP or its metabolism might explain the positive inotropic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We also measured VIP in the heart to determine whether a local increase in VIP might explain this effect. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to control and enalapril groups (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). After 7 days, rats were anaesthetised and underwent metabolic clearance studies for VIP or had hearts, lungs and kidneys removed and snap frozen. VIP concentrations in plasma, infusate and tissue extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma concentrations of VIP were unchanged by treatment with enalapril (control: 7.7 +/- 0.8 pmol l(-1); enalapril: 7.9 +/- 0.8 pmol l(-1) ), while the metabolic clearance rate of) VIP increased significantly (control: 10.4 +/- 1.4 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1); enalapril: 17.3 +/- 1.6 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1); p < 0.005).

VIP in the heart increased after enalapril (control: 208.4 +/- 39.0 pmol g (-1); enalapril: 928.9 +/- 123.6 fmol g(-1); P < 0.0005). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition increases the metabolism of VIP.

    "360": "Risk factors for coronary artery disease should be controlled after MI in older persons. A serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >125 mg/dL after MI should be treated with lipid-lowering drug therapy to decrease the serum LDL cholesterol to <100 mg/dL. Aspirin in a dose of 160 mg to 325 mg daily should be given indefinitely. Indications for long-term anticoagulant therapy with warfarin after MI to maintain an international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0 include secondary prevention of MI in persons unable to tolerate daily aspirin, persistent atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombus. Beta-blockers should be given indefinitely. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be given to persons who have congestive heart failure, an anterior MI, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. Calcium channel blockers should not be used unless there is persistent angina pectoris despite beta-blockers and nitrates. Antiarrhythmic drugs other than beta-blockers should not be used. An automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be used in persons who have a history of ventricular fibrillation or serious sustained ventricular tachycardia or who are at very high risk for developing sudden cardiac death. Until data from the Heart Estrogen/ Progestin Replacement Study are available, use of an estrogen/progestin regimen is recommended in the treatment of postmenopausal women after MI unless they are at increased risk for developing breast cancer. The two indications for revascularization in older persons after MI are prolongation of life and relief of unacceptable symptoms despite optimal medical management.",

Future work is needed to identify those patients most likely to benefit from treatment by geriatricians and to determine how care can be optimally coordinated among different types of physicians and health providers.", 
    "368": "1. Nitric oxide (NO) has important roles in physiological vasodilatation, cytotoxicity and vascular disease. Nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI2), both released from the endothelium, act synergistically to inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion. These autacoids also inhibit the adhesion and migration of leucocytes and, in some arteries, they synergize in terms of vasodilation. 2. The development of atherosclerosis and hyperlipaemia per se is accompanied by impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. 3. Atherosclerosis is associated with marked changes in the activity of isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) in the artery wall, including increased expression of the NOS2 (inducible) isoform in complex human lesions as well as in the neointima of experimental animal models. 4. Failure of NO release from the endothelium with normal physiological stimuli, which has been attributed to a defect in the operation of the endothelial NOS (NOS3), provides conditions propitious for leucocyte adhesion, vasospasm, thrombosis and, in addition, may promote increased proliferation of intimal cells. 5. Nitric oxide and superoxide anions generated by inflammatory cells in atherosclerosis react to form cytodestructive peroxynitrite radicals, potentially causing injury to the endothelium and myocytes, and this may be a factor in apoptosis of cells leading to plaque rupture. 6. We have been able to reverse these NO defects with therapeutic agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antagonists of platelet-activating factor and NO donor compounds, all offering promise in protecting against some manifestations of vascular disease.", 
    "369": "1. One of the most important issues in the field of hypertension research centres on the therapeutic use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Inhibitors of the RAS have potent anti-hypertensive effects, even in experimental models of hypertension and in human essential hypertension, where the activity of the peripheral RAS is low or normal. 2. It is suggested here that determining the mechanisms by which activation of the peripheral RAS produces hypertension will help us determine the anti-hypertensive effects of these inhibitors in low/normal renin-angiotensin hypertension. 3. Three hypotheses describing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin are discussed. The first hypothesis involves the direct vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin. The second hypothesis suggests that chronic angiotensin produces hypertension by increasing Na+ reabsorption leading to volume expansion and hypertension. The final hypothesis suggests that, in angiotensin-induced hypertension, the increased Na+ reabsorption is not associated with volume expansion but, rather, is associated with an increase in vascular tone resulting from an interaction between angiotensin and the nervous system. 4. It is also hypothesized that the interaction between angiotensin and the nervous system produces a differential activation of sympathetic outflow that spares the kidney.", 
    "370": "A simple, highly accurate and precise method for the quantitative measurement of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in human plasma is presented. The assay is based on gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The preparation of stable isotope labelled lisinopril for use as an internal standard is described. The method involves solid phase extraction on C18 sorbent and derivatization to the methyl diester-trifluoroacetamide derivatives. The detection limit was found to be 50 pg and a lower limit of quantification was reached down to 0.5 ng/mL plasma.", 
    "371": "Molecular biology techniques, to be applicable to a diagnostic renal biopsy specimen, should (1) be highly sensitive to be performed on a very small quantity of tissue; (2) be quantitative because they have to analyze genes normally expressed in the tissue and (3) allow the analysis of as large a number of genes as possible. Among different methods, only the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT/-PCR) might comply with previous requisites, but the few RT/-PCR examples on renal biopsies in the literature do not allow starting RNA quantification and quality control; furthermore they have the drawback of analyzing only few genes. In an ongoing study to assess the expression of a number of genes in glomeruli and in tubulointerstitium of patients with different nephropathies, we developed a comparative RT/-PCR kinetic strategy based on the purification and quantification of total glomerular and tubulointerstitial RNA and on the use of an internal standard, the housekeeping gene G3PDH. We demonstrate that in microdissected diagnostic renal biopsies (1) glomerular and interstitial starting RNA can be quantified; (2) the G3PDH gene may be used both as an internal standard and as an indirect marker of RNA integrity; (3) as low as 28 ng of total RNA is sufficient to obtain PCR products of eight genes, and (4) it is worth to operate on microdissected biopsy specimens because of the different expression of genes in the two renal compartments.", 
    "372": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are important therapeutic agents for treating patients with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Although most ACE inhibitors are cleared by the kidney via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, little is known about their reabsorption potential. In particular, it is believed that while certain ACE inhibitors are transported by the intestinal peptide transporter (PepT1), these same compounds do not interact with the renal peptide transporter (PepT2). In the present study, we examined the interaction of quinapril with the high-affinity peptide transporter, PepT2. Studies were performed in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles in which the uptake of [14C]glycylsarcosine (GlySar), at low substrate concentrations, was examined in the absence and presence of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors). We found that quinapril was capable of cis-inhibiting the uptake of GlySar and in a concentration-dependent manner. While the Ki for quinapril ( approximately 1 mM) was several-fold higher than the Km for GlySar ( approximately 160 microM), the interaction was unique in that inhibition of PepT2 was of a noncompetitive type. Overall, the data suggest that quinapril is a low-affinity inhibitor of the renal peptide transporter and that it binds to a site distinct from that of the GlySar binding site.", 
    "373": "The combination of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is a candidate therapy for hypertension and cardiac failure. Given that NEP and ACE metabolize angiotensin (Ang) and bradykinin (BK) peptides, we investigated the effects of NEP inhibition and combined NEP and ACE inhibition on the levels of these peptides. We administered the NEP inhibitor ecadotril (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mg/kg per day), either alone or together with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (0.2 mg/kg per day), to rats by 12 hourly gavage for 7 days. Ecadotril produced diuresis, natriuresis, increased urine cyclic guanosine monophosphate and BK-(1-9) levels, increased Ang II and Ang I levels in plasma, and increased Ang I levels in heart. Perindopril reduced Ang II levels in kidney, and increased BK-(1-9) levels in blood, kidney and aorta. Combined NEP/ACE inhibition produced the summation of these effects of separate NEP and ACE inhibition. In addition, perindopril potentiated the ecadotril-mediated diuresis, natriuresis and decrease in urine BK-(1-7)/BK-(1-9) ratio, which is an index of BK-(1-9) metabolism. Moreover, combined NEP/ACE inhibition increased Ang II levels in plasma and lung. These data indicate that summation of the effects of separate NEP and ACE inhibition provides the basis for the therapeutic efficacy of their combination. Whereas potentiation by perindopril of the diuretic and natriuretic effects of ecadotril may contribute to the therapeutic effects, increased Ang II levels in plasma and lung may compromise the therapeutic effects of combined NEP/ACE inhibition.", 
    "374": "Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have been found to have greater peri-infarction and postinfarction mortality. In this study, we evaluated the postinfarction survival, susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, and degree of LVH and cardiac fibrosis in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the direct vasodilator hydralazine on these characteristics.", 
    "375": "An acute myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Rats were randomized to either control (n=50), hydralazine (n=41), or ramipril (n=45). Treatments were started 4 hours after infarction and continued for 8 weeks. Ramipril and hydralazine reduced arterial pressure similarly. Medications were stopped 72 hours before euthanasia, at which time hemodynamic, programmed electrophysiological stimulation (PES), and morphological studies were performed. Mortality was decreased in ramipril (56%) compared with hydralazine (78%) and control (82%) SHRs (P=0.008). This was accompanied by a decrease in myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis and a decrease in inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias by PES in the ramipril group regardless of MI size. Treatment with hydralazine had little or no effect on LVH and cardiac fibrosis and did not modify inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias by PES. Ramipril but not hydralazine prevented the increase in LV end-diastolic pressure in rats with large MIs.",

    "377": "Dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridine CCB) adversely affect renal function in diabetes. The effects of dihydropyridine CCB on 24-h urinary protein excretion rate and GFR decline (deltaGFR) were prospectively evaluated in 117 nondiabetic patients with chronic, proteinuric nephropathies enrolled in the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study and randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy. Sixty-three percent of patients were treated with dihydropyridine CCB. During follow-up, CCB-treated compared with no CCB patients had higher proteinuria (mean+/-SEM: 4.8+/-0.2 g/24 h versus 4.2+/-0.2 g/24 h, respectively, P = 0.015) and mean arterial BP (MAP). The difference in proteinuria was significant in the placebo group (5.1+/-0.2 g/24 h versus 4.3+/-0.3 g/24 h, P = 0.02), but not in the ACEI group (4.4+/-0.2 g/24 h versus 4.1+/-0.2 g/24 h). Of note, CCB-treated patients had significantly less proteinuria (P = 0.028) in the ACEI group compared with placebo. CCB-treated versus no CCB patients had a faster deltaGFR in the overall study population and in the placebo group, but not in the Ramipril group. Proteinuria was comparable in CCBtreated and no CCB patients for MAP < or = 100 mmHg, but was higher in CCB-treated patients for MAP >100 mmHg. Similarly, proteinuria was comparable in the placebo and in the ACEI group for MAP < or = 100 mmHg, but was higher in the placebo group for MAP >100 mmHg. In CCB- and placebo-treated patients, a linear correlation (P = 0.006 for both groups) was found between proteinuria and MAP values. MAP, proteinuria, and deltaGFR in patients given nifedipine versus those given other dihydropyridine CCB were comparable. Thus, in nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies, dihydropyridine CCB may have an adverse effect on renal protein handling that depends on the severity of hypertension and is minimized by ACEI therapy or tight BP control. ACE inhibitors may electively limit proteinuria in patients on dihydropyridine CCB treatment and/or with uncontrolled hypertension.", 
    "378": "1. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of captopril on both dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in the rat central nervous system. 2. Slices of rat striatum were prepared and prelabelled with [3H]-dopamine or [3H]-choline. Slices were continuously superfused with Krebs'-Ringer solution and electrical stimulation (1 Hz) was performed. 3. Captopril significantly inhibited stimulation-evoked [3H]-dopamine release from rat striatal slices in a concentration-dependent manner (S2/S1 ratios: control 0.835 +/- 0.018 (n = 6); 1 x 10(-5) mol/L captopril 0.597 +/- 0.035 (n = 6; P < 0.05); 5 x 10(-5) mol/L captopril 0.561 +/- 0.041 (n = 6; P < 0.05)). However, the basal release of [3H]-dopamine was not affected by captopril. 4. Captopril also reduced stimulation-evoked [3H]-acetylcholine release in the striatum (S2/S1 ratios: control 0.891 +/- 0.016 (n = 6); 1 x 10(-5) mol/L captopril 0.794 +/- 0.011 (n = 6; P < 0.05)). 5. These results show that captopril inhibits the release of both dopamine and acetylcholine in the rat striatum. Although the mechanisms underlying the neurosuppressive effects of captopril remain to be determined, the findings suggest that the inhibition of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission may be related to the central action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.",

Women who reported the use of calcium channel blockers had no increased risk of newly diagnosed cancer compared with those taking other cardiovascular drugs (relative risk=1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.26). The relative risk of dying from cancer associated with the self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI 0.91-1.72). Relative risks were adjusted for the following self-reported factors: age; weight; height; cholesterol level; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; smoking; alcohol intake; physical activity; menopausal status; postmenopausal hormone use; aspirin use; and history of diabetes, cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, angina, and hypertension.

    "383": "Brief postirradiation treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of radiation nephropathy in rats. The efficacy of brief treatment with an ACE inhibitor was shown to be greatest when the animals were young when irradiated and when the treatment was given 4 to 10 weeks after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In further studies with a BMT nephropathy model, we have shown that brief treatment with an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist (AII blocker) is even more effective than brief treatment with an ACE inhibitor. We have also shown that an NO synthase inhibitor, which exacerbated radiation nephropathy when given continuously, has no effect when given during the postirradiation interval when ACE inhibitors and AII blockers were most effective. Studies also showed that the loss of efficacy of brief treatment with increased age at irradiation parallels the decrease in radiosensitivity that occurs with increasing age at irradiation, but that this decrease in radiosensitivity is not sufficient to explain the loss of efficacy of brief treatment. These data indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is important in the expression of renal radiation injury, particularly between 4 and 10 weeks after irradiation.", 
    "384": "1. The aim of the present study was to examine whether ramipril induces delayed myocardial protection against free radical injuries ex vivo and to determine the possible role of the bradykinin B2-nitric oxide (NO) pathway, prostaglandins(PGs) and protein synthesis in this delayed adaptive response. 2. Rats were pretreated with ramipril (10 or 50 microg kg(-1), i.v.) and hearts were isolated after 24, 48 and 72 h. Langendorff hearts were subjected to 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-induced injury. 3. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and its maximal increase velocity (+ dP/dtmax), coronary flow (CF), heart rate (HR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in coronary effluent and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the myocardium were measured. 4. The results showed that in the DPPH control group, 20 min after free radical-induced injury, LVDP, +dP/dtmax, CF, HR declined, whereas TBARS and LDH increased significantly. The above cardiac function parameters were significantly improved in RAM-pretreated rats after 24 and 48 h. 5. Pretreatment with HOE 140, the selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, NG-nitro-L-arginine, the NO synthase inhibitor, and actinomycin D, the RNA transcription inhibitor, prior to ramipril injection abolished the beneficial effects of ramipril at 24 h while indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, pretreatment had no effect on ramipril-induced delayed protection. 6. In conclusion, ramipril induces delayed myocardial protection against free radical injury in the rat heart. This delayed protection was sustained for 48 h, is associated with the bradykinin B2 receptor-NO pathway and depends on protein but not prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "385": "1. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the existence, location and functional importance of an alternative angiotensin II-forming pathway other than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the human saphenous vein (SV). 2. Vascular reactivity studies using an in vitro organ bath technique showed that the SV (n=20) produced similar maximum contractions in response to angiotensin I (41.5+/-5.4 mN) compared to those observed to angiotensin II (46.7+/-10.9 mN). The response to angiotensin I could be significantly inhibited (P<0.05) by incubation with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (1 microM). 3. Prior incubation of segments of SV with either captopril (1 microM) (n=6), quinaprilat (1 microM) (n=7), or the chymase inhibitor soya bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) (10 microM) (n=7) singularly failed to have any inhibitory effect on the response to angiotensin I. However when vessel segments (n=7) were co-incubated with quinaprilat (1 microM) and SBTI (10 microM), the SV exhibited a rightward shift in curve profile to angiotensin I and a markedly reduced maximum response 12.5+/-2.4 mN, when compared to control (30.4+/-7.6 mN), quinaprilat (24.5+/-9.4 mN), and SBTI (31.6+/-10.7 mN) on their own. 4. An immunohistochemical technique employing streptavidin biotin peroxidase localised ACE to both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells while chymase was confined to mast cells in the adventitia of the vessel wall. 5. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the existence of an alternative angiotensin I converting pathway to that of ACE, involving chymase. Therefore, there is the capacity for a continuation of angiotensin II formation, in the presence of ACE inhibition.",

The second phase of this study has documented the 1 year survival of 2,152 patients (84%). The population comprised 1,533 men and 619 women with a mean age of 67 years. Severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%) was observed in 18% of patients and clinical signs of cardiac failure were present in 35% of patients in the first 5 days of infarction. The mortality was 8.2% at 5 days, 13.2% at 28 days and 19.5% at one year. In multivariate analysis, the principal predictive factor of mortality at 1 year was age (RR = 1.06, p = 0.0001): the mortality increased by 6% per year of age. In survivors 5 days after the onset of infarction, the 1 year prognosis was significantly correlated with age (RR = 1.05, p = 0.0001) and with cardiac failure (LVEF: RR = 1.57, p = 0.0001) and Killip class (RR = 1.66, p = 0.0001). The prescription of an ACE inhibitor or a betablocker in the first 5 days of infarction was associated with a reduction in 1 year mortality of 27% (p = 0.04) and 37% (p = 0.01) respectively.

    "387": "S-Enalapril, and S-ramipril are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which are used for treatment of hypertension. Due to the fact that only the S enantiomer possesses the ACE inhibiting activity, it is necessary to develop an enantioselective analytical method for its discrimination from the less active R-enantiomer. An amperometric biosensor, based on L-amino acid oxidase, was developed and proved reliable for the analysis of the S-enantiomer of these ACE inhibitors. The working range of the biosensor for S-enalapril assay (A) is 0.4-120 mumol/L, and for S-ramipril assay (B) is 0.2-100 mumol/L, with a limit of detection of 163 nmol/L (A) and 107 nmol/L (B), respectively. It is of interest to mention that the biosensors demonstrated enantioselectivity versus D-proline (1.4 x 10(-3) mol/L(A), 5.3 x 10(-3) mol/L(B) and also the selectivity versus the polyvinylpyrolidone (3.0 x 10(-3) mol/L(A), 3.2 x 10(-3) mol/L(B), respectively. The working pH ranges are: 6.8-7.4 (A), and 6.2-7.0 (B), respectively.

    "388": "Restenosis in the months following a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains the main limitation to this technique for myocardial revascularisation. Despite intensive investigation in this area, no pharmacological therapy has yet been found to be useful in preventing restenosis after conventional balloon angioplasty. The occurrence of restenosis, which is now known to be caused by both vessel remodelling and neointimal hyperplasia, might be reduced in the future by a combined mechanical and pharmacological approach. Although systemic administration of 'antirestenosis' drugs has not yet been tested to prevent restenosis after coronary stenting, it is very likely that pharmacological inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia within coronary stents will take advantage of local delivery techniques. In addition to local drug delivery catheters that are available, the stent itself may be coated with polymers and serve as a platform for drug delivery. The continued attractiveness of PTCA, as an alternative to medical treatment or bypass surgery for patients with coronary artery disease, will depend upon our ability to control the restenotic process.", 
    "389": "Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-ace-tyltransferase (AANAT)) catalyzes the reaction of serotonin (or tryptamine) with acetyl-CoA to form N-acetylserotonin (or N-acetyltryptamine) and is responsible for the melatonin circadian rhythm in vertebrates. This study evaluates a series of indoleamine analogs as alternate substrates of AANAT. 3-Indolepropylamine and 3-indolebutylamine were chemically synthesized and found to be processed by AANAT, although 20- and 60-fold less efficiently compared with the natural substrate serotonin, respectively. Racemic alpha-methyltryptamine and Nomega-methyltryptamine were also shown to be substrates for AANAT, again with reduced kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin. The enzyme did exhibit approximately 9:1 stereoselectivity for the R-enantiomer of alpha-methyltryptamine versus the S-enantiomer. By measuring the enzymatic rates versus increasing buffer microviscosity, it was demonstrated that diffusional release of product is most likely the principal rate-determining step for the enzymatic transformation of tryptamine (which has similar kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin). Analysis of kcat and kcat/Km versus pH for the poor substrate Nomega-methyltryptamine showed that an ionizable group on the enzyme with pKa approximately 7, required to be in its deprotonated form, may be important in catalysis. The alpha-methyltryptamine analog alpha-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by the enzyme, but served as a modest competitive inhibitor. Taken together with the pH-rate analysis, these results favor a model in which the serotonin substrate binds to the enzyme as the positively charged ammonium salt, and nucleophilicity of the amine is important in enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer.",

L-Carnosine uptake was optimal at pH 6.0 and was reduced by 60% and 35%, respectively, by 50 microM p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (a proton ionophore) and by acid preloading with 50 mM NH4Cl. The constituent amino acids did not inhibit L-carnosine uptake. L-Carnosine uptake was inhibited, however, from 50% to 80% by other dipeptides and structurally similar drugs such as bestatin, beta-lactam antibiotics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The LL, LD, or DL forms of the dipeptide Leu-Leu inhibited tritiated L-carnosine uptake by approximately 60%, 40%, and 70%, respectively. By contrast, the DD form did not inhibit uptake.

Thiazides were prescribed to 30.1% of women compared with 16% of men (P < 0.001). Average PDD was 135 +/- 117% of defined daily dose (DDD) for loop diuretics, and highest for bumetanide (245 +/- 2.01% of DDD, equivalent to 2.5 +/- 2.0 mg). Average PDD was 74 +/- 40% of DDD for thiazides, and highest for chlorthalidone (100 +/- 49% of DDD, equivalent to 25 +/- 12 mg).",

    "403": "A variety of in vitro experiments was conducted to examine iron binding to captopril and a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study design was used to assess the in vivo interaction. Captopril (25 mg) was coingested with either ferrous sulphate (300 mg) or placebo by seven healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were phlebotomized and had blood pressure measured at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h post ingestion. A 1 week washout period was used.",

There were no substantial changes in Cmax (mean difference; -32; 95% CI -124-62 ng ml(-1) (P = 0.57)) or in tmax (mean difference; 0; 95% CI -18-18 min (P = 0.65)) for unconjugated captopril when captopril was ingested with iron.

The addition of ferric chloride to captopril resulted in the initial rapid formation of a soluble blue complex which rapidly disappeared to be replaced by a white precipitant. The white precipitate was identified as captopril disulphide dimer. There were no significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups.",

In Part I of the study, subjects took a single oral tablet dose of 20 mg temocapril hydrochloride following an overnight fast. In Part II they took seven once daily oral tablet doses of 20 mg temocapril hydrochloride. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined after the single and the last dose. Trough plasma samples were taken before each dose in Part II. Urine was collected for 24 h following the single and the last dose.",

    "410": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the transplacental kinetics and effects on placental function of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, in the dually perfused human placental lobule system. When placed in the maternal perfusate at a high therapeutic serum concentration (150 ng/ml), enalaprilat was rapidly transferred from the maternal perfusate into placental tissue followed by a gradual release from the placenta into the fetal perfusate. Cmax and AUC values for enalaprilat in the maternal perfusate were approximately 3 times higher than in the fetal perfusate, and drug levels did not equilibrate between maternal and fetal perfusates during the 4-6 hours of perfusion. The more highly perfused regions of the placental lobule had higher drug levels than non-perfused areas. At the end of the perfusion period, the mean percent of total drug added in the maternal perfusate was 59%, with 23% in the fetal perfusate and the remainder (18%) in placental tissue. Despite the relatively high levels of drug found in placental tissue, there were no alterations in placental function as measured by fetal volume loss, fetal pressure, glucose utilization, lactate production, hCG release, net fetal oxygen transfer, and oxygen consumption. Results from this study clearly document placental transfer of enalaprilat in the perfused human placental lobule system. The lack of effect on placental function suggests that enalaprilat has no direct effect on fetoplacental vascular beds, and that fetal hypotension occurring from ACE inhibitor exposure may be due to direct effects on the fetal kidney and not to decreased perfusion of fetoplacental vascular beds; these findings require further validation in an in vivo model.", 
    "411": "Invasive revascularization improves prognosis, functional status and quality of life in patients with severe angina pectoris and impaired left ventricular function, and treatment with ACE-I reduces the development of cardiac events and left ventricular dysfunction in patients without or with mild angina pectoris. However, the effects of a combined treatment strategy with invasive revascularization and subsequent long-term ACE-I therapy in patients with limiting angina pectoris and impaired left ventricular function have not previously been investigated. APRES is a long-term, prospective, randomized double-blind study that evaluates the effects of ramipril 10 mg o.d. on the long-term development of cardiac events, left ventricular function, functional status and quality of life following invasive revascularization in patients without recent AMI or clinical heart failure and with preoperative ejection fraction in the range 0.30-0.50. The rationale, design and power of APRES and the choice and relevance of outcome measures are discussed. Based on experience and results from the first year of the study for screening procedure, inclusion rate, patient compliance, reproducibility analyses and the magnitude of outcome measures, we conclude that the study is feasible and safe. The included patients match with the target population, the outcome measures seem appropriate and the power considerations valid for the majority of the outcome measures.", 
    "412": "A case of unilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia is presented. A 46-year-old woman with a 7-year history of hypertension and a 1-year-history of hypokalemia was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, venous sampling and adosterol scintigraphy exhibited a functioning left adrenal mass. The plasma aldosterone concentration increased markedly when furosemide with upright posture and either captopril or adrenocorticotropin were administered. Plasma renin activity was suppressed below the detectable range. Aldosterone secretion displayed a circadian rhythm and was not suppressed by dexamethasone administration. The resected left adrenal mass was pathologically diagnosed as adrenocortical nodular hyperplasia. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia involving the zona glomerulosa rarely has been reported, with varying and incompletely characterized hormonal characteristics. This case report and literature review suggest unilateral adrenal hyperplasia as a rare cause of hyperaldosteronism with characteristics intermediate between idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma, resembling the functional features of the adenoma more closely.", 
    "413": "The clinical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. The authors examined the early steps in insulin action, i.e., the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and of the pp185 in liver and muscle of obese rats treated acutely with captopril, using immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Following treatment with captopril there was an improvement in insulin-induced insulin receptor and pp185 phosphorylation in the liver and muscle of obese rats. This finding contribute to an explanation of the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors appear to improve insulin sensitivity.", 
    "414": "The enzymatic pathways for local angiotensin II (Ang II) formation in the heart have been studied both in vivo and in vitro, but the results of these experiments have been discrepant. Thus, the experiments in vivo with intact hearts, both in humans and in animal models, have unequivocally demonstrated that the major Ang II-forming enzyme is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In contrast, the experiments in vitro with both human or animal heart preparations, have unequivocally demonstrated that the major Ang II-forming enzyme is chymase, a mast cell-derived chymotrypsin-like serine protease. The in vitro approach, however, seems to involve several pitfalls, which tend to overestimate the contribution of chymase as compared to that of ACE. It seems evident that in vivo the chymase-mediated Ang II formation is subjected to local inhibition, a fact that has been overlooked in most of the studies performed in vitro. Accordingly, human chymase, even in its natural form as a protease-proteoglycan complex, is highly sensitive to the protease inhibitors naturally present in the interstitial fluid (IF). We found that if human heart tissue preparations are incubated in vitro in the presence of IF, the chymase-mediated Ang II formation is almost totally suppressed. As the heart interstitium is constantly bathed by IF with its protease inhibitors in concentrations sufficiently high to ensure efficient inhibition of this enzyme, the protease inhibitor-mediated suppression of chymase should also be effective in vivo. Thus, the local production of Ang II in the human heart appears to be regulated by ACE rather than by chymase.", 
    "415": "Following myocardial infarction (MI), extensive fibrosis appears at and remote to the MI and is associated with diastolic dysfunction. Both circulating and tissue hormones contribute to the adverse structural remodelling of the myocardium and thereby influence the progressive nature of heart failure. In this review, factors contributing to the appearance of fibrous tissue will be considered, with special emphasis on the role of peptides produced within the diseased myocardium and on the circulating hormones of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "416": "Renovasular disease commonly affects elderly people. Elderly patients with heart failure are routinely treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which may increase risk of renal dysfunction.

We selected patients by intention to treat with ACE inhibitors. We used captopril renography to screen for renovascular disease. All patients with abnormal renograms underwent magnetic-resonance angiography of the renal arteries as well as 40% of patients with normal renograms as negative controls.", 
    "418": "Magnetic-resonance angiography showed severe renovascular disease (>50% renal-artery stenosis or occlusion) in 29 (34%) patients. Captopril renography had an estimated sensitivity of 78.8% (95% CI 72.7-97.8) and specificity of 94.3% (67.6-97.3) for detection of renovascular disease. The estimated positive predictive value of captopril renography was 89.7% and the negative predictive value was 87.5%. Patients with renovascular disease had worse renal function (mean creatinine 201 [SD 56] vs 136 [40] pmol/L, p<0.001), were older (mean age 80.7 [5.6] vs 76.8 [5.3] years, p<0.01), and were more likely than patients without renovascular disease to have peripheral arterial disease.",

The methods are based on the reaction of this drug as n-electron donor with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone(DDQ)-7,7,8,8- tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), chloranil (CL) and p-chloranilic acid (p-CA) as pi-acceptors to give highly coloured complex species. The coloured products are measured spectrophotometrically at 588, 843, 419, 550 and 520 nm for DDQ, TCNQ, TCNE, CL and p-CA, respectively, optimization of different experimental conditions is described. Beer's law is obeyed in the range of 20-200 micrograms ml-1 and colours were produced in non-aqueous media and were stable for at least 1 h. Application of the suggested methods to perindopril tablets are presented.", 
    "421": "Specialized proteases, referred to as sheddases, secretases, or membrane-protein-solubilizing proteases (MPSPs), solubilize the extracellular domains of diverse membrane proteins by catalyzing a specific cleavage in the juxtamembrane stalk regions of such proteins. A representative MPSP (tumor necrosis factor-alpha convertase) was cloned recently and shown to be a disintegrin metalloprotease that is inhibited by peptide hydroxamates including the compound TAPI. Substrate determinants that specify cleavage by MPSPs remain incompletely characterized, but may include the physicochemical properties of the stalk or unidentified recognition motifs in the stalk or the extracellular domain. We constructed a mutant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in which the stalk has been replaced with an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (ACE-JMEGF), to test the hypothesis that MPSP cleavage requires an open, comparatively unfolded or extended stalk. Wild-type ACE is a type I transmembrane (TM) ectoprotein that is efficiently solubilized by a typical MPSP activity. We found that ACE-JMEGF was solubilized inefficiently and accumulated in a cell-associated form on transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells; cleavage was stimulated by phorbol ester and inhibited by TAPI, features typical of MPSP activity. Determination of the C-terminus of soluble ACE-JMEGF revealed that, surprisingly, cleavage occurred at a Gly-Phe bond between the fifth and sixth cysteines within the third disulfide loop of the EGF-like domain. Reduction of intact CHO cells with tributylphosphine resulted in the rapid release of ACE-JMEGF (but not wild-type ACE) into the medium, suggesting that a proportion of membrane-bound ACE-JMEGF is cleaved but remains cell-associated via disulfide tethering. The mechanism for the release of ACE-JMEGF in the absence of chemical reduction is unclear. We conclude that the presence of a compact, disulfide-bridged domain does not per se inhibit cleavage by an MPSP activity, but ectodomain release is prevented by disulfide tethering to the TM domain.", 
    "422": "The rationale behind combination therapy relates to the fact that when two different classes of agents are combined, they may provide complementary, additive, or synergistic antihypertensive effects through different mechanisms. Lower doses of two drugs, which provide blood pressure reduction similar to higher doses of one drug, may enhance tolerability and improve compliance. Investigative efforts have been undertaken to explore fixed-dose combinations of drugs that do not include diuretics. The first nondiuretic fixed-dose combinations are an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-calcium antagonist combination or a beta-blocker-calcium antagonist combination. The rationale for an ACE inhibitor-calcium antagonist combination is based on the fact that both drugs reduce vasoconstriction through different mechanisms. The ACE inhibitor largely attenuates vasoconstriction through augmentation of vasodilatory kinins and reduction of the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II, whereas the calcium antagonists, through attenuating the transmembrane flux of calcium, inhibit calcium-mediated electromechanical coupling in contractile tissue in response to numerous stimuli. Moreover, both classes of drugs facilitate salt and water excretion by the kidney through different mechanisms. The ACE inhibitor restores the renal-adrenal response to salt loading, whereas the calcium antagonist possesses intrinsic natriuretic properties through poorly described mechanisms of inhibiting renal tubular salt and water reabsorption. The combination of a beta-blocker and dihydropyridine calcium antagonist is logical due to the different antihypertensive mechanisms of these drugs without risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities. There is evidence in clinical trials that ACE inhibitors may offset one of the major side effects associated with calcium antagonist therapy: pedal edema. Although the studies are small and the observations subjective, there is consistent evidence that the combination may provide an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of this common clinical problem. There is also evidence of reduced calcium antagonist-associated constipation and headache with this type of drug combination, likely because lower doses of this agent are used in combination with ACE inhibitors. However, there is no published evidence that calcium antagonists reduce the cough associated with the ACE inhibitor.", 
    "423": "The importance of the level to which blood pressure is reduced becomes increasingly important when one considers preservation of renal function. It is clear that three major subsets of patients emerge as requiring levels of blood pressure control of < 130/85 mm Hg to preserve renal function. Such individuals include black Americans, those with diabetic nephropathy, and those with renal insufficiency or > or = 1 g of proteinuria. It is clearly important to achieve such levels of blood pressure control in these high-risk individuals. It is also clear that single-agent therapy will never achieve these levels of blood pressure control. Therefore, multiple antihypertensive agents will be required to achieve such a goal. With increasing numbers of medications, however, there is also, unfortunately, a decrease in compliance. Therefore, fixed-dose combinations emerge as playing a major part both in achieving a level of blood pressure control as well as maintaining levels of compliance. Certain types of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as calcium channel antagonist combinations, however, appear to have better overall effects than others do. These and related data are reviewed in this paper.", 
    "424": "Two major problems continue to challenge hypertension experts and clinical practitioners. The first is the apparently simple issue of controlling blood pressure; only one-quarter of hypertensive patients in the United States have blood pressures reduced to less than 140/90 mm Hg. Even those known to be receiving treatment have barely a 50% success rate. Explanations include inadequate commitments by physicians to achieve target blood pressures, but it is also likely that effectively decreasing blood pressure--despite the currently available panoply of antihypertensive agents--is a truly difficult task. The second problem is that despite our success in decreasing stroke incidence, hypertension treatment with traditional agents, largely diuretic-based, has not adequately protected patients against coronary events and renal insufficiency. Such new drug classes as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers exhibit vascular effects that might inhibit atherosclerotic changes and reduce clinical events, but we are still awaiting definitive confirmation of these properties from ongoing clinical outcomes studies in hypertension. Therapy with fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs is now recognized as a potentially useful approach. Innovative combinations, including ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, can provide enhanced antihypertensive efficacy while avoiding or minimizing adverse metabolic and clinical side effects. These approaches are also convenient and cost-effective. It remains to be learned whether newer drug combinations might exhibit additive cardiovascular protective actions.", 
    "425": "Essential hypertension is, at least in many subjects, associated with a decrease in insulin sensitivity, whereas glycemic control is (still) normal. Metaanalyses of hypertension intervention studies revealed different efficacy of treatment on cerebral (cerebrovascular accidents [CVA]) and cardiac (coronary heart disease [CHD]) morbidity and mortality. Although CVA were reduced to an extent similar to that anticipated, the decrease in CHD was less than expected. These differences are likely to be caused by the different impact of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on CHD and CVA. Frequently these cardiovascular risk factors are ineffectively controlled in hypertensive patients, and moreover, some of the widely used antihypertensive agents have unfavorable side effects and further deteriorate these particular metabolic risk factors. Therefore, the metabolic side effects of antihypertensive treatment have received more attention. During the past few years, studies demonstrated that most antihypertensive agents modify insulin sensitivity in parallel with alterations in the atherogenic lipid profile. Alpha1-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were shown to either have no impact on or even improve insulin resistance and the profile of atherogenic lipids, whereas most of the calcium channel blockers were found to be metabolically inert. The diuretics and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists further decrease insulin sensitivity and worsen dyslipidemia. The mechanisms by which beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist treatment exert its disadvantageous effects are not fully understood, but several possibilities exist: significant body weight gain, reduction in enzyme activities (muscle lipoprotein lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase), alterations in insulin clearance and insulin secretion, and, probably most important, reduced peripheral blood flow due to increase in total peripheral vascular resistance. Recent metabolic studies found beneficial effects of the newer vasodilating beta-blockers, such as dilevalol, carvedilol and celiprolol, on insulin sensitivity and the atherogenic risk factors. In many hypertensive patients, elevated sympathetic nerve activity and insulin resistance are a deleterious combination. Although conventional beta-blocker treatment was able to take care of the former, the latter got worse; the newer vasodilating beta-blocker generation seems to be capable of successfully treating both of them.", 
    "426": "To evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on sexual activity, 90 hypertensive men, aged 40 to 49 years, all married and without history of sexual dysfunction were treated with 100 mg of atenolol or 20 mg of lisinopril for 16 weeks, according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. During the first month of therapy, sexual activity, assessed as number of sexual intercourse episodes per month, significantly declined with both atenolol (from 7.8 +/- 4.3 to 4.5 +/- 2.8, P < .01 v placebo) and lisinopril (from 7.1 +/- 4.0 to 5.0 +/- 2.5, P < .05 v placebo). Ongoing with the treatment, sexual activity tended toward recovery in the lisinopril (7.7 +/- 4.0 sexual intercourse episodes per month, P = NS v placebo), but not in the atenolol group (4.2 +/- 2.8, P < .01 v placebo), with a statistically significant difference between the two drugs (P < .01). The percentage of patients who complained of sexual dysfunction symptoms was significantly higher in the atenolol- than in the lisinopril-treated group (17% v 3%, P < .05). These findings suggest that atenolol induces a chronic worsening of sexual activity, whereas lisinopril causes only a temporary decline.", 
    "427": "The effect of doxazosin versus captopril on blood pressure, albuminuria, and left ventricular mass was studied in 33 hypertensive type-1 diabetic patients randomized to 6 months treatment with captopril (17 patients, mean daily dose 100 mg) or doxazosin (16 patients, mean daily dose 9 mg). Casual and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (24hBP) were reduced from 163/95 to 144/83 mm Hg and 152/86 to 145/81 mm Hg, respectively, in the captopril group, and from 160/93 to 145/86 mm Hg and 156/86 to 147/79 mm Hg in the doxazosin group (all P < .05). The achieved 24hBP on treatment was positively associated with pretreatment levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (r = 0.53 and 0.59, respectively, both P < .01). Albuminuria did not change significantly in either group. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 13 patients (7 in the captopril and 6 in the doxazosin group). Left ventricular mass was reduced by an average of 27% and 23%, respectively, in these patients (both P < .01), but did not change significantly in patients without left ventricular hypertrophy. The reduction in left ventricular mass was positively associated with the presence of baseline left ventricular hypertrophy and inversely with dietary sodium intake and achieved casual blood pressure on treatment (R2 = 0.59, P < .001). We conclude that doxazosin and captopril used for 6 months are equally effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive type-1 diabetic patients; the antihypertensive effect is closely related to glycemic control; and dietary sodium intake and achieved casual blood pressure after treatment are independent determinants of the reduction in left ventricular mass seen in these patients.", 
    "428": "The goal of this study was to determine if the hemodynamic effects of the combined administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist are greater than those produced by either of these agents administered individually during heart failure.", 
    "429": "Ten farm pigs were chronically instrumented with aortic, left atrial and right atrial catheters, a left ventricular (LV) pressure gauge, LV dimension crystals, coronary occluders, an ascending aortic flow probe and pacing leads. Heart failure was induced by serial myocardial infarctions followed by repeated rapid ventricular pacing.", 
    "430": "Heart failure was manifested by significant (p < 0.01) decreases in LV dP/dt (-38 +/- 5%, from 2943 +/- 107 mmHg/s) and cardiac output (-27 +/- 4%, from 4.1 +/- 0.2 l/min) and increases in left atrial pressure (+18 +/- 1 mmHg, from 4 +/- 1 mmHg) and total peripheral resistance (TPR)(+40 +/- 8%, from 23 +/- 2 mmHg/l/min). The effects of an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) and an AT1 receptor antagonist (L-158,809), administered in maximally effective doses, either individually or concomitantly, were examined on different days in conscious pigs with heart failure. There were no differences in any of the baseline hemodynamic measurements among the groups studied. Thirty minutes after administration, enalaprilat (4 mg/kg i.v.) increased (p < 0.05) cardiac output by 8 +/- 2% and reduced (p < 0.05) mean arterial pressure and TPR by 5 +/- 1 and 12 +/- 1%, respectively, while the changes in LV dP/dt (0 +/- 2%), LV fractional shortening (+4 +/- 3%) and heart rate (+1 +/- 1%) were not statistically significant. Similarly, L-158,809 (4 mg/kg, i.v.) increased cardiac output by 9 +/- 2% and reduced mean arterial pressure and TPR by 4 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 3%, respectively, while the changes in LV dP/dt (+3 +/- 3%), LV fractional shortening (+3 +/- 1%) and heart rate (0 +/- 1%) were not significant. However, enalaprilat (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and L-158,809 (1 mg/kg, i.v.), administered concomitantly, reduced TPR by 21 +/- 3%, an effect greater (p < 0.05) than when either of these agents was administered individually at a dose of 4 mg/kg, i.v. The changes in mean arterial pressure (-9 +/- 2%), cardiac output (+15 +/- 4%) and LV fractional shortening (+11 +/- 3%) also tended to be greater with concomitant administration. In addition, in a sequential dosing protocol, when L-158,809 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 30 min after enalaprilat (1 mg/kg, i.v.), TPR was reduced by 20 +/- 4% compared to only a 6 +/- 3% reduction (p < 0.05) when the enalaprilat was followed 30 min later by a second dose of enalaprilat (1 mg/kg, i.v.). The changes in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output for the combined treatment group also tended to be greater than those for the group given two sequential doses of enalaprilat.", 
    "431": "In conscious pigs with heart failure, the combined vasodilatory effects of an ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor antagonist are greater than those produced when only one of these agents is administered, suggesting that independent mechanisms of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor antagonism could be partly responsible for the improved vascular dynamics during heart failure.", 
    "432": "The long-term effects and mechanisms of early started angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition post myocardial infarction (MI) are not well understood. Chronic effects of early ACE inhibition on hemodynamics, left ventricular diastolic wall stress and remodeling were, therefore, compared to that of angiotensin AT1-receptor subtype blockade in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. The contribution of bradykinin potentiation to both ACE inhibitor and angiotensin AT1-receptor subtype blockade was assessed by cotreatment of rats with a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist.",

    "434": "Quinapril and losartan reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and global left ventricular diastolic wall stress only in rats with large MI. Pressure volume curves showed a rightward shift in proportion to MI size that was not prevented by quinapril or losartan treatment. Only the ACE inhibitor reduced left ventricular weight and this effect was prevented by cotreatment with the bradykinin antagonist. Baseline and peak cardiac index and stroke volume index, as determined using an electromagnetic flowmeter before and after an acute intravenous volume load, were restored by quinapril, whereas losartan had no effects.", 
    "435": "Treatments starting 30 min after coronary artery ligation, with either quinapril or losartan, reduced preload only in rats with large MI. Despite this unloading of the heart, structural dilatation was not prevented by this early treatment.

    "441": "Angiotensin receptor antagonists have the theoretical advantage of being more effective in blocking the effects of angiotensin II at angiotensin type I receptors. The potential disadvantage of not potentiating bradykinin may be compensated by the unopposed action of angiotensin II on vascular angiotensin type II receptors, which appear to mediate similar beneficial cardiovascular effects to bradykinin. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have a lower incidence of adverse effects than ACE inhibitors as they do not produce cough and appear much less likely to produce angioedema. Although ACE inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug class in Australia, they are underused for the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Angiotensin receptor antagonists may become alternative therapies to ACE inhibitors in these disorders. However, at present they are only indicated for the treatment of hypertension.",

If so, inhibition of atrial natriuretic factor breakdown by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) may enhance the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibition.

The first dose of sampatrilat did not lower clinic or ambulatory blood pressure. Lisinopril had an immediate antihypertensive effect that differed significantly from all doses of sampatrilat. After 10 days of treatment, sampatrilat lowered clinic and ambulatory blood pressure significantly at all doses, with a trend toward a dose response for systolic ambulatory blood pressure. Sampatrilat inhibited plasma ACE in a dose-dependent fashion but significantly less so than lisinopril on days 1 and 10 of treatment. Lisinopril but not sampatrilat significantly increased plasma renin activity, whereas sampatrilat but not lisinopril significantly increased urinary cGMP excretion.", 
    "445": "The increasing efficacy of sampatrilat compared with lisinopril over 10 days could not be attributed to an increase in plasma ACE inhibition, suggesting that the NEP inhibitor activity of sampatrilat may have contributed to its antihypertensive action.

After preliminary quality control, 27% (233) of baseline echocardiograms were rejected by our centralized evaluation committee, and 22% (142) of postinclusion echocardiographic measurements had to be repeated, mainly because they were of poor echogenic quality. Analysis of approved baseline echocardiograms for the first 274 randomly allocated patients with digitized data showed that there was a significant correlation between centralized evaluation committee and investigator calculations of left ventricular mass index (r = 0.76, P < 0.001), with consistently higher values for investigator calculations, independently of level of left ventricular mass index (correlation between difference and mean of investigator and centralized evaluation committee measurements, r = 0.08, P = 0.28).

A positive correlation to blood pressure was found for mesenteric artery wall thickness and wall: lumen ratio. Concentration for half-maximal effect for the response of mesenteric arteries from rats in the P group to norepinephrine was lower than that of the control group rats.

Night-time systolic blood pressures were significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (128 +/- 17 versus 118 +/- 10 mmHg, P < 0.05) due to there being a smaller day-night difference in systolic blood pressure during glibenclamide treatment that appeared to occur mainly in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Responses of diastolic blood pressure to intravenous infusion of angiotensin II and forearm vascular responses to intra-brachial arterial infusion of angiotensin II were significantly greater during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (P < 0.05). However, the enhancement of forearm vascular responses during glibenclamide treatment appeared to be restricted to patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

In order to verify these pathophysiological concepts, a series of substudies will be conducted as part of the EUROPA programme. Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound examination of coronary arteries will be performed in approximately 400 patients before and after 3 years' treatment with either perindopril or placebo, in order to assess progression and possible regression of coronary lesions. B-mode ultrasonography of the brachial artery will be used as a model for changes in the coronary arteries, to assess endothelial function in response to ischaemia (reactive hyperaemia) and to vasoconstriction (cold pressor test). Three hundred patients will be investigated before and at different intervals after initiation of study treatment. In addition genetic characterization will be performed of patients participating in EUROPA in order to assess whether specific genotypes do respond more or less favourably to perindopril. In addition, the effect of perindopril will be investigated in patients with diabetes type II, since ACE inhibition in such patients may improve microvascular function and renal function. Integration of these substudies, as well as detailed analysis of other specific subgroups in EUROPA, will help us understand the effects of treatment with perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

The primary end-point is a combined one: total mortality, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris and cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation are included; the outcome is studied in patients with proven coronary artery disease and no clinical heart failure. Secondary end-points consist of these events individually calculated. The first patient was recruited in October 1997, and it is planned to finish recruitment by the end of 1998.", 
    "497": "Coronary vasodilator responses to pharmacological (acetylcholine) and physiological (cold pressor test and flow dependent dilation) stimuli are impaired in hypertensive patients. The ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to restore normal coronary responses in hypertension and the potential mechanisms involved are examined. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent impairment of endothelial-dependent relaxation of arterial rings in response to acetylcholine; in dogs, intracoronary infusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor dilates epicardial arteries and enhances coronary blood flow. In hypertensive patients with normal coronary arteries, intravenous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat changes constriction of coronary arteries to dilation in response to the cold pressor test, and the absence of flow-dependent dilation becomes a normal response. In addition, maximal coronary blood flow induced by papaverine is enhanced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and minimal coronary resistance is reduced. It is concluded that both animal and human studies have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may acutely reverse the abnormalities of coronary vasomotion in arterial hypertension. However, not all the mechanisms responsible are fully understood and further studies are needed, particularly to determine the exact role of nitric oxide, bradykinin and oxygen-derived free radicals.",

We review briefly the clinical data supporting a potential role for ACE inhibitors in the prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke and the wider use of these agents in hypertension, renal disease and diabetes. We also briefly review the major ongoing trials evaluating these hypotheses.", 
    "499": "During ischaemia, both the circulating renin-angiotensin system and the local angiontensin converting enzyme are activated. The circulating renin-angiotensin system has a short-term role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. Its aim is to restore blood pressure and cardiac homeostasis. Activation of the local system causes long-term regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis via sustained activation of local angiotensin and the gradation of bradykinin. This results in the secondary permanent structural changes that underline many aspects of coronary artery disease. Recently it has been shown that ACE inhibition is useful in the early and late phase of myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce in vitro vascular hypertrophy and attenuate arteriolosclerosis and to maintain endothelial function. Interestingly, unexpected data from trials on heart failure have shown that patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a reduced incidence of infarction, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease and the need for coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty. As a consequence, several trials have been designed to assess the effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of coronary artery disease, as well as on its morbidity and mortality. The EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) is one of these. This article summarised a number of independent and complementary mechanisms and points to the role played by ACE and ACE inhibition in coronary artery disease. In particular it considers the possibility that ACE inhibition improves endothelial function, exerts anti-atherogenic and anti-proliferation activity and modulates sympathetic activity.", 
    "500": "Circulating levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in humans are linked with an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in the ACE gene: DD genotype bearers have higher levels of ACE than either ID or II genotype bearers. Recent studies have suggested that the ACE DD genotype may be associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease. The aim of this paper is to review studies on the influence of I/D polymorphism on coronary restenosis, coronary vasomotion and coronary thrombosis. The renin angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia in experimental models. In humans, I/D polymorphism is not associated with restenosis after balloon angioplasty but is strongly associated with restenosis after coronary stent implantation. This may be explained by the fact that the contribution of neointimal hyperplasia to restenosis is much more important after coronary stent implantation than after balloon angioplasty. The renin angiotensin system may participate in the regulation of coronary vasomotion. An association between I/D polymorphism and coronary artery spasm has been reported. An increased production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-I and an increase in platelet aggregability may explain the higher risk of coronary thrombosis in subjects with high levels of ACE. The ACE I/D genotype has been associated with a lower incidence of a patent infarct-related artery after myocardial infarction and with a higher risk of total occlusion of the dilated site 6 months after successful balloon angioplasty. These studies suggest that the influence of the I/D polymorphism on coronary artery disease may be multifactorial. Possible mechanisms include interactions with neointimal formation, coronary artery spasm and coronary thrombosis.", 
    "501": "Long-term controlled trials in heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction indicate the potential of ACE inhibition to reduce ischaemic events, such as unstable angina and myocardial infarction. These effects occur after long-term medication and suggest structural rather than functional effects of ACE inhibitors. Such structural effects could include an improvement in endothelial function and less atherosclerosis of coronary and systemic arteries, as well as a reduction in cardiac size. Together, these effects may improve the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio. Neurohormonal activation is pivotal in heart failure and also occurs in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. ACE inhibitors modulate neurohormonal activation and, through that mechanism, may induce their beneficial effects in terms of cardiac remodelling and improved morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Neurohormonal activation also occurs during acute myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with diminished left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Recent studies indicate that short episodes of stress-induced myocardial ischaemia may also lead to significant increases in circulating norepinephrine, epinephrine and, in more severe ischaemia, in angiotensin II. This increase in vasoconstricting neurohormones results in significant systemic vasoconstriction and may also underlie the constriction of abnormal coronary segments observed during atrial pacing-induced stress. This ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation is not dependent on the stress of angina, but correlates with the degree of myocardial ischaemia and also with the presence of left ventricular dysfunction. Acute ACE inhibition modulates this ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and the subsequent effects on systemic and coronary vascular tone. Consequently, acute ACE inhibition significantly reduces acute myocardial ischaemia. The significance of these observations is as yet unclear. However, they may be important in situations of severe myocardial ischaemia, such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Presumably, this potential of ACE inhibitors to reduce short-term stress-induced myocardial ischaemia as a result of their neurohormonal modulating and subsequent vasodilating effects gains in significance during chronic ACE inhibitor treatment, in parallel with a long-term improvement of coronary endothelial function.", 
    "502": "Endothelial cells control the tone of the underlying vascular smooth muscle by secreting vasodilator substances (prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor). These vasodilator substances also contribute to the antithrombogenicity of the normal endothelium, and inhibit cellular growth. In coronary vascular disease, the ability of the endothelium to secrete vasodilator substances is reduced, while the propensity to release endothelium-derived contracting factors is increased. In particular, the reduced release of nitric oxide in response to aggregating platelets, thrombin and circulating catecholamines favours the occurrence of thrombosis and vasospasm, and plays a key role in the initiation of the atherosclerotic process. From the therapeutic point of view, the best available way to enhance the release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and hyperpolarizing factor is to inhibit converting enzyme. This will protect endogenous bradykinin from breakdown and prolong its action on endothelial receptors.", 
    "503": "Angiotensin, a vasoconstrictive peptide, is now known to be an agent of vascular oxidative stress, vascular growth and inflammation, and may directly influence the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). The presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II have been demonstrated in vascular tissue, and these local substances are causally involved in the development of vascular lesions. Recent clinical trials in post-myocardial infarction reported that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces recurrent myocardial infarction and prevents cardiac enlargement. Long-term prospective trials are currently being conducted to examine the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on coronary ischaemic events and coronary atherosclerosis. This paper reviews angiotensin's role in the pathophysiology of CAD and the mechanisms of ACE inhibitor effects.", 
    "504": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) reduce the incidence of re-infarction in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), and the DD genotype for the ACE gene is an independent risk factor of MI. These findings suggest involvement of ACE in the natural history of coronary plaques and in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACE-I potentially prevent coronary plaque rupture by suppressing angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and sympathetic nerve activity. Actions of ACE-I on risk factors, including insulin resistance, may retard the progression of atheromatous changes in the coronary artery. Furthermore, ACE-I attenuate contractile dysfunction due to myocardial stunning and hibernation, while it augments anti-infarct tolerance of the myocytes afforded by preconditioning. These actions on the myocardium may also be beneficial in ACS. Although favorable effects of ACE-I on the mortality rate of MI patients has been established, the benefit of chronic therapy with ACE-I for patients who have coronary artery disease without MI remains to be clarified.", 
    "505": "Acute coronary syndrome is caused by disruption of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque. It is recognized that the risk of plaque disruption depends more on plaque composition than on plaque size. Therefore, it is important to establish imaging techniques and clinical markers for the identification of vulnerable plaques. Intravascular ultrasound and angioscope may reveal important features of vulnerable plaques. In the near future, optical coherence tomography and intravascular thermography may further improve the characterization of plaques. Systemic markers of inflammation, such as CRP and SAA, may reflect the intensity of inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesion. Clinical observations indicate that plaques may be stabilized by lipid-lowering drugs, anti-oxidants, estrogen and Chlamydia-killing antibiotics. After plaque rupture, new generation antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, such as GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and low-molecular heparin, can limit the mural thrombi formation more effectively.", 
    "506": "A pregnancy after Mustard repair for transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect with pulmonary stenosis is reported. The 23-year-old gravida 1 was treated with ACE inhibitors up to 26 weeks of gestation until cardiac medication was changed to dihydralazine. At 28 weeks of gestation the patient developed cardiac decompensation leading to caesarean section for maternal indication at 29 weeks of gestation. The neonate did not show any congenital malformation nor anuria. The patient was moved to a normal ward six days after delivery. A cardiac follow-up examination showed no difference to the condition before pregnancy.", 
    "507": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to the evolution of ischemic coronary events through its hemodynamic, hemostatic and mitogenic effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists have been shown to be cardioprotective in experimental animal models, with ischemia-reperfusion injury and in patients with congestive heart failure. Ang II receptors include at least two different subtypes, AT1 and AT2. Both AT1 and AT2 are expressed in the rat heart. Myocardial AT1 receptor density increases in association with ACE expression, and AT1 receptor activation is related to collagen formation following myocardial infarction in rats. Studies from the authors' laboratory have shown significant myocardial dysfunction in association with a concurrent increase in AT1 receptor expression in the rat myocardium immediately following a brief period of ischemia and reperfusion. Application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN) directed at AT1 receptor messenger RNA and AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, significantly attenuates myocardial dysfunction induced by ischemia-reperfusion in the isolated rat heart. These observations suggest that myocardial AT1 receptor expression is involved in myocardial dysfunction following ischemia-reperfusion. Unlike losartan, which upregulates the plasma Ang II level, administration of AS-ODN does not affect plasma Ang II level. Although the reason for this is not clear, the difference in plasma Ang II levels implies that AS-ODN may be, at least theoretically, more beneficial than losartan in limiting ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, also contributes to the outcome of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recent studies from the authors' laboratory have demonstrated that Ang II induces apoptosis in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells via activation of AT1 receptors and this can be blocked by losartan. These observations collectively underscore the importance of myocardial AT1 receptor expression in ischemia-reperfusion injury.", 
    "508": "Oatp1, the organic anion transport polypeptide, is an integral membrane protein cloned from rat liver that mediates the uptake of various organic anions such as bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and taurocholate (TCA). Recent studies by others revealed that the thrombin inhibitor, CRC 220, a modified dipeptide, was transported by oatp1. The present study was designed to examine whether another modified peptide, enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was also a substrate. Transport was studied with enalapril (1 to 800 micromol/L, with [3H]enalapril) in a HeLa cell line stably transfected with oatp1-cDNA under the regulation of a Zn2+-inducible promoter. Noninduced transfected cells (without zinc) that did not express oatp1 failed to take up enalapril. In contrast, cells expressing oatp1 transported enalapril, estrone sulfate (E1S), taurolithocholic acid sulfate (TLCAS), and the glutathione conjugate of BSP (BSPGSH). Uptake of enalapril by oatp1 at 37 degreesC was substantially higher than that at 4 degreesC. The rate at 37 degreesC (uptake rates for induced - noninduced, transfected cells) was linear over 5 minutes and was concentration-dependent, characterized by a Km of 214 +/- 67 micromol/L and a Vmax of 0.51 +/- 0.15 nmol/min/mg protein. Enalapril uptake was inhibited competitively by BSP (at 1, 5, 10, and 50 micromol/L) and TCA (at 5, 25, and 100 micromol/L) with inhibition constants (Ki) of 2 and 32 micromol/L, respectively. The metabolite enalaprilat was, however, not transported by oatp1. That oatp1 is not a general transporter of anionic compounds was further shown by the lack of transport of harmol sulfate, benzoate, and hippurate. These observations attest to the role of oatp1 as a specific transporter for at least two classes of pharmacologically important peptides.", 
    "509": "To compare the effects of chronic administrations of the angiotensin II antagonist losartan and of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on renal function in sodium-depleted rats with one-kidney, one clip hypertension, and to examine the contribution of endogenous kinins to the effect of enalapril.", 
    "510": "We administered enalapril and losartan (10 and 30 mg/kg per day, respectively) for 6 days to hypertensive rats that had been subjected to dietary sodium-intake restriction for 6 days prior to treatment and continued to be subjected to this restriction during treatment. In an additional group, administration of enalapril was combined with infusion of the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (300 microg/kg per day subcutaneously via an osmotic pump). Renal function of anesthetized rats was assessed by using a clearance technique.", 
    "511": "Despite there being similar falls in arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate (867 +/- 40 microl/min per g kidney weight in untreated rats) was decreased to a larger extent in enalapril-treated than it was in losartan-treated rats (284 +/- 29 versus 438 +/- 36 microl/min per g kidney weight, P < 0.01). Although infusion of Hoe 140 had no influence on the effect of enalapril on arterial pressure, the level of glomerular filtration achieved in rats of this group (545 +/- 55 microl/min per g kidney weight) was similar to that found in losartan-treated rats. No effect of either treatment on renal plasma flow was detected; as a consequence, the excessive decrease in filtration fraction observed for rats in the enalapril-treated group was corrected by concomitant administration of Hoe 140. Interestingly, administration of enalapril resulted in a greater loss of sodium than did administration of losartan (723 +/- 147 versus 308 +/- 57 micromol during 6 days), and this effect was abolished by infusion of Hoe 140 (353 +/- 42 micromol during 6 days).", 
    "512": "Administration of enalapril to sodium-depleted rats with one-kidney, one clip hypertension reduces their glomerular filtration rate to a greater extent than does administration of losartan despite these agents having similar effects on systemic blood pressure. Combined administration of enalapril and Hoe 140 has a less marked effect on glomerular filtration rate than does that of enalapril alone. This suggests that kinins play a role in the regulation of efferent arteriolar tone in this rat model.", 
    "513": "The effects of both single and long-term oral captopril or nifedipine treatment on cardiac parameters at rest and during exercise in patients with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was investigated.", 
    "514": "Thirty-one asymptomatic patients with chronic, isolated, previously untreated, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) of mean grade 3.1 +/- 0.6, had left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) 64 +/- 5 mm, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) 41 +/- 5 mm, ejection fraction (EF) 66 +/- 6% and fractional shortening (FS) 37 +/- 5% measured by echo-Doppler. Bedside Swan-Ganz measurements at rest and at peak exercise (75 W) were conducted before (baseline) and at 75-90 min after oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine. Repeat testing was performed 24 h later, at 75-90 min after oral administration of 25 mg captopril.", 
    "515": "At rest, nifedipine significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR) compared with baseline (704 +/- 152 versus 880 +/- 216 dynes.s.cm-5; p < 0.0001) and captopril treatment (800 +/- 176 dynes.s.cm-5; p < 0.0001). Despite significant improvement of effective left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (LVSVef) after both nifedipine and captopril over baseline (103 +/- 20 ml), LVSVef did not differ between nifedipine and captopril (110 +/- 17 versus 110 +/- 22 ml; NS). Nifedipine significantly increased effective cardiac output (COef) from baseline (6.7 +/- 1.3 l/min) to 8.2 +/- 1.5 l/min; p < 0.0001, but this was due to an increase in heart rate (HR) (66 +/- 10 versus 75 +/- 1 beats/min; p < 0.0001). In contrast, captopril affected neither COef nor HR. In addition, captopril reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) more than nifedipine (8.7 +/- 2.5 versus 11 +/- 2.9 mmHg; p < 0.0001). At exercise, both drugs caused similar reductions in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). By comparison with exercise baseline, LVSVef was increased by captopril (139 +/- 24 versus 147 +/- 27 ml; p < 0.01) but was unchanged after nifedipine. Compared with baseline, nifedipine increased COef (from 14.4 +/- 2.0 to 15.5 +/- 2.1 l/min; p < 0.0001) due to a significantly higher HR, while COef and HR were unchanged after captopril. A smaller increase in PCWP was also seen after captopril than nifedipine and baseline (both p < 0.0001). After long-term therapy (33 +/- 12; range: 12 to 53 months) with captopril (75 mg/day, n = 13) or nifedipine (40 mg/day; n = 12) there was no change in LVESD, and in left ventricular EF and FS in either groups. None of the patients became symptomatic. Compared with baseline, captopril significantly reduced AR grade by 0.9 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.01), but not significantly so versus nifedipine. LVEDD was reduced in captopril patients by 4.0 +/- 2.6 mm (p < 0.0002), but not significantly so in nifedipine patients. LVEDD was normalized in five captopril patients, and in four treated with nifedipine.", 
    "516": "Single captopril treatment caused a greater hemodynamic improvement than nifedipine, notably during exercise; these findings were confirmed by long-term therapy with both drugs. Therefore, captopril may delay the development of left ventricular dysfunction and thus the time for corrective surgery.", 
    "517": "Losartan-induced acute renal failure may occur in patients sensitive to reduced renal plasma flow. Such patients include those with bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, and severe sodium and volume depletion because their renal function is often angiotensin-dependent. Theoretically, both ACE inhibitors and losartan could adversely affect renal function in such sensitive patients. The ELITE trial showed a 10.5% incidence of losartan-induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients with congestive heart failure with no known underlying renal dysfunction, an incidence identical to that for captopril. A review of the literature revealed no controlled trials that specifically address whether losartan can be used as an alternative in patients in whom renal dysfunction associated with losartan have been published and an additional case report was identified from a local adverse drug reaction monitoring program. There were two cases of patients who developed renal dysfunction while receiving ACE inhibitors and then losartan. We found only one published case in which losartan was used without deterioration in renal function in patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking an ACE inhibitor, although underreporting of such cases would be expected. There was one case of renal dysfunction with losartan after a lack of renal dysfunction while the patient was taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining three reports are of patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking losartan with no antecedent ACE inhibitor use. All case reports describe renal deterioration that was reversible upon discontinuation of the inciting agent, whether an ACE inhibitor or losartan. All but two patients (personal communication, Barbara Cadario) had underlying renal pathology. Although there is a paucity of published literature and the clinical experience of some may suggest otherwise, there is currently no evidence (with the exception of 1 case report) to suggest that losartan is any better tolerated than ACE inhibitors from the standpoint of renal toxicity. Available evidence suggests that this is equally true in patients with and without underlying renal dysfunction. Furthermore, case reports suggest that, as with ACE inhibitors, losartan should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis and in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney. In patients with underlying renal dysfunction, regardless of whether they tolerate ACE inhibitors, losartan may be used if deemed necessary. Renal function should be monitored and losartan should be stopped if evidence of renal dysfunction becomes apparent, since several case reports and a randomized trial suggest that losartan may cause the same negative renal effects as ACE inhibitors.",

    "523": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuated the contractile responses to angiotensin (Ang) I of arterial strips of humans, monkeys, and dogs, as can be expected. Unexpectedly, however, the response was not abolished by sufficient doses of ACE inhibitors, the facts suggesting the Ang I conversion by a non-ACE enzyme(s). HPLC analysis of the incubation product of Ang I with vascular tissues revealed that Ang II was yet formed despite complete ACE inhibition, and the ACE inhibitor-insensitive Ang II formation was blocked by chymostatin. The disclosed Ang II-forming enzyme was identified as chymase, which was later found in abundance in the human heart. Another notable discovery by us is the species difference in chymase processing of Ang I: chymases of primates, dog, and hamster convert Ang I to Ang II, while chymases of rat, rabbit, and probably mouse do not. Accumulating evidence indicating that Ang II is not merely a vasopressor agent but also a growth-promoting factor, which leads to tissue hypertrophy and fibrosis, together with the results our studies lead us to propose the tissue-remodeling roles of chymase-formed Ang II in various cardiovascular diseases: dog neointimal proliferation after angioplasty, hamster cardiomyopathy, etc., in which chymase mRNA is increased concordantly with tissue remodeling. The fact that Ang II receptor antagonists, not ACE inhibitors, suppress the tissue remodeling supports our argument that Ang II is formed predominantly by chymase in diseased tissues. Orally active chymase inhibitors, evolving in our study, should help explore the actual roles of chymase as well as the rational treatment of tissue-remodeling disorders.", 
    "524": "The natriuretic peptide (NP) system is one of the most important systems regulating blood pressure and body-fluid homeostasis. The biological activities of the system are determined by the NPs and the receptors, which are comprised of three subtypes: NP-AR and NP-BR related to biological activities and NP-CR related to the clearance of NP. We focused our studies on the receptor subtypes. In hypertensive rats (SHR-SP/Izm, DOCA/salt), NP-AR was upregulated and NP-CR was downregulated. The ACE inhibitor derapril, but not the Ca2+ blocker manidipine, normalized the upregulated NP-AR, but the effect was completely abolished by the bradykinin beta 2-receptor antagonist, suggesting that bradykinin regulates the vascular NP-AR. The AT1 antagonist TCV-116, but not manidipine, reversed the downregulated NP-CR. Ang II decreased NP-CR in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells. These results suggest that upregulation of NP-AR and downregulation of NP-CR with the increased plasma NPs counteract hypertension by enhancing the action of NP. A beta-blocker (carvedilol) potentiated the hypotensive action of NPs by increasing plasma NPs and enhancing the vascular response to NPs via downregulation of the vascular and lung NP-CR. The newly found mode of actions could be related to its anti-heart failure effect. In genetically hyperglycemic Wistar fatty rats, vascular NP-BR and NP-AR were upregulated. Since plasma ANP and vascular CNP were significantly increased, the local CNP/NP-BR system as well as the systemic ANP/NP-AR system may play an important role in counteracting vascular remodeling in diabetes mellitus. All these observations provide in vivo evidence for the pathophysiological significance of the receptor subtype of the NPs.", 
    "525": "The tetrapeptide acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), a physiological inhibitor of the proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells, is degraded by the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE). Whereas synthetic AcSDKP (Goralatide) protects normal mice from the haematological toxicity of chemotherapy, it has a lower beneficial effect in humans. This discrepancy could be dependent on Goralatide administration schedules, as well as on the endogenous concentrations of AcSDKP and ACE, which vary during chemotherapy.", 
    "526": "We investigated the effect of one myelotoxic dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 200 mg kg-1) administered without or with Goralatide on blood, bone marrow (BM) and spleen AcSDKP concentrations, ACE activity, nucleated cell counts and survival of the primitive haematopoietic progenitors high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs).",

Repeated injections of Goralatide from 24 h before to 36 h after the i.p. injection of 5-FU spared BM HPP-CFCs. As an injection of 10 mg of Goralatide induced a short peak of plasma AcSDKP without modifying its BM concentrations, we suggest that its protective effect on HPP-CFCs could be mediated by its interference with other plasma molecules targeting to the BM.",

The patients had been taking digoxin, furosemide, captopril and aspirin for more than 3 months. Thirteen healthy subjects (mean age, 50 +/- 4.0 years) acted as controls. Compliance of the proximal (aorta and major branches, C1) and distal parts (C2) of the circulation were derived from a third order four-element modified Windkessel model which can reproduce arterial pressure waveforms, including both exponential and oscillatory sections. Active renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were determined on venous blood samples in the supine position and after 30 min active standing. There was decreased proximal (C1, 1.51 +/- 0.11 ml x mmHg(-1), P<0.01) and distal (C2, 0.050 +/- 0.011 ml x mmHg(-1)) arterial compliance in the chronic heart failure patients vs controls (C1, 1.71 +/- 0.16 ml x mmHg(-1); C2, 0.054 +/- 0.006 ml x mmHg(-1)). The chronic heart failure patients were characterized by an aldosterone escape phenomenon which was inversely correlated with the proximal arterial compliance in both supine (r= - 0.795, P=0.002) and standing (r= - 0.628, P=0.029) positions.",

Their primary clinical and laboratory features along with the details of their management were compared with those of similar cases from the literature. The seven patients died within one to four months of the diagnosis with a pattern of acute renal failure, left ventricular failure and malignant hypertension. Histopathologic examination was performed in four of the patients, in two of whom it revealed thickening of the wall of the interlobular arteries related to the scleroderma, and in the other two patients nonspecific lesions of malignant hypertension. This histopathologic particularity led us to propose, on the basis of multiple renal biopsies performed in patients with scleroderma, a lesion chronology of the kidney in patients with scleroderma. Nevertheless, the triggering factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms of scleroderma renal crisis remain unclear and its prognosis is severe. Early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other vasodilatators administered intravenously can prevent death and dialysis.",

Icatibant did not alter the renal hemodynamic response to captopril, but it significantly altered the change in plasma renin activity in response to ACE inhibition (-0.4+/-0.4 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour, as compared with 2.0+/-0.7 ng per milliliter per hour for captopril alone; P=0.007).

    "537": "The roles of ANG II in the brain mechanisms subserving thirst and Na appetite in baboons were investigated by chronic intracerebroventricular infusions of ANG II and AT1-receptor antagonists using subcutaneous miniosmotic pumps and by oral administration of captopril. ANG II at 3 or 5 micrograms/h for 7 days increased water intake from 2,455 +/- 107 to 7,052 +/- 562 ml/day by day 6 and 300 mM NaCl intake from 8.3 +/- 1.1 to 275 +/- 87 mmol/day by day 5. Concurrent intracerebroventricular losartan (300 micrograms/h) did not substantially reduce these responses, but they were abolished by intracerebroventricular ZD-7155 (50 micrograms/h). The increase of 300 mM NaCl intake when it was offered after intramuscular injection of furosemide, 2 mg . kg-1 . day-1 for 3 days, was unaltered by intracerebroventricular losartan (300 micrograms/h) but was reduced by intracerebroventricular ZD-7155 (50 micrograms/h) infused throughout Na depletion/repletion; oral captopril (1 g, 3 and 18 h before access to 300 mM NaCl) also reduced NaCl intake. Restriction of water intake to 25% of daily intake for 3 days caused a high intake of water on day 4, and this was reduced by intracerebroventricular losartan (300 micrograms/h) infused throughout the period of water restriction/rehydration. These novel results in a primate species suggest that brain ANG II is involved in both thirst and Na appetite, acting via AT1 receptors.", 
    "538": "The increase of glomerular filtration can often be observed in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, even in the early stage of the disease and it does not require the presence of microalbuminuria. This phenomenon can be explained by vasoconstriction occurring in the efferent arterioles. Eighteen normotensive, diabetic patients (aged: 28-42) who developed increased glomerular filtration were recruited in this study. The specific objectives were: 1. to study the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on the glomerular filtration, 2. to evaluate the effect of this treatment on blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters in normotensive, diabetic subjects. After a placebo period of one week, patients were treated orally a daily dose of 3 x 6.25 mg of captopril for twelve weeks. Glomerular filtration was assessed by the isotopic clearance method and blood pressure recordings were taken every 30 minutes throughout a day using an automatic programmable device. Preload, afterload and linear ejection fraction were estimated by echocardiograph, whereas cardiac index was measured by isotopic first pass technique. At the end of the treatment period a significant decrease of glomerular filtration was observed (from 141.9 +/- 10 ml/min to 98.9 +/- 12 ml/min; p < 0.01. Similarly, the afterload exhibited a significant drop due to drug treatment (45.6 +/- 5.8 x 10(3) dyn/cm2 vs. 55.4 +/- 4.7 x 10(3) dyn/cm2 at the end of the placebo period (p < 0.01). However, preload, linear ejection fraction, and cardiac index did not significantly change during the treatment. According to the results obtained from this study a beneficial effect of captopril on the early development of the glomerular hyperfiltration was demonstrated in normotensive diabetic patients who did not develop microalbuminuria. This issue needs to be investigated further in a large scale clinical trial.",

Myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition of the gastrocnemius was studied after electrophoretic separation of slow MHC1, fast oxidative MHC2a, and fast glycolytic MHC2b isoforms from needle microbiopsies obtained at baseline and after 6 months. EC improved in both groups. Peak V(O2) increased from 21.0+/-4.7 to 27.6+/-4.3 mL . kg-1 . min -1 (P=0.011) in the L group and from 17.5+/-5.0 to 25.0+/-5.5 mL . kg-1 . min -1 (P=0.014) in the E group. Similarly, ventilatory threshold changed from 15.0+/-4.0 to 19.9+/-4.9 mL (P=0. 049) with L and from 12.0+/-1.9 to 15.4+/-3.5 mL (P=0.039) with E. MCH1 increased from 61.2+/-11.2% to 75.4+/-7.6% with L (P=0.012) and from 60.6+/-13.1% to 80.1+/-10.9% (P=0.006) with E.

These changes are accompanied by a reshift of MHCs of leg skeletal muscle toward the slow, more fatigue-resistant isoforms. Magnitude of MHC1 changes correlates with the net peak V(O2) gain, which suggests that improved EC may be caused by favorable biochemical changes occurring in the skeletal muscle.", 
    "543": "Oral administration of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist 3-methyl-2,6-dimethyl-4-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl ]methoxy] pyridine (ME3221) inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin II at doses of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg in rats. A higher dose of ME3221 (3-10 mg/kg) was required to obtain the same inhibitory potency in dogs. The antagonistic potency of ME3221 for angiotensin II-induced contraction in the rabbit aorta (pA2 = 8.82) was about five times higher than that in the canine aorta (pA2 = 8.18). The inhibition constant of ME3221 for displacing [125I]angiotensin II binding to membrane fractions from the rabbit aorta (Ki = 3.84 nM) and rat liver (Ki = 2.55 nM) was significantly lower than that for the canine aorta (Ki = 84.5 nM), canine liver (Ki = 122 nM) and bovine adrenal cortex (Ki = 21.5 nM). In contrast, [Sar1, Ala8]angiotensin II had a similar inhibition constant (Ki = 0.85-4.67 nM) in the species investigated. Treatment with 5 mM dithiothreitol significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the angiotensin II-induced contractile response to 1.2% in the rabbit aorta, but it did not significantly reduce the response in the canine aorta (83.2%). Dithiothreitol reduced [125I]angiotensin II binding to membrane fractions from the rabbit aorta and the rat liver but partially inhibited binding in preparations that had a low affinity for ME3221. These data indicate a species difference in the angiotensin AT1 receptor: the canine and bovine angiotensin AT1 receptor has a relatively low affinity for ME3221 and is slightly resistant to dithiothreitol. The species difference in the angiotensin AT1 receptor reflects the in vivo efficacy of ME3221 in rats and dogs.",

Serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured prior to, as well as 3 and 8 months after initiation of ACE inhibition, mean arterial pressure was controlled via 24-h measurement and repeated spot measurements.

    "553": "We studied ultradian and circadian variations in blood pressure (BP) in patients with essential hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive agents. No patient had previously received antihypertensive agents before this study began. After a 2-wk control period, we performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 86 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stages I or II). The patients were then given a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (captopril or imidapril), a beta-receptor blocker (arotinolol or bisoprolol), or a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine or benidipine) twice daily to control BP. We evaluated the patients' BP once every 2 wk to ensure optimal control. After 12 wk, ultradian and circadian variations in BP were analyzed by the maximum entropy method (MEM). All antihypertensive agents decreased office systolic BP (SBP), office diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h SBP, and 24-h DBP. ACEI did not change office, 24-h, daytime, or nighttime pulse rate (PR). Arotinolol and bisoprolol decreased 24-h PR. All antihypertensive agents decreased 24-h, daytime, and nighttime pressure rate product. MEM showed that no antihypertensive agent affected the circadian variation in the 1st peak (24-h periodicity) of SBP, DBP, or PR. However, calcium channel blockers shortened the periodicity of circadian variations in the 2nd peak (12-h periodicity) of SBP and the 3rd peak (8 to 6 h periodicity) of SBP. Therefore, ultradian variations in BP should be carefully monitored in hypertensive patients treated with calcium channel blockers.",

Neither candesartan nor enalapril with concomitant high salt-loading attenuated the blood pressure (BP) elevation. LVH was also not attenuated significantly by these treatments. [Experiment 2] After 8 wk of 8% salt-loading, the rats were given a 0.3% NaCl diet and concurrently received candesartan, enalapril, or vehicle for 5 wk. Switching from the high-salt to low-salt diet significantly decreased BP and left ventricular mass in the vehicle-treated animals. Both candesartan and enalapril normalized BP during salt-depletion; the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system produced an additive reduction in LVH. These findings suggest that sodium intake and hemodynamic load, but not the renin-angiotensin system, may be major determinants of the development of LVH in DS rats.",

It has been known for many years that malignant essential hypertension rapidly causes deterioration of kidney function. This can be prevented by treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs. Mild-to-moderate essential hypertension causes significant renal function impairment only after a number of years. There are now data suggesting that the decline of renal function caused by mild-to-moderate essential hypertension can be prevented by anti-hypertensive treatment. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that anti-hypertensive drugs have a beneficial effect on the progression of renal insufficiency in patients with diabetic nephropathy and in chronic glomerulonephritis.

    "565": "Left ventricular (LV) mass progressively increases throughout life, reaching its greatest magnitude in senescence. In the normotensive elderly, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is mostly a consequence of a degenerative process in connective tissue. In hypertensive patients, LVH results from an increase in muscle mass and fibrotic tissue. LVH by echocardiographic criteria can be found in up to 50% of elderly patients with hypertension. Although associated with aging, LVH is associated with a higher rate of non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular events. Even in the absence of coronary stenosis, LVH is associated with reduced coronary reserve, increased number of arrhythmias and progressive deterioration in LV function. Conceivably, an increase in interstitial fibrosis and cross-linking collagen in the senescent heart is responsible for an increase in myocardial stiffness and diastolic abnormalities. Regression of LVH has been demonstrated not only to improve left ventricular filling and coronary reserve but also to diminish cardiac arrhythmias. Although few studies have demonstrated that the reduction of LV mass is associated with better cardiovascular prognosis, it seems reasonable to consider it a goal of antihypertensive therapy. Of all anti-hypertensive agents, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors seem to be the most powerful in reducing LV mass.",

After stabilization of the clinical status by means of basic therapy (nitrates, blockers of slow calcium channels, diuretics, antiaggregants), all patients were divided into two follow-up groups. The first group consisted of 36 patients who received renitec (10 mg/24 h), patients of group 2 were given enap in the same dose. The course of treatment lasted 12 weeks. The effectiveness of treatment was controlled by echocardiography according to the standard methods in M- and B-regimens.

    "567": "The spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat is a genetic model that exhibits both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypertension. To determine the impact of long-term treatment with the long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (PE) on the glucose metabolism, lipid levels, and heart in this model, studies were performed in three groups of SHR/N-cp rats maintained on a diet containing 54% carbohydrate with 18% sucrose and 36% starch. One group of obese rats received PE (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg body weight/d) for 3 to 4 months, a second group of obese rats received no treatment, and a third group of lean rats were used as controls. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased gradually in both untreated obese and lean rats, with lean animals showing slightly higher levels compared with untreated obese rats. By contrast, SBP was reduced to normal levels in PE-treated obese rats throughout the treatment period. Compared with lean rats, obese rats showed significantly higher body weight and fasting serum levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG). However, no significant differences were observed in these metabolic parameters between PE-treated and untreated obese rats. Plasma renin activity measured at the end of the treatment period was significantly higher in PE-treated rats compared with untreated obese and untreated lean rats. The mean heart weight and left ventricular weight, expressed in absolute terms or indexed to body weight, were significantly lower in PE-treated versus untreated obese and untreated lean rats. To further determine whether glucose metabolism is directly affected by PE treatment, in vitro glycogen synthesis was evaluated in isolated soleus muscles obtained from three additional groups of animals. The basal rate of muscle glycogen synthesis was significantly lower in obese compared with lean rats (P < .05), but did not differ between PE-treated and untreated obese rats. Maximal insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis increased threefold in PE-treated obese rats, but this increase did not differ from the increases observed in untreated obese and lean rats. In conclusion, the present study shows that long-term PE treatment in obese SHR/N-cp rats with NIDDM and hypertension effectively controlled systemic arterial pressure and resulted in a significant reduction in left ventricular weight. However, these favorable effects of PE were not associated with significant improvement in glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia in this model. PE also had no direct stimulatory effects on either basal or insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis in the isolated soleus muscle of obese rats, perhaps because of the severe insulin-resistant state of the animals. Our results support the clinical observations that antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors has neutral effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with combined hypertension and NIDDM.", 
    "568": "Investigations of calcium antagonists in patients with advanced heart failure have raised concern over an increased risk of worsening heart failure and heart failure deaths. We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median 14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients treated with amlodipine.", 
    "569": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril and the angiotensin II antagonist losartan on insulin sensitivity and plasma fibrinogen in overweight hypertensive patients. Twenty-eight overweight mild to moderate [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 and <110 mm Hg] hypertensives aged 43-64 years, after a 4-week placebo period, were randomized to perindopril, 4 mg o.d., or losartan, 50 mg o.d., for 6 weeks. Then, after a new placebo period, patients were crossed to the alternative regimen for further 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and of the treatment periods, blood pressure was measured, plasma fibrinogen was evaluated, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 min of clamp and total glucose requirement (TGR) were evaluated. Both perindopril and losartan reduced SBP (by a mean of 20.2 mm Hg, p < 0.001 vs. placebo; and 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002 vs. placebo, respectively) and DBP (by a mean of 15.2 mm Hg, p = 0.001 vs. placebo, and 11.8 mm Hg, p = 0.01 vs. placebo respectively), with no difference between the two treatments. GIR was significantly increased by perindopril (+2.91 mg/min/kg, p = 0.042 vs. placebo), but not by losartan (+0.28 mg/min/kg, NS). TGR was not modified by losartan but was increased by perindopril (+9.3 g, p = 0.042 vs. placebo). Plasma fibrinogen levels were reduced by perindopril (-53.4 mg/dl, p = 0.022 vs. placebo) but not by losartan (-16.8 mg/dl, NS). The perindopril-induced decrease in fibrinogen was correlated with the increase in GIR (r = 0.39; p < 0.01). These findings suggest that fibrinogen decrease produced by the ACE inhibitor is related to its action on insulin sensitivity, which seems to be dependent not on angiotensin II blockade but rather on other mechanisms.", 
    "570": "The objective of the study was to determine whether angiotensin (Ang) I elimination in lung circulation depends on the degree of myocardial damage with and without early long-term perindopril treatment in a rat model of myocardial injury induced by intracoronary microembolization. Twenty-one days after surgery, steady-state arterial [125I]-Ang I and [125I]-Ang II blood concentrations were measured after high-performance liquid chromatography separation during i.v. infusion of [125I]-Ang I in three groups of male Wistar conscious rats: (a) sham-operated rats receiving saline (sham group, n = 6); (b) rats after coronary microembolization receiving saline (saline group, n = 7); and (c) rats after coronary microembolization receiving perindopril (2 mg/kg/day; from days 2-20 after embolization; perindopril group, n = 6). Ang I clearance and the Ang I-to-Ang II concentration ratio (R) were estimated. The embolization per se resulted in focal fibrosis, appearance of hypertrophic and dystrophic cardiac myocytes, and was accompanied by increased Ang I clearance (1,479 vs. 314 ml/min in sham group), 1.8-fold decreased [125I]-Ang II arterial level, and decreased R (0.5 vs. 1.2 in sham group; p < 0.05). Only Ang I concentrations and R were correlated with number of scars (r = -0.77; p < 0.05; and r = -0.82; p < 0.01, respectively). Captopril bolus (1 mg/kg, i.v.) caused similar reduction in [125I]-Ang II blood concentration in both sham and saline groups, but a significant increase of [125I]-Ang I blood concentration was detected in the sham group only. Thus in rats with coronary microembolization, a higher proportion of Ang I in lung circulation is eliminated by pathways independent of angiotensin-converting enzyme. In the perindopril group, a reduced number of scars (seven vs. 17 per slice in the saline group; p < 0.05), density of dystrophic and hypertrophic cardiac myocytes, and increased content of cell glycogen were observed. It was accompanied by normalized arterial [125I]-Ang I concentration, Ang I clearance, and R; [125I]-Ang II concentration tended to that in sham group. Only in the sham and perindopril groups was there significant correlation between Ang I and Ang II concentrations. The clear relation between number of scars per slice and R (r = -0.83; p < 0.01) was observed in all rats with embolized coronary vessels (saline and perindopril groups together). In conclusion, in this experimental, model Ang I elimination in the lung circulation was directly related to the degree of myocardial damage. Early perindopril treatment prevented maladaptive changes in Ang I processing and led to significant reduction of the undesirable aftereffects of myocardial tissue damage. Our data demonstrate the cardioprotective action of perindopril based on its beneficial influence on the renin-angiotensin system disturbances.",

    "576": "Extensive hemodynamic monitoring was carried out in all patients. Plasma concentrations of endothelin-1, angiotensin II, soluble thrombomodulin, and soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and granule membrane protein-140) were measured from arterial blood samples. All measurements were carried out before the start of the infusion (\"baseline\" values) and daily during the following 5 days. All endothelial-derived substances (thrombomodulin, endothelin-1, and all soluble adhesion molecules) were similarly increased beyond normal in both group. Endothelin-1 increased only in the untreated control patients (from 6.9 +/- 0.7 to 14.3 +/- 1.4 mg/mL). Soluble thrombomodulin increased in the untreated control patients (from 58 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 14 ng/mL [p < .05]), but significantly decreased in the enalaprilat-treated patients. Soluble adhesion molecules increased in the untreated control group (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule from 92 +/- 14 to 192 +/- 29 ng/mL; intercellular adhesion molecule-1 from 480 +/- 110 to 850 +/- 119 ng/ mL) and returned almost to normal values in the enalaprilat patients. The survival rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Control patients developed severe sepsis and septic shock more often than the enalaprilat-treated group.", 
    "577": "The complex pathogenesis of endothelial function abnormalities in sepsis may offer a large number of pharmacologic interventions. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat resulted in a reduced release of soluble endothelial-derived substances into the circulating blood, which may indicate an improved endothelial function. The specific actions of enalaprilat on the endothelium have to be elucidated in further studies.", 
    "578": "Huntington disease (HD) fibroblasts subjected to stress exhibit an enzyme profile that is different from that exhibited by escapee (unaffected members of families with HD) or control fibroblasts. The specific activity of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in normally cultured HD fibroblasts was not different from that in control and escapee fibroblasts. However, in escapee and control fibroblasts subjected to stress by withholding fresh medium, the specific activity of GAPDH in cells harvested by trypsinization increased greatly 3 weeks after withholding medium ( approximately 8-fold), but the increase was significantly less pronounced ( approximately 3-fold) in the HD fibroblasts. In contrast, only small changes occurred in the specific activity of lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) over the same time period, and the values were not significantly different among the three groups at any time point. The specific activity of hexokinase (HK) was significantly higher in the HD fibroblasts at 1-3 weeks after withholding fresh medium than in the escapee/control fibroblasts. Finally, the total yield of fibroblasts per culture flask (as judged by protein content) was significantly greater for the stressed HD fibroblasts than for the escapee and control fibroblasts at 2 and 3 weeks after withholding medium. The present results are in accord with the hypothesis that HD is a disease associated with latent, generalized metabolic abnormalities.", 
    "579": "In lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis, the activation of phagocytic cells produces high amounts of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are partly implicated in the pathogenic process. In this study, the ex vivo antioxidant activity of nacystelyn (NAL), a recently developed mucoactive thiol-containing agent, was investigated using the respiratory burst of human blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The ROS generation was induced by serum-opsonized zymosan and assessed with luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The activity of NAL was compared with N-acetylcysteine (ACC) and captopril, other thiol-containing pharmacological agents having documented antioxidant properties. The three drugs significantly inhibited the ECL response of activated PMNs in the presence of luminol, a luminogenic agent which mostly reflects the production of hydroxyl and hypohalite radicals. NAL was more efficient than the other two drugs: the concentrations producing a 50% inhibition (IC50) of total luminol-ECL were 290 microM, 1580 microM and 760 microM for NAL, ACC and captopril, respectively. The inhibition of the lucigenin-ECL response of activated PMNs was less marked for all compounds suggesting a poorer reactivity with superoxide radicals. These findings demonstrate that NAL, at concentrations obtainable in vivo by inhalation, impairs the PMNs chemiluminescence response related to hydroxyl and hypohalite radicals production. As those radicals are highly cytotoxic, NAL appears as a promising agent in the prevention of oxidative lung damage caused by an active inflammatory response.", 
    "580": "Angioedema is a well-known adverse effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The bradykinin accumulation as a result of the decreased degradation of bradykinin is thought to be the causal mechanism. Angiotensin II antagonists seem to have no effect on the degradation of bradykinin. Therefore, it was expected that angioedema would not occur during treatment with losartan potassium, the first orally active angiotensin II antagonist.", 
    "581": "We reviewed the 13 case reports of angioedema associated with the use of losartan reported to Lareb (Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation, Den Bosch) and to the Drug Safety Unit of the Inspectorate for Health Care, Ryswyh, in the Netherlands since the introduction of losartan in 1995 until May 1997.", 
    "582": "In all 13 cases, a diagnosis of angioedema attributed to the use of losartan seems to be very plausible. In 7 cases the diagnosis could not be confirmed by a physician because the symptoms had already been resolved, but the signs and symptoms clearly indicated angioedema. The adverse reactions occurred within 24 hours to 16 months after the initiation of losartan therapy. Three patients had previously experienced angioedema during treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Eleven of the patients involved were women and 2 were men.", 
    "583": "Our observations strongly suggest that the onset of angioedema was associated with the use of losartan. Physicians and pharmacists should be aware of this potentially life-threatening complication. It may be advisable not to prescribe angiotensin II antagonists to patients with a history of angioedema (of whatever origin).", 
    "584": "Despite randomized controlled trials demonstrating mortality reduction, many studies have documented persistent low rates of prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in patients with heart failures; the reasons for this pattern remain poorly defined. In addition, some authors have argued that the results of carefully controlled clinical trials do not translate well into the uncontrolled world of clinical practice, and the mortality benefits of ACE-I may not extend into special populations such as the elderly.",

    "587": "We identified a diagnosis of heart failure in 1016 patients without a contraindication to ACE-I. Three hundred seventy-eight of these patients were receiving ACE-I at the time of admission. Of the 638 remaining, 257 had their left ventricular systolic function assessed and 92 had diminished function. Of these 92, 50 (54.3%) were discharged on a regimen of ACE-I. The only significant difference in baseline comorbidity or demographic variables between those given and those not given ACE-I was that patients not prescribed ACE-I were older. Using multivariate analysis, younger age and cardiology consultation predicted ACE-I prescription (P = .02). By life-table analysis, mortality at 1 year following discharge from the index hospitalization was lower in those treated with ACE-I than in those not so treated (P = .03). The Deyo index of comorbidity, prescription of an ACE-I, site of treatment, and presence or absence of cardiology consultation were significantly associated with 1-year mortality by multivariate analysis (P<.001).", 
    "588": "Underinvestigation and undertreatment of chronic heart failure persists. Failure to treat elderly patients with ACE-I is associated with a mortality that appears to be greater than that seen in the placebo arms of large clinical trials of ACE-I therapy. Within the population studied, older patients are less likely to be treated. Failure of age to significantly add to prediction of mortality implies that the apparent bias against treating older patients with chronic heart failure with ACE-I is not justified. Because mortality is dependent on provider and site of treatment, further reductions in mortality from chronic heart failure may require intensive and selective local efforts, or development of regional heart failure centers.", 
    "589": "To investigate the efficacy and safety of fosinopril in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), patients with mild to moderate CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions <40% were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive fosinopril 5 to 20 mg every day (n = 122) or enalapril 5 to 20 mg every day (n = 132) for 1 year.",

    "594": "In general, AMI therapies that are effective in younger patients are also effective in older patients. Conversely, older age is associated with an increased risk of complications from therapy, implying that careful patient selection is required to optimize outcomes while minimizing risks. The principal limitation of currently available data is that relatively few patients older than the age of 80 have been enrolled in prospective randomized clinical trials.", 
    "595": "Thrombolysis and primary angioplasty are effective in establishing reperfusion and improving clinical outcomes in older patients with AMI. In the absence of contraindications, aspirin and beta blockers should be considered standard therapy in AMI patients of all ages, whereas heparin, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated in selected subgroups. At the present time, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, and antiarrhythmic agents are not recommended for routine use in the AMI setting, and the role of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, low molecular weight heparin, and other newer agents await the results of ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "596": "Neonatal treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist losartan in rats induces irreversible renal histological abnormalities, mainly papillary atrophy, in association with an impairment in urinary concentrating ability. The aim of the present study was to assess proximal tubular function in adult rats treated neonatally with enalapril. Male Wistar rats received daily, intraperitoneal injections of either enalapril (10 mg kg-1) or isotonic saline vehicle from 3 to 24 days of age. In 15-week-old, hydropenic rats we analysed: (i) proximal tubular iso-osmotic fluid reabsorption using the method of lithium clearance; and (ii) maximal tubular D-glucose reabsorption (TmG), under pentobarbital anaesthesia. The main findings were that neonatally enalapril-treated rats showed: (i) reductions in absolute (APRH2O) and fractional (FPRH2O) iso-osmotic fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubules (APRH2O: 0.50 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.03 mL min-1 g KW-1, P < 0.05; FPRH2O: 58 +/- 3 vs. 68 +/- 2%, P < 0.05); and (ii) a normal TmG. In addition, during baseline clearance measurements neonatally enalapril-treated rats showed increases in urine volume and fractional excretion rates of sodium and potassium, a reduction in urine osmolality, whereas glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were unaltered. These results suggest that neonatal ACE inhibition produces an irreversible, but differentiated, abnormality in proximal tubular function. Thus, the development of a normal proximal tubular function in the rat seems to be dependent on an intact renin-angiotensin system, (RAS) neonatally.", 
    "597": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the derangement in renal and cardiac function in congestive heart failure. The present study evaluated the effects of eprosartan, a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on renal hemodynamic and excretory parameters and on the development of cardiac hypertrophy in rats with aortocaval fistula, an experimental model of congestive heart failure. Infusion of eprosartan (1.0 mg/kg) in rats with aortocaval fistula produced a significant increase (+34%) in total renal blood flow and a sustained decrease (-33%) in the calculated renal vascular resistance. These effects on renal hemodynamics were more pronounced than those observed in sham-operated control rats and occurred despite a significant fall (-12%) in mean arterial blood pressure. Moreover, eprosartan caused a preferential increase in renal cortical blood perfusion and significantly increased glomerular filtration in rats with congestive heart failure. Chronic administration of eprosartan (5.0 mg/kg per day for 7 days through osmotic minipumps inserted intraperitoneally on the day of operation) resulted in a significant enhancement of urinary sodium excretion compared with nontreated rats with heart failure. Moreover, administration of eprosartan to salt-retaining rats with congestive heart failure resulted in a progressive increase and ultimate recovery in urinary sodium excretion. Finally, early treatment with eprosartan blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy in rats with aortocaval fistula to a larger extent than the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. These findings emphasize the importance of angiotensin II in mediating the impairment in renal function and induction of cardiac hypertrophy in heart failure and further suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockade may be a useful treatment of these consequences in severe cardiac failure.", 
    "598": "A soluble angiotensin (Ang) II-generating enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from the rat mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) perfusate by a combination of gel filtration and affinity chromatographies. The enzyme is a glycoprotein of 28.5 kDa (SDS-PAGE), whose N-terminal sequence is identical with that of the rat pancreatic elastase-2; therefore the enzyme will henceforth be referred to as rat MAB elastase-2. When Ang I was used as the substrate, the enzyme specifically released Ang II and the dipeptide His-Leu (Km=36 microM; Kcat=1530 min-1). The catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km=42.5 min-1 microM-1) of this reaction was comparable to those of other known Ang I-converting enzymes. The proteolytic specificity of the purified enzyme toward mellitin, oxidized insulin B chain, somatostatin-14 and renin substrate tetradecapeptide suggested that the enzyme-substrate interaction was defined by an extended substrate binding site, typical of elastases-2 of pancreatic origin. According to the sensitivity of the rat MAB elastase-2 to various inhibitors this enzyme could be described as a member of the chymostatin-sensitive group of Ang II-forming serine proteases. The localization and biochemical properties of this enzyme suggest that it might play a role in the regional control of vascular tonus.", 
    "599": "The aim of this study was to investigate the possible link between the regression of the left ventricular mass induced by ACE-inhibition and L-type calcium channels. For this purpose, an evaluation of both L-type calcium channels and AT1 receptor patterns in the left ventricular tissue of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was made before and after long-term treatment with ramipril. An abnormal density of both dihydropyridine and AT1 receptors was observed in SHR at 24 weeks, compared to age-matched control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (dihydropyridine receptor Bmax: 1. 30+/-0.09 vs 1.14+/-0.06 pmol mg-1 proteins, P<0.001; AT1 receptor Bmax: 1.35+/-0.07 vs 2.62+/-0.08, P<0.001 pmol mg-1 proteins). A treatment for 10 weeks with ramipril induced a significant decrease in the left ventricular mass index of SHR, as well as a significant decrease in dihydropyridine receptor density (Bmax: 0.96+/-0.01 vs 1. 39+/-0.08 pmol mg-1 proteins, P<0.001) and a significant increase in AT1 receptor density (Bmax: 3.08+/-0.26 vs 2.78+/-0.09 pmol mg-1 proteins, ramipril-treated SHR vs vehicle-treated SHR, P<0.001). These results suggest that the decrease in left ventricular mass after treatment with ramipril may be dependent on changes in L-type calcium channels other than the direct effect on circulating and tissue angiotensin II (ang II) levels: involvement of calcium channels and subsequent calcium influx into cardiac cells could be proposed as an additional mechanism for the regression of left ventricular mass after ACE-inhibition.", 
    "600": "It has been suggested that combined inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) may lower blood pressure more effectively than either treatment alone, independent of the degree of salt and volume status or the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The effects of NEP inhibition in hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus are largely unknown. We therefore compared ACE inhibition, NEP inhibition, and dual NEP/ACE inhibition in diabetic hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) aged 9 to 10 weeks were injected with either streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) or citrate buffer and randomized to receive either the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg/kg BID), the NEP inhibitor SCH 42495 (30 mg/kg BID), the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor S 21402 (25 or 50 mg/kg BID), or vehicle by gavage for 4 weeks. A group of diabetic SHR was also allocated to receive the combination of SCH 42495 (30 mg/kg BID) and captopril (25 mg/kg BID). The degree of renal NEP inhibition was determined by autoradiography, and plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined by radioimmunoassay. In diabetic SHR, the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor (50 mg/kg BID), as well as the combination of the NEP inhibitor and the ACE inhibitor, reduced systolic blood pressure more effectively than the ACE inhibitor (P<0.001) or the NEP inhibitor (P<0.001) alone. In nondiabetic SHR, the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor and the ACE inhibitor were equally effective, while the NEP inhibitor had only slight blood pressure lowering effects. Relative heart weight decreased in parallel to the changes in blood pressure. Renal NEP was clearly inhibited (70% to 92%; P<0.001) by both the NEP inhibitor and the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor. Both the ACE inhibitor and the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor increased PRA, but the stimulating effect of dual NEP/ACE inhibition on PRA was less than that observed with ACE inhibition alone (P<0.05). Albuminuria in diabetic SHR was lower during treatment with both the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor (50 mg/kg BID) and the combination of NEP inhibition and ACE inhibition compared with vehicle treatment (P<0.05). In conclusion, the present study shows that hypertension in SHR with streptozotocin-induced diabetes is modulated by natriuretic peptides and thus is sensitive to NEP inhibition. The increased efficacy of dual NEP/ACE inhibition on blood pressure in diabetic SHR, compared with ACE or NEP inhibition alone, suggests that this therapeutic approach may prove beneficial in the treatment of hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus and other forms of volume-dependent hypertension.", 
    "601": "The aim was to determine whether enalaprilat (0.08 mg/kg/min) or losartan (0.01 mg/kg/min) administration before ischemia can improve postischemic systolic and diastolic dysfunction ('stunned myocardium') and attenuate the 'hyperfunction' phase at the beginning of reperfusion. An isolated isovolumic rabbit heart preparation was subjected to 15 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion without (group 1) or with pretreatment with enalaprilat (group 2) or losartan (group 3). Left ventricular developed pressure and end-diastolic pressure (diastolic stiffness) were measured and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (T, Tau) and the ratio between +dP/dt and -dP/dt were calculated. In comparison to the stunned group (group 1) both enalaprilat (group 2) and losartan (group 3) exerted a significant protective effect on postischemic recovery of contractile state and diastolic stiffness. Only enalaprilat attenuated the 'hypercontractile' phase. However, both enalaprilat and losartan failed to improve myocardial relaxation. In summary, these data strongly suggest a direct deleterious action of the local renin-angiotensin system on ischemic myocardium and diminution of myocardial stunning with its successful blockade. Although, we can not exclude the possibility that bradykinin has some cardioprotective effect, these data suggest that angiotensin exacerbates myocardial injury.", 
    "602": "We determined plasma metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentrations in 30 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) at an initial examination (baseline) and on three separate occasions during a 48-month follow-up period. All patients had normal urinary albumin excretion (<20 microg/min) at the first three examinations. At the fourth examination (48 months after the first examination), 22 patients had normal urinary albumin excretion and eight had microalbuminuria (median, 36.4 microg/min; range, 20.2 to 46.6 microg/min). Compared with patients with normal urinary albumin excretion, patients with microalbuminuria had significantly higher plasma levels of MMP-9 at the second (56+/-14 microg/L v36+/-12 microg/L; P < 0.05), third (88+/-23 microg/L v 39+/-14 microg/L; P < 0.01), and fourth (117+/-30 microg/L v 44+/-16 microg/L; P < 0.01) examinations, but not at the first examination (34+/-12 microg/L v 33+/-14 microg/L; P=NS). An increase in plasma MMP-9 concentrations preceded the occurrence of microalbuminuria within 4 years. The groups did not differ with regard to age, sex, duration of NIDDM, blood pressure, or mean glycated hemoglobin. In addition, the eight patients with microalbuminuria were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril; 0.5 mg once daily) for 6 months. Microalbuminuria was reduced to within the normal range, and plasma MMP-9 concentrations were significantly decreased with the cilazapril treatment (52+/-18 microg/L; P < 0.01). However, serum MMP-1 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 showed no change during the study period. These data suggest that plasma MMP-9 concentrations preceded and may predict the development of microalbuminuria in NIDDM.", 
    "603": "Functional and structural changes of chronic renal allograft failure share similarities with other chronic nephropathies with low nephron number. In models of reduced nephron number, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers prevented proteinuria and retarded renal lesions. This study investigates whether blockade of angiotensin II activity prevented chronic allograft injury in the Fisher 344 --> Lewis rat kidney transplant model, and compares its effect with that of calcium channel blockers, the main antihypertensive agents used in transplant patients to control BP. Transplanted rats received either no treatment (control), the type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, or the calcium channel blocker lacidipine. Rats received cyclosporine for the first 10 d posttransplant to prevent acute rejection. Doses of antihypertensive drugs were adjusted to achieve a comparable level of BP control throughout the study. Awake systolic BP was comparable in animals given losartan or lacidipine during the 6-mo observation period. Daily treatment with losartan but not lacidipine resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of proteinuria, preserved glomerular and tubulointerstitial structure, and improved graft survival compared with corresponding parameters in control untreated rats. GFR, measured as inulin and p-aminohippurate clearances, respectively, in rats surviving the 6-mo follow-up, was numerically but not significantly higher in losartan-treated animals than in all other groups. Thus, at comparable levels of BP control, losartan but not lacidipine effectively protects animals from chronic allograft injury and allows long-term survival.",

Intraoperatively, increases of mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 85 mmHg or > 80 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were treated by an urapidil bolus. The total intraoperative amount of urapidil was documented for both groups. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics as well as the plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin and renin were measured intraoperatively and up to 2 h after admission to the intensive care unit.",

The same amount of urapidil had to be given in the two groups to maintain MAP below the defined limit.",

Normalization in the remaining patients may require a combination of two or more drugs. This review considers the rationale and the evaluation of combinations with drugs interacting with the renin-angiotensin system (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor antagonists) with other drugs. The combinations may be justified when giving an additive or synergistic action and when reducing clinical or metabolic side-effects. Recent developments concern the potential benefit of combining ACEI and angiotensin receptor antagonists.", 
    "609": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is now recognized as an effective approach for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In addition, ACE inhibitors are very effective for the prevention of chronic renal failure. Today, it is possible to antagonize the effects of angiotensin II more specifically using AT1 receptor antagonists. Several non-peptide, orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists have recently been developed clinically. These new molecules are as effective as ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers at reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, they appear to have similar systemic and renal hemodynamic properties in patients with congestive heart failure and renal diseases. Now, several large clinical trials such as the LIFE, the RENAAL and the ELITE II studies are under way to investigate the long-term benefits of one of these compounds in hypertension, heart failure and type II diabetic nephropathy.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were the first of the RAAS blocking agents to be widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, another class of pharmacological blockers of the RAAS, have more recently been shown to be safe and useful in hypertension and perhaps also in heart failure. This review deals with the similarities and differences between these two classes of drugs with particular emphasis on the effects of the drugs on the heart, the blood vessels, the kidney (role of the drugs as nephroprotective), the brain, the hormonal profile and finally the potential adverse effects. The place of angiotensin II antagonists in congestive heart failure remains to be more precisely defined.",

Data of 1115 in-patients of Hospices Civils de Lyon were collected. We have shown the feasibility of such a study in spite of many difficulties (52.15 per cent of questionnaires received, missing data...). Reference treatments such as ACE inhibitors in heart failure treatment or betablockers for high blood pressure represent respectively only 14.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent of the prescriptions in these indications. Within the framework of quality of care improvement, the study of the appropriateness of the treatments enables identification of domains where better therapeutic information is necessary.", 
    "612": "The efficacy and good safety of fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor recently made available to the medical profession in France, has been demonstrated by several controlled studies versus placebo and reference antihypertensives. A phase IV multicentre clinical trial was conducted among general practitioners in order to assess, on a larger scale and under conditions of daily practice, the results obtained in terms of blood pressure control and quality of life as well as the clinical and laboratory safety of the drug. This analysis was based on 19,435 hypertensive patients, 989 of whom were over the age of 75 years, followed for 12 weeks after introduction of fosinopril either as monotherapy or in combination with the antihypertensive treatment(s) already prescribed. Under these conditions, after 12 weeks of treatment, blood pressure was controlled in 79.8% of patients, with improvement of all items of the quality of life scale. The very low incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events, even among the oldest patients, confirms the safety of use of fosinopril, predictive of good long-term compliance with treatment.",

Mean SBP decreased from 169.5 +/- 13.1 mmHg to 150.5 +/- 12.5 mmHg after 4 weeks and to 145.0 +/- 10.9 mmHg after 8 weeks. Of the 16,900 patients included in the safety analysis, 853 (5.0%) dropped out of the study, 504 (3.0%) for adverse events (AE). The most frequent AE were: cough (3.5%), headache (0.9%), dizziness (0.8%), asthenia (0.6%) and nausea (0.5%). 13 deaths were observed during the study, mainly due to stroke or cancer. Six cases of raised serum creatinine level, 3 cases of angio-oedema and 2 cases of hepatitis were also reported. After 8 weeks of treatment, the main predictors of therapeutic response (DBP) were: recently discovered hypertension (86.3% of controlled DBP), regular exercise (85.5%) and age < 50 years (84.6%). Conversely: obesity, diabetes mellitus (77.9%), previously treated with several drugs (75.2%) and initial DBP > or = 105 mmHg (74.5%) were not predictive. Predictive factors emerging from logistic regression were : baseline DBP (< 105 mmHg), history of hypertension, body mass index, initial treatment of hypertension (no treatment--one drug--several drugs) and age.",

    "624": "The tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) may have specific roles that complement those of the systemic RAS. In the adrenal, the tissue RAS has been implicated in the regulation of glomerulosa tissue growth and function, and in mediating the response of the tissue to stimulation by ACTH and potassium ions. To examine the role of the rat adrenal tissue RAS in its response to angiotensin II stimulation, adrenals were incubated either as bisected glands or as separated capsular glands (largely glomerulosa) under control conditions, or in the presence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, or of angiotensin II, or both. Captopril inhibited the two different tissue preparations in different ways. In the capsular gland it inhibited basal aldosterone output, but facilitated its response to angiotensin II. In the bisected gland, captopril inhibited the response of aldosterone to angiotensin II. Other data suggest that one way in which captopril functions is by preventing the conversion of fasciculata-generated 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone (18-OH-DOC) to aldosterone in the glomerulosa. Immunolocalisation of 18-OH-DOC in perfused rat adrenal confirms that one function of angiotensin II is to mobilise tissue-sequestered 18-OH-DOC. The results illustrate the importance of tissue RAS in the synthesis of aldosterone and the response to angiotensin II.",

Using echocardiographic method left atrial dimension (LA), left ventricular end diastolic (LVEDD) and end systolic diameter (LVESD), interventricular septum (IVSDD) and posterior wall end diastolic diameter (LVPWDD), ejection fraction (LVEF) and fraction of shortening (LVFS) were measured. Plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide, endotelin, neuropeptide Y and aldosterone and plasma renin activity were estimated radioimmunologically. All echocardiographic and neurohormonal measures were performed 4 times: before therapy, after 3 days, 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment with molsidomine. We observed significant increase in LVEF, which at baseline was 33.8% and after 3 months 44.8% (p < 0.05).

    "630": "Arterial tone and water-electrolyte homeostasis are regulated by several peptides, including angiotensin II (AII), bradykinin (BK), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelins (ETs). Changing the concentrations of these peptides in the plasma, tissue, or urine by decreasing the levels of angiotensin II and endothelins and increasing BK and ANP concentrations, is one way of modulating the hemodynamic load. The metabolism of these peptides in essentially controlled by three enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), which all belong to the group of zinc metallopeptidases. Inhibition of these peptidases by a single compound (a dual inhibitor) that inhibits at once angiotensin II formation and BK and ANP inactivation, causes vasodilatation with reduction in blood pressure with reduction in blood pressure and increases natriuresis. The design of these inhibitors has often be relied on structure-activity studies, based on active-site models derived from structural data on thermolysin (TLN). The results of a large number of pharmacological experiments and those issued from some clinical studies using selective or mixed inhibitors show that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, dual ACE/NEP inhibitors such as S21,402 produce dose-related decreases (-15 to -40 mmHg) in mean arterial pressure and reductions in left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac size. These compounds produce also an increase in urinary levels of BK, ANP and cGMP associated with enhanced urine output and sodium excretion. Moreover inhibition of NEP appears to improve the cardio- and reno-protective effects resulting from ACE inhibition and could also reduce hypertrophy of vascular walls. Inhibition of ECE seems to result in a weak reduction in blood pressure, an effect which could be emphasized by using dual ECE/ACE or ECE/NEP inhibitors. According to these results mixed dual inhibitors could be of great interest for the treatment of severe hypertension and chronic heart failure. Potent triple inhibitors blocking ACE, NEP and ECE could also be developed.",

During 482+/-161 days of follow-up, cardiothoracic ratio, SDNN, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and serum sodium were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. The risk ratio for a 41.2-ms decrease in SDNN was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.16 to 2.44). The annual mortality rate for the study population in SDNN subgroups was 5.5% for >100 ms, 12.7% for 50 to 100 ms, and 51.4% for <50 ms. SDNN, creatinine, and serum sodium were related to progressive heart failure death.

The results reported in the present study show that modulators of the renin-angiotensin system, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor captopril and the angiotensin II receptor type I antagonist valsartan, have potent inhibitory effects on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in vitro. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra is increased by captopril, whereas IL-6 production is decreased by valsartan. These effects are exerted mainly at high concentrations of the drugs. Administration of one dose of captopril or valsartan in therapeutic dosages to patients with essential hypertension did not influence LPS-stimulated production of cytokines by whole blood. In conclusion, despite inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro, it is unlikely that captopril or valsartan could be used in anticytokine therapeutic strategies in vivo.",

The column was kept at a constant temperature of (40+/-0.2) degrees C. Detection was performed using a glassy carbon electrode at a potential of 1350 mV. Sample preparation for urine consisted of a solid-phase extraction using C8 cartridges. This procedure allowed recoveries greater than 85% for both compounds. The method proved to be accurate, precise and sensitive enough to be applied to pharmacokinetic studies and it has been applied to urine samples obtained from four hypertensive patients (detection limit of 50 ng/ml for cilazapril and 40 ng/ml for cilazaprilat in urine).

    "640": "The hemoregulatory peptide N-Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) has been shown in vivo to inhibit the cycling of murine hematopoietic stem cells triggered into S-phase by either cytotoxic drug administration or irradiation. This property, further confirmed using in vitro models, demonstrates that the peptide has an in vivo protective effect on the hematopoietic system. AcSDKP has been shown to be a physiological substrate of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which catabolizes the peptide through a dipeptidasic activity. Thus, oral administration of ACE inhibitor to humans has led to an increase in the plasma AcSDKP concentration. In the present paper, we report on the in vivo effect of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, on the proliferative status of murine hematopoietic stem cells triggered into S-phase by irradiation. Administration of lisinopril (10 mg/kg) 1 hour after irradiation led to a 90 to 100% inhibition of murine plasma ACE activity as observed during the first 4 hours postirradiation. This inhibition was correlated with a 600% increase in the endogenous plasma AcSDKP level and a total suppression at 24 hours of entry of the hematopoietic stem cell into the cell cycle. We discuss the possible role of ACE in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation through control of the AcSDKP concentration.", 
    "641": "The mechanism for hepatic uptake of temocaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is predominantly excreted into bile was studied using isolated rat hepatocytes and COS-7 cells expressing the organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp1). The uptake of temocaprilat into isolated rat hepatocytes exhibited saturation with a Km of 20.9 microM and a Vmax of 0.21 nmol/min/mg protein. This uptake was temperature sensitive and was significantly reduced by metabolic inhibitors, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent and an anion-exchange inhibitor, although the replacement of Na+ with Li+ in the medium did not affect the uptake. [3H]Temocaprilat uptake was inhibited by estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and dibromosulphophthalein, typical substrates for the Na+-independent organic anion transporter, in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas excess estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide did not completely inhibit the uptake. Temocaprilat uptake into COS-7 cells transfected with oatp1 cDNA revealed a concentration-dependency with a Km of 46.7 microM, a value comparable with that obtained in isolated hepatocytes. The contribution of oatp1 to carrier-mediated hepatic uptake of temocaprilat was less than 50% by correcting the uptake clearance with that of estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide. A good linear correlation was observed for the inhibitory effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (benazeprilat, cilazaprilat, delaprilat and enalaprilat) between isolated hepatocytes and oatp1-expressing cells. These data suggest that oatp1, along with another transporter(s), mediates the uptake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors into rat hepatocytes.",

Valsartan or benazeprilat given continuously by subcutaneous osmotic minipump beginning at 10.5 weeks of age lowered blood pressure, as determined by radiotelemetry, prevented proteinuria, prolonged survival and decreased the severity of histopathological changes in the heart and kidney. These results indicate that angiotensin receptor blockade affords a similar degree of protection as inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in salt-loaded stroke-prone SHR. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a primary contribution of angiotensin II to the maintenance of blood pressure and support a principal role for angiotensin II-dependent mechanisms in the development of end-organ damage in the salt-loaded stroke-prone SHR.", 
    "643": "This work was conducted to determine whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (enalapril and captopril) administered to mother rats prenatally can potentiate a re-opening of the neonatal ductus arteriosus (DA) induced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) after postnatal closure. A subcutaneous injection of PGE2 (4 micrograms) was administered to newborn rats 3 hr after a Cesarean delivery from females which had been orally given 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg/day of enalapril or 15 or 150 mg/kg/day of captopril from day 14 to day 20 of gestation. The ratio of the DA to the pulmonary artery (PA) was determined at intervals after the injection. The DA/PA ratio was significantly higher in the newborn rats of mothers who were transplacentally administered these agents compared to the controls, except at the low dose (0.1 mg/kg) group of enalapril. We found that the level in the neonatal lungs of 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase, a key enzyme that catalyzes PGE2 to convert it to its inactive metabolite 15-keto-PGE2, was not affected after maternal treatment with enalapril or captopril. These results indicate that the increased ductal responsiveness to PGE2 in newborn rats was a common response after maternal ACEI treatment, but the catabolism of PGE2 in the lungs did not contribute to this response.", 
    "644": "Abnormal intracellular Ca2(+)-handling appears to be a major cause of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in animals and humans with cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and heart failure. However, the precise mechanisms which cause alteration of Ca2(+)-handling remain unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of neurohormonal systems may play a central role. In particular, widespread awareness of the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has occurred since experimental and clinical studies have detailed the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. To evaluate in vivo the role of activated RAS in the regulation of (a) cardiac receptor expression and signal transduction mechanisms and (b) Ca2+ homeostasis, transgenic TG(mREN2)27 rats harbouring the murine renin Ren2d gene were chosen. These animals develop fulminant hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy at an early age despite low levels of renin in the plasma. High expression of the transgene in the vasculature and the heart is associated with increased local formation of angiotensin II. In the Ren2-transgenic model alterations of beta-adrenergic neuroeffector mechanisms, Ca2(+)-handling and alpha-adrenergic signal transduction are observed which are very similar to those observed in the myocardium of patients with end-stage heart failure. Moreover, treatment with specific inhibitors of the RAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor antagonists, largely reversed these defects. Studies on TG(mREN2)27 rats may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease and mechanisms which promote disease progression to end-stage heart failure and also may have important implications with regard to therapeutics of heart failure in man.",

    "649": "1. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the compensation of major blood pressure disturbances such as haemorrhage and is involved in the tonic long-term (> 1 day) maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). Since its contribution to the short-term (< 1 h) buffering of normal blood pressure variability is not known, this was investigated in resting conscious dogs. 2. The regulatory efficiency and the response time of the RAS were studied by an acute step reduction of renal artery pressure to 70 mmHg for 1 h using a suprarenal aortic cuff. After a delay of at least 100 s, MABP rose exponentially by 22 +/- 5 mmHg in normal dogs (n = 4), by 6 +/- 3 mmHg after angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (n = 4), and by 25 +/- 5 mmHg after ganglionic blockade (n = 4). MABP returned to control after release of the cuff with similar time courses. The time constants of the MABP responses were in the range of 20 min. Thus, possible feedback oscillations of the RAS would be expected around 0.0025 Hz (1/(4 x 100 s)); a buffering effect would be possible below this frequency. 3. Blood pressure variability was investigated by spectral analysis of MABP from 3.75 h recordings in the frequency ranges of 0.002-0.003 Hz (feedback oscillations) and below 0.002 Hz (buffering effect). 4. ACE inhibition (n = 7) decreased MABP by 11 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.05), but in both frequency ranges integrated spectral density was not affected. ACE inhibition also failed to significantly change spectral density in either of the two frequency ranges under the following conditions: (1) during ganglionic blockade (n = 7), (2) during a low-sodium diet (except for a very slight elevation below 0.002 Hz) (n = 7), and (3) when the fall of MABP induced by ACE inhibition was compensated by an angiotensin II infusion (n = 7). 5. It is concluded that in spite of its high regulatory efficiency with an adequate response time the RAS does not directly contribute to the short-term buffering of blood pressure variability, nor does it give rise to feedback oscillations under normal resting conditions. Even if the RAS is stimulated by sodium restriction its contribution to short-term blood pressure buffering is only marginal.", 
    "650": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from clinical trials have suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition might exert a beneficial effect independent of its lipid-lowering effect, and ACE inhibition may exert a benefit independent of blood-pressure lowering. To test the hypothesis that such an effect might be mediated by alteration in platelet reactivity, we studied 55 monkeys receiving both, 1, or neither of the ACE inhibitor fosinopril and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin. Platelet responsiveness to collagen and to the thrombin receptor agonist (TRA) SFLRRN-NH2 was determined by aggregometry. For each agonist, the maximum rate and extent of aggregation were measured for each dose, and the concentration required for half-maximal response (C50) was determined. Each drug, when given alone, slightly decreased the dose of agonist required to produce 50% response in the rate and extent of platelet aggregation relative to control. The combination of the 2 drugs, however, produced a significant increase in the dose of TRA required to produce 50% response in the rate and extent of aggregation relative to either drug alone or the control group. This was not true for collagen. The magnitude of the change relative to the control group, 47% for rate and 30% for extent of aggregation, could confer considerable protection by changing the threshold for thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and, thus, decrease thrombosis.", 
    "651": "High-sensitivity titration calorimetry is used to measure changes in enthalpy, heat capacity and protonation for the binding of captopril to the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1). The affinity of ACE to captopril is high and changes slightly with the pH, because the number of protons linked to binding is low. The determination of the enthalpy change at different pH values suggests that the protonated group in the captopril-ACE complex exhibits a heat protonation of approximately -30 kJ/mol. This value agrees with the protonation of an imidazole group. The residues which may become protonated in the complex could be two histidines existing in two active sites, which are joined to the amino acids coordinated to Zn2+. Calorimetric measurements indicate that captopril binds to two sites in the monomer of ACE, this binding being enthalpically unfavorable and being dominated by a large positive entropy change. Thus, binding is favored by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The temperature dependence of the free energy of binding deltaG degrees is weak because of the enthalpy-entropy compensation caused by a large heat capacity change, deltaCp =-4.3+/-0.1 kJ/K/mol of monomeric ACE. The strong favorable binding entropy and the negative deltaCp indicate both a large contribution to binding due to hydrophobic effects, which seem to originate from dehydration of the ligand-protein interface, and slight conformational changes in the vicinity of the active sites.",

Ang II, per se, caused a marked rise in glomerular prosaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2.

The most consistent anomaly seen, skull hypoplasia, along with renal dysfunction appear to be more related to prolonged or late pregnancy exposure than to first trimester exposure. There is little supportive evidence that ACE inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) are teratogenic. There seems to be no absolute reason to discontinue these 2 medications prior to pregnancy, nor to create anxiety when a patient is identified with the combination of early pregnancy and treatment with these medications. There appears to be reason to discontinue the medication in pregnancy but the adverse event rate cannot be assessed because of inadequate prospective information.", 
    "657": "The effects of antihypertensive agents on cardiovascular parameters, especially on arterial pulse wave velocity, remain largely unknown in normotensive subjects. Therefore, the present investigation was designed to evaluate acute effects of ACE inhibitor captopril,beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol and calcium entry blocker verapamil on cardiovascular and ventilatory function in healthy volunteers.", 
    "658": "The influence of single doses of captopril (25 mg), propranolol (40 mg), and verapamil (80 mg) on cardiovascular function and exercise capacity were compared in healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion.", 
    "659": "Cardiac output and beat-by-beat blood pressure were estimated non-invasively before and after the drug administrations by whole-body impedance cardiography and Finapres finger blood pressure monitoring, respectively. Arterial pulse wave velocity was obtained from the time delay between flow pulses measured from the root of the aorta and the popliteal artery, and systemic vascular resistance was calculated from cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. In addition, a progressive maximal exercise test was performed after the treatments.", 
    "660": "Propranolol reduced heart rate, cardiac output and arterial pulse wave velocity, and increased systemic vascular resistance clearly more effectively than placebo. In addition, captopril effectively decreased arterial resistance and pulse wave velocity. However, the influence of verapamil on cardiovascular parameters did not significantly differ from those observed in placebo-treated subjects. Exercise peak heart rate, peak blood pressure, and minute ventilation were reduced in subjects treated with propranolol, but not in those treated with captopril and verapamil, when compared to placebo.", 
    "661": "Acute administration of captopril and propranolol but not verapamil clearly modulated cardiovascular parameters in rest, suggesting differential effects of these compounds on cardiovascular function in healthy volunteers. These drugs seem to have disparate effects on arterial pulse wave propagation as an indicator of arterial compliance after short-term administration in healthy subjects. Captopril and verapamil had no effect on cardiovascular and ventilatory function during maximal exercise, while propranolol markedly altered also these variables in the present study.", 
    "662": "The present study aimed to investigate the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor captopril and the Ca-antagonist nifedipine on endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) in the forearm of hypertensive patients. Twenty-three middle-aged untreated hypertensive patients underwent evaluation of EDV and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV) in the forearm, by means of local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine (MCh, evaluating EDV) and sodium-nitroprusside (SNP, evaluating EIDV), before and 1 h after intake of either captopril (25 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg) in a randomised, double-blind fashion. A matched normotensive control group was investigated at baseline conditions only. Five of the hypertensives were also evaluated after 3 months of treatment with captopril 25 mg twice daily in an open pilot study. First, the vasodilation induced by methacholine (MCh), but not SNP, was significantly attenuated in the hypertensive patients compared to the normotensive controls (P < 0.001 at MCh 4 microg/min). Second, although the two drugs induced a similar decline in blood pressure (BP) 1 h after administration (-11 to 10 mm Hg/-8 to 7 mm Hg), captopril significantly potentiated the vasodilator response to MCh (+32+/-13%, MCh 4 micr og/min, P < 0.01) but not SNP, while nifedipine did not significantly alter the response to either MCh or SNP. The improvement in vasodilator response to MCh induced by captopril was closely related to the reduction in BP (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Third, in the pilot study, 3 months of captopril treatment induced a significant potentiation of the vasodilator response to MCh (+34+/-17%, MCh 4 microg/min, P < 0.05) in parallel with a significant BP reduction (-22+/-24/13+/-13 mm Hg, P < 0.05), while the response to SNP was unchanged. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that essential hypertension is associated with a defect in EDV. Furthermore, an improvement in EDV was seen in hypertensive patients shortly after administration of captopril, but not nifedipine. In addition, a significant beneficial effect on EDV was seen in a small pilot study during long-term treatment with captopril.", 
    "663": "We conducted a MEDLINE search of published literature from 1966 to January 1998 regarding the impact of aspirin (ASA) on the therapeutic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertension and congestive heart failure. Selected references from these articles and results of recent clinical trials were also included. By inhibiting cyclooxygenase, ASA may interfere with the prostaglandin-mediated hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Although other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may increase blood pressure in hypertensive patients taking an ACE inhibitor, low-dosage (< or = 100 mg/day) ASA does not. However, higher dosages of ASA may attenuate the benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). Low-dosage ASA appears to interact little with ACE inhibitors, whereas higher dosages may produce a more significant interaction. Patients with CHF may also be more susceptible to this interaction because of underlying disease.", 
    "664": "Coronary angioplasty is widely performed for the management of symptomatic coronary artery disease. With improvements in technique, operator experience, and tools, more complex lesions are being treated. Unfortunately, luminal renarrowing continues to limit the long-term success of the procedure, resulting in the need for repeat revascularization in approximately 30% of patients within 6 months. As the pathophysiologic process of restenosis is better defined, various pharmacologic and mechanical interventions have been tried to attenuate the process. Some agents are antithrombotics, antiplatelets, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, and calcium channel blockers. Improvement has been noted with the newer glycoprotein IIb- and IIIa-blocking agents, mechanical stents, and radioactive materials. Whether these new compounds will withstand the test of time is unknown.", 
    "665": "In the present study, we examined the effect of blockade of the brain stem renin-angiotensin system on renal sympathetic baroreflexes and chemoreflexes in conscious rabbits and examined the role of central catecholaminergic pathways in these responses. Eleven rabbits underwent preliminary surgical instrumentation and pretreatment with central 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 500 micrograms/kg) or ascorbic acid 6 wk before the commencement of the experiments. Baroreflex curves were determined under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia (10% O2 + 3% CO2) before and after central administration of either Ringer solution, the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan (10 micrograms), or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (500 ng) on separate days. Losartan increased the upper plateau and the range of the mean arterial pressure (MAP)-renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) curve (79 and 78%, respectively) in intact rabbits, whereas this effect was not observed in 6-OHDA-pretreated rabbits. Hypoxia elicited an increase in resting RSNA (111% in intact rabbits and 74% in 6-OHDA-injected rabbits) and elevated the upper plateau of the RSNA-MAP curve in both groups (89% in intact rabbits and 114% in 6-OHDA-injected rabbits). During hypoxia, losartan and enalaprilat increased the RSNA upper plateau in intact rabbits but had no effect in 6-OHDA-pretreated rabbits. No effects on the MAP-heart rate baroreflex curves were observed. Thus the effect of losartan to increase RSNA, particularly during hypoxia and baroreceptor unloading, being abolished by central noradrenergic depletion suggests that the endogenous ANG II which normally causes an inhibition of renal sympathetic motoneurons is dependent on the integrity of central catecholaminergic pathways.",

Sulphonylurea was used as a single agent in 119 (22.9%) patients, in combination with metformin in 219 (42%) patients and with insulin in 17 patients (3.3%). Among patients treated with sulphonylureas (n=342), glibenclamide (47.7%) and gliclazide (30.7%) were the main drugs prescribed. Metformin monotherapy was prescribed in only 31 patients (6%). Insulin treatment was prescribed in 141 (27%) patients and in combination with oral drugs in 23 patients (4.5%). Of the 534 prescriptions, 225 (42%) contained antihypertensive drugs. Calcium channel blocking agents and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were the most commonly prescribed drugs in both monotherapy (n=155) and combination therapy (n=70). The antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs accounted for 45% and 39% of the total drug expenditure, respectively. Lipid-lowering drugs were prescribed in 8% of the diabetic patients.

Co-incubation of the cells with known enzyme inhibitors including captopril (an ACE inhibitor), thiorphan (an EP24.11 inhibitor), and EDTA (an EP24.15 inhibitor) inhibited the formation of LHRH 4-10, LHRH 7-10, and LHRH 6-10 respectively. In all cell types, the degradation rate of [D-Ala6]-LHRH was about 3-8 times lower than that of LHRH.

No EP24.15 or ACE activity was observed in type I-like pneumocytes and only a weak EP24.11 activity was detected.", 
    "674": "The relationship between systemic blood pressure and glomerular capillary pressure (Pgc) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) during treatment with antihypertensive drugs is still unclear. The effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), two calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine and verapamil), and an alpha1-receptor blocker (doxazosin) on renal blood flow (RBF) autoregulation, Pgc, and renal segmental resistances were therefore studied in SHR. Recordings of RBF autoregulation were done before and 30 min after intravenous infusion of the different drugs, and Pgc was thereafter measured with the stop-flow technique. When the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced to approximately 120 mmHg by infusions of doxazosin or enalapril, the lower pressure limit of RBF autoregulation was reduced significantly. Nifedipine or verapamil abolished RBF autoregulation. Doxazosin did not change Pgc (43.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 46.7 +/- 1.5 mmHg in controls, P > 0.5), enalapril lowered (41.3 +/- 0.8 mmHg, P < 0.01), and the calcium channel antagonists increased Pgc [53.7 +/- 1.4 mmHg (nifedipine) and 54.8 +/- 1.2 mmHg (verapamil), P < 0.01]. When MAP was reduced to approximately 85 mmHg by drugs, Pgc was reduced to 43.3 +/- 1.7 mmHg after nifedipine (P > 0.2 vs. control), whereas Pgc after enalapril was 38.5 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P < 0.05 vs. control). Enalapril reduced Pgc mainly by reducing efferent resistance. During treatment with calcium channel antagonists, Pgc became strictly dependent on MAP. Monotherapy with nifedipine may increase Pgc and by this mechanism accelerate glomerulosclerosis if a strict blood pressure control is not obtained.",

In the present study, infusion of NPY (2 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) enhanced renovascular resistance by approximately 8 mmHg . ml-1 . min and enhanced urine and sodium excretion by approximately 450 microliter/15 min and approximately 60-85 micromol/15 min, respectively. Acute renal denervation did not alter renovascular or tubular NPY effects, indicating that a neuronally released mediator is not involved. Treatment with the angiotensin II-receptor antagonist losartan prevented the decline of the renovascular response with time but did not modify tubular NPY effects. The bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist icatibant accelerated the decline of the renovascular NPY effects with time; concomitantly, it attenuated NPY-induced diuresis and natriuresis and abolished NPY-induced calciuresis. The converting-enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat prevented the decline of the renovascular response with time; concomitantly, it magnified the NPY-induced diuresis, natriuresis, and calciuresis. We conclude that bradykinin may be involved in NPY-induced diuresis, natriuresis, and, in particular, calciuresis.",

Six were assigned to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy initiated 24 hours after damage and continued for 4 weeks. The remaining six dogs served as a control group. Left ventricular structure (mass and end diastolic volume) and systolic function (regional and global ejection fraction at rest and during afterload stress) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging before damage and at the end of the 4-week period. After myocardial damage, left ventricular mass increased from 93.6 +/- 4.0 to 107.5 +/- 3.4 gm in the control group (P < .01) with no change in ventricular volume. Ramipril-treated dogs displayed a reduction in mass (83.2 +/- 2.2 to 74.6 +/- 2.9 gm, P < .05). In the control group, there was greater reduction in global ejection fraction in response to afterload stress at 4 weeks compared with baseline (-16 +/- 4 vs -4 +/- 3%, P = .03). Ejection fraction response to afterload stress was maintained at 4 weeks in the converting enzyme inhibitor-treated group (-5 +/- 3 vs - 1 +/- 4%) and was different at 4 weeks from the control group (-1 +/- 4 vs -16 +/- 4%, P = .004).",

The number of ACE-mRNA transcripts was related to muscle fiber area, whereas an inverse relationship between the number of ACE transcripts and capillary density was found. ACE was detected in the endothelial cells of capillaries in skeletal muscle.",

He reported a cervical and thoracic pain for one year, that was related to a 95% of occlusion on the right coronary artery. An angioplasty has been done but the patient still related the thoracic pain. Afterwards the patient had recurrent episodes of right hemiplegia and hypertensive emergencies that have been treated with anti-hypertensive agents. A venous disease was suspected because of cyanosis in the face especially when episodes of transient ischemic attacks occurred. A venography showed obstruction of the right jugular vein near the junction with the superior vena cava. In conclusion, it was not possible to define with certainty the relationship between the two pathologies presented by the patient, even so, we call attention to the improvement of the neurological symptoms after the control of superior vena cava obstruction with the treatment.",

However, acute renal failure (ARF) may occur in patients who are taking these drugs in situations associated with decreased glomerular filtration pressure, such as dehydration caused by acute diarrhea or diuretic therapy. Sixty-four patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit for ARF associated with ACE inhibitor therapy were followed for more than 5 years. In this historical retrospective study, we documented that 45 patients were treated for hypertension (group I) and 19 were treated for heart failure (group II). Their mean age was 71.2+/-11.6 years. Patients with ARF presented with overt dehydration in 91% and 84% of the cases in groups I and II, respectively. Hypovolemia was caused by diuretics or gastrointestinal fluid loss. Bilateral artery-renal stenosis or stenosis in a solitary kidney was documented in 22% and 10% of patients in groups I and II, respectively. The probability of survival was 91% and 49% at 1 year and 64% and 18% at 5 years, for groups I and II, respectively. Acute renal failure required hemodialysis in seven patients, but none of them became dialysis dependent. In the subgroup of patients with preexisting chronic renal failure, all the patients except for one who belonged to group II died within 2 years. In both groups, after resolution of ARF, plasma creatinine concentration returned to baseline level and the course of renal function was not significantly worsened. In conclusion, ARF associated with ACE inhibitors is likely to occur in many patients without renal artery stenosis after unexpected dehydration, especially in older patients with congestive heart failure. In both groups of patients, in the absence of preexisting chronic uremia, recovery of renal function occurred without sequelae, even after an episode of acute tubular necrosis requiring dialysis.",

A model was developed to predict the cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacy services assumed to improve use of drugs of choice to unity in hypothetical cohorts of three diseases that commonly accompany hypertension and in which clear drugs of choice exist. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with diabetes who have proteinuria, use of beta blockers after myocardial infarction, and use of ACE inhibitors in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction were analyzed. Clinical pharmacy services could be cost-saving in all three diseases in this model if use of the drug of choice in standard practice did not exceed 0.899 in patients with diabetes who have proteinuria, 0.512 in patients after infarct, and 0.804 in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.

    "689": "Increased apoptosis has been demonstrated in various forms of human and experimental cardiovascular disease. The role of this phenomenon in the vasculature in different models of hypertension is unclear. In hypertension, regression of vessel wall hypertrophy/hyperplasia or remodeling in response to various antihypertensive drugs may be mediated in part by apoptosis. This study examined vascular smooth muscle apoptosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in which it may presumably counterbalance vascular wall growth. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers induce regression of the vascular wall in hypertension. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine on apoptosis in blood vessels of SHR to determine whether part of the growth inhibitory effect of these drugs is mediated by apoptosis. This was performed by detection and measurement of DNA fragmentation using DNA laddering and examining aortic histologic sections with in situ end-labeling (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-nick labeling [TUNEL]). Ten-week-old SHR were treated for 12 weeks with 10 mg/kg per day of enalapril and 20 mg/kg per day of amlodipine. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by enalapril and amlodipine (P < .01). Cross-sectional area of aorta was significantly increased (3.34+/-0.15 mm2) in SHR compared to that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats (1.17+/-0.07 mm2, P < .01). The cross-sectional area of the aorta was significantly smaller in enalapril-treated SHR (2.42+/-0.12 mm2, P < .05) compared to untreated SHR, and almost normalized by amlodipine (1.65+/-0.31 mm2, P < .01). Apoptosis characterized using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to radiolabel 3'-OH ends of fragmented DNA extracted from aorta, showed presence of fragmented labeled DNA as \"DNA laddering,\" a hallmark of apoptosis. SHR had increased apoptosis (341+/-25 pixels/microg DNA) compared to WKY controls (206+/-13 pixels/microg DNA, P < .01). Apoptosis was six- to eightfold greater in aorta of enalapril and amlodipine-treated SHR (P < .01). These results were confirmed by in situ end-labeling of fragmented DNA in aortic histologic sections. Western blot quantification of Bax and Bcl-2 (pro- and antiapoptotic gene products, respectively) showed higher Bax and lower Bcl-2 expression, and accordingly increased the Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio in aorta from SHR treated with enalapril or amlodipine in comparison to untreated SHR. In conclusion, enhanced apoptosis is present in aorta of SHR, possibly as a homeostatic mechanism counterbalancing growth. Antihypertensive agents such as the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the calcium antagonist amlodipine may cause regression or inhibition of vascular wall growth in SHR partly through enhanced apoptosis, which may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of these drugs.", 
    "690": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide have been shown to be effective antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal failure. A fixed low-dose combination of these two agents has been proposed in the treatment of hypertension. We evaluated this combination in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and mild to severe chronic renal failure that did not require dialysis. This was a multicenter, open trial consisting of a 2-week single-blind placebo washout period followed by 12 weeks of active treatment. At week 0, the patients received 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide once a day or every other day, with the possibility of dosage adjustment to perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg at week 2, week 4, or week 8. A pharmacokinetic analysis using a population pharmacokinetic approach was performed at week 8. Twenty-three patients completed the 12-week study, at which time 14 patients were receiving 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide daily, three were receiving 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide every other day, and six perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg. Blood pressure readings (supine) decreased from 170.4+/-19.2 / 101.5+/-6.7 mm Hg before active treatment to 146.5+/-19.7 / 86.5+/-10.6 mm Hg at the end of treatment (P < .0001). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that for indapamide and perindoprilat (the active metabolite of perindopril) the area under the curve (AUC24) increased with the severity of renal failure. No interaction was noted between the two drugs. Mean serum creatinine and sodium and serum potassium levels remained stable during the study. Impairment of renal function occurred in one patient and was considered unrelated to treatment. We conclude that a fixed low-dose perindopril-indapamide combination as first-line treatment has a good safety/efficacy ratio in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.", 
    "691": "Double-blind, randomized controlled studies of longer than 1 week in duration comparing the antiproteinuric potential of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are lacking. Therefore, we performed such a study in patients with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week wash-out period in which patients did not use any medication known to affect proteinuria, 21 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). Throughout the 16-week study period, blood pressure, creatinine clearances, and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. In addition, device-measured blood pressure and renal hemodynamic studies were performed at the start and end of the study. Systolic blood pressure fell in the Lis group from 163+/-7 (SEM) to 140+/-8 mm Hg (P < .01) and from 157+/-10 to 147+/-6 mm Hg in the Amlo group; diastolic blood pressure fell from 101+/-3 to 86+/-7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98+/-3 to 91+/-2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were not affected by amlodipine treatment, whereas a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was seen in lisinopril-treated patients (from 55+/-11 to 50+/-10 mL/min; P < .01). Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril induced a decline in the protein-creatinine ratio with a maximal effect reached after 12 to 16 weeks of therapy (from 0.39+/-0.17 to 0.26 +/-0.11 g/mmol; P < .009). In conclusion, we could not demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, whereas therapy with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril resulted in a decrease in proteinuria. Amlodipine did not affect renal hemodynamics, whereas lisinopril induced a fall in GFR.", 
    "692": "The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetic (non-insulin dependent [NIDDM] and insulin-dependent [IDDM]) hypertensives at baseline and after treatment by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. After a 3-week placebo period, patients were treated for 16 weeks with trandolapril, 2 to 4 mg/day. The UAE and blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometer and 24-h ABPM) were measured at baseline and repeated on trandolapril. Predictive factors of abnormal UAE (24-h UAE > or = 30 mg) were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). Predictors of UAE decrease were also searched. One hundred seventy-one patients entered the analysis. Baseline office BP was 164+/-14 / 97+/-6 mm Hg and 24-h BP was 142+/-17 / 83+/-10 mm Hg. Seventy-four patients (43%) had UAE > or = 30 mg. Independent risk factors for abnormal UAE were nighttime diastolic BP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 8.6, P = .0001), diabetes duration (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.1 to 5.0, P = .025), and presence of retinopathy (OR = 3.2, CI = 1.0 to 10.0, P = .047). Conversely, office BP level was not significantly related to UAE. On treatment, office BP levels decreased to 143+/-13 / 82+/-8 mm Hg (P < .0001) and 24-h BP levels to 134+/-17 / 78+/-9 mm Hg (P < .0001). In the abnormal UAE group, UAE significantly decreased from 76 to 50 mg/day (P = .006). After treatment, independent predictive factors of abnormal UAE were: on-drug fasting plasma glucose (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4, P = .0009) and on-drug nighttime diastolic BP (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4, P = .001). The only predictor of UAE decrease was a 24-h systolic BP decrease (OR = 2.3, CI = 1.3 to 4.3, P = .007). We conclude that in diabetic hypertensives with abnormal UAE, trandolapril exhibited a sustained 24-h antihypertensive effect and provided a consistent reduction of microalbuminuria. This study confirmed the superiority of ABPM over clinical BP to predict target organ damage.",

We used a database covering all prescriptions to elderly people to measure the change in proportion of newly treated patients who received each class of drug as first-line therapy. We used a matched cohort design for assessment of the teleconference and workshops, a randomised community design for the newsletters, and time-series analysis for the media impacts.",

The proportion of patients who received either a CCB or an ACE inhibitor as first-line therapy, contrary to guidelines, was still 42% overall in 1996.

Corticosteroid use was determined prior to the onset of SRC in cases or prior to the first visit in controls. Cases were compared with matched controls using McNemar's matched-pair analysis and conditional logistic regression analysis. The effects of other drugs, including D-penicillamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, were also evaluated.",

New use of low-dose steroids, continuous use of any steroid dose, NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of SRC. Antecedent D-penicillamine therapy may have been protective against the development of SRC in controls.",

When half-time was more than 20 minutes on standard diuretic renography in 8 cases, captopril renography showed an ipsilateral decrease and bilateral increase in glomerular filtration rate in 4 and 1, respectively, and no change in 3. In 12 of the 23 patients (52%) there was no difference in the results of captopril and diuretic renography as well as no change in differential function on standard diuretic renography during 1 1/2 years of observation.

When such compensatory mechanisms are activated, they may be unmasked by captopril, producing 1 of 4 patterns on renography and glomerular filtration rate. Patterns may indicate different degrees of impending renal function impairment and, thus, they may become useful for determining the progression of injury, when present, and the appropriate timing of surgical intervention.",

In the present review we assess the literature detailing such evidence in early (hyperlipidaemia) and end-stage (heart failure) disease, with emphasis on the mechanisms by which the disturbances are thought to occur. 3. Strategies for the correction of disturbed NO signalling in these states are reviewed and include both prescribed pharmacological interventions, such as lipid-lowering therapy and novel uses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and dietary supplementation with L-arginine and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. 4. In addition to a decreased production/function of NO, the possible detrimental effects of a chronic elevation in NO production in patients with liver cirrhosis, together with a novel use of antibiotics to correct this perturbation, is outlined.", 
    "706": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertensive remodeling has polymorphic character with broad spectrum of its geometry. Echocardiographically it is simply possible to distinguish 4 LV remodeling types: normal geometry, concentric remodeling, eccentric hypertrophy and concentric hypertrophy. In an overview article morphological, functional and prognostic characteristics of remodeled hypertensive LV are presented. Most adverse prognosis as regards cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality is in LV concentric hypertrophy. As to the current knowledge LV hypertrophy regression can be considered for potential aim of the management of arterial hypertension, independent from blood pressure normalization. Removal of structural changes of the CV system due to arterial hypertension could be more important function of antihypertensive drugs than blood pressure reduction alone. Until now minimally 147 articles regarding the influence of antihypertensive treatment on LV hypertrophy regression have been published. According to them most effective drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A new idea has brought the HYCAR study, which has demonstrated, that low dose of ramipril without any antihypertensive effect significantly reduces LV hypertrophy. The results of the study \"evoke\" change in the management of arterial hypertension: the treatment with low dose of ramipril in indication of LV hypertrophy regression also in those hypertensive patients with formerly normalized blood pressure. The importance of LV hypertrophy regression for the prognosis must be however specified in large designed trials, because until now it is not exactly known.",

    "708": "Eight randomised clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus placebo in myocardial infarction have been published in three years, including over 100,000 patients. High risk myocardial infarction carries a poor prognosis with a 25% death rate at 42 months in SAVE, 23% at 15 months in AIRE and 42% at 37 months in TRACE. This form of myocardial infarction benefits the most from treatment with ACE inhibitors: the relative reductions in risk for the previously mentioned trials were 19%, 27% and 22% respectively, and the absolute reductions in risk of death were 4% at 42 months, 6% at 15 months and 8% at 37 months, respectively. Studies including all forms of myocardial infarction involve populations at lower risk. The effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality are then less obvious: from 7.7% to 7.2% at 5 weeks in ISIS-4, from 7.1% to 6.3% at 6 weeks in GISSI-3, from 9.6% to 9.0% at 4 weeks in CCS-1, corresponding to relative reductions in the risk of death of 7%, 12% and 3% respectively and absolute reductions of the risk of death of 0.5% at 5 weeks, 0.8% at 6 weeks and 0.6% at 4 weeks, respectively. Who should be treated? All patients for 4 to 6 weeks or only high risk patients. When should treatment be started? Some investigators institute treatment from the first day but others think it prudent to wait until the second day. For how long? Four to 6 weeks would be sufficient to counteract ventricular remodelling while the benefits are sustained in the long term. But treatment should be continued long term in high risk patients. Which molecule, which dose and how many times, should it be taken per day? The logical answer is molecules with proven efficacy at the dose given in the clinical trials respecting the number of times indicated per day.", 
    "709": "A review of the results of randomised trials of the use of betablockers in acute myocardial infarction shows by techniques of meta-analysis that their prescription in the early hours of the acute event leads to a reduction in short-term mortality: the reduction of risk is 12% as compared with groups which are not given betablockers. In addition to its impact on mortality, early betablocker therapy is associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence of myocardial infarction and a proven antalgic effect. However, in patients receiving thrombolysis, the beneficial effect on mortality and recurrence of infarction of intravenous betablockers seems less evident. In daily clinical practice, the prescription of betablockers in the first days of infarction has significantly increased over the last ten years. In the USIK trial carried out in France in November 1995, nearly two thirds of patients received betablocker therapy. In the same study, the prescription of betablockers is associated with a reduction in mortality independent of the classical risk factors and the prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These results confirm the value of this therapeutic class in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "710": "Circulating endothelin-1, a very strong peptide vasoconstrictor first discovered in 1988, is raised in cardiac failure. This increase contributes to the deleterious effects of cardiac failure. Although specific anti-endothelin drugs are under development in this condition, the effects of more commonly used drugs on circulating endothelin-1 levels are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on plasma endothelin-1 levels in cardiac failure. The plasma endothelin-1 levels were measured in 24 patients (stages III and IV of the NYHA classification), before and after treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril: test doses, then 75 mg/day). A control group of 10 paired patients was used to shake off the effects of bed rest and hospital salt-free diet. The initial endothelin-1 levels were high but equivalent in the control and study groups: 9.13 +/- 1.87 fmol/mL vs 8.98 +/- 1.92 fmol/mL. Plasma endothelin-1 decreased significantly in the study group 72 hours after beginning ACE inhibitor therapy (7.44 +/- 1.95, p < 0.02) but remained higher than normal (p < 0.01), whereas the values in the control group remained the same. This study demonstrates a decreases in plasma endothelin-1 levels 72 hours after onset of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with stable severe cardiac failure. This results, already suggested by many experimental studies and certain ancillary clinical trials, could explain some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in this condition.", 
    "711": "Plasma noradrenaline is little used in evaluating the prognosis of cardiac failure because of the theoretical necessity of interrupting treatment for a few days before blood sampling. The present study reevaluated the prognostic value of this parameter with blood sampling performed during treatment and then 48 hours after withdrawal of treatment in 192 patients with chronic stable cardiac failure at an advanced stage (64% of patients in Classes III or IV with an average ejection fraction of 28.5 +/- 13.5%). During follow-up (average 43 months) there were 51 deaths and 17 transplants. None of the patients were lost to follow-up. Univariate analysis of 52 variable observers during the initial phase of evaluation found in decreasing order of predictive value for death plasma noradrenaline levels before and after withdrawal of treatment for 48 hours. Serum sodium, age, systolic mean and diastolic pulmonary artery pressures. In multivariate analysis: noradrenaline with or without withdrawal of treatment, hyponatraemia and systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Actuarial survival curves distinguished the following parameters: noradrenaline levels became predictive at concentrations of over 210 pg/mL and there was a significant difference in survival with respect to 4 levels of serum noradrenaline (with or without treatment) > 300 pg/mL, 300 to 600 pg/mL and > 900 pg/mL. This serum noradrenaline measured without withdrawal of treatment (especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) is a powerful predictor of mortality, carrying a progressively poorer prognosis as the concentration increases.", 
    "712": "The international, prospective, randomized HOT study was aimed at determining the influence of a targeted BP reduction on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients were randomly allocated to 3 DBP targets (< 80, < 85, < 90 mmHg). In addition, the impact of a coprescription of aspirin was studied. The BP target had to be reached within 3 months, according to a well-defined strategy : felodipine 5 mg o.d. as a 1st intention drug, 1, 2 or 3 additional drugs, if necessary, on the following steps. BP measurements were made, using an oscillometric automatic device (Hestia). From April 1992 to October 1994, 18,790 patients with an age range 50-80 years, coming from 26 countries, entered the study. The data collected on the 36th month were in agreement with those obtained on the 12th and the 24th months. Baseline DBP was reduced by 21, 23 and 25 mmHg in the 90, 85 and 80 mmHg target groups, respectively. The rate of patients whose DBP reached the target, obviously increased from the 3rd to the 12th month: from 43 to 56%, 60 to 70%, 74 to 83% in the 90, 85 and 80 mmHg, target groups, respectively. From the 2nd to the 3rd year, BP control was further improved, with a slightly higher rate of controlled patients in the elderly (age > 60 y), especially in the 80 mmHg target group. From inclusion to the 3rd month, one-drug treated patients decreased, whereas 2- or 3-drug treated patients increased. Felodipine-treated patients decreased on the 36th month, but remained over 80%. From the 6th to the 36th month, additional prescription of a betablocker or an ACE-inhibitor increased from 36 to 39%, and from 23 to 28%, respectively; moreover, the side-effects rate decreased from 10.5 to 3.6%, with a special decline in ankle edema from 4 to 1%. In conclusion, the BP reduction observed on the 36th month was of the same extent as that observed in the first months. It seems obviously possible to reach a targeted DBP and to maintain it over time, along with a good acceptability of the treatment. Targeted DBP could be more easily achieved in elderly patients, possibly due to a better drug compliance.", 
    "713": "Diabetic nephropathy is a serious microangiopathic complication of type 1 and 2 diabetes and accounts in a major way for the high morbidity and invalidity of diabetics. Although progression is inevitable when the disease is advanced, there are ways how to prevent its development and retard its progress. Because reliable prediction of diabetic nephropathy is impossible, primary prevention is essential in all diabetic patients. As soon as the diagnosis of diabetes is established, the blood sugar level should be checked systematically and permanent satisfactory compensation of diabetes should be ensured (HbA1c less than 6.5%) which is the main principle throughout the subsequent course of the disease. The principle of secondary prevention the objective of which is to prevent the development of manifest nephropathy with permanent proteinuria, is to monitor microalbuminuria and maintenance of a normal blood pressure. With regard to pathophysiological circumstances in therapy angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred. The objective of tertiary prevention is retardation of renal insufficiency by fortified hypotensive therapy, correction of hyperlipoproteinaemia, dietary protein restriction and adequate compensation of diabetes. In case of renal failure dialyzation treatment or transplantation must not be delayed.", 
    "714": "AT1 receptor activation has been demonstrated to cause increased vascular resistance properties which may be of particular importance in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF). The overall goal of this study was to examine the effects of ACE inhibition (ACEI) alone, AT1 receptor blockade alone and combined ACEI and AT1 receptor blockade on LV pump function, systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flow patterns in the normal state and with the development of pacing induced CHF, both at rest and with treadmill induced exercise.", 
    "715": "Pigs (25 kg) were instrumented in order to measure cardiac output (CO), systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular (PVR) resistance, neurohormonal system activity, and myocardial blood flow distribution in the conscious state and assigned to one of 4 groups: (1) rapid atrial pacing (240 bpm) for 3 weeks (n = 7); (2) ACEI (benazeprilat, 3.75 mg/day) and pacing (n = 7); (3) AT1 receptor blockade (valsartan, 60 mg/day) and rapid pacing (n = 7); and (4) ACEI and AT1 receptor blockade (benazeprilat/valsartan, 1/60 mg/day, respectively) and pacing (n = 7). Measurements were obtained at rest and with treadmill exercise (15 degrees, 3 miles/h; 10 min) in the normal control state and after the completion of the treatment protocols. With rapid pacing, CO was reduced at rest and with exercise compared to controls. ACEI or AT1 blockade normalized CO at rest, but remained lower than control values with exercise. Combination therapy normalized CO both at rest and with exercise. Resting SVR in the CHF group was higher than controls and SVR fell to a similar degree with exercise; all treatment groups reduced resting SVR. With exercise, SVR was reduced from rapid pacing values in the ACEI and combination therapy groups. PVR increased by over 4-fold in the rapid pacing group both at rest and with exercise, and was reduced in all treatment groups. In the combination therapy group, PVR was similar to control values with exercise. Plasma catecholamines and endothelin levels were increased by over 3-fold with chronic rapid pacing, and were reduced in all treatment groups. In the combination therapy group, the relative increase in catecholamines and endothelin with exercise were significantly blunted when compared to rapid pacing only values. LV myocardial blood flow at rest was reduced in the rapid pacing only and monotherapy groups, but was normalized with combination therapy.", 
    "716": "These findings suggest that with developing CHF, combined ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade improved vascular resistive properties and regional blood flow distribution to a greater degree than that of either treatment alone. Thus, combined ACEI and AT1 receptor blockade may provide unique benefits in the setting of CHF.",

    "718": "Platelet concentrates were leukocyte depleted using three different leucocyte-depletion filters selected to represent filters with negative, positive or neutral charge, respectively. Bradykinin levels were analysed before, during and up to 90 min post-filtration.", 
    "719": "Significant levels of bradykinin were generated when negatively charged leucocyte depletion filters were used. However, we found a high variation between platelet concentrates prepared from different donors as well as within the same concentrate when this was divided into three aliquots. Generated bradykinin was rapidly degraded in the collection bag and no bradykinin was detectable 60 min post-filtration.", 
    "720": "Bradykinin generation is more pronounced when negatively charged leucocyte removal filters are used. Due to a rapid degradation of bradykinin in the storage bag, pre-storage filtration should minimise the risk of bradykinin related adverse reactions during transfusion with some filters.", 
    "721": "Like human chymase, hamster chymase is an ANG II-forming enzyme, but pathophysiological roles of chymase are still unknown. We determined the functional conversion of ANG I and [Pro11, D-Ala12]ANG I, a chymase-selective substrate, to ANG II in the hamster cardiovascular system. ANG I and [Pro11, D-Ala12]ANG I produced similar dose-dependent pressor responses in conscious hamsters. Captopril and CV-11974, an ANG II type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonist, inhibited the responses to ANG I; in contrast, the pressor responses to [Pro11, D-Ala12]ANG I were suppressed only by CV-11974. In the isolated aorta, captopril suppressed ANG I-induced contraction by 84%; administration of captopril with either chymostatin or aprotinin eliminated the contraction. [Pro11, D-Ala12]ANG I-induced contraction was not affected by captopril but was attenuated by chymostatin (71%) and aprotinin (57%). CV-11974 abolished the responses to both substrates, whereas PD-123319, an AT2-receptor antagonist, had no effect. In homogenates of the aorta and heart, soybean trypsin inhibitor-inhibitable ANG II formation predominated over captopril- or aprotinin-inhibitable ANG II formation. These data suggest that [Pro11,D-Ala12]ANG I and part of ANG I were functionally converted to ANG II by chymase and other serine protease(s) in hamster vessels, inducing AT1-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Biochemical data supported a role for chymase in the alternative pathway.", 
    "722": "Rats with congestive heart failure demonstrate striking intrarenal vasoconstriction that contributes to reduced renal excretory function. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of angiotensin action reverses intrarenal vasoconstriction in rats 4-6 wk after coronary artery ligation. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that abnormalities in the expression and regulation of glomerular angiotensin receptors contribute to the intrarenal vasoconstriction. Because glomerular angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors normally downregulate in response to high local ANG II concentrations, we anticipated that glomerular AT1-receptor expression would be reduced in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). To our surprise, the density of glomerular AT1 receptors was nearly double (97% increase, P < 0.002) that of controls, indicating an acquired abnormality in angiotensin receptor regulation. This was specific for renal glomeruli, because the density of angiotensin receptors on renal vasculature was decreased in rats after MI compared with normal controls. Glomerular AT1-receptor expression was downregulated by an acute pharmacological infusion of ANG II and upregulated by acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to a similar extent in MI and control rats. Renal cortical mRNA expression showed an increase in the renin mRNA-to-actin ratio and angiotensinogen-to-actin ratio, indicating stimulation of the intrarenal angiotensin system in rats after MI. The data indicate a specific dysregulation of AT1 receptors in glomeruli but not blood vessels after MI.", 
    "723": "Recent studies indicate that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) normalizes the in situ electrophysiological abnormalities of the left ventricle. This study was designed to determine whether regression of LVH also normalizes the abnormalities of individual membrane currents. LVH was induced in rabbits by renal artery banding. Single ventricular myocytes from rabbits with LVH at 3 mo after renal artery banding demonstrated increased cell membrane capacitance, prolonged action potential duration, decreased inward rectifier K+ current density, and increased transient outward K+ current density compared with myocytes from age-matched controls. Additional rabbits were randomized at 3 mo after banding to treatment with either vehicle or captopril for an additional 3 mo. Myocytes from LVH rabbits treated with vehicle showed persistent membrane current abnormalities. However, myocytes isolated from LVH rabbits treated with captopril had normal cell membrane capacitance, action potential duration, and membrane current densities. Captopril had no direct effect on membrane currents of either control or LVH myocytes. These data support the hypothesis that the action potential prolongation and membrane current abnormalities of LVH are reversed by regression. Normalization of membrane currents probably explains the reduced vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia observed in this LVH model after treatment with captopril.", 
    "724": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is characterized by remodeling of both myocyte and interstitial compartments of the heart. The aim of this investigation was to study the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on alterations in the composition of the interstitium in chronic pressure-overload hypertrophy.", 
    "725": "LVH was induced in weanling rats by banding the ascending aorta. Animals with aortic banding received either vehicle (n = 20), hydralazine (20 mg/kg per day, n = 20), or the ACE inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg per day, n = 20) during weeks 6-12 after banding.", 
    "726": "Compared with sham-operated, untreated rats (n = 20), aortic-banded vehicle and hydralazine-treated rats displayed substantially increased left ventricular weights and myocyte diameters whereas ramipril significantly blunted the hypertrophic response at the myocyte level (each P < 0.001) as well as the increase in left ventricular weight (each P < 0.01). In addition, image analysis revealed a significant induction of perivascular and interstitial tissue accumulation in vehicle- and hydralazine-treated rats (2.5-fold, each P < 0.0001). In contrast, ramipril-treated rats displayed attenuated interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, both being significantly diminished compared with vehicle- and hydralazine-treated rats (each P< 0.001). Further, vehicle- and hydralazine-treated rats were characterized by elevated steady-state messenger (m)RNA levels of fibronectin (2.7- and 2.8-fold, P< 0.005), collagen I (2.0- and 1.8-fold, P < 0.0005), collagen III (both 2.2-fold, P < 0.001) and laminin B (1.6- and 1.6-fold, P < 0.005). In parallel, the corresponding immunohistochemical signals were markedly enhanced in these groups. In comparison, ramipril significantly blunted the induction of collagen I and III, laminin B and fibronectin at both the mRNA and protein levels. These morphological and molecular differences between the hydralazine and ramipril groups could not be attributed to differences in left ventricular-pressures, which were markedly elevated in all aortic stenosis rats (1.9-fold, each P < 0.001 versus sham). In fact, given that ramipril but not hydralazine blunted the hypertrophic response to pressure overload, the echocardiographic measurements revealed that left ventricular systolic wall stress was higher in the ramipril group (70 +/- 1 versus 34 +/- 0.7 kdyn/cm2; P < 0.02).",

Tissue kallikrein, a potent kinin-generating enzyme, is present in the vascular wall and heart tissue. High dietary fructose consumption is reported to induce hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension. The objective of the present study was to examine the status of kallikrein in vascular and cardiac tissue from highly fructose-fed rats and to delineate the effect of kinins and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in this animal model of glucose intolerance.", 
    "729": "Male Wistar rats (350 g body weight) were divided into four groups of 10 rats each: (1) controls; (2) oral ramipril at 500 microg/kg per day for the last 2 study weeks; (3) fructose in drinking water as a 10% (w/v) solution for 4 weeks; and (4) fructose + ramipril, with fructose administered as in group 3 plus the administration of ramipril for the last 2 study weeks. Systolic blood pressure (tail-cuff method), glucose tolerance (2 g/kg body weight intraperitoneally) and metabolic parameters were recorded. Kallikrein activity in tail artery and heart tissue homogenates was estimated at the end of the 4th study week from measurements of kininogenase activity and kinins generated by a radioimmunoassay.", 
    "730": "The area under the curve for the glucose tolerance test increased from 1265 +/- 103 mmol/l after 120 min in the control and 1152 +/- 36 mmol/l in the ramipril group (NS) to 2628 +/- 143 mmol/l in the fructose group (P<0.01). The administration of ramipril to fructose-treated rats in group 4 improved glucose tolerance (2160 +/- 100 mmol/l; P<0.05 versus group 3). Blood pressure increased significantly in fructose-fed rats but fell markedly in fructose-fed rats treated with ramipril (P<0.01). Kallikrein activity measured in the heart and vessels increased as a consequence of fructose administration (P<0.05), but the administration of ramipril increased this parameter to a much greater extent (P<0.01 versus control group), which correlated closely with the decrease in blood pressure and the improvement in glucose tolerance observed in the fructose + ramipril group.", 
    "731": "The administration of fructose as a solution in the drinking water induced glucose intolerance and increased blood pressure. Treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril improved glucose tolerance and significantly diminished blood pressure. Cardiovascular kinin-generating capability increased in treated animals and this increase was even higher when rats were treated with ramipril, suggesting that kinins, acting as a paracrine hormonal system, can exert cardiovascular protection and contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.",

In the present extension of the earlier study, the sequential fasting-refeeding regimen was begun at later time points (28 and 54 days post-initiation) than the first study. This was done to determine whether larger-sized altered hepatic foci (AHF) exhibited a depletion similar to that of the relatively small AHF in the published experiment and to study concomitant molecular changes during the fasting periods. Groups of animals were fasted in the presence and absence of 0.05% phenobarbital (PB) in the drinking water. During the fasting periods, both body and liver weights decreased dramatically, less in the fast begun at 54 days. This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling indices of hepatocytes within AHF. Apoptotic bodies increased dramatically in the non-focal (surrounding the AHF) hepatocytes during the fasting periods. These parameters were slightly lower in hepatocytes of rats administered PB during the fasting periods, most notably during the 54-66 day period. With the nick end-labeling method, the proportion of hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher in cells within AHF at the end of each of the fasting periods in all but one group. Concomitantly, the number of AHF and percentage of liver volume occupied by AHF decreased dramatically during the fasting periods. Refeeding caused a marked increase in BrdU labeling in hepatocytes within and surrounding AHF during the first week or two, most notably in animals not receiving PB during the fasting period. Both the number and volume percentage of liver AHF returned to control values within approximately 2 weeks of the refeeding regimen. Assays of nuclear DNA fragmentation with samples of whole liver indicated that a 'laddering' effect was most noticeable in livers of animals subjected to the fasting-refeeding regimen when phenobarbital was not present during the fasting period. Studies of the levels of mRNA of several genes in the total liver revealed that the expression of c-myc increased 3- to 9-fold during the fasting periods but rapidly returned to normal levels after refeeding. Levels of albumin and insulin-like growth factor I mRNAs decreased significantly during the fasting period, but rapidly reappeared on refeeding. These results indicate that the extensive loss of AHF during the short-term fasting periods occurs even when the number and volume of AHF are 10- to 50-fold greater at the beginning of the fast than the values published previously. Both the decrease in insulin growth factor I and the elevation of c-myc expression during the fasting period may indicate the role of these genes in the transcriptional regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis in both normal and preneoplastic hepatocytes in the rat.",

Baseline and captopril-enhanced renograms were obtained with 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine and a 1-day protocol in 50 patients; 36 patients were studied using 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid and a 2-day protocol.

A 470-patient trial showed a significantly higher rate of myocardial infarction in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetics treated with the CCA nisoldipine than in those treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. Non-experimental data (on 84 093 person-years in total) comparing antihypertensive agents in hypertensive women showed mostly non-significant covariate-adjusted total and cardiovascular mortality differences that are difficult to interpret because of potential residual confounding. One report suggested a relationship between CCAs and suicide. A case-control study (9513 cases, 6492 controls) showed that CCAs are unlikely to cause cancer. The current recommendation remains to start treatment of hypertension with diuretics and beta-blockers, but recent studies support the use of sustained release CCAs in cases in which blood pressure cannot be controlled with other agents.",

    "749": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of an insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene on progression of diabetic nephropathy. We performed an observational follow-up study of 35 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Patients were investigated during captopril treatment for a median of seven (range three to nine) years. Eleven patients were homozygous for the deletion allele (DD) and 24 were hetero- or homozygous for the insertion allele (ID + II). The two groups had comparable glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria and blood pressure at baseline and captopril induced nearly the same mean reduction in blood pressure--to 103 (SD 5) mm Hg in the DD-group and 102 (8) mm Hg in the ID + II-group. The rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate was significantly steeper in the DD group than in the other group (mean 5.7 (SD 3.7) versus 2.6 (2.8) ml/min/year, p = 0.01). In conclusion, the deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene reduces the long term beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with insulin dependent diabetes.", 
    "750": "In previous studies we demonstrated that in normotensive rats, but not in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) enhances bradycardic reflexes through an action on cardiac vagal afferent pathways. The present study aimed to determine whether cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, or a nonreversible genetic factor accounted for the insensitivity of SHR to ANP action on cardiac reflex pathways. SHR were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) for 6 weeks from 4 to 9 weeks of age (SHR-S, n=10) or for 9 weeks from 4 to 12 weeks of age (SHR-L, n=10) or were untreated (SHR, n=10) to produce differential effects on blood pressure and left ventricle/body weight ratio (LV/BW). Untreated normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY, n=10) were also studied. At 13 weeks of age, all rats were instrumented with aortic and jugular catheters, and at 14 weeks we measured heart rate reflexes to rapid intravenous infusions of methoxamine (100 microg/kg, cardiac baroreflex) and serotonin (5 to 60 microg/kg, von Bezold-Jarisch cardiac chemosensitive reflex), with either alpha-rat ANP (150 ng/kg per minute IV) or saline vehicle (270 microL/h IV) infusion. Perindopril treatment for 6-week (SHR-S) and 9-week (SHR-L) durations maintained blood pressure at normotensive levels in both groups. SHR-S exhibited a small degree of cardiac hypertrophy (LV/BW was 8% higher than in WKY but 11% less than in untreated SHR), but LV/BW was normalized in SHR-L (to within 1% of WKY LV/BW). In WKY, ANP significantly (P<0.05) enhanced bradycardic responses to both the cardiac baroreflex (by 42+/-10%) and von Bezold-Jarisch chemosensitive reflex (by 17+/-5%) activation but had no effect in SHR. The cardiac reflex action of ANP was restored in SHR-L (ANP enhanced reflex bradycardia by 28+/-12% and 36+/-8%, baroreflex and von Bezold-Jarisch reflex, respectively; P<0.05), but SHR-S, which developed some cardiac hypertrophy, remained unresponsive to ANP. Our results suggest that the inability of ANP to sensitize cardiac vagal (nonarterial) afferents in SHR was not due to an inherited irreversible component, or the hypertension per se, but was associated with the presence of cardiac hypertrophy. A functional consequence of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy may be the inhibition of the cardioprotective action of ANP through cardiac vagal reflexes.", 
    "751": "We recently reported that administration of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) production, activates the vascular and cardiac renin-angiotensin systems and causes vascular thickening and myocardial hypertrophy in rats with perivascular and myocardial fibrosis. It has been reported that aldosterone may contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis, but it is not known whether inhibition of NO synthesis affects angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor gene expression and aldosterone secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NO inhibition on the expression of Ang II receptors in the adrenal gland and on aldosterone secretion in rats. Wistar King A rats received normal water, L-NAME alone (1 mg/mL in the drinking water), or L-NAME and the alpha1-adrenergic receptor blocker bunazosin (0.1 mg/mL in the drinking water) for 1 week. After 1 week of treatment with L-NAME, systolic blood pressure, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and mRNA level and number of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) were increased. Plasma renin activity, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, and the number of AT2-R were unchanged. Although addition of bunazosin to L-NAME restored systolic blood pressure to the control level, PAC and AT1-R numbers remained significantly higher than those of control level. These results suggest that the increased AT1-R number and PAC induced by the inhibition of NO synthesis were independent of blood pressure and systemic renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, hypertension and myocardial fibrosis induced by NO blockade may be due in part to an elevation of PAC caused by increased AT1-R in the adrenal gland.", 
    "752": "We determined the mechanism accounting for the removal and metabolism of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in 21 anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), 18 age-matched normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD), and 36 mRen-2 transgenic (TG+) rats. Animals of all 3 strains were provided with tap water or tap water containing losartan, lisinopril, or a combination of lisinopril and losartan for 2 weeks. On the day of the experiment, Ang-(1-7) was infused for a period of 15 minutes at a rate of 278 nmol . kg-1 . min-1. After this time, samples of arterial blood were collected rapidly at regular intervals for the assay of plasma Ang-(1-7) levels by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of Ang-(1-7) had a minimal effect on vehicle-treated SD rats but elicited a biphasic pressor/depressor response in vehicle-treated SHR and TG+ rats. In lisinopril-treated rats, Ang-(1-7) infusion increased blood pressure, whereas losartan treatment abolished the pressor component of the response without altering the secondary fall in arterial pressure. Combined treatment with lisinopril and losartan abolished the cardiovascular response to Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. In vehicle-treated SD, SHR and TG+ the half-life (t1/2) of Ang-(1-7) averaged 10+/-1, 10+/-1, and 9+/-1 seconds, respectively. Lisinopril alone or in combination with losartan produced a statistically significant rise in the half-life of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains of rats. Plasma clearance of Ang-(1-7) was significantly greater in the untreated SD rats compared with either the SHR or TG+ rat. Lisinopril treatment was associated with reduced clearance of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. Concurrent experiments in pulmonary membranes from SD and SHR showed a statistically significant inhibition of 125I-Ang-(1-7) metabolism in the presence of lisinopril. These studies showed for the first time that the very short half-life of Ang-(1-7) in the circulation is primarily accounted for peptide metabolism by ACE. These findings suggest a novel role of ACE in the regulation of the production and metabolism of the two primary active hormones of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "753": "Insulin has been shown to directly affect blood vessel tone and to promote vascular hypertrophy, but the mechanism of these actions remains uncertain. Because angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin action and to impede the progression of vascular hypertrophy in hypertensive animal models, it is possible that the vascular properties of insulin may be mediated through the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS). To evaluate this relationship, we first investigated the effect of insulin on components of the RAS using cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Insulin treatment (1000 microU/mL) markedly increased angiotensinogen mRNA expression and angiotensinogen production. We next investigated the role of the RAS in insulin-mediated cell proliferation, using [3H]thymidine uptake. Studies were done both with insulin alone and in the presence of captopril (1x10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L) and losartan (1x10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L). [3H]Thymidine uptake was increased significantly by 1000 microU/mL insulin, and this stimulation was reduced by 1x10(-6) mol/L captopril (-38.8%, P<0.05) and by 1x10(-8) mol/L losartan (-37. 5%, P<0.05). Further studies showed that the degree of insulin-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake in VSMCs could be duplicated by 4x10(-10) mol/L Ang II. Losartan reduced the effects of both Ang II and insulin on [3H]thymidine uptake by about 40% to 45% of baseline (P<0.05). Captopril reduced insulin-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake but did not affect Ang II-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake. In summary, insulin induced significant stimulation of angiotensinogen expression and production and stimulated growth similar to that seen with Ang II in cultured rat VSMCs. Inhibition of Ang II production or its binding to the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibited insulin-mediated growth in a fashion similar to that seen with inhibition of Ang II-mediated growth. Thus, insulin can modulate the vascular RAS, and the effect of insulin on vascular growth may be via direct effects on angiotensinogen expression and translation operative through both the AT1 receptor and the conversion of Ang I to Ang II.", 
    "754": "We administered angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade (losartan, 40 mg x kg-1 x d-1), type II receptor (AT2) blockade (PD123319, 100 mg x kg-1 x d-1), or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 30 mg x kg-1 x d-1) to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from 10 to 20 weeks of age. Control SHR and Wister-Kyoto rats (WKY) received a placebo for the same period. At the end of treatment, losartan and enalapril were both found to have significantly reduced the arterial systolic blood pressure and the collagen concentration to the level of WKY, whereas PD123319 had no effect. Enalapril and PD123319 significantly reduced the media cross-sectional area of the aorta in comparison to that of untreated SHR, which was still larger than that of the WKY; however, losartan did not change it. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we next examined the mRNA expressions for ACE, AT1 receptor, and AT2 receptor in experimental animals. We observed significantly enhanced mRNA expression for AT1 and AT2 receptors and ACE in untreated SHR compared with WKY. The AT1 mRNA level was also significantly decreased in the SHR treated with either losartan or enalapril, whereas the AT2 mRNA level was significantly decreased in the SHR treated with either PD123319 or enalapril in comparison to untreated SHR. The level of ACE mRNA was significantly decreased only in the SHR treated with enalapril. These results indicate that AT1 receptor, but not AT2 receptor, plays a crucial role in the remodeling of matrix tissue, while AT2 receptor may play a role in the development of hypertrophy of smooth muscle in aorta in SHR, and that the reduction of hypertrophy of smooth muscle does not fully account for the suppression of hypertension.", 
    "755": "The objectives of our study were to assess the reproducibility of the trough-to-peak ratio (T/P) and to see whether a high T/P is accompanied by more organ protection or vice versa. The study included 175 (mean+/-SD age, 51+/-9 years) subjects with mild-moderate essential hypertension who had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy taken from the SAMPLE study (Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation), an open-label multicenter study. The study included a 3-week washout pretreatment period, a 12-month treatment period with lisinopril (n=84) or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (n=91) once daily, and a 4-week placebo follow-up period. Results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were obtained before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. T/Ps were computed in each patient by dividing the systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes at trough (changes in the last 2 hours of the monitoring period) by those at peak (average of the 2 adjacent hours with the maximal blood pressure reduction between the 2nd and 8th hour from drug intake) after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Average 24-hour blood pressure was similarly reduced at 3 and 12 months. Trough blood pressure changes at 3 and 12 months were closely correlated, as were the corresponding peak blood pressure changes. However, the 3- and 12-month T/Ps correlated to a lesser degree (r<0.42). Furthermore, the reduction of LVMI induced by treatment was similarly correlated with the treatment-induced reduction in 24-hour average, trough, and peak blood pressures but not with the T/Ps. This was also evident when the contribution to LV hypertrophy regression by 24-hour blood pressure changes and T/Ps was assessed in a multivariate regression analysis. In patients with a T/P >/=0.5 or <0.5, the regression of LVMI was similar. In conclusion, peak and trough blood pressure changes are reproducible and predict the regression of LVMI induced by treatment as well as average 24-hour blood pressure. T/Ps are less reproducible, and their value does not predict regression of organ damage by antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "756": "In the double-blind Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial, active treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d) with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/d) titrated or combined to reduce sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to <150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching placebos were used similarly. In view of persistent concerns about the use of calcium channel blockers as first-line antihypertensive drugs, this report explored to what extent nitrendipine, administered alone, prevented cardiovascular complications. Age at randomization averaged 70.2 years and systolic/diastolic blood pressure 173.8/85.5 mm Hg. Of 2398 actively treated patients, 1327 took only nitrendipine (average dose, 23.4 mg/d), and 1042 progressed to other treatments including nitrendipine (n=757; 35.7 mg/d), enalapril (n=783; 13.4 mg/d), and/or hydrochlorothiazide (n=294; 21.0 mg/d). Compared with the whole placebo group (n=2297), patients receiving monotherapy with nitrendipine had 25% (P=0.05) fewer cardiovascular end points, and those progressing to other active treatments showed decreases (P</=0. 01) in total mortality (40%), stroke (59%), and all cardiovascular end points (39%). Among the control patients, 863 used only the first-line placebo. Compared with this subgroup, patients receiving monotherapy with nitrendipine showed a nearly 50% (P</=0.004) reduction of all types of end points, including total and cardiovascular mortality. The full relative benefit from nitrendipine was seen as early as 6 months after randomization. To ascertain that the benefit conferred by the dihydropyridine was not due to selection bias, the 1327 patients remaining on monotherapy with nitrendipine were matched by gender, age, previous cardiovascular complications, and systolic blood pressure at entry with an equal number of placebo patients. In this analysis, nitrendipine reduced (P</=0.05) cardiovascular mortality by 41%, all cardiovascular end points by 33%, and fatal and nonfatal cardiac end points by 33%. Despite the limitations inherent in post hoc analyses, the present findings suggest that the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, given as a single antihypertensive medication, prevents cardiovascular complications in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "757": "Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that alternative pathways to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exists for angiotensin II (Ang II) generation in the heart, large arteries, and the kidney. In vitro studies in intact tissues, homogenates, or membrane isolates from the heart and large arteries have repeatedly demonstrated such pathways, but the issue remains unresolved because the approaches used have not made it possible to extrapolate from the in vitro to the in vivo situation. For our in vivo model, we studied young and healthy human volunteers, for the most part white and male; when these subjects achieved balance on a low salt diet to activate the renin system, the response of renal perfusion to pharmacological interruption of the renin system was studied. With this approach, we studied the renal vasodilator response to 3 ACE inhibitors, 2 renin inhibitors, and 2 Ang II antagonists at the top of their respective dose-response relationships. When these studies were initiated, our premise was that a kinin-dependent mechanism contributed to the renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition; therefore, the renal vasodilator response to ACE inhibition would exceed the alternatives. To our surprise, both renin inhibitors and both Ang II antagonists that were studied induced a renal vasodilator response of 140 to 150 mL/min/1.73 m2, approximately 50% larger than the maximal renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition, which was 90 to 100 mL/min/1.73 m2. In light of the data from in vitro systems, our findings indicate that in the intact human kidney, virtually all Ang II generation is renin-dependent but at least 40% of Ang I is converted to Ang II by pathways other than ACE, presumably a chymase, although other enzyme pathways exist. Preliminary data indicate that the non-ACE pathway may be substantially larger in disease states such as diabetes mellitus. One implication of the studies is that at the tissue level, Ang II antagonists have much greater potential for blocking the renin-angiotensin system than does ACE inhibition-with implications for therapeutics.", 
    "758": "While the promises of gene therapy may be years away from realization, the therapeutic use of drugs that act by modifying gene transcription is a well-established practice in clinical medicine. Although transcription-modulating drugs are frequently used in many different specialties, the deliberate development and use of these agents in cardiovascular medicine has been comparatively limited. However, research advances in the area of gene transcription and in the molecular genetic regulation of blood pressure, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and cell growth are providing new opportunities for controlling the expression of genes that are relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and essential hypertension. These research advances are beginning to converge in the development of transcription-modulating drugs with the potential to attack genetically determined risk factors that often cluster in patients with essential hypertension. Ligand-activated transcription factors that serve as receptors for small lipophilic compounds such as the thiazolidinediones and retinoids represent examples of potential therapeutic targets with direct effects on the expression of genes relevant to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension and its complications. Mounting evidence suggesting that the superior cardiorenal protective properties of converting enzyme inhibitors are related in part to their ability to indirectly modify the expression of genes in the heart and vasculature provides provisional support for the clinical value of this therapeutic approach. Given the success of transcription-modulating drugs in the treatment of type II diabetes and many other clinical disorders, it is anticipated that these agents will be developed as tools for the prevention and treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the not too distant future.",

    "760": "After a 2 to 4 week run-in period, 116 adult outpatients were randomized to receive valsartan 40, 80 or 160 mg twice daily, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 5/10 mg once daily, or placebo. At baseline and after 28 days of treatment, cardiac hemodynamic parameters were measured. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and by any changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, and routine laboratory parameters.", 
    "761": "For the 12 hour time point (trough), all doses of valsartan reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (statistically significant for valsartan 40 mg and 160 mg), decreased systemic vascular resistance (statistically significant for all three valsartan doses and for lisinopril at peak and trough), and increased cardiac output (statistically significant for all three valsartan doses at peak, and for 80 and 160 mg at trough). There were no clinically relevant effects on any safety parameters.",

    "763": "Effect of two angiotensin convertase inhibitors, enalapril and captopril, on blood plasma and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation and plasma peroxyl radical-trapping capacity was studied in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. A progressive increase in blood erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) level was observed in diabetic rats after 6 and 12 weeks. Blood plasma MDA level increased while plasma peroxyl radical-trapping capacity was decreased after 12 weeks. Captopril (2 mg/kg body weight) augmented the diabetes-induced changes in MDA content after 6 weeks and prevented them after 12 weeks increasing also the peroxyl radical-trapping capacity. Enalapril (1 mg/kg body weight) counteracted the diabetes-induced changes in MDA content after both 6 and 12 weeks but did not affect the plasma peroxyl radical-trapping capacity. These results suggest a possibility of a therapeutic use of angiotensin convertase inhibitors to attenuate the effects of oxidative stress in diabetes.", 
    "764": "The presence of components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and specific receptors of angiotensin II in the female and male reproductive tract supports the hypothesis that reproductive functions may be controlled by RAS. Therefore, the present study investigated the influence of ACE and angiotensins on sperm functions and the sperm-egg interaction. The experiments did not indicate direct effects of ACE on the capacitation process or acrosome reaction. Release of ACE from human spermatozoa during capacitation was not related to their ability to undergo acrosome reaction after stimulation with ionophore. Therefore, ACE release does not seem to be a useful clinical marker for human sperm capacitation. However, decreased binding of human spermatozoa to the oolemma of zonafree hamster oocytes after inhibition of ACE by captopril indicates that kininase II is involved in sperm-egg interactions. In contrast to other studies, incubation with captopril had no influence on sperm binding to the zona pellucida. Because effects of ACE on sperm-egg interactions but not on capacitation or acrosome reaction were observed, several experiments were performed to study the influence of substrates and products on the acrosome reaction. Angiotensin II induced the acrosome reaction dose-dependently, whereas angiotensin I had no effect on the acrosome reaction. The effect of angiotensin II on acrosome reaction seems to be calcium-dependent and mediated by protein kinases. Since a specific type 2 angiotensin II receptor inhibits the acrosome reaction induced by angiotensin II, this subtype of receptors may be present at the surface of sperm heads. Another clue for the presence of type 2 receptors on human spermatozoa is the finding that pertussis toxin did not inhibit the angiotensin II induced acrosome reaction. In contrast to type 1 angiotensin II receptors, type 2 receptors are known to be G-protein independent.", 
    "765": "Proteolytic enzymes, which are synthesized and secreted by cells of the seminiferous tubule of the testis, have important functions in spermatogenesis. We performed metabolic studies using small peptide hormones as a substrate to investigate the activity of proteases in cultured Sertoli cells of the rat. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the cell culture supernatants showed cleavage of met- and leu-enkephalin, substance P, and bradykinin. No peptidolysis was observed for the cyclic peptide oxytocin. The hormone cleavage pattern and the use of specific protease inhibitors in peptide degradation experiments demonstrated activities of several proteases in Sertoli cells. These are mainly metalloproteinases including neutral metalloendopeptidases, angiotensin-converting enzyme and aminopeptidases. In addition, activities of serine and aspartic proteases were detected. Only marginal proteolytic activities were observed in Sertoli cell conditioned supernatants, indicating that the investigated proteases are mainly located on Sertoli cell membranes. The peptide hormones used in this study have been found to play a potential role in the endocrine, paracrine or autocrine regulation of testicular cells. The membrane-associated proteases reported here may therefore be involved in the metabolism and inactivation of these peptides.", 
    "766": "Chronic renal insufficiency ultimately culminating in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation is a major health problem in the United States. The first task confronting the physician caring for a patient with renal disease is to decide whether the renal insufficiency is acute or chronic. The initial differential diagnostic approach to chronic renal insufficiency consists of determining whether the patient has glomerular disease or interstitial or vascular disease on the basis of a careful history taking, urinalysis, and measurement of 24-hour protein excretion. Further refinement of diagnostic considerations often requires serologic studies, renal biopsy, or imaging the urinary tract with ultrasonography or computed tomography. Management considerations begin with the identification and correction of any acute reversible causes of renal insufficiency in patients with chronic renal disease. Recent studies have shown that effective antihypertensive therapy, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, restriction of dietary protein, and excellent glycemic control in patients with diabetes, can retard the progression of chronic renal disease. Once these therapeutic strategies are in place, it is important to anticipate and treat the multiple manifestations of chronic progressive renal insufficiency: fluid overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism, and anemia.", 
    "767": "Twenty-four splenectomized dogs were subjected to rapid right ventricular pacing (RRVP) at 250 beats/min for five weeks. During the final three weeks, four groups six dogs were untreated or treated with captopril alone, with the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist L158,809 alone or with the two drugs combined by constant intravenous infusion. Hemodynamic studies were carried out during light anesthesia at baseline, and after two and five weeks of pacing. Total vascular capacitance and stressed blood volume were calculated from the mean circulatory filling pressure during transient circulatory arrest after acetylcholine administration at three different circulating volumes. Central blood volume and cardiac output were measured by thermodilution. Severe heart failure was present in the untreated group after five weeks of RRVP, characterized by low cardiac output and total vascular capacitance, high right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge and mean circulatory filling pressure, plus increased stressed and central blood volumes. While L158,809 had not effect, captopril alone or combined with L158,809 ameliorated the reduction in total vascular capacitance, and reduced right atrial and mean circulatory pressure and stressed blood volumes. Combined therapy reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril was effective in this model of chronic low output heart failure, whereas AT1 receptor antagonism was not.", 
    "768": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been implicated in various cardiovascular diseases; however, little is known about the ACE gene regulation in endothelial cells. We have investigated the effect of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on ACE activity and gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Our results showed a 3- and 5-fold increase in ACE activity in the medium and in the cells, respectively, after 24-h stimulation by PMA. We also observed an increase in the cellular ACE mRNA content starting after 6 h and reaching a 10-fold increase at 24 h in response to 100 ng/ml PMA as measured by ribonuclease protection assay. This effect was mediated by an increased transcription of the ACE gene as demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments and nearly abolished by the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Our results indicate that PMA-activated PKC strongly increases ACE mRNA level and ACE gene transcription in HUVEC, an effect associated with an increased ACE secretion. A role for early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) as a factor regulating ACE gene expression is suggested by both the presence of an Egr-1-responsive element in the proximal portion of the ACE promoter and the kinetics of the Egr-1 mRNA increase in HUVEC treated with PMA.", 
    "769": "In rats with five-sixths nephrectomy (remnant kidney), blood pressure, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria are significantly reduced by administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, during 16 weeks after reduction of the nephron number. The activity of catalase in remnant-kidney cortex homogenate is not influenced by enalapril treatment; the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are significantly increased. Elevated lipid peroxidation in cortex homogenates, evaluated by malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal concentrations, is not changed by treatment. Supplementation of dietary vitamin E to enalapril treatment does not alter antioxidant enzyme activities when compared to enalapril monotherapy. These results show that enalapril improves the balance between reactive oxygen intermediates and antioxidant enzymes in the remnant-kidney cortex of the rat. This finding may in part explain the protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the progression of glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "770": "alpha-Adrenergic blockers are potential alternative antihypertensive agents for diabetic patients. Data on their relative efficacy and their effect on kidney function and albuminuria are very limited however. 76 patients with diabetes type 2, hypertension (>/=140/90 mm Hg) and albuminuria (>/=30 mg/24 h) were randomized into three groups to receive cilazapril (2.5-10 mg), doxazosin (2-8 mg) or both. Patients of the first and second groups received a single agent for 4 months, the agents were then crossed for an additional period of 4 months followed by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) for a third 4-month period. Blood pressure was monitored monthly, creatinine clearance and HbA1c were measured before and at the end of each treatment period. Patients of the third group received reduced doses of cilazapril and doxazosin for 4 months. Hydrochlorothiazide was then added for the subsequent 4 months. There was a significant decline in blood pressure values during the first period in all groups. Cilazapril: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 160 +/- 6 to 149 +/- 5 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 101 +/- 3 to 94 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.001). Albuminuria declined from 350 +/- 105 to 205 +/- 96 mg/24 h (p = 0.001), creatinine clearance (CrCl) was unchanged. Doxazosin: SBP: 160 +/- 7 to 151 +/- 6 mm Hg; DBP: 97 +/- 4 to 90 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.001). Albuminuria 373 +/- 121 to 322 +/- 107 mg/24 h (p = 0.065) and CrCl 87 +/- 7 to 91 +/- 6 ml/min. The combination of both agents at half doses was equipotent or superior to either drug alone. Cross-over of cilazapril and doxazosin reproduced the hypotensive effect and reversed the antialbuminuric effect. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a further decline of 6-14 mm Hg in SBP and 3-11 mm Hg in DPB.", 
    "771": "This paper describes use of the prescription records of a large pharmaceutical benefits management organization to retrospectively analyze the refill behavior of patients who have recently started antihypertensive therapy in the outpatient setting. Using logistic regression analysis, the author identified class of antihypertensive medication, patient age, and dosing frequency as clinically important independent covariates that are predictive of persistence (defined as continuing therapy with the original antihypertensive drug as originally prescribed) at 12 months. At 12 months' follow-up, the percentage of patients continuing initial angiotensin II (A-II) antagonist therapy was substantially higher than the percentage continuing therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, or thiazide diuretics (64% vs 58%, 50%, 43%, and 38%, respectively). Additional studies are needed to explain why more patients continued with the same A-II antagonist therapy at 12 months compared with the other classes of antihypertensive drugs; whether these findings are explained by drug tolerability, financial incentives, newness of the product, selection bias, or other factors; whether these differences will be maintained in the following years; and whether the differences are associated with better health outcomes.", 
    "772": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated in normotensive type 2 diabetics with microalbuminuria the effect of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, on urine albumin excretion and serum lipids. A total of 1,882 patients were screened for urine microalbumin consecutively by dipstick test, Rapi Tex-Albumin test and RIA. The final 28 normotensive and microalbuminuric patients were assigned to receive either ramipril (1.25 mg/d, n = 16) or placebo (n = 12) for 12 weeks. Throughout the study, both groups had no changes in blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C, serum creatinine and electrolytes and no difference in creatinine clearance. At week 12 only the placebo group showed the significant increment of urine albumin excretion and triacylglycerol (30.6 +/- 38.3 to 39.0 +/- 19.7 and 167 +/- 64 to 208 +/- 77 mg/dl, respectively) but the decrement of HDL-cholesterol (46 +/- 16 to 35 +/- 6 mg/dl). During a 3 month period, increased urine albumin excretion was observed in normotensive type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria who received only placebo. We conclude that ramipril may arrest the progression of albumin excretion and had favorable effects on serum lipids. Ramipril was safe and well-tolerated without untoward side effects during the study period.", 
    "773": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), in addition to being a classic glycolytic enzyme, is a multifunctional protein involved in relevant cell functions such as DNA replication, DNA repair, translational control of gene expression, and apoptosis. Although the multifunctional nature of GAPDH suggests versatility in the mechanisms regulating its expression, no major qualitative changes and few quantitative changes in the GAPDH transcripts have been reported. While studying the expression of GAPDH during spermatogenesis, we detected alternative initiations to TATA box and alternative splicings in the 5' region of the pre-mRNA, resulting in at least six different types of mRNAs. The amount and the polyadenylation of the GAPDH transcripts increased in mature testis in relation to immature testis and further increased when cell suspensions from mature testis were exposed to heat shock. These results suggest that alternative initiation, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation could provide the necessary versatility to the regulation of the expression of this multifunctional protein during spermatogenesis.", 
    "774": "To test the utility of endoprosthetic treatment for ostial renal artery stenosis, and to examine blood pressure and its treatment, serum creatinine, and restenosis rate, 44 ostial renal stent placements were performed in 30 patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, and the indication for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) therapy. There was a marked decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (163+/-30 to 145+/-17 and 93+/-18 to 83+/-10 mm Hg; P < 0.008) with a decrease in number of medication (3.2+/-0.9 to 2.8+/-1.0; P = 0.005). In 5 out of 8 patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor, this drug could be added. Serum creatinine changed from 1.46+/-0.7 mg/dl to 1.39+/-0.58 mg/dl (P = ns). Three patients showed restenosis (12.5%). Ostial stenting lowers blood pressure, decreases antihypertensive drugs and increases medication flexibility.", 
    "775": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most potent vasoconstrictor yet described. The active 21-amino-acid peptide is derived from the conversion of the inactive precursor \"Big ET-1\" by an enzyme called endothelin-converting enzyme. In addition to its potent action as a vasoconstrictor, endothelin promotes growth and proliferation of smooth muscle and myocardial hypertrophy. ET-1 levels are elevated in acute myocardial infarction (MI), atherosclerosis, renal failure, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF). ET-1 levels correlate extremely well with the seriousness of the pathophysiologic condition. ET-1 levels at 72 h post MI accurately predict long-term survival. In patients with heart failure, ET-1 levels also predict long-term outcome, with the prognosis being severely compromised in patients with elevated ET-1 levels. Levels of plasma big ET-1 have been demonstrated to predict 1-year mortality and have been shown to be a better predictor of 1-year outcome than plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine, NYHA class, age, and echocardiographic left ventricular parameters. Although a small number of studies have reported beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on ET-1 levels in animal models, most reports in humans have not found an effect of ACE inhibitors on ET-1 levels. Only one ACE inhibitor, fosinopril, has been shown to be effective in normalizing ET-1 levels in clinically relevant situations, such as the long-term study of patients with CHF. This observation may point to a superior role of fosinopril compared with other ACE inhibitors in CHF patients and may indicate beneficial effects of fosinopril beyond blood pressure control.", 
    "776": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been generally beneficial in the treatment of many clinical conditions characterized by a significant degree of cardiovascular and renal involvement. Most of the available data on the benefits of ACE inhibitors have come from well-conducted large clinical trials that have provided much information supporting the use of ACE inhibitors, in agreement with the basic principles of evidence-based medicine. In particular, ACE inhibitors improve blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and have proved to be beneficial in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Improved survival rates after the use of ACE inhibitors have been also demonstrated in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), whether or not the condition is complicated by acute CHF. More recently, some studies have demonstrated the ability of ACE inhibitors (particularly fosinopril) to prevent the long-term development of CHF in patients treated acutely during MI and without baseline LV dysfunction. ACE inhibitors appear to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and to reduce the occurrence of re-infarction, as demonstrated in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial and the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study (SAVE). Finally, a protective role for ACE inhibitors has been reported even in diabetic hypertensive patients, in whom such agents can significantly reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events (CAD and stroke) with a pattern that is largely independent of blood pressure control and is not observed with the use of calcium antagonists. These data confirm the strong involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases and strongly support the role of ACE inhibitors as drugs for present and future therapy.", 
    "777": "Recent trials in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes reveal important differences in the risk for major cardiovascular events when individual agents are compared. In the Fosinopril Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET), 380 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomized to fosinopril or amlodipine and followed for up to 3.5 years to assess effects on serum lipids. Although both agents effectively controlled blood pressure, amlodipine caused a significantly greater decrease in systolic pressure. At the end of the trial, serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, serum glucose, plasma insulin, serum creatinine, and microalbuminuria were similar in both groups. The patients randomized to fosinopril were significantly less likely to experience the prospectively defined combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalized angina, or stroke compared to those randomized to amlodipine (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.26-0.95). In the Appropriate Blood pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial, 470 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes who were randomized to long-acting nisoldipine had an adjusted sevenfold increased risk for acute MI compared to those randomized to enalapril (RR 7.0; 95% CI 2.3-21.4). In the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) trial, the patients with hypertension and above the median of HbA1c (> or =6.7%) randomized to isradipine had a threefold increased risk for major cardiovascular events compared to those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.09-7.26). These findings are supported by several observational studies. Therefore, evidence is emerging that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and low-dose diuretics may be more effective than calcium antagonists for prevention of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with diabetes or impaired glucose control.", 
    "778": "Increasing worldwide rates of diabetes mellitus, combined with the significant micro- and macrovascular complications that accompany the disease, point to a heightened need to develop simple, rational strategies to protect against end-organ damage, particularly diabetic nephropathy. Although simple strategies do exist, i.e., early diagnosis of microalbuminuria (MAU) followed by nephroprotective therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the use of these techniques should be increased. This is especially true for primary care physicians, who will continue to handle the majority of diabetic patients. To combat the underuse of this dual approach, this article reviews a stepwise approach to identifying early MAU so that therapeutic measures can be undertaken before the disorder progresses to diabetic nephropathy and, consequently, to end-stage renal disease in the majority of patients. Once a diagnosis of MAU is made, a variety of trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibitor therapy should be considered the standard therapy to retard worsening albuminuria and subsequent renal disease. ACE inhibitors can retard the progression of microalbuminuria and can lower the percentage of patients who progress to end-stage renal disease and death. Significant data indicate that ACE inhibitors should be used in MAU diabetics regardless of the level of blood pressure. In particular, the ACE inhibitor fosinopril may offer advantages because of its dual route of elimination, thus simplifying dosing in renally impaired patients. The newly developed angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be considered in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors because of the similar effect on the interruption of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "779": "Rising worldwide rates of diabetes mellitus heighten the need to maintain adequate metabolic control in diabetic patients and to control for other cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profile disturbances, high blood pressure, and smoking habits. This is especially the case in diabetic patients who also present with hypertension, a co-morbid state that is present in at least 50% of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients. Cardiovascular disease is present in 75% of all diabetes-related deaths, and the concomitant condition of diabetes and hypertension is believed to act synergistically on elevating the risk for cardiovascular disease. A number of trials have demonstrated a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease end points in diabetic hypertensive patients than in diabetic normotensive patients. Furthermore, hypertension is associated not only with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality but also for microvascular complications in patients with diabetes. Adequate treatment of high blood pressure is imperative in these patients. The effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment can be measured not only by the degree of reduction in blood pressure but also by assessment of the effects on urinary albumin excretion rate. It is assumed that the greater the reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate, the greater the renoprotective effect. Treatment choices should be evidence-based, i.e., physicians should concentrate not only on the treatment of hypertension but also on improving glycemic control and lipid profile disorders, when necessary. When viewed in this regard, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, low-dose diuretics, and in some cases beta-blockers, should be considered agents of choice in hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "780": "The endothelial vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET) can induce acute renal failure when fibrinolysis and vasodilatory prostanoids (PGs) are inhibited. This study compares therapeutic agents preventing ET-induced acute renal failure in anesthetized female pigs. We investigated the effect of four ET boli (1.5 microg/kg, i.v.) after pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg) and epsilon-aminocaproicacid (100 + 50 mg/kg) alone (controls, group 1) or during additional nifedipine (10 microg/kg/h; group 2), hirudin (0.5 mg/kg; group 3), or enalapril (2 x 0.15 mg; group 4) on coagulation, PGs, and renal function. The ET-induced blood pressure increase was lower in groups 2 to 4 (lowest in group 3, P < 0.05). PG synthesis was blocked in all groups. The initial hypercoagulability (controls) resulted in disseminated intravascular coagulation that was prevented by hirudin and was attenuated in groups 2 and 4. At the end of the experiment, creatinine clearance was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. The recovery of renal function two hours after the last ET bolus was most pronounced in the hirudin group. All therapeutic drugs attenuated ET-induced impairment of renal function. Hirudin seems to be the most potent protective drug. Prevention of further ET release evoked by ET-mediated secretion of thrombin might explain this. These results suggest three important pathways for ET's hemodynamic and renal effects.", 
    "781": "Thirty-four patients (65.3+/-3.3 years of age, mean+/-SEM) with hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L) had measurement of their renin-aldosterone system. Nineteen patients (56%) had plasma renin activity (PRA) >1.5 ng/mL/h, which was not low, while 15 (44%) had PRA <1.5. Twelve of the 15 hyporeninemic hyperkalemic patients were studied to determine whether their renin-aldosterone system responded to 2 weeks of furosemide, 20 mg daily. Four were nonresponders: PRA averaged 0.3+/-0.1 ng/mL/h, and it did not increase with furosemide or respond to captopril before or after furosemide. Eight patients were responders: PRA averaged 0.6+/-0.2 ng/mL/h and increased with furosemide to 5.5+/-3.4 ng/mL/h. Captopril failed to increase PRA before furosemide, but PRA increased to 15.3+/-8.4 ng/mL/h after furosemide. Plasma aldosterone was low in both nonresponders and responders (3.5+/-1.2 ng/dL vs 5.8+/-2.5 ng/dL) and did not increase significantly with furosemide (4.3+/-1.7 ng/dL vs 8.7+/-2.5 ng/dL). Serum potassium did not fall and therefore did not limit the rise in aldosterone. Renin responders had greater body weight, were predominantly female (6/8 vs 2/4) and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (7/8 vs 0/4). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) fell with furosemide in 8 of 8 responders and in 1 of the 2 nonresponders in whom it was measured. Neither group had suppressed plasma prorenin levels, indicating no suppression of renin gene expression. These results indicate that many hyperkalemic patients do not have suppressed PRA. Further, a majority of patients with suppressed PRA have high levels of ANP and can respond to diuretic therapy with a rise in PRA and a fall in ANP, suggesting physiologic suppression of the renin system by volume expansion. A minority of hyperkalemic patients with suppressed PRA had PRA that did not increase under these study conditions.", 
    "782": "Bradykinin is believed to be the main mediator of symptoms in hereditary (HA) and acquired (AA) angio-oedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, as well as in angio-oedema that complicates treatment with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Difficulties in the measurement of kinin concentrations, however, have so far precluded the demonstration of an incontrovertible change in plasma bradykinin concentrations in these disorders. By developing a reliable assay we have been able to follow bradykinin concentrations during attacks and during remission in HA and in AA, and also in a patient treated with an ACE-inhibitor.", 
    "783": "Liquid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and RIA were used for specific measurement of plasma bradykinin concentrations in 22 patients with HA and in 22 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex distribution. Four patients with AA and one hypertensive patient treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril were also studied.", 
    "784": "Among the healthy volunteers plasma bradykinin concentration was inversely proportional to age. The geometric mean plasma bradykinin concentration in the healthy volunteers was 2.2 fmol/mL (SD 2.2), compared with 3.9 fmol/mL (3.7) among patients with HA during remission (p=0.095). Bradykinin was also high in the patients with AA (10.4 fmol/mL [1.6]). During acute attacks of oedema, in both HA and AA, plasma bradykinin rose to two to 12 times the upper limit of normal. Infusion of C1-esterase inhibitor (the deficient factor in both HA and AA) immediately lowered bradykinin concentrations. In the patient receiving the ACE-inhibitor captopril, bradykinin concentration was very high at 47 fmol/mL during an acute attack of angio-oedema, but normal at 3.2 fmol/mL in remission after withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "785": "A sensitive method for measurement of plasma bradykinin provided the means to show that concentrations of this peptide decrease with age in healthy people.

Cases were patients who had progressed to ESRF and controls were patients who were not in ESRF, that is, whose serum-creatinine failed to progress to >3 mg/dl during the observation period and who did not require renal replacement therapy. Matching for renal disease (IgA-GN, ADPKD), gender, age at renal death and region of residence resulted in 102 individually matched pairs (IgA-GN N = 54, ADPKD N = 48).

    "790": "The recognized role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the pathogenesis of the progression of renal disease cannot be solely attributed to Ang II's hemodynamic effects. Indeed, growth stimulating signals driven by Ang II promote mesangial cell (MC) hypertrophy and extracellular matrix production, prominent features of progressive glomerular injury. Superoxide anion (O2-) avidly interacts with nitric oxide, an endogenous vasodilator that inhibits growth factor stimulated MC growth and matrix production. In addition, O2- acting as an intracellular signal is linked to growth related responses such as activation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases. The studies reported herein were designed to investigate: (a) whether Ang II induces MC O2-production and (b) if increased O2- production elicits growth responses in MC.",

Ang II dose dependently increased MC 3H-leucine incorporation, and MC protein content, two markers of MC hypertrophy, as well as 3H-thymidine incorporation, a marker of MC hyperplasia. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP kinases prevented Ang II induced MC hypertrophy.

    "794": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of adverse effects and the prognostic value of various risk factors in a large population of unselected hypertensive patients treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril. Among the 30 072 patients investigated in this post marketing retrospective study, 1813 patients (6.0 per cent) reported an adverse effect. The five most frequent side effects were coughing (3.1 per cent), dizziness (0.7 per cent), headache (0.6 per cent) asthenia (0.5 per cent) and nausea (0.3 per cent). Intolerance risk factors for trandolapril were researched using both univariate and multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis, a prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor and female gender were strongly correlated with either overall intolerance or coughing. The most relevant variables for the occurrence of adverse effects, listed according to their entry order in the multivariate analysis, were: prior intolerance of ACE inhibitors (OR: 4.19, 95 per cent CI: 3.66-4.78), female gender (OR: 1.46, 95 per cent CI: 1.31-1.63), prior intolerance of other antihpertensive agents (OR: 1.27, 95 per cent CI: 1.14-1.41), smoking (OR: 0.76, 95 per cent CI: 0.66-0.87) and combination with a beta blocker (OR: 1.31, 95 per cent CI: 1.08-1.58). A prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor appears to be a very strong predictor of coughing (OR: 6.14, 95 per cent CI: 5.24-7.19). The following variables, namely female gender (OR: 1.61, 95 per cent CI: 1.40-1.85), age 60-80 (OR: 1.25, 95 per cent CI: 1.09-1.44) and prior intolerance of other antihypertensive agents (OR: 1.20, 95 per cent CI: 1.03-2.39) appear less significant.", 
    "795": "We demonstrate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enalapril and captopril inhibit the transport of D-Phe-L-Gln into PepT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes and into rat renal cortical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). The kinetics of inhibition are competitive. Enalapril and captopril are not substrates for PepT2 (Boll et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93 (1996) 284-289). Therefore we conclude that in rat renal cortical BBMV this neutral dipeptide is transported via PepT1.", 
    "796": "The positive chronotropic effect of bradykinin was investigated in isolated spontaneously beating atria of the rat. Cumulative additions of bradykinin (0.3-100 nM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the beating rate of the atria by maximally 35+/-4 beats/min, approximately 25% of the 1 microM isoprenaline-induced maximal responses. In contrast, the active metabolite of bradykinin and selective bradykinin B1-receptor agonist, Des-Arg9-bradykinin, did not influence the spontaneous frequency of beating. Propranolol (1 microM) combined with prazosin (1 microM) did not affect the positive chronotropic effect of bradykinin. A selective bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, concentration-dependently shifted the response curves for bradykinin to the right, whereas the bradykinin B1-receptor antagonist, Lys-[Leu8]Des-Arg9-bradykinin had no effect. The tachycardic responses to bradykinin were potentiated by ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme/kininase II inhibitor, but not affected by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor. Indomethacin and meclofenamate, two cyclooxygenase inhibitors, abolished the bradykinin-induced chronotropic effect. These results indicate that exogenous bradykinin induces a positive chronotropic effect that occurs independent of adrenoceptors. The bradykinin-induced chronotropic effect is mediated by bradykinin B2 receptors, whereas B1 receptors do not play a role in mediating this effect. Prostaglandins but not nitric oxide appear to be involved in bradykinin-induced positive chronotropic effect.", 
    "797": "Several studies indicated an abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) in hypertensive patients, but no study has systematically investigated the effects of different pharmacologic classes of antihypertensive drugs on EDV. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of three different antihypertensive regimens [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, calcium channel blockade, and beta-blockade] on EDV when given locally in the forearm at a constant blood pressure. The increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) during local intraarterial infusions of methacholine (MCh; inducing EDV) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; inducing endothelium-independent vasodilation, EIDV) was measured in young, normotensive subjects by venous occlusion plethysmography, before and during concomitant local intraarterial infusion of any of the antihypertensive drugs. Without changing baseline FBF, enalaprilat (n=6, 2.4 mg/h) potentiated the increase in FBF induced by MCh [from 22.6+/-2.3 (SD) to 25.4+/-2.3 ml/min/100 ml tissue at 4 microg/min; p < 0.05], but the response to SNP was unchanged. Local intraarterial verapamil infusion (n=6), at a dose individually titrated to keep baseline FBF unchanged, did not alter the response to MCh infusion, whereas the response to SNP was potentiated. A higher dose of verapamil (n=6), which increased baseline FBF, increased both EDV and EIDV significantly in parallel (p < 0.05). The local propranolol infusion (n=6, 1.2 mg/h) attenuated the FBF response to MCh significantly (from 28.9+/-5.7 to 21.5+/-3.2 ml/min/100 ml tissue at 4 microg/min; p < 0.05), whereas both baseline FBF and the response to SNP were unchanged. In conclusion, this investigation showed that commonly used antihypertensive drugs affect endothelial vasodilator function in a different ways. ACE inhibition enhanced EDV, whereas a nonselective beta-blocker attenuated EDV. The calcium channel blocker, verapamil, improved both EDV and EIDV, probably by a direct effect on the vascular smooth-muscle cells.", 
    "798": "It is well known that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate progressive ventricular enlargement or hypertrophy after myocardial infarction and that cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is increased in the rat model of myocardial infarction. In this study, to determine whether the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on cardiac hypertrophy after myocardial infarction are due to a reduction in ventricular afterload or to inhibition of cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme, we used sodium loading during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The rat model of myocardial infarction was treated with a vehicle, 1% saline, as drinking fluid, perindopril (2 mg/kg/day), or 1% saline as drinking fluid plus perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Perindopril reduced blood pressure, prevented cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibited cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme. The effects of perindopril on blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy were abolished by sodium loading, which did not alter the degree of cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Thus the actions of perindopril on cardiac hypertrophy depend more on blood pressure reduction than on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the rat model of myocardial infarction.", 
    "799": "Although the transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to the apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (very-low-density lipoproteins + low-density lipoproteins) has been shown to be abnormally increased in a number of conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk, it has not been studied in patients with essential hypertension (EH). To determine whether subjects with EH have increased CE transport, CE transfer (CET) was estimated isotopically and lipoprotein lipid and phospholipid composition determined in a group of 14 untreated normolipidemic (triglycerides 116+/-46, cholesterol 185+/-30, HDL 38+/-10 mg/dl) otherwise healthy ethnically diverse EH subjects. CET was significantly increased in EH subjects compared to a similar group of normotensive controls (EH: k = 0.27+/- 0.09 vs. control k = 0.11+/-0.02: P < 0.01). Lipoprotein concentration and composition were comparable in the two groups and closely resembled that of an age- and sex-matched reference group. The abnormal increase in CET persisted (k = 0.25+/-0.12) after 3 months of treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril without a change in either plasma or lipoprotein lipids. Thus, CET is increased in normolipidemic subjects with EH and is not affected by the ACE inhibitor ramipril.",

    "825": "We reported previously that bradykinin induces endothelium-dependent relaxation at nanomolar (nM) concentrations in isolated bovine coronary arteries with an intact endothelium. Recently we have found that in the presence of 10 microM indomethacin, femtomolar (fM) concentrations of bradykinin induce endothelium-dependent relaxation in some bovine coronary arteries (approximately 10% of the coronary arteries examined). The present study was designed to characterize the relaxation induced by fM bradykinin. Relaxation was completely abolished by repeated application of fM bradykinin, by 100 microM N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and by 10 microM methylene blue. Relaxation induced by nM bradykinin was partly affected by these treatments. Relaxation induced by both concentrations of bradykinin was inhibited by a B2-kinin receptor antagonist, [Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-bradykinin, in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by a B1-kinin receptor antagonist, des-Arg9, [Leu8]-bradykinin. In the presence of 10 microM captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, all coronary arteries examined in this experiment showed endothelium-dependent relaxation to fM bradykinin. These results show that some bovine coronary arteries relax in response to fM bradykinin, and this response is mediated predominantly by the release of nitric oxide via stimulation of endothelial B2-kinin receptors. The relaxation may be dependent on ACE activity.",

Nearly all patients received anticoagulants and nitrates. The proportion of patients treated increased significantly, between 1986 and 1990, for antiplatelet drugs (from 51% to 96%) and thrombolytics (from 9% to 44%) and, between 1990 and 1993, for beta-blockers (from 57% to 78%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (from 26% to 43%). The use of calcium antagonists and antiarrhythmics dropped over time. Coronary arteriography and angioplasty were increasingly performed (53% and 18% in 1993), although progressively postponed in-hospital stay. The observed trends reflect a rapid translation of clinical trials into medical practice. However the use of thrombolytics could be raised further by shortening the hospitalization delay (median: 3 hours in 1993) and door-to-needle time (median: 47 minutes) which remained stable over time.", 
    "827": "The model for heart failure has changed radically over the past 20 years. No longer a simple hemodynamic paradigm of pump dysfunction, heart failure is now characterized as a complex clinical syndrome with release of many neurohormones and cytokines, which are believed to be most responsible for progression of disease. This change in our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has important therapeutic implications. Drugs designed to influence the myocardial contractile state have been found over the past few decades to have either a neutral or an adverse effect on long-term survival, whereas agents designed to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and other neurohormonal systems have proved to be remarkably effective treatment. Recently, drugs designed to block excessive sympathetic nervous system activity have been demonstrated in well-controlled studies to be safe and effective forms of therapy for heart failure. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with alpha1-blocking and antioxidant properties, is associated with prevention of progression of heart failure as manifested by improvement in left ventricular (LV) function, reduction in heart size, and improved survival in patients with New York Heart Association functional Class II and III symptoms. This improvement is observed equally in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure. It is tempting to speculate that beta-adrenergic blockers prevent the progression of heart failure by reducing LV mass and LV chamber size. In essence, carvedilol, and perhaps other beta-adrenergic blockers, appear to abrogate relentless LV remodeling which is typically associated with progression of heart failure. The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers may be particularly effective in this regard, although more data on beta-adrenergic blockers in patients with advanced heart failure are needed. Data from experimental heart failure animal models also suggest that endothelin (ET) subtype A (ET(A)) receptor blockers have the potential to lessen the pace of progressive LV remodeling. As our understanding of the neuroendocrine response to diminished cardiac performance improves, novel and even more imaginative neurohormonal and cytokine antagonists are likely to emerge as important new treatments for both hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "828": "Left ventricular (LV) dilatation after myocardial infarction (MI) is a major predictor of prognosis and identifies which patients will develop heart failure. Left ventricular dilatation or remodeling starts immediately after MI and progresses in the chronic phase of heart failure. Factors influencing remodeling, such as infarct size and neurohumoral activation, including the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system, are discussed. Remodeling can be affected by reduction of infarct size and inhibition of neurohumoral activation. The effect of thrombolysis, beta-blockade, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the acute phase after MI and in the chronic phase of heart failure on remodeling are discussed. On the basis of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade in acute MI and in chronic heart failure, a treatment strategy is proposed in which both ACE inhibition and beta-blockade are started early after MI. Depending on infarct size and ventricular function, continued treatment in the chronic phase of heart failure must be considered.", 
    "829": "Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a disease characterized pathologically by pulmonary artery medial hypertrophy, adventitial thickening, and neointimal proliferation. Increasing recognition of the importance of remodeling to the pathogenesis of PPH suggests new therapeutic possibilities, but it will be necessary to (1) identify essential mediators of remodeling, and (2) demonstrate that inhibiting those mediators suppresses remodeling before new antiremodeling therapies can be considered feasible. The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on pulmonary vascular remodeling was studied in a newly developed rat model in which neointimal lesions develop between 3 and 5 wk after monocrotaline injury is coupled with increased pulmonary artery blood flow after contralateral pneumonectomy. Neointimal formation was significantly suppressed at 5 wk by ACE inhibition whether it was started 10 d before or 3 wk after remodeling was initiated, although medial hypertrophy and adventitial thickening still developed. By 11 wk, the extent of neointimal formation in rats treated with ACE inhibition was similar to rats without ACE inhibition at 5 wk. Pulmonary artery pressures and right ventricular weights correlated with the extent of neointimal formation. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrated marked suppression of lung tropoelastin and type I procollagen gene expression in the presence of ACE inhibition. An angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist partially, but not completely, replicated the effects of ACE inhibition. These data suggest that the tissue angiotensin system may be a target for therapeutic efforts to suppress the vascular remodeling that is characteristic of primary pulmonary hypertension.",

The present study investigated the role of angiotensin Type 1 (AT1) receptors in the subfornical organ (SFO) on this effect. The intake of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by combined administration of the diuretic, furosemide (FURO), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (CAP). Pretreatment of the SFO with an AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (1 microgram/200 nl), reduced water intake but not 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by subcutaneous FURO+CAP. Methysergide (4 microgram/200 nl) injected bilaterally into the LPBN increased 0.3 M NaCl intake after FURO+CAP. Losartan injected into the SFO prevented the additional 0. 3 M NaCl intake caused by LPBN methysergide injections.

This impairment was partially reversed by an acute ANG II blockade with losartan. These results demonstrate that high BP does not account for the decreased SBRS in LH rats. SBRS impairment could result either from cardiac hypertrophy or from the direct effect of ANG II on the baroreflex loop.",

However, it is unknown whether the latter actually takes place. In this study, it was hypothesized that NO is released (from macula densa cells or endothelium) as part of the normal TGF loop, and mitigates the TGF response. In Sprague Dawley rats, TGF responsiveness was assessed (fall in tubular stop flow pressure, deltaSFP, upon switching loop of Henle perfusion rates from 0 to 40 nl/min) during an intrarenal NO clamp (systemic infusion of nitro-L-arginine, 10 microg/kg per min, followed by intrarenal nitroprusside infusion adjusted to restore renal blood flow [RBF]). This maneuver was presumed to fix intrarenal NO impact at a physiologic level. To validate the approach, TGF responsiveness during an intrarenal angiotensin II (AngII) clamp (systemic infusion of enalaprilat 0.2 mg/kg per min, followed by intrarenal AngII infusion) was also studied. AngII is presumed to modulate but not mediate, TGF, thus not to increase as part of the TGF loop. In untreated animals, RBF was 7.4 +/- 0.4 ml/min, and deltaSFP was 5.7 +/- 1.6 mmHg. Nitro-L-arginine infusion alone reduced RBF to 5.3 +/- 0.5 ml/min (P < 0.05); with nitroprusside infusion, RBF was restored to 8.3 +/- 0.7 ml/min. In this condition (NO clamp), deltaSFP was markedly increased to 19.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg (P < 0.05). By contrast, deltaSFP, which was virtually abolished during enalaprilat alone (0.2 +/- 0.3 mmHg), was not significantly different from controls during AngII clamp (8.2 +/- 1.0 mmHg). These data suggest that NO may well be released upon TGF activation. By contrast, AngII is not dynamically involved in TGF activation, but may modulate the TGF response. Thus, dynamic release of NO during TGF activation mitigates the TGF response, so that it will offset the action of a primary, as yet undefined, vasoconstrictor mediator. The source of this NO, macula densa or endothelium, remains to be elucidated.", 
    "843": "This study is aimed at examining whether essential arterial hypertension (HTN) or ACE inhibitors have any effect on erythrocyte selenium (Se)-dependent and Se-non-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Eleven patients with HTN (2 men and 9 women) and 9 healthy volunteers were included in this study after clinical examination and laboratory investigation. The activities of all three enzymes were determined and then the patients were assigned to receive ACE inhibitor therapy consisting of captopril, 25 to 50 mg daily, or enalapril, 10 to 40 mg daily. After 1 year, the determination of antioxidant enzymes was repeated. Our results showed that the initial values of Se-dependent GSH-Px in patients treated with ACE inhibitors were significantly lower (19.60 +/- 3.50 microM NADPH/min(-1)/mgHb(-1)) compared with the controls (28.64 +/- 4.93 microM NADPH/min(-1)/mgHb(-1); p < 0.001), whereas the activity of Se-non-dependent GSH-Px was significantly enhanced (13.55 +/- 1.46 microM NADPH/min(-1)/mgHb(-1); p < 0.001) compared with the control group (9.44 +/- 0.81 microM NADPH/min(-1)/mgHb(-1); p < 0.001). ACE inhibitors did not significantly change the activity of Se-dependent GSH-Px or Se-non-dependent GSH-Px. No significant alteration was observed in SOD activity.",

    "852": "The effects of 2 fixed antihypertensive combination drugs on blood pressure and aortic elastic properties were compared in 2 parallel groups. Twenty-six patients for 6 months received a calcium antagonist plus ACE inhibitor (verapamil SR 180 mg/trandolapril 1 mg (Vera/Tran)) and 25 patients a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist plus diuretic (metoprolol 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (Meto/HCTZ)). In addition to blood pressure (SBP, DBP), carotidofemoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed non-invasively. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was determined from cardiac output derived by electrical impedance cardiography. Sitting DBP decreased for -14.4 mmHg following Vera/Tran compared with -9.2 mmHg following Meto/HCTZ (p = 0.02 for difference between treatments). Blood pressure was normalized (i.e. DBP < 90 mmHg) in 69% of patients with Vera/Tran and in 52% with Meto/HCTZ. PWV was lowered with Vera/Tran to a higher extent than with Meto/HCTZ (differences between group means -0.46 to -0.98 m/sec, statistically not significant). Vera/Tran induced a decrease in TPR of about 15% of baseline values, whereas Meto/HCTZ showed no influence. Treatment-related adverse events following Meto/HCTZ were bradycardia and associated symptoms; following Vera/Tran these were cough and edema in 1 case each. In the Meto/HCTZ group, there were more withdrawals/drop-outs (9/25) than in the Vera/Tran group (2/26). The somewhat more intense reduction in PWV with Vera/Tran is indicative of an increase in aortic elastic properties associated with the more potent decrease in BP. In the present study, the combination of calcium antagonist plus ACE inhibitor was found to be an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive regimen and in these respects appears to have some advantages compared with a combination of beta-blocker plus diuretic.", 
    "853": "The present investigation was performed to evaluate the effects of S-nitrosocaptopril, a novel vasodilator possessing the capacities of both an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and an NO donor, on blood pressure and renal function in rats. S-nitrosocaptopril produced acute reductions in mean arterial pressure after both oral dosing (5, 10, 50 mg/kg) to chronically-catheterized awake rats and intravenous administrations (0.125, 1.25, 12.5 mg/kg) to anesthetized rats. The hypotensive magnitude and duration of S-nitrosocaptopril were dose-dependent. Acute pressure-associated reductions in the glomerular filtration rate and urine flow were observed only at high concentration of S-nitrosocaptopril (12.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in both awake and anesthetized rats. These decreases were transient, followed by an overshoot of glomerular filtration rate and urine flow above basal values. In contrast, captopril (i.v.) did not produce any significant acute effects on mean blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate in either awake or anesthetized rats. In rats with acute hypertension induced by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 30 mg/kg, i.v.), S-nitrosocaptopril (0.125 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly abolished the hypertensive effects. In contrast, the hypertension was not affected by captopril. In two-kidney one-clipped Goldblatt hypertensive rats, oral administration of S-nitrosocaptopril (25 mg/kg, b.i.d.) for 10 days significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and preserved glomerular filtration rate. The oral antihypertensive effect of S-nitrosocaptopril was more potent than captopril (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings indicate that: (1) S-nitrosocaptopril provides both acute and chronic anti-hypertensive effects orally and intravenously, whereas captopril has only moderate chronic oral effects; and (2) S-nitrosocaptopril preferentially decreases blood pressure without markedly affecting glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "854": "The model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in Wistar rats was used to study the expression of osteopontin during development of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes was confirmed by serum glucose levels exceeding 16 mmol/l during the experimental period of 12 weeks. During this period of time, diabetic nephropathy developed, as characterized by a reduced glomerular filtration rate (2.7 +/- 0.3 ml/min in controls vs. 1.7 +/- 0.1 ml/min in diabetic rats) and proteinuria (8.3 +/- 1.7 mg/24 h in controls vs. 22.0 +/- 4 mg/24 h in diabetic rats). Northern blot analysis revealed a time-dependent upregulation of renal cortical osteopontin expression reaching 138 +/- 6% of control levels after 2 weeks and 290 +/- 30% (mean +/- SE, n = 6-9) after 12 weeks. By immunostaining, the increased osteopontin expression could be located to the tubular epithelium of the renal cortex. Chronic treatment of animals with ramipril (3 mg/kg) during the 12-week experimental period led to a further increase in osteopontin mRNA expression in diabetic animals, amounting to 570 +/- 73% (mean +/- SE, n = 6) of controls. Increased levels of osteopontin were not associated with accumulation of monocyte/macrophages that were identified by the cell type specific monoclonal antibody ED-1. The increased osteopontin expression in ramipril-pretreated rats was abolished by application of the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, icatibant (0.5 mg/kg). In addition, increased osteopontin expression in diabetic rats, which did not receive any treatment after STZ injection, could as well be reduced by icatibant given for the final 2 weeks of the experimental period. These data suggest that a strong bradykinin B2-receptor-mediated upregulation of osteopontin occurs during the pathogenesis of experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats.", 
    "855": "We examined whether the ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism modulates renal disease progression in IDDM and how ACE inhibitors influence this relationship. The EURODIAB Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in IDDM is a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial in 530 nonhypertensive, mainly normoalbuminuric IDDM patients aged 20-59 years. Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured every 6 months for 2 years. Genotype distribution was 15% II, 58% ID, and 27% DD. Between genotypes, there were no differences in baseline characteristics or in changes in blood pressure and glycemic control throughout the trial. There was a significant interaction between the II and DD genotype groups and treatment on change in AER (P = 0.05). Patients with the II genotype showed the fastest rate of AER progression on placebo but had an enhanced response to lisinopril. AER at 2 years (adjusted for baseline AER) was 51.3% lower on lisinopril than placebo in the II genotype patients (95% CI, 15.7 to 71.8; P = 0.01), 14.8% in the ID group (-7.8 to 32.7; P = 0.2), and 7.7% in the DD group (-36.6 to 37.6; P = 0.7). Absolute differences in AER between placebo and lisinopril at 2 years were 8.1, 1.7, and 0.8 microg/min in the II, ID, and DD groups, respectively. The significant beneficial effect of lisinopril on AER in the II group persisted when adjusted for center, blood pressure, and glycemic control, and also for diastolic blood pressure at 1 month into the study. Progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (lisinopril versus placebo) was 0.27 (0.03-2.26; P = 0.2) in the II group, and 1.30 (0.33-5.17; P = 0.7) in the DD group (P = 0.6 for interaction). Knowledge of ACE genotype may be of value in determining the likely impact of ACE inhibitor treatment.",

Approximately 100 cases of pancreatitis induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, of which about 20 involved lisinopril. We report a case of pancreatitis occurring only 3 hours after intake of lisinopril by a man without other risk factors for the illness. The patient had experienced a similar but less severe reaction to this medication 3 months earlier. This case probably represents the first time a patient was rechallenged with lisinopril and had a more significant adverse reaction.",

ACE inhibitor dose-response analysis used the discharge dose of ACE inhibitor, converted to enalapril-equivalent doses and adjusted for renal function. Principal end points were time-to-readmission and 90-day readmission rate. Of 314 total patients, digoxin was used in 72%, diuretic in 86%, and 67% received an ACE inhibitor. Only 22% of those on an ACE inhibitor received currently recommended doses of enalapril > or = 20 mg/day or equivalent, whereas 41% received enalapril < or = 5 mg/day. Time-to-readmission was increased by an ACE inhibitor (p = 0.002) but not digoxin or diuretic. An ACE inhibitor was the principal covariate of 90-day readmission rate (p <0.05). The readmission rate was not reduced with daily ACE inhibitor doses of < or = 5 mg enalapril, whereas daily doses of > or = 10 mg enalapril reduced 90-day readmission rates by 28% compared to those receiving diuretic or digoxin therapy (p <0.05). Using a dynamic model, the dose required to achieve 90% to 95% of the theoretical maximum ACE inhibitor effect exceeded 100 mg enalapril daily. Thus, CHF readmission rates are lower when daily ACE inhibitor doses exceed 5 mg enalapril or the equivalent daily, but are unaffected by digoxin or diuretic. Modeled maximum ACE inhibitor benefits require doses 8- to 10-fold higher than current usage patterns.", 
    "862": "This study tested whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril can improve the insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in uremia. Fifteen uremic hypertensive patients were treated with benazepril in a dose of 10-20 mg per day for ten weeks, and ten healthy subjects, matched in age, sex ratio and body mass index (BMI), served as the control group. Before and after the treatment, an oral 75 g glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin release test (IRT) were performed in two groups above, and the blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations at 0, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after glucose load were examined, and the insulin glycoregulatory activity, including insulin sensitivity index (ISI), glucose uptake rate (M), total areas under the glucose and insulin curves during OGTTs (AUCG AUCINS), was calculated. The changes of serum potassium and renal function before and after treatment were observed. It showed that (1) benazepril could reduce blood pressure significantly (SBP decreased from 174.8 +/- 12.0 mmHg to 151.5 +/- 9.0 mmHg, p <0.001; DBP decreased from 108.0 +/- 8.2 mmHg to 95.3 +/- 9.0 mmHg, p <0.001). The total response rate was 86.7%. (2) After treatment with benazepril for ten weeks, the blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations after glucose load and AUCG, AUCINS values in the uremic patients were significantly lower than before treatment, but were still significantly higher than in the controls. The values of ISI and M in the uremic patients after treatment were much higher than before treatment, but were still significantly lower than in the control subjects. (3) The differences of serum potassium and creatinine levels before and after treatment were not significant. These findings indicate that benazepril can not only reduce blood pressure effectively and safely, but also partly improve insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance in uremia.", 
    "863": "Patients with end-stage liver disease usually show a hyperdynamic circulatory state. It has previously been reported that patients who develop myocardial depression in the early post-liver transplantation period are more prone to organ failure and death. We reviewed the records of 754 adult patients undergoing liver transplantation at our institution and identified 7 patients who initially showed hyperdynamic circulation, but then developed reversible dilated cardiomyopathy in the early posttransplantation period. All identifiable causes of cardiac dysfunction, such as myocardial ischemia, thyroid dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances, were excluded. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from a preoperative median baseline of 60% to 20% (P = .02), with four-chamber dilatation on echocardiogram. All these patients required supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, afterload reduction, inotropic support, and monitoring in the intensive care unit. Cardiac function subsequently improved in all patients, with ejection fraction increasing to a median of 50%. All patients were discharged from the hospital. At a median follow-up of 15 months, there was no recurrence of heart failure. The increased peripheral resistance seen after successful liver transplantation may be an important causative factor.", 
    "864": "To investigate whether renal endothelin (ET)-1 participates in water and sodium handling, we investigated the influence of different sodium intakes on renal production of ET-1 in eight healthy subjects. The functional relationship with the renin-angiotensin system was also studied. Renal ET-1 formation is affected by sodium intake, because 1 wk of high sodium decreased urinary ET-1 excretion (-34%, P < 0.05), whereas a low-sodium diet increased ET-1 excretion (66%, P < 0.05) and mRNA expression for preproendothelin-1 in epithelial cells of medullary collecting ducts and endothelial cells of the peritubular capillary network. Increased ET-1 renal synthesis was associated with sodium retention and increased free water clearance. Urinary ET-1 excretion changes from normal to low-sodium diet were negatively related to contemporary changes in sodium excretion (r = 0.97, P < 0.05) and were positively correlated with free water clearance (r = 0.97, P < 0.05). These correlations were maintained during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, which only partially reduced ET-1 renal excretion. These results indicate that renal ET-1 production is indeed modulated by varying sodium intakes and may exert a role in sodium and water handling."
