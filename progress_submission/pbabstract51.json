Several factors have been found to contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis present in diabetic patients. These include hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, impaired fibrinolysis, increased platelet aggregation, and dysfunctional arterial remodeling. The evidence supports that a healthy lifestyle, statin drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aspirin can modify these factors and slow the atherosclerosis process observed in type 2 diabetes. Because of the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes, early cardiac testing is indicated. The optimal strategy for coronary revascularization in diabetic patients remains controversial and is discussed in detail in this review.",

Two hundred twenty-nine Cavalier King Charles (CKC) Spaniels with MR attributable to MVD but no signs of CHF were randomly allocated to treatment with enalapril 0.25-0.5 mg daily (n = 116) or to placebo groups (n = 113). Each dog was evaluated by physical examination, electrocardiography, and thoracic radiography at entry and every 12 months (+/-30 days). The number of dogs developing heart failure was similar in the treatment and placebo groups (n = 50 [43%] and n = 48 [42%], respectively; P = .99). The estimated means, adjusted for censored observations, for the period from initiation of therapy to heart failure were 1,150 +/- 50 days for dogs in the treatment group and 1,130 +/- 50 days for dogs in the placebo group (P = .85). When absence or presence of cardiomegaly at the entrance of the trial was considered, there were still no differences between the treatment and placebo groups (P = .98 and .51, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that enalapril had no significant effect on the time from initiation of therapy to heart failure (P = .86). Long-term treatment with enalapril in asymptomatic dogs with MVD and MR did not delay the onset of heart failure regardless of whether or not cardiomegaly was present at initiation of the study.", 
    "8": "The reduction in blood pressure seen with the use of beta-blocking drugs was an unexpected finding. Initially there was resistance to their use as the reduction of cardiac output and increase in peripheral resistance from beta-blockade was considered an undesirable pharmacological action for a drug in the treatment of hypertension. However, beta-blockers have now become established in the treatment of hypertension and have been recommended as a first line choice in various guidelines, although their exact mode of action remains a matter for debate. In broad terms beta-blocking drugs are at least of similar efficacy to the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. They may be usefully combined with other anti-hypertensives, as is often required. There is some evidence that the beta-1 selective agents are more efficacious than the non-selective beta-blockers. Notwithstanding some observations to the contrary beta-blockers are often effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly and in black patients; the combination of being elderly and black, however, appears to result in a reduced fall in blood pressure. If they are given early in pregnancy they lead to a low birth weight. Co-existant disease may influence the choice of a beta-blocker to treat hypertension. Beta-blockers are valuable agents in ischaemic heart disease, notably the control of chronic angina pectoris and to improve prognosis post-myocardial infarction. While initial dose titration has to be extremely careful, heart failure is now a strong indication for the use of a beta-blocker, as prognosis is much improved. Diabetes should no longer be regarded as a contra-indication to the use of a beta-1 selective agent. Recent work confirms that beta-blockers should be given to patients undergoing surgery who have a high cardiac risk. Outcome studies suggest overall that in younger patients beta-blockers reduce the incidence of strokes and myocardial infarction. There is no convincing evidence of a difference between the ACE inhibitor captopril and the combination of diuretic and a beta-blocker. In high risk patients, i.e. those with diabetes, no difference was seen between captopril and atenolol. Diuretics may result in better outcome measurements in the elderly compared to beta-blockade but in combination, \"conventional treatment\" is as effective in terms of total mortality, strokes and myocardial infarction as ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. Co-existant asthma remains an important contraindication to beta-blockade, but not chronic obstructive airways disease where a beta-blocker should be used with caution if it is indicated, e.g. post-infarction. Quality of life measurements, at least with beta-1 selective agents compare favourably with other anti-hypertensive drugs. Beta-blockers, without partial agonist activity, should not be stopped abruptly, particularly in patients with, or at high risk of, co-existant ischaemic disease because of the danger of post-beta-blockade cardiac sympathetic hypersensitivity; alternatively bed rest should be instituted to reduce the risk of sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "9": "The discovery of the kinin system is not recent, but its study in clinical field has been done only in the last years. This system is composed by substrates (kininogens) and plasma and tissue kallikreins are the specific activators of these substrates producing two vasoactive peptides called bradykinin and kallidin. The biologic effects of kinins are mediated by specific receptors called B1 and B2. The activation of this system is particularly important in blood pressure regulation and in inflammatory reactions. The kinin system is involved in many clinical situations including respiratory allergic reactions, septic shock, hypertension and its treatment, hypotensive transfusion reactions, heart diseases, pancreatitis, hereditary and acquired angioedema, Alzheimer's disease and liver cirrhosis with ascites. The study of the kinin system in clinical field, which had been limited by methodological difficulties, has now received an important stimulus by the recent availability of specific and sensitive methods of dosage.", 
    "10": "The Reduction in End Points in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study and the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) are two recently reported trials with hard end points, conducted in patients in advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy. Two other studies--the Irbesartan Microalbuminuria Study (IRMA)-2 and the Microalbuminuria Reduction with Valsartan study (MARVAL)--were trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria, a cardiovascular risk factor associated with early-stage diabetic nephropathy. These trials all had a common theme--that is, does an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) interfere with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy in a blood pressure-independent fashion? Without question, the results of these trials legitimatize the use of the ARB class in forestalling the deterioration in renal function, which is almost inevitable in the patient with untreated diabetic nephropathy. These data can now be added to the vast array of evidence supporting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use in patients with nephropathy associated with type 1 diabetes. It now appears a safe conclusion that the patient with diabetic nephropathy should receive therapy with an agent that interrupts the renin-angiotensin system. These studies have not resolved the question as to whether an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is the preferred agent in people with nephropathy from type 1 diabetes, though the optimal doses of these drugs remain to be determined. Head-to-head studies comparing ACE inhibitors to ARBs in diabetic nephropathy are not likely to occur, so it is unlikely that comparable information will be forthcoming with ACE inhibitors. An evidence-based therapeutic approach derived from these trials would argue for ARBs to be the foundation of therapy in the patient with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.", 
    "11": "The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between psychological characteristics and responses to antihypertensive drug therapy. Twenty-two hypertensive subjects underwent psychological evaluation and treatment with 1) a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ); 2) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril; and 3) combined alpha + beta blockade (doxazosin + betaxolol). Anger-Out scores on the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory were positively correlated with the HCTZ-induced fall in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01); Anger-In was negatively correlated with the quinapril-induced fall in systolic pressure (p<0.05). The target systolic blood pressure (130 mm Hg) was achieved with either HCTZ or quinapril in 79% of subjects without, vs. 25% of subjects with, childhood trauma (p=0.03). Responses to doxazosin + betaxolol were not correlated with psychological characteristics. The authors conclude that both inhibited anger expression and childhood trauma are associated with reduced response to a diuretic or ACE inhibitor. Combined alpha/beta blockade may be preferable to an ACE inhibitor or diuretic in treating selected hypertensive patients. Further studies should include examination of psychological factors in terms of the response to combined ACE inhibitor + diuretic therapy.", 
    "12": "AIM:To assess the effect of ACE inhibitor and Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist in preventing hepatic fibrosis caused by CCl(4) administration in rats;to investigate whether or not there are expression of AT 1 receptors on hepatic stellate cells; and to observe the effect of Ang II on proliferation and ECM synthesis of cultured HSCs.METHODS:Studies were conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Except for the hepatofibrotic model group and the control group, in three treated groups, either enalapril (5mg/kg), or losartan (10mg/kg), or enalapril + losartan were given to the fibrotic rats by daily gavage, and saline vehicle was given to model and normal control rats. After 6 weeks, liver fibrosis was assessed directly by hepatic morphometric analysis, which has been considered the gold standard for the quantification of fibrosis. The expressions of AT 1 receptors and (alpha-mooth muscle actin,alpha-SMA) in liver tissue or isolated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were detected by immunohistochemical techniques. The effect of Ang II on HSC proliferation was determined by MTT method. Effect of Ang II on collagen synthesis of HSCs was determined by (3)H-proline incorporation.RESULTS:Contrasted to the fibrosis in rats of the model group, groups of rats treated with either enalapril or losartan, or a combination of two drugs showed a limited expansion of the interstitium (4.23 plus minus 3.70 vs 11.22 plus minus 4.79, P<0.05), but no difference was observed among three treated groups (5.38 plus minus3.43, 4.96 plus minus 2.96, 4.23 plus minus 2.70, P>0.05). Expression of AT 1 receptors was found in fibrotic interstitium of fibrotic rats, whereas in normal control rats they were limited to vasculature only to a very slight degree. AT 1 receptors were also expressed on activated HSCs in the culture. At concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5)mol/L, Ang II stimulated HSC proliferation in culture in a dose dependent manner. Increasing Ang II concentrations produced corresponding increases in (3)H-proline incorporation. Differences among groups were significant.CONCLUSION:Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT 1 blocker may slow the progression of hepatic fibrosis;activated HSCs express AT 1 receptors, and Ang II can stimulate the proliferation and collagen synthesis of HSCs in a dose-dependent manner; and activation of RAS may be related to hepatic fibrogenesis induced by CCl(4).",

Overall, blood pressure decrease was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in RI throughout the study. However, despite similar blood pressure reduction, the two regimens showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with a significant decrease in both UAE (33.8 +/- 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 +/- 2.1 at 24 months, p < 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 +/- 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 +/- 0.04 at 24 months, p < 0.05) while nifedipine GITS did not significantly influence UAE (35.7 +/- 12.2 at baseline and 31.2 +/- 12.1 at 24 months, n.s.) or RI (0.61 +/- 0.01 at baseline and 0.59 +/- 0.02 at 24 months, n.s.).", 
    "17": "Effective blood pressure control over a long period of time reduces the severity of organ damage, namely UAE while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential hypertension.

    "18": "A broad spectrum of renal changes is observed in patients with sickle cell anemia, and ideal therapeutic measures for the management of these alterations are still being studied. Affected patients have deficient urinary concentration and potassium excretion. Perhaps owing to a compensatory mechanism, the proximal tubules are in a condition of \"hyperfunction\", with increased sodium and phosphorus reabsorption and greater creatinine and uric acid secretion. Mild tubular acidosis may be present. No treatment has been reported for these tubular changes, except for care in the maintenance of hydration. The use of anti-inflammatory drugs is being studied in order to inhibit the prostaglandins involved in the process. Increased renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and filtration fraction are frequent findings. Hematuria commonly occurs as a consequence of red blood cell sickling in the renal medulla, papillary necrosis, or even renal medullary carcinoma. Measures such as increased fluid ingestion, urine alkalinization and, if necessary, administration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid and certain invasive procedures have been proposed to treat hematuria. Nephropathy in patients with sickle cell anemia can be manifested by proteinuria and, more rarely, nephrotic syndrome. Drugs such as prednisone and cyclophosphamide are ineffective for the treatment of patients with nephrotic syndrome. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors decrease proteinuria, but their long-term effect in preventing the progression of glomerular disease has not been established. Chronic renal failure, although infrequent, may be one of the manifestations of this disease. Hemodialysis and transplantation are satisfactory therapeutic options for patients with end-stage renal disease.", 
    "19": "Quinapril is rapidly de-esterified after absorption to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Quinapril produces favourable haemodynamic changes, and improves ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular disorders; these effects are mediated through the binding of quinaprilat to both tissue and plasma ACE. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day provided effective blood pressure control in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials, but some patients required dosages of 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. In general, quinapril provided similar blood pressure control to other standard antihypertensive therapies including other ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in comparative clinical trials. Combined therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug as monotherapy in two well designed studies. Quinapril has also been shown to reduce microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. In patients with congestive heart failure, quinapril <or=40 mg/day produced beneficial haemodynamic and echocardiographic changes and improved exercise tolerance, symptoms and functional class. Effects of quinapril on survival have not been investigated, but quinapril 10 to 20 mg/day showed comparable efficacy to captopril 25 to 50mg twice daily in two well designed trials. In patients with coronary artery disease, quinapril 40 mg/day significantly reduced the incidence of ischaemic events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a well controlled study (n = 148). However, a lower dosage of quinapril (20 mg/day) showed no effect on ischaemic events or atherosclerotic progression with 3 years of treatment in a similarly designed study involving 1750 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. The tolerability of quinapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. In placebo-controlled trials, cough occurred in 2 and 4.3% and hypotension occurred in <1 and 2.9% of quinapril recipients with hypertension or congestive heart failure, respectively. No increase in adverse events was observed when the dosage was increased from 10 to 40 mg/day.",

    "21": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) are largely responsible for the increased cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. This review discusses the pathophysiology of CHF, the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension is an important cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes may be responsible for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, while hypertension may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes that are found. Experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the biochemical and ultrastructural changes seen. The role of insulin to reverse both metabolic and structural changes is reviewed both from experimental data and with the limited amount of clinical data available. The therapy of CHF in patients with diabetes is similar to that of patients without diabetes, with therapy directed toward the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As the morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies have pointed out the importance of this subgroup where the opportunity to make a significant clinical impact exists. A significant opportunity exists to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors when ischaemia and CHF are both present. However, studies in patients diabetes have been limited to post hoc subgroup analyses and rarely as predefined subgroups. Clinical trials involving patients with diabetes with and without hypertension and LV dysfunction are clearly needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high risk subgroup.",

The patients with acute phase of TA initially received typical immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone in monotherapy or combined with azatioprine or cyclophosphamide), followed by chronic administration of prednisone.

In the observed group hypertension was effectively controlled with 2-3 hypotensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, diuretics and Ca antagonists. The acute phase of TA was diagnosed in 11 patients and it was treated successfully (except one case) with immunosuppressive therapy. After discontinuation of the treatment (4 patients) progression of the disease was observed.

Since omapatrilat and two of the metabolites are sulfhydryl-containing compounds, methyl acrylate was used to stabilize these compounds in human blood and plasma samples. Methyl acrylate reacted instantly with the sulfhydryl group to form a derivative that was stable in blood and plasma.

Albutensin A delayed gastric emptying and elevated blood glucose levels. Although albutensin A showed low affinity for bombesin receptor, it decreased food intake in bombesin receptor knockout mice, indicating that its inhibitory effect on feeding was not mediated through bombesin receptor. Then, we investigated whether the albutensin A-induced decrease in food intake was mediated by complement C3a and C5a receptors, because albutensin A had affinities for these receptors. Des-Arg-albutensin A, lacking affinity for C3a and C5a receptors, did not inhibit food intake. We found for the first time that centrally administered C3a (10-100 pmol/mouse) by itself decreased food intake in fasted mice. In contrast, C5a increased food intake after central injection. Based on these results, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of albutensin A on food intake is mediated through the C3a receptor.", 
    "36": "Among the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, hypertension is the most powerful and treatable. For an asymptomatic patient to remain on a lifetime of antihypertensive treatment that might cause adverse effects is difficult for most patients. Managed care plans should treat hypertensive patients in ways that the patient can remain on therapy to prevent complications and thereby reduce the long-term costs associated with untreated hypertension. The recent disappointing outcomes achieved with antihypertensive drugs suggest there is room for improvement in the management of hypertension. Since the introduction of the first orally active angiotensin II receptor blocking drug, losartan, attention has been focused on the central role of angiotensin II in hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Studies of angiotensin II antagonists (AIIAs), which block the tissue receptor for angiotensin II, show that these agents effectively control hypertension when given once daily and cause no significant adverse effects or laboratory abnormalities. Losartan is unique among the AIIAs in that it offers 1-step titration dosing and has a uricosuric effect. Losartan, candesartan, and valsartan have been shown to improve the symptoms of congestive heart failure; losartan has been similar to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure mortality. At 1 year, the refill rate for losartan in a managed care setting has been more than that for any other class of antihypertensive agents. Although there is not yet a clinical trial determining the long term mortality of AIIA treatment in hypertension compared with other antihypertensive agents, the use of AIIAs in conjunction with lifestyle modification and patient education can provide more efficient hypertension control and a provide a treatment with which patients can live.",

A greater percentage of patients treated with an AIIA (losartan) stayed on therapy from 12 to 48 months compared with patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (67.4% vs 60.7% at 12 months, P < 0.01; 50.9% vs 46.5% at 48 months, P = 0.095), calcium antagonists (67.4% vs 54.1% at 12 months, P < 0.01; 50.9% vs 40.7% at 48 months, P < 0.03), beta-blockers (67.4% vs 45.6% at 12 months, P < 0.01; 50.9% vs 34.7% at 48 months, P < 0.03), or thiazide diuretics (67.4% vs 20.8% at 12 months, P < 0.01; 50.9% vs 16.4% at 48 months, P < 0.03). The percentage of patients staying on AIIA therapy from 12 months to 48 months was statistically greater (P < 0.001) than the percentage of patients staying on therapy with other antihypertensive drug classes.", 
    "41": "This analysis supports the observation that initiation of antihylertensive therapy with an AIIA such as losartan results in a greater persistence rate over a 4-year period than does therapy with any other antihypertensive class. These findings may have important implications for blood pressure control, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and health care resource utilization.", 
    "42": "Derangements of the three endothelium-related vasodilator systems (prostaglandins, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor(s) and nitric oxide) cause the endothelial dysfunction observed in hypertension. Free radical-induced nitric oxide degradation plays a crucial role in hypertension. An increase in superoxide producing enzymes such as NAD(P)H oxidase and xanthine oxidase has been demonstrated. Superoxide dismutase may correct endothelial dysfunction in vitro and superoxide dismutase mimetics can lower blood pressure in experimental animals. Antioxidant agents and xanthine oxidase-inhibiting compounds have been used in humans. In addition, the synthesis of vasoconstrictor peroxides derived from the activity of cyclooxygenase in the endothelium and the vascular smooth muscle is stimulated by the OH. radical. Hydrogen peroxide levels are augmented in hypertension, but its role is unclear because recent investigations have shown that this substance may act as a hyperpolarizing factor. It is thought that the therapeutic benefit of anti-hypertensive drugs, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, could be in part due to an inhibition of free radical production. A role of superoxide in the endothelial dysfunction and hypertension of chronic renal failure has also been suggested by recent animal experiments.", 
    "43": "There is a paucity of trials that specifically evaluate the benefits of cardiovascular risk reduction therapies in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We therefore sought to describe the data supporting the use of therapies for lowering cardiovascular risk, preventing ischemic events, as well as managing intermittent claudication, in these patients. A search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials in peripheral arterial disease was conducted using Medline and reference lists of relevant articles. These trials served as the primary sources of data and treatment recommendations, while observational studies and case series were included as sources of commonly accepted treatment recommendations that were not fully supported by the randomized trial. Data from the primary sources support the use of antiplatelet therapy and, potentially, of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, for preventing ischemic events. In contrast, the evidence demonstrates a nonsignificant trend for treating dyslipidemia to prevent mortality and does not specifically support intensive glycemic control in persons with diabetes or estrogen use in these patients. However, observational data and data derived from trials in persons with other manifestations of cardiovascular disease may be generalized to support the importance of treating key risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Data supporting the use of estrogen to reduce cardiovascular risk are less clear. Studies do demonstrate improvement in walking ability resulting from exercise rehabilitation programs, as well as from use of cilostazol and, to a more modest degree, pentoxifylline. The consensus is to treat risk factors of peripheral arterial disease patients similarly to patients with other manifestations of atherosclerosis and to use exercise rehabilitation or cilostazol to treat the subset of patients with claudication.", 
    "44": "Alterations in the function and structure of the blood vessel wall account for most clinical events in the coronary and cerebrovascular circulation such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular drugs may exert beneficial effects on the vascular wall both at the level of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, endothelial mediators, in particular nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET), are of special interest. Drugs can modulate the expression and actions of NO, a vasodilator with antiproliferative and antithrombotic properties, and of ET, a potent vasoconstrictor and proliferative mitogenic agent. The most successful drugs in this context are statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. While statins increase the expression of NO synthase. ACE-inhibitors increase the release of NO via bradykinin-mediated mechanisms. Antioxidant properties of drugs are also important, as oxidative stress is crucial in atherosclerotic vascular disease. These properties may explain part of the effects of calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors. Indeed, angiotensin II stimulates NAD(P)H oxidases responsible for the formation of superoxide, which inactivates NO. ACE-Inhibitors thus increase the bioavailability of NO. Newer cardiovascular drugs such as nebivolol are able to directly stimulate NO release from the endothelium both in isolated arteries and in the human forearm circulation. ET receptor antagonists may exert beneficial effects in the vessel wall by preventing the effects of ET at its receptors and by reducing ET production. In summary, cardiovascular drugs have important effects on the vessel wall, which may be clinically relevant for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "45": "Hypertension is common and increases the risk of death from coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disease. The reason for treating hypertension is to prevent the long-term complications of this disorder. Many studies of antihypertensive therapy have produced only modest reductions in coronary events; in particular, with the use of beta-blockers. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown a lesser effect of these drugs on primary prevention of coronary events, cardiovascular and total mortality with respect to other antihypertensive approaches based on the use of low-dose diuretic therapy, especially in the elderly, even if the reduction of stroke and heart failure (HF) were similar. New beta-blockers with vasodilating properties due to the capacity to enhance the release of endothelial nitric oxide, then lessening a contributory mechanism to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as endothelial damage and dysfunction, seem to possess considerable potential in the treatment of hypertension, particularly in terms of improvement of cardiovascular outcome of patients. In HF, there is now considerable interest in the therapeutic use of beta-blockade. Some recent clinical trials have demonstrated conclusive evidence of the beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy on survival in chronic HF. As a result of these data, beta-blocker therapy has become part of standard therapy for patients with chronic HF, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and diuretics. The treatment is, in general, well tolerated. There are, however, some unanswered questions. One is whether some beta-blockers may be better than others. The major mortality benefit is probably a class-effect of beta1-adrenoceptor blockade, but the differences between beta-blockers might be clinically relevant. For example, it is under debate whether ancillary properties of some beta-blockers, such as the capability of exerting antioxidant effects or enhancing the nitric oxide production, may contribute to the clinical effects of these drugs. Future clinical trials will report over the next few years and help to answer the question about differences in mortality effects among types of beta-blocking agents, thus correctly defining the precise role of these drugs in the wide spectrum of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "46": "Despite the use of antihypertensive drugs, mortality (but not morbidity) from cerebrovascular diseases has been reduced significantly. As a consequence, an increasing number of patients suffer from recurring strokes and from the debilitating consequences of cerebrovascular diseases and develop progressive cognitive impairment. Its pathological substrates are regional alteration of cerebral perfusion, lacunae, white matter lesions, progressive cortical atrophy, even in the asymptomatic patient and in the absence of extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Lacunar infarction and white matter lesions are particularly frequent in the hypertensive diabetic patient. Lacunae and white matter lesions sometimes coexist and may favour the development of dementia in the hypertensive patient, through focal ischaemia, perivascular oedema, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral diaschisis and cortical deafferentation. Treatment with calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics smooth the patchy hypoperfusion despite the fall in pressure. However, the time course and the extent of this effect vary according to the drug administered. In particular, only a calcium channel blocker increased perfusion of both cortical and subcortical areas, while diuretic treatment increased perfusion only after prolonged treatment, and this effect was limited to the cortical areas. Such differences may explain the discrepant results on risk reduction for dementia observed in large intervention trials.", 
    "47": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) are important in the aetiology of hypertension and the pathogenesis of cardiac and renal damage associated with elevated blood pressure. While angiotensin II acts by increasing blood pressure and supporting end-organ damage, kinins have an opposite protective effect. The two systems interact on many levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activates angiotensins and inactivates kinins. ACE inhibitors therefore exert their organ-protective action via both systems, as they block the deleterious RAS and potentiate the protective KKS. Furthermore, ACE may directly interact with the kinin B2 receptor and ACE inhibitors, thereby eliciting a resensitization of this receptor following agonist-induced desensitization. Recently, a functional heterodimer of AT1 and B2 receptors has also been demonstrated. Moreover, kallikreins may be involved in the activation of prorenin and in the signalling pathway of angiotensin AT2 receptors. Because of the multitude of interactions, any therapeutic intervention into one of the two peptide systems will automatically lead to an alteration in the other. This double action is utilized by drugs such as ACE inhibitors to provide unprecedented effectiveness in hypertension and associated cardiac and renal damage.", 
    "48": "Acute and chronic administrations of L-arginine analogues are associated with renal functional and structural alterations that can be prevented or reversed by pharmacological blockade of other vasoactive systems. When given acutely, L-arginine derivatives have an antinatriuretic effect that is overridden by elevation of perfusion pressure and both endothelin and angiotensin II play an important role in the systemic and renal haemodynamic alterations associated with impaired nitric oxide availability. Long-term administration of L-arginine derivatives, mainly NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), resulted in hypertension, intrarenal vascular, tubular and glomerular lesions and reduction in renal function. In prevention studies, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system markedly reduced hypertension and the renal morphological alterations associated with L-NAME administration. Although improvement in renal function may be achieved when arterial pressure is fully controlled, several reports indicate that the L-NAME-induced renal structural changes were independent of blood pressure and at least partly mediated by endothelin. In intervention studies, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system decreased but did not completely normalize arterial pressure, improved renal function and normalized albuminuria. Both the renin-angiotensin and the sympathetic nervous systems contribute to the sustained phase of chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition, the adrenergic component being prominent with time. L-NAME hypertension can also be reversed by calcium antagonists, possibly via inhibition of angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, and the T-type antagonist had a greater effect than the L-type antagonist in reducing pre-glomerular resistance. The rat model of hypertension induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide generation has provided a useful tool to study both the development and the treatment of renal lesions resembling those found in human hypertension, a disease associated with early generalized impairment of endothelial function.", 
    "49": "Heart failure is unique among the major cardiovascular disorders in that it alone is increasing in prevalence while there has been a striking decrease in other conditions. Some of this can be attributed to the aging of the U.S. and European populations. The ability to salvage patients with myocardial damage is also a major factor, as these patients may develop progression of left ventricular dysfunction due to deleterious remodelling of the heart. This process involves structural and conformational changes in the heart characterized by pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis. The net effect is deterioration in cardiac function and the onset of heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is known to be a major factor in promoting cardiac remodelling. Increased neurohormone levels systemically and within the heart lead to increased load on the heart. Many neurohormones involved also directly act as growth factors on cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Due to its central role in remodelling, neurohormonal activation has emerged as an inviting target for therapeutic interventions. The use of agents to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems has been shown to inhibit (and sometimes even reverse) cardiac remodelling and to improve the clinical course of patients with cardiac dysfunction. Neurohormonal activation is known to be widespread and there is evidence that additional agents such as endothelin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) may be involved in the remodelling process. Clinical trials evaluating the effects of blocking these agents are currently under way and should soon provide important information about therapy.", 
    "50": "The results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and of several experimental studies have indicated that excess aldosterone detrimentally affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by acting through both classical and non-classical mineralocorticoid receptors. The effects mediated through classical mineralocorticoid receptors entail enhanced sodium and water reabsorption, potassium loss and hypokalaemia, congestion, increased vascular resistance and hypertension. Those occurring through non-classical mineralocorticoid receptors located on myofibroblasts comprise cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which may be due to a direct effect of aldosterone on collagen synthesis. Data obtained in primary aldosteronism patients demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as changes in left ventricular filling that can be accounted for by cardiac fibrosis. Available clinical data indicate that in a considerable proportion of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aldosterone secretion can escape from blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, thus suggesting that additional mechanisms, besides angiotensin II, can play an important role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion. Compelling evidence indicates that endothelin (ET)-1 is overtly increased in severe CHF and thus is a likely candidate for the aldosterone 'escape' phenomenon in CHF. Endothelin-1 is expressed in the adrenal cortex, together with its receptor subtypes A (ETA) and B (ETB), and directly stimulates aldosterone secretion in different species, in humans by acting via both ETA and ETB receptor subtypes. Moreover, we have recently found that the novel endothelin peptide ET-1 (1-31), by acting as an ETA agonist, can also be involved in the regulation of growth of the adrenal cortex, as well as in the pathogenesis of Conn's adenoma. In this paper, we review the findings suggesting a relationship between activation of the ET-1 system, enhanced aldosterone secretion and cardiac fibrosis and discuss the implications of endothelin antagonism for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "51": "Pharmacological antagonism of the endothelin system presents a novel target for the treatment of a range of cardiovascular diseases. The antagonists developed so far differ in their endothelin receptor subtype specificity. Indeed, at present there is no consensus opinion as to what level of receptor selectivity defines a particular antagonist as 'selective' or 'mixed'. Antagonists that are highly selective for the endothelin A receptor (ETA) receptor subtype have a number of hypothetical advantages over non-selective antagonists. This theory is based on the analysis of the function of the endothelin B (ETB) receptor. Current evidence suggests that activation of the ETB receptor results in vasodilatation, diuresis and natriuresis, each of which are properties that might be advantageous to maintain in conditions such as cardiac failure and hypertension. However, definitive evidence to suggest a therapeutic advantage of selective ETA receptor antagonists requires long-term, head-to-head studies to be performed.", 
    "52": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin. In atherosclerosis, the delicate balance between endothelium-derived factors is disturbed. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived nitric oxide, which exerts vasodilating, antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects, and inhibits leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall. Besides its blood pressure increasing effect in man, endothelin also induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The derangement of endothelial function in atherosclerosis is likely to be caused in part by genetic factors, but is also due to cardiovascular risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis is crucial for the development of the disease process in the vasculature and is therefore an important therapeutic target. However, the efficacy of pharmacotherapy aimed at an improvement in endothelial function depends on the individual risk factor profile of the patient.", 
    "53": "Atherosclerosis, a chronic systemic disease of the vasculature with an inflammatory component, is the primary cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Impairment of vascular endothelial cell function in atherosclerosis and in conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk are important determinants of disease progression. Reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in the coronary and systemic circulation due to decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and increased release of oxygen-derived free radicals promotes the adhesion of leukocytes, thrombosis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and increases in vascular tone. In addition to decreases in bioactive NO, enhanced production of the 21-amino acid peptide endothelin-1 contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis. This paper discusses mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to improving endothelial pathways in atherosclerosis. Restoration of endothelium-derived NO bioactivity through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, the endothelin system, or statin therapy improves vascular function in experimental hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and heart failure. These treatments may also have therapeutic benefit for patients at risk or with overt atherosclerosis, and are likely to reduce vascular and myocardial complications of this disease.", 
    "54": "This paper discusses the role of endothelial dysfunction in human hypertension, especially in relation to small resistance artery structure, as well as the effects of anti-hypertensive drugs on endothelial function of small arteries in human and experimental hypertension. A significant impairment of endothelial function was observed in human essential hypertension as well as in secondary forms of hypertension. No correlation was observed with vascular structure. In animal models of genetic hypertension there is substantial evidence for a beneficial effect of anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium entry blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers on endothelial function in small resistance arteries. A significant improvement in endothelial dysfunction may be observed in hypertensive patients after prolonged treatment with ACE inhibitors (cilazapril, lisinopril), calcium entry blockers (nifedipine), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (losartan), while atenolol and hydrochlorotiazide proved to be ineffective in this regard despite similar blood pressure reductions. We conclude that: (i) the development of hypertension is usually associated with the presence of endothelial dysfunction in small resistance arteries of essential hypertensive patients; (ii) vascular structure does not seem to be the major determinant of endothelial function, at least in subcutaneous small resistance arteries; (iii) anti-hypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and calcium entry blockers may improve endothelial function; (iv) a decrease in blood pressure seems to be necessary but not sufficient to obtain a beneficial effect on the endothelium in humans.", 
    "55": "We examined whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) prevent isoproterenol (ISO)-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dogs. The effects of a large dose of ISO, 1 microg/kg/min, 3 h infusion, were investigated in three groups with simultaneous infusion of an ACE inhibitor (quinaprilat), ARB (candesartan) or saline. ISO infusion significantly decreased LV dP/dt, LV ejection fraction and LV fractional shortening, and significantly increased tau, the time constant of isovolume relaxation of LV, and LV end diastolic pressure. All of these changes were significantly attenuated in both the ACE inhibitor and ARB groups, especially in the ARB group. Serum levels of creatinin kinase isoform MB, lactate dehydrogenase and lipid peroxide were significantly increased by ISO. However, the increases in these markers of myocardial damage were significantly diminished by simultaneous infusion of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, especially by ARB. In conclusion, an ACE inhibitor and ARB prevent LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as myocardial damage induced by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "56": "The cardioprotective effects of quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied in a rat model of heart failure. Twenty-six rats were divided into two groups: one given 20 mg/kg/day quinapril (n = 11), and controls given 0.5% methylcellulose (n = 15). After oral administration for 1 month, quinapril reduced heart weight (from 1.28+/-0.05 to 0.87+/-0.02 g; p < 0.05) without changing body weight. Quinapril lowered left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 14.1+/-2.0 to 6.6+/-1.5 mmHg; p < 0.05) and central venous pressure (from 2.7+/-0.9 to 0.7+/-0.4 mmHg), and increased +/- dP/dt (from +2409+/-50 to +3569+/-169 mmHg/s, and from -2318+/-235 to -3960+/-203 mmHg/s; both p < 0.01). The area of myocardial fibrosis was markedly reduced by quinapril (6+/-3%) as compared with controls (29+/-6%; p < 0.01). Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA was markedly increased in controls as compared with age-matched normal rats. The increase in level of TGF-beta1 mRNA was significantly suppressed by quinapril (from 17.1+/-6.2 to 9.00+/-2.40; p < 0.05). These observations indicated that quinapril has cardioprotective effects on heart failure, and that the beneficial effects may be partly explained by attenuation of fibrotic response through suppression of TGF-beta1 mRNA expression.", 
    "57": "Plaque disruption promoted by local inflammation and oxidative stress seems to be the triggering mechanisms of acute coronary syndromes. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) play a key role in the inflammatory process. Within the inflammatory region, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) accumulation has been described, leading to enhanced production of angiotensin II which stimulates adhesion molecule formation and increases oxidative stress. According to recent clinical trials, drugs like statins or ACE inhibitors seem promising and could stabilize the plaque, probably by attenuation of the inflammatory process. Finally, as thrombus formation also plays a role in these acute coronary syndromes, another approach is the use of antithrombotic therapy.", 
    "58": "Sudden cardiac death describes the unexpected natural death from cardiac cause within a short time period from the onset of symptoms (usually one hour) in a person without any prior condition that would appear fatal. The mechanism is generally a malignant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). Sudden death is a major public health problem as it accounts for 3 to 400,000 deaths annually in the United States. Risk factors, physiopathological mechanisms, disease states associated with sudden death, and primary and secondary prevention treatments are reviewed.", 
    "59": "Medical therapy for chronic heart failure has recently been extensively revised on the basis of a reduction of mortality in randomized trials. However, there are almost no available trials in children whose treatment for heart failure is adapted from what is known in adults. Digitalis play a role in heart rate variability but there is no evidence for an effect on mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lead to an improvement of left ventricular function and reduces mortality; in addition, they are well tolerated in children. Diuretics are useful in congestive heart failure but chronic administration may have deleterious effects. Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms and the ejection fraction; however, they must be given cautiously and the up-titration phase must be very progressive. New promising drugs are emerging (calcium sensitizers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, angiotensin receptor [AT1] blockers) but at the present time their use in chronic heart failure has not proven to be efficient.", 
    "60": "Until recently, no morbidity-mortality study had examined the effects of \"newer\" drugs, like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and alpha-blockers compared to \"old\", but well-proven, thiazide diuretics, and beta-blockers in the treatment of essential hypertension. The prospective and randomised clinical trials, CAPPP, STOP-2, NORDIL, INSIGHT, and one arm of ALLHAT, with a total of about 58,000 middle-aged or elderly hypertensive patients have now been published. The primary outcome, composite cardiovascular (CV) death, cerebral stroke, and myocardial infarction, or composite fatal coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, was the same, irrespective of the drug in all trials. Thus, prevention of CV complications depends on the lowering of blood pressure with well-tolerated medication, irrespective of class.",

For estimation of the pore size we employed a new method, tissue negative staining. In diabetic rats, enlarged pores and decreased numbers of anionic sites of GBM were observed. Both insulin treatment and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevented these changes. The renoprotective effect of the two drugs is discussed in the article.",

    "64": "PEPT2 immunoreactivity in normal human airways was localised to cells of the tracheal and bronchial epithelium and the endothelium of small vessels. In peripheral lung immunoreactivity was restricted to type II pneumocytes. In sections of cystic fibrosis lung a similar pattern of distribution was obtained with signals localised to endothelial cells, airway epithelium, and type II pneumocytes. Functional ex vivo uptake studies with fresh lung specimens led to an uptake of the fluorophore conjugated dipeptide derivative D-Ala-L-Lys-AMCA into bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes. This uptake was competitively inhibited by dipeptides and cephalosporins but not ACE inhibitors, indicating a substrate specificity as described for PEPT2.",

    "66": "Experiments were performed in vivo on chronically cannulated adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to assess the involvement of serotonergic or muscarinic receptor stimulation or activation of the renin-angiotensin system in eliciting catecholamine release during acute hypoxia during periods of nicotinic receptor desensitisation. Despite nicotinic receptor desensitisation induced by intravenous infusion of nicotine (1.3 x 10(-5) mol kg(-1) h(-1)), plasma catecholamine levels were increased to levels (adrenaline plus noradrenaline 125-200 nmol l(-1)) similar to those in control fish during severe hypoxia (40-45 mmHg; 5.3-6.0 kPa). Blockade of serotonergic receptors using methysergide or of muscarinic receptors using atropine did not affect the ability of fish to elevate circulating catecholamine levels during hypoxia. However, selective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, using lisinopril to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme, prevented the elevation of both angiotensin II and circulating catecholamine levels in acutely hypoxic fish experiencing nicotinic receptor desensitisation. In fish possessing functional nicotinic receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade attenuated but did not prevent the elevation of plasma catecholamine levels during hypoxia. The results of this study indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is activated during hypoxia and plays a role in eliciting catecholamine release that is secondary to activation of nicotinic receptors. However, under conditions of nicotinic receptor desensitisation, activation of the renin-angiotensin system during hypoxia is a prerequisite for catecholamine release.",

As documented earlier, cardiologists in a teaching institution are more likely to prescribe established life-saving drugs than do primary care physicians. However, full-time primary care physicians at a university-affiliated teaching hospital continue to use these therapies at a higher rate than do those outside academic medicine.",

Medical therapy with intense risk-factor modification and treatment with a statin, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be used unless contraindicated. Surgical therapy has also changed with the introduction of minimally invasive, beating heart surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention has perhaps changed the most radically with adjunctive therapy - glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, thienopyridines, and reliance on stent implantation. The future, with new distal protection devices and drug-coated stents, should continue to see increased numbers of patients who can benefit from percutaneous intervention.", 
    "73": "The choice of the appropriate dosage of ACE inhibitor in clinical practice is an important one. The available evidence suggests that in chronic heart failure as well as in chronic coronary artery disease, high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor are more effective than low ones. The current recommended clinical approach is to target ACE inhibitor dosing regimens to be similar to those used in the clinical trials, which demonstrated mortality and morbidity benefits. When titrated appropriately, ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated and target doses can be achieved and maintained in the majority of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, with or without heart failure.",

Until recently, the effect of such treatment in patients with preserved LV function has not been known. The results from the Heart Outcome Prevention Evaluation trial have indicated that long-term treatment with ramipril leads to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease, including those with prior myocardial infarction and preserved LV function. These results suggest that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition should also be considered in post-infarction patients with normal cardiac function.", 
    "75": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a 6-month angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor intervention on myocardial ischaemia. METHOD: We randomized 389 patients with stable coronary artery disease to double-blind treatment with ramipril 5 mg/day (n = 133), ramipril 1.25 mg/day (n = 133), or placebo (n = 123). Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiography was performed at baseline, and after 1 and 6 months. RESULTS: Relevant baseline variables were similar in all groups. Changes over 6 months in duration of >/= 1 mm ST-segment depression (STD), total ischaemic burden and maximum STD did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events between the groups. CONCLUSION: ACE inhibitor treatment has little impact on incidence and severity of myocardial ischaemia in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "76": "The evidence base for drug treatment of hypertension is strong. Early trials using thiazide diuretics suggested a shortfall in prevention of coronary heart disease. The superiority of newer drugs has been widely advocated but trial evidence does not support an advantage of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers or alpha-blockers for this outcome. Even meta-analyses have failed to clarify matters. If this issue is to be settled, bigger and better trials of longer duration in high-risk patients are needed. Meanwhile, the importance of rigorous blood pressure control using multiple drugs has been established. This should be the focus of our attention rather than agonising over differences in cause-specific outcomes that may not be generalisable to all patient populations.",

    "78": "Forty-six patients with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and mild-to-moderate hypertension and stable microalbuminuria were examined. P 4 or 8 mg once daily was compared to N 20 or 40 mg once daily; an optional open combination treatment with indapamide 2.5 mg once daily was given when needed. Main outcome measures were urinary albumin excretion rate, creatinine clearance and isotopic clearance measurements after 12 months.", 
    "79": "Baseline characteristics (blood pressure, HbA1, renal function) were highly comparable between groups. No serious adverse events occurred during the study period. Blood pressure was controlled (<140/90 mmHg) in all patients except for one in each group who dropped out. At the end of the study, albumin excretion rate was stabilized in both groups (P: 72% of baseline, N: 108%, NS). There were no significant differences found in radiometric clearance measurements. Creatinine clearance rose in patients treated with P by 10.0 ml/min on average, while it decreased by 9.8 m/min under N treatment (group effect: p<0.05).", 
    "80": "In this head-to-head comparison, P and N were effective in stabilising most parameters of renal function in incipient diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "81": "Two in vitro and one in vivo assay were performed to study the endothelial pleiotropic actions of \"tissue type\" angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) such as perindopril and quinapril, their active forms, that is, quinaprilat and peridoprilat, or of statins belonging to natural (lovastatin), semisynthetic (simvastatin), and synthetic enantiomeric (atorvastatin, cerivastatin) classes. Cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i levels in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated coronary vasodilatation in the Langendorff preparation of guinea pig heart constituted our in vitro assays. The in vivo assay consisted of study of PGI2-mediated thrombolytic response in arterial blood of rats after intravenous administration of drugs. In this last assay, perindopril and quinapril proved to be, by two orders of magnitude, more potent PGI2-dependent thrombolytics than the most potent statin (atorvastatin). However, in both in vitro assays we found a higher endothelial efficacy of statins as compared to ACE-Is. In particular, those statins that contain the lactone ring in their molecules (lovastatin, simvastatin) were the most potent coronary vasodilators. In summary, the in vivo profile of action of ACE-Is and statins contrasted with their reversed order of potency in vitro. We hypothesize that the endocrine-like function of the pulmonary circulation [28-31] may be responsible for the in vivo bradykinin-triggered, PGI2-mediated thrombolysis by ACE-Is, whereas the pleiotropic action of statins, possibly involving inhibition of prenylation [14-19], is diffused throughout many vascular beds.", 
    "82": "Acute renal failure is a heterogeneous disease. In advanced countries the incidence of acute renal failure is rising steadily in the elderly population. One of the serious causes of renal failure in this age group are pharmacological preparations and iodine radiocontrast diagnostic substances. It was revealed that also commonly used drugs may have a nephrotoxic potency in subjects with pre-existing renal disease and/or in certain clinical risk situations. In a group of 133 acutely haermodialyzed patients at the medical department we made a detailed clinical and economic analysis of treatment in a group of patients haemodialyzed on account of acute drug induced renal failure. These patients accounted for 28% of all acutely haemodialyzed patients and 65% of them were older than 65 years. The drugs which were involved as the cause or partial cause of renal failure had a negative effect on intrarenal haemodynamics. They comprised in the first place inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme and non-steroid antirheumatic drugs, frequently in combination with diuretics or an iodine contrast substance. A risk factor was preexisting nephropathy defined by the presence of renal perfusion depending on increased formation of angiotensin II and renal vasodialatating prostaglandins. Risk is ascribed also to pathological conditions associated with systemic hypotension and a reduced effective circulating volume. Costs of treatment per patient with drug induced renal failure were calculated as 127,000 Czech crowns. The sum was calculated as the cost of the diagnosis related group.", 
    "83": "Cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetic patients is a multidimensional task. Long-term decrease of glycaemia by the use of insulin or sulfonylureas had disappointing effects on cardiovascular events, whereas metformin effects are ambiguous. On the contrary, controlling risk factors like hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in diabetic as in non-diabetic patients. Similarly, clinical trials have shown the efficacy of treatments that decrease cardiovascular risk whatever the cause, such as antiplatelet drugs in secondary prevention and high-dose ramipril in secondary prevention or in hypertensive patients. The absolute benefit conferred by efficient therapies is higher in diabetic patients because they are at an increased risk of events compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.", 
    "84": "Diabetic nephropathy is a glomerular disease, which causes most of premature mortality observed in diabetic patients. The risk of diabetic nephropathy is not entirely accounted for by diabetes duration and control. Diagnosis has been improved by sensitive assays for urinary albumin (microalbuminuria). Treatment relies up on early and liberal use of several antihypertensive agents. Among them, angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors rank first, because of their efficacy.", 
    "85": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of diverse causes. Untreated, this condition will likely progress to advanced heart failure, sudden death, or both. There have been a number of significant advances in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Treatments that counteract ventricular remodeling with neurohumoral blockade have substantially improved the outcome for many patients. Although cardiac transplantation is of benefit to patients with advanced disease, the growing donor heart shortage limits this option. New treatments are clearly needed, and many are being actively investigated. As the genetic and cellular derangements that result in dilated cardiomyopathy are better understood, new therapeutic targets will be identified in the quest to restore normal cardiac structure and function.", 
    "86": "The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of the ACE-1, Trandolapril, alone or with Verapamil on blood pressure, albuminuria and metabolic profile in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria. It was an open multicenter, consecutive and prospective study conducted in 281 patients. There was a four-week wash-out period of antihypertensive drugs, after which we carried out a measurement over a 24-h period of the urinary excretion of albumina (UEA). Blood pressure was recorded after at least 5 minutes of rest in the sitting position at 1 to 3 minute intervals with a mercury sphygmomanometer in good condition. Average BP was obtained from three consecutive readings. Within treatment changes were analysed using descriptive statistics and t-tests on the change from baseline. Analysis of variance, chi-square and Mc Nemar tests were also used. If after 8 weeks of treatment with Trandolapril 2 mg o.q.d. the patients were non-responders (mean blood pressure reduction of 5 mmHg or less) or their blood pressure remained uncontrolled (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mmHg), Verapamil 180 mg o.q.d. was added. Two hundred and thirty patients completed the 12 weeks study. Population included 157 (55.9%) males with an average of 61.7 +/- 9.2 years. Baseline measurements were systolic 165.4 +/- 14.6 and diastolic 94.8 +/- 8.5 mmHg blood pressures, fasting glucose 162.7 +/- 43.9 mg/dL, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) 6.8 +/- 1.2%, and albuminuria 520.9 +/- 602 mg/day. UEA fell significantly (p < 0.001) after treatment to 177.9 +/- 24.3 mg/day (CI 95%, 129.9 to 225.8). The percent reduction reached 29.6%. Albuminuria was lower than 30 mg/day in 47 patients. Blood pressure was completely controlled in 125 (54%) patients. Glucemia fell significantly (p < 0.001) to 153.2 +/- 42.7 mg/dL, and the HbAlc to 6.5 +/- 1.3% (p = 0.012). In summary, in those diabetic type 2 patients with arterial hypertension and proteinuria, Trandolapril alone or associated with Verapamil significant lowered albuminuria and blood pressure facilitated the control or their metabolic profile.", 
    "87": "In the Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rat, a diet containing L-arginine, the natural substrate for nitric oxide synthase, abrogates the hypertension. We postulated that nitric oxide synthase inhibition might induce a salt-sensitive form of hypertension and that this salt sensitivity might be linked to a loss of the regulatory effect of sodium ingestion on angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensinogen. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomised to a diet containing 0.008 %, 2.2 % or 4.4 % sodium chloride and to treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) in the drinking water, or drinking water alone (Controls) for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured by tail cuff plethysmography twice weekly. After 4 weeks, the rats were anaesthetised and truncal blood collected for determination of angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin I (Ang I), Ang II and aldosterone concentrations as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Systolic blood pressure increased with increasing dietary sodium intake in the L-NAME-treated rats (P < 0.05). Plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations decreased with increasing dietary sodium intake in both Control and L-NAME-treated rats. Ang I and ACE activity were unchanged by increasing dietary sodium intake. In contrast, the plasma concentration of Ang II and angiotensinogen increased with increasing dietary sodium (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively). Treatment with the Ang II receptor blocker, losartan, reversed the blood pressure increase. We conclude that treatment with L-NAME induces an increase in blood pressure that is at least in part salt sensitive. Further, the salt-sensitive component appears to be Ang II-dependent, as it was associated with increasing plasma Ang II levels and could be reversed by treatment with an Ang II receptor antagonist.",

Ex vivo mesenteric artery and heart perfusion, high-performance liquid chromatography, and radioimmunoassay for aldosterone were performed.",

    "92": "Body fluids, particularly in the thorax, are increased in moderate congestive heart failure, even if diuretic treatment is appropriate. Ultrafiltration, differently from diuretics, removes isotonic fluid and therefore the greatest possible amount of sodium per unit of fluid withdrawn, providing a physiologic dehydration. This results in improvement in the patient's clinical condition, exercise capacity, lung function, as shown by improvement of standard pulmonary function tests, lung mechanics during exercise, and norepinephrine kinetics during exercise and orthostatic tilting.", 
    "93": "Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In the United States, there are more than 5 million patients with heart failure and over 500,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. Numerous advances have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to sodium and water retention in this condition. Important alterations in the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been described in heart failure, allowing the use of mechanism-specific treatments such as beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. As our understanding of the roles of the natriuretic peptides and the arginine vasopressin-aquaporin-2 system in the pathophysiology of heart failure evolves, treatments directed toward the alterations in these systems in heart failure can be further developed.", 
    "94": "Antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well established and have usually been attributed to the inhibition of angiotensin II (ANG)-mediated effects at vascular or ventricular (angiotensin type 1) AT(1) receptors. One other important mechanism involves ANG-induced interactions with the sympathetic nervous system, which might include alterations of cardiac catecholamine concentrations during ACE inhibition due to a modulation of monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. Tissue catecholamines were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats that were long-term treated with captopril (50 or 0.5 mg/kg/day), enalapril (10 or 0.1 mg/kg/day), an AT(1) receptor antagonist (candesartan-cilexetil, 3 mg/kg/day), or a calcium antagonist (mibefradil, 18 mg/kg/day). The kinetic parameters of MAO were then determined in vitro in the presence of ANG, captopril, enalaprilat, or candesartan. Noradrenaline and adrenaline contents were doubled in the left ventricle by captopril, enalapril, or candesartan independently of hypotensive potency but not in liver or cortex. In parallel, cardiac MAO activity was reduced by all doses of captopril (49/29%), enalapril (52/24%), or candesartan (38%). Mibefradil, which does not interact with the renin-angiotensin system, did not alter cardiac catecholamines or MAO activity when an equipotent antihypertensive dose was applied. In vitro MAO activity was not influenced by ANG, enalaprilat, or captopril at concentrations of up to 1 mM. It is concluded that diminished AT(1) receptor stimulation decreases cardiac MAO activity, probably by regulating MAO expression, since ANG, ACE inhibitors, and AT(1) antagonists had no effect on MAO activity in vitro. This action contributes to an increase in cardiac catecholamine content that may improve cardiac sympathetic control during therapy.", 
    "95": "This study compares the effect of estrogens and ACE inhibition on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentrations in healthy postmenopausal women, genotyped for a 4G/5G polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter, a polymorphism shown to influence PAI-1 concentrations. Methods and Results- Morning estradiol, PAI-1, tissue plasminogen activator, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone were measured in 19 postmenopausal women (5G/5G:4G/5G:4G4G=5:10:4, respectively) at baseline and during randomized, single-blind, crossover treatment with conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg per os per day, ramipril 10 mg per os per day, and combination estrogens and ramipril. Estradiol (P<0.005) and angiotensin II (P<0.01) were significantly higher during estrogens. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased during ACE inhibition (P<0.05). Both conjugated estrogens [PAI-1 antigen from 12.5 (7.6, 17.4) [mean (95% CI)] baseline to 6.6 (2.6, 10.7) ng/mL, P<0.01] and ACE inhibition [8.3 (4.9, 11.7) ng/mL, P<0.005] decreased PAI-1 without decreasing tissue plasminogen activator. The effect of combined therapy on PAI-1 [5.6 (2.3, 8.8) ng/mL] was significantly greater than that of ramipril alone (P<0.05). There was a significant effect of PAI-1 4G/5G genotype on baseline PAI-1 concentrations (P=0.001) and a significant interactive effect of 4G/5G genotype and treatment, such that genotype influenced the change in PAI-1 during ramipril (P=0.011) or combined therapy (P=0.006) but not during estrogens (P=0.715).", 
    "96": "ACE inhibition with ramipril and conjugated estrogens similarly decrease PAI-1 antigen concentrations in postmenopausal women. Larger studies that use clinical outcomes are needed to determine whether PAI-1 4G/5G genotype should influence the choice of conjugated estrogens or ACE inhibition for the treatment of healthy postmenopausal women.",

Functional diagnosis of RVD with regard to renovascular hypertension (RVH) was done with the captopril test (CP-T) and captopril-enhanced (99m)Tc-DTPA (diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid) renal scintigraphy (CER). All were subjected to SR. Number, length, size and site of RVD with involvement of branch arteries dictated the choice of operative method but basically in situ repair for main trunk disease (11 kidneys) and ex vivo bench repair with autotransplantation for those beyond the first bifurcation intrarenally involving branched arteries (24 kidneys) were employed. The outcome was analyzed as to blood pressure control, split renal function, and branch renal artery patency.",

    "101": "Effects of long-term sarpogrelate (5-HT(2) antagonist) administration on the systolic blood pressure of Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were studied and compared with those of quinapril (ACE-I). Sarpogrelate and quinapril were administered orally for 12 weeks and body and heart weights, systolic blood pressure and the relationships between heart weight and systolic blood pressure were determined. Although both drug treatments caused decreases in the body weight of WKYs and SHRs, only quinapril induced a decrease in the heart weight of SHRs. In addition, quinapril induced a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure in WKYs and SHRs while sarpogrelate had no effect on systolic blood pressure. Thus, quinapril showed hemodynamic effects on WKYs and SHRs, but the 5-HT(2) antagonists sarpogrelate did not shown such effects, suggesting that 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists may not be important for controlling systolic blood pressure.", 
    "102": "Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and dependency in western society. Following stroke, the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased by a factor of around 2-3 compared with baseline. Indeed, after the first 30 days, stroke survivors are more likely to die from a cardiac event than from a cerebrovascular event. In patients with atherothrombotic stroke, preventing subsequent manifestations of the underlying disease is therefore an important therapeutic goal. A number of options have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. Aggressively controlling stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking, should provide significant benefit in reducing stroke risk; however, it is difficult to realize the full potential of these approaches in routine clinical practice. A number of classes of medication can reduce the risk of stroke and other vascular events, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. Several antiplatelet agents are approved to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, although only clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are approved for the reduction of both stroke and MI in such patients. In the CAPRIE study, clopidogrel showed a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 8.7% (p = 0.043) compared with ASA for the composite endpoint of ischaemic stroke, MI or vascular death. Evidence from animal studies, ex vivo models in humans, and patients undergoing coronary stent insertion or patients with unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI clearly demonstrates the synergistic antiplatelet effect of using clopidogrel with ASA. In summary, most patients with an ischaemic stroke should be treated with an antiplatelet agent to reduce their risk of recurrent stroke, MI, or vascular death. The use of aggressive antiplatelet therapy has the potential to become a new paradigm for managing patients with vascular disease due to atherothrombosis.", 
    "103": "The leukocyte migration induced by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) has been investigated in rats using the pleurisy model. Intrapleural injection of PNV (10-100 microg/cavity) caused a dose- and time-dependent leukocyte accumulation. The bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.5 mg/kg) substantially inhibited PNV-induced cell accumulation, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (2 mg/kg) potentiated by 80% this effect. The non-specific kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor soybean trypsin inhibitor greatly reduced PNV-induced leukocyte migration, whereas the selective tissue kallikrein inhibitor P(ac)-F-S-R-EDDnp failed to affect PNV-induced responses. Treatment of rats with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) at the neonatal stage resulted in 67% inhibition of the PNV-induced cell migration. The neurokinin NK(1) receptor antagonist SR140333, but not the NK(2) receptor antagonist SR48968, reduced by 55% venom-induced cell accumulation. We conclude that bradykinin generation is involved in the PNV-induced pleural leukocyte migration in rats, where it can directly activate sensory nerves contributing to a neurogenic inflammatory mechanism.", 
    "104": "Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has long been associated with angioedema. Increased levels of bradykinin caused by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme have been thought to be responsible for this side effect. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AT2 blockers), such as losartan potassium (Cozaar; Merck & Co., West Point, PA), are a new class of antihypertensives developed in part to eliminate cough and angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors. These agents act by selectively binding to angiotensin II receptor sites, thereby eliminating the hypertensive effects of angiotensin without affecting local and systemic bradykinin levels. We present three cases of AT2 receptor antagonist-induced angioedema, and examine its significance in the treatment of angioedema and its proposed etiology.",

All three patients had prior episodes of angioedema while on losartan. Two patients presented with involvement of the anterior tongue and face that resolved within 12 hours of discontinuation of the losartan and a course of intravenous steroids. The third patient experienced recurring episodes of angioedema that eventually required a tracheotomy for airway compromise. After discontinuing the losartan and receiving a course of intravenous steroids, the angioedema resolved in 5 days. The patient was decannulated 10 days after onset of symptoms.", 
    "107": "Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition commonly associated with ACE inhibitor use. AT2 blockers bind to angiotensin II receptor sites and have no demonstrable effect on local or systemic bradykinin levels. We present three cases that demonstrate AT2 blocker-induced angioedema. They were all complicated by the fact that the inciting agent, losartan, was not discontinued after the initial episode and resulted in recurrent episodes of angioedema, one of which required surgical airway intervention. The incidence of AT2 blocker-induced angioedema brings into question prior theories on the etiology of angioedema and bradykinin's role in its pathogenesis.", 
    "108": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that vascular injury resulted in an induction of vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and have suggested that inhibition of vascular ACE might be important in the prevention of restenosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor with high affinity to tissue ACE, on restenosis following coronary intervention. The design of this study was a prospective, randomized, open, and non-placebo controlled trial. Patients with ischemic heart disease were enrolled after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stent implantation at 7 participating institutions. Two hundred and fifty-three patients with 294 lesions were randomly assigned to the quinapril (10-20 mg per day) group or control group. Administration of quinapril was continued for 3-6 months of the follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed before and after angioplasty and at follow-up. Core laboratory measurements were performed independently and blinded. Follow-up angiography was performed in 108 patients with 124 lesions in the quinapril group and in 107 patients with 130 lesions in the control group. The baseline characteristics and findings of angioplasty showed no significant differences between the two groups. However, in the quinapril group, restenosis per patient and per lesion was significantly lower (34.3% vs. 47.7%, p < 0.05 and 30.6% vs. 43.8%, p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed that administration of quinapril independently contributed to reducing the restenosis per patient and per lesion (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.99 and odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.99). In conclusion, quinapril significantly reduces restenosis following coronary intervention.",

Overall, creatinine, blood urea and serum K did not show significant differences between groups. However, in 9 patients in group A increases in serum K >5.5 mmol/dL and creatinine >2.0 mg/L were observed after 10 days of treatment. At 90 days, the mitral E/A ratio was higher (p = 0.001) and LV end systolic volume smaller (p = 0.021) inpatients treated with canreonate than in those receiving placebo.

    "113": "Since adverse effects due to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors frequently occur in cutaneous locations, this review summarizes the spectrum of expected and unexpected adverse effects of these drugs, possible associated mechanisms, and their basic functions for dermatologists. ACE inhibitors block the activity of the metalloproteinase ACE by binding to its active site, thus displacing angiotensin I and preventing its conversion to vasopressive angiotensin II. Furthermore, ACE degrades bradykinin, substance P, enkephalins and some of the reproductive peptide hormones. The overall incidence of adverse effects to ACE inhibitors is estimated at 28%, approximately half of which occurs in the skin. General reactions are first-dose hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Cutaneous reactions comprise life-threatening angioedema, pruritus, bullous eruptions, urticaria, other generalized rashes, photosensitivity and hair loss. ACE inhibitors thus mimic a broad variety of skin diseases, why these drugs should be thought of when sudden, unexplainable skin eruptions are observed.", 
    "114": "The renin-angiotensin (RAS) and the alpha1 sympathetic nervous system (SNS) interact at different levels in cardiovascular regulation. Concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha1 receptor antagonists result in a synergistic antihypertensive action and is of wide utility in cardiovascular therapy. We examined the impact of concurrent inhibition of RAS (captopril or losartan) and the SNS (prazosin) before and after acute nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition with L-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on renal cortical perfusion (RCF) and blood pressure (MAP) in healthy and acute ischemic renal failure (ARF) rats (n = 6). Captopril or losartan reduced MAP and increased RCF more in healthy (p < 0.001) and ARF rats (p < 0.02). Prazosin alone reduced both MAP and RCF (p < 0.001). The combination of prazosin with captopril or losartan caused an additive fall in MAP, and mitigated the fall in RCF. Captopril + prazosin caused a profound fall in RCF following L-NAME, in healthy but not ARF rats (p < 0.001). Acetylcholine (Ach), a vasodilator which stimulates endogenous NO production caused a profound paradoxical fall in RCF in ARF, but not in healthy rats (p < 0.001 ANOVA). These results indicate a significant interaction between angiotensin II and phenylephrine in renal vasomotion. It establishes that endogenous NO homeostatically opposes angiotensin II-alpha1-mediated renal vasoconstriction, and that the vasodilator role of NO is diminished in ARF. The paradoxical fall in RCF induced by Ach in ARF is speculated to result, at least in part, from the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which acts as a renal vasoconstrictor, following the combination of ischemia-generated super oxide anion (O-2), with endothelial NO released by Ach.",

    "119": "OBJECTIVE - To describe clinical observations of marked improvement in ventricular dysfunction in a medical office environment under circumstances differing from those in study protocols and multicenter studies performed in hospital or with outpatient cohorts. METHODS - Eleven cardiac failure patients with marked ventricular dysfunction receiving treatment at a doctors office between 1994 and 1999 were studied. Their ages ranged from 20 and 66 years (mean 39.42+/-14.05 years); 7 patients were men, 4 were women. Cardiopathic etiologies were arterial hypertension in 5 patients, peripartum cardiomyopathy in 2, nondefined myocarditis in 2, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy in 4. Initial echocardiograms revealed left ventricular dilatation (average diastolic diameter, 69.45+/-8.15mm), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (0.38+/-0.08) and left atrial dilatation (43.36+/-5.16mm). The therapeutic approach followed consisted of patient orientation, elimination of etiological or causal factors of cardiac failure, and prescription of digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors. RESULTS - Following treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction changed to 0.63+/-0.09; left ventricular diameters changed to 57.18+/-8.13mm, and left atrium diameters changed to 37.27+/-8.05mm. Maximum improvement was noted after 16.9+/-8.63 (6 to 36) months. CONCLUSION - Patients with serious cardiac failure and ventricular dysfunction caused by hypertension, alcoholism, or myocarditis can experience marked improvement in ventricular dysfunction after undergoing appropriate therapy within the venue of the doctor's office.", 
    "120": "Renin is the main determinant of angiotensin (Ang) II levels. It, therefore, always appeared desirable to reduce Ang II levels by direct inhibition of renin. So far, specific renin inhibitors lacked potency and/or oral availability. We tested the new orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor SPP100 (Aliskiren, an octanamide with a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] in the low nanomolar range) in 18 healthy volunteers on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium diet using a double-blind, 3-way crossover protocol. In 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days, each volunteer received 2 dosage levels of Aliskiren (low before high; 40 and 80 or 160 and 640 mg/d) and randomized placebo or 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren was well tolerated. Not surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in these normotensive subjects. There was a dose-dependent decrease in plasma renin activity, Ang I, and Ang II following single doses of Aliskiren starting with 40 mg. Inhibition was still marked and significant after repeated dosing with maximal decreases in Ang II levels by 89% and 75% on Days 1 and 8, respectively, when the highest dose of Aliskiren was compared with placebo. At the same time, mean plasma active renin was increased 16- and 34-fold at the highest dose of Aliskiren. Plasma drug levels of Aliskiren were dose-dependent with maximal concentrations reached between 3 to 6 hours after administration; steady state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing. Less than 1% of dose was excreted in the urine. Plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were decreased after doses of Aliskiren > or =80 mg and after enalapril. Aliskiren at 160 and 640 mg enhanced natriuresis on Day 1 by +45% and +62%, respectively, compared with placebo (100%, ie, 87+/-11 mmol/24h) and enalapril (+54%); kaliuresis remained unchanged. In conclusion, the renin inhibitor Aliskiren dose-dependently decreases Ang II levels in humans following oral administration. The effect is long-lasting and, at a dose of 160 mg, is equivalent to that of 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren has the potential to become the first orally active renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ACE-inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.", 
    "121": "The blood pressures of hypertensive patients living in the southeastern region of the United States are less responsive to several classes of antihypertensive medications. Birth weights are lower among blacks and those living in the Southeast, and evidence suggests that this developmental difference increases blood pressure. As an initial step in addressing the possibility that birth weight influences response to antihypertensive therapy, we examined the relationship between birth weight and class of antihypertensive medication among 3236 Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina with high blood pressure. Birth weight, obtained from birth certificates, was not related to use of either diuretics or beta blockers. However, among black women, there was an inverse association between birth weight and use of calcium channel antagonists (P=0.03), which persisted after adjustment for the number of antihypertensive medications. Among white men, low and high birth weights were associated with greater use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors than in men of normal birth weight (P=0.002 for quadratic trend [U-shaped]). This association remained after adjustment for comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus, which were associated with birth weight and for which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended. The findings indicate that birth weight is associated with use of calcium channel antagonists in black women and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in white men. These observations suggest that further study of the relationship between birth weight and blood pressure responses to various antihypertensive medications may help elucidate pathophysiological factors contributing to geographic and racial disparities in therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "122": "Previous studies have indicated that angiotensin II (Ang II) concentrations in renal interstitial fluid are much higher than plasma levels. In the present study, we performed experiments to explore renal interstitial fluid concentrations of Ang I and Ang II further and to determine whether these levels are altered by acute arterial infusion of an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) or by volume expansion. Microdialysis probes (molecular weight cutoff point: 30 000 Da) were implanted in the renal cortex of anesthetized rats and were perfused at a rate of 2 microL/min. Using relative equilibrium rates, the basal renal interstitial fluid Ang II concentration averaged 3.07+/-0.43 nmol/L, a value much higher than the plasma Ang II concentration of 107+/-8 pmol/L (n=7). Interstitial fluid Ang I concentrations (0.84+/-0.04 nmol/L) were consistently lower than the Ang II concentrations but higher than the plasma Ang I concentrations (112+/-14 pmol/L). Intra-arterial infusion of enalaprilat (7.5 micromol/kg/min, n=5) for 120 minutes resulted in a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (from 114+/-4 to 68+/-4 mm Hg) along with reductions in plasma and renal ACE activity (by -99% and -52%, respectively). Enalaprilat resulted in a significant increase in plasma Ang I from 133+/-21 to 1167+/-328 pmol/L and a decrease in plasma Ang II from 110+/-12 to 67+/-9 pmol/L. During enalaprilat infusion, interstitial fluid concentration of Ang I was significantly increased from 0.78+/-0.06 to 0.97+/-0.08 nmol/L; however, Ang II concentrations were not altered significantly (3.67+/-0.28 versus 3.67+/-0.25 nmol/L). Acute volume loading with Ringer's solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin at a rate of 150 microL/min for 2 hours (6% to 7% of body weight) lowered plasma concentrations of Ang I from 110+/-23 to 16+/-2 pmol/L and Ang II from 100+/-23 to 36+/-6 pmol/L; however, renal interstitial fluid concentrations of Ang I and Ang II were not altered significantly during volume expansion (Ang I, from 0.77+/-0.05 to 0.69+/-0.03 nmol/L; Ang II, from 3.76+/-0.43 to 3.59+/-0.39 nmol/L, n=5). These data indicate that renal interstitial fluid concentrations of Ang I and Ang II are substantially higher than the corresponding plasma concentrations. Furthermore, the fact that the high interstitial fluid concentrations of Ang II are not responsive to acute ACE inhibition or volume expansion suggests the compartmentalization and independent regulation of renal interstitial fluid Ang II.", 
    "123": "Bradykinin evokes endothelium-dependent relaxation in some vascular beds; on the other hand, the possibility has been demonstrated that in certain organs, such as the adrenal medulla or atria, bradykinin may enhance transmitter release from the sympathetic nerves. We hypothesized that bradykinin may also enhance postganglionic sympathetic neurotransmission in blood vessels. To test this hypothesis, we recorded excitatory junction potentials (EJPs), a measure of sympathetic purinergic neurotransmission, in rat mesenteric resistance arteries with a conventional microelectrode technique. EJPs were elicited by repetitive perivascular nerve stimulation (1 Hz, 20 to 50 V, 30 to 60 micros, 11 pulses). In this preparation, bradykinin (10(-7) or 10(-6) mol/L) significantly enhanced the amplitude of EJPs without altering the resting membrane potential. This effect of bradykinin was blocked by Hoe 140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, but not by des-Arg(9),[Leu(8)]-bradykinin, a bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine did not alter the effect of bradykinin. Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, but not candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, enhanced the action of a low concentration (10(-8) mol/L) of bradykinin on EJPs. These findings suggest that in rat mesenteric resistance arteries, bradykinin enhances sympathetic purinergic neurotransmission, presumably through presynaptic bradykinin B2 receptors. The clinical relevance of the present findings remains unclear; however, the fact that the ACE inhibitor, but not the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, enhanced the action of bradykinin on sympathetic neurotransmission may warrant further investigation.",

Another possibility is that insulin resistance per se, by some uncertain mechanisms, causes essential hypertension [1, 5]. We evaluated insulin sensitivity in 24 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension before and after cilazapril monotherapy during 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity (Si) was assessed by minimal model test (MINMOD) using frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test in 0 week and after 12 weeks of treatment.

    "145": "Diabetic nephropathy(DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Japan. Clinical course of DN is divided into five stages. Stage 1 is a pre-nephropathy stage. Stage 2 is the period with microalbuminuria. Stage 3A is the stage with persistent macroproteinuria and well preserved renal function. Strict glycemic control and antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors are capable of inducing remission in stage 2 of DN and probably in stage 3A. GFR less than 60 ml/min and urinary protein excretion more than 1 g/day are regarded as stage 3B. Serum creatinine concentration increases in stage 4. Antihypertensive therapy and low protein diet are major options of therapy both in stage 3B and 4. Stage 5 is the period with renal replacement therapy. Survival rate of patients on HD due to DN still remains unsatisfactory. Only 30-50% of type 2 diabetic patients develop DN, suggesting that there are several factors other than hyperglycemia which induce DN. Prediabetic hypertension and parenteral hypertension are regarded as predictors of DN. Smoking, male gender, and advanced age might be risk factors of DN. Recently it was demonstrated that insertion/deletion(I/D) polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme gene is associated with DN. In addition polymorphisms of several genes seem to be associated with DN. Development of DNA tips will make it possible to determine a number of gene polymorphisms. Accumulations of the information on gene polymorphisms from many patients with or without DN are expected to contribute detection of patients at high risk of developing DN.", 
    "146": "Because many antihypertensive drugs can affect airway function, the treatment of hypertension in patients with airway dysfunction is complex. For example, the worsening or precipitation of asthma by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is well-recognized, but beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockers that exert mild beta(2)-agonist effects, and those that modulate the endogenous production of nitric oxide, affect airway function to a lesser extent. Therapy with selective alpha(1)-blockers is not contraindicated in cases of chronic airway obstruction. Conversely, alpha(2)-agonists must not be given to asthmatic subjects because they can adversely affect the bronchi. Calcium channel blockers do not exert severe side effects on the airways. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may cause cough and exacerbate or even induce asthma; however, angiotensin II type I (AT(1)) antagonists do not cause cough. 5-Hydroxytryptamine modifiers such as urapidil are a treatment option for patients with chronic airway obstruction. In patients with airway dysfunction, we suggest treatment with thiazide diuretics as the initial drug choice, and calcium channel blockers if the response is poor. In the case of no response, calcium channel blockers alone must be used. However, there is no strict rule because individual patients may respond differently to individual drugs and drug combinations. Consequently, it is important to adopt a flexible approach. For patients who are unresponsive to the aforementioned drugs, AT(1) receptor antagonists, newer beta(1)-adrenoceptor-blocking agents with ancillary properties (eg, celiprolol or nebivolol), and/or vasodilators can be considered.",

Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.",

Several vasopeptidase inhibitors are under clinical investigation. Omapatrilat is the most studied agent in this class. Clinical studies of omapatrilat in hypertension have consistently shown the agent's effectiveness in a variety of patient populations. In patients with heart failure, omapatrilat significantly improved neurohormonal and hemodynamic status. Long-term effects of omapatrilat in patients with heart failure recently were compared with those of conventional therapy in a large phase II trial. Results of the study appear promising.

This review assesses the therapeutic effects of angiotensin II antagonists compared with the ACE inhibitors in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. From 21 comparative studies with a duration of up to one year, it can be concluded that the lowering of the blood pressure with the two classes is similar. Both showed relatively few side effects, the only difference being a higher incidence of cough after ACE inhibitors.

    "159": "Bradykinin is a major mediator of swelling in C1 inhibitor deficiency as well as the angioedema seen with ACE inhibitors and may contribute to bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma. Formation of bradykinin occurs in the fluid phase and along cell surfaces requiring interaction of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high M(r) kininogen (HK). Recent data suggest that activation of the kinin-forming cascade can occur on the surface of endothelial cells, even in the absence of factor XII. We sought to further define this factor XII-independent mechanism of kinin formation. Both cytosolic and membrane fractions from endothelial cells possessed the ability to catalyze prekallikrein conversion to kallikrein, and activation depended on the presence of HK and zinc ion. We fractionated the cytosol by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography by using corn trypsin inhibitor as ligand. The fractions with peak activity were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and ligand blot with biotinylated corn trypsin inhibitor, and positive bands were sequenced. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as the protein responsible for zinc-dependent prekallikrein activation in the presence of HK. Zinc-dependent activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex also depended on addition of either alpha and beta isoforms of Hsp90 and the activation on endothelial cells was inhibited on addition of polyclonal Ab to Hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner. Although the mechanism by which Hsp90 activates the kinin-forming cascade is not understood, this protein represents the cellular contribution to the reaction and may become the dominant mechanism in pathologic circumstances in which Hsp90 is highly expressed or secreted.",

Captopril was given as an initial dose of 6.25 mg, and then 50 mg/day on day 1 and 100 mg/day thereafter. The corresponding doses of perindopril were 2, 4, and 8 mg/day. Acute hemodynamic changes, the percentage of patients who reached target doses, and in-hospital and 6-month cardiovascular events were monitored. Baseline clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were identical, but patients randomized to perindopril were in a higher Killip class (1.4 +/- 0.6 vs 1.2 +/- 0.5, p = 0.05). During the first 6 hours, treatment with perindopril resulted in higher minimal systolic (97 +/- 15 vs 91 +/- 14 mm Hg, p <0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (57 +/- 11 vs 54 +/- 10 mm Hg, p <0.02), later occurrence of minimal BP (3.6 +/- 0.2 vs 2.7 +/- 0.1 hour, p <0.001), and a lower incidence of persistent hypotension with systolic BP < 90 mm Hg for > or =1 hour (5% vs 16%; p < 0.01) compared with captopril. At initial administration, target doses of perindopril and captopril were attained in 97% and 82% of the patients, respectively (p < 0.01). After 6 months, there were no differences between patients treated with perindopril and captopril in mortality rates (6% vs 13%, p = 0.16) and need for revascularization (20% vs 21%, p = 0.9). Thus, in patients during AMI, perindopril treatment showed better short-term tolerance than treatment with captopril, with significantly less acute hemodynamic changes and fewer withdrawals.", 
    "161": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the predominant form of hypertension in persons older than 50 years, who represent the majority of individuals with hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) determines Joint National Committee blood pressure stage, and therefore the need for therapy, far more often than diastolic blood pressure (DBP). SBP consistently is associated with greater risk for overall mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and other end points. In addition, clinicians are far less aggressive and less successful at controlling SBP compared with DBP. Thus, SBP should be acknowledged as the major criterion that determines diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic management in older individuals. Several recent large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of drug therapy targeting ISH in the elderly have shown dramatic reductions in cardiovascular end points and mortality. The treatment of patients with ISH must occur within the framework of the larger goals associated with treatment of hypertension generally. Lifestyle modification, including salt restriction and increasing physical activity, may contribute to improvements in arterial compliance and control of ISH in particular. In clinical trials, most antihypertensive agents decrease SBP more than DBP. However, certain drug classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates, have advantageous properties that may make them particularly useful for the treatment of ISH.", 
    "162": "Individuals who survive an acute myocardial infarction (MI) have up to a ninefold greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with the general population. The modification of traditional coronary risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and diabetes mellitus, constitutes one of the cornerstones of management after acute MI. Therapies aimed at reversing the pathophysiologic disorders that lead to endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, and atherosclerotic plaque instability may improve the prognosis for patients after acute MI. Aggressive risk stratification diagnostic testing can identify patients at the highest risk for adverse events. Prior to hospital discharge, patients should have an evaluation of left ventricular systolic function, an assessment for the risk for residual myocardial ischemia, and a clinical assessment of the risk for serious ventricular arrhythmias. An array of pharmaceutical agents is available for the secondary prevention of MI, including antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins.", 
    "163": "ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) is an emergency medical condition. Expediting the steps leading to coronary reperfusion is of critical importance in improving survival after acute MI. After the diagnosis of acute MI is made, patients should be treated with oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, beta-blockers, heparin, and analgesics, barring any contraindications. If an experienced cardiac catheterization laboratory is available within 60 to 90 minutes, then catheter-based reperfusion therapy is recommended; otherwise, thrombolysis should be considered as an alternate therapy. Therapy with a reduced-dose thrombolytic agent and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor appears to be of an added benefit in establishing TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 3 flow, but this approach awaits final approval prior to widespread use. The adjunctive use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, with or without stenting, appears to be beneficial and is being used more frequently in the acute setting. Coronary angiography should be performed in patients who fail to respond to thrombolytic therapy or who have evidence of recurrent ischemia. This procedure should not be routinely performed in patients who have responded to thrombolytic therapy. Four to 6 days after an acute MI event, assessment of left ventricular function is recommended. Submaximal exercise test (with or without nuclear or echocardiographic imaging) should be considered in patients prior to discharge from the hospital--an exception can be made in patients with one-vessel disease treated successfully with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After discharge, a regular exercise test should be obtained 4 to 6 weeks after an uncomplicated acute MI event. Secondary prevention measures such as weight loss, cessation of smoking, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in all patients, barring contraindications.",

Because patients with diabetes are at high risk for coronary disease, they have more to gain from prevention. There is evidence from clinical trials that select cardiovascular therapies may work better in diabetes, beyond their expected benefit, and may prevent diabetes itself.",

There were 69 patients (16%) with the DD genotype, 194 patients (44%) with the ID genotype, and 178 patients (40%) with the II genotype. During a mean follow-up of 9.4 months, there were 49 cardiac deaths (DD, n = 4; ID, n = 26; II, n = 19). The DD genotype was significantly associated with a lower mortality than the other genotypes (p = 0.0363) by Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, site of myocardial infarction, Killip functional class, reperfusion therapy during acute phase, ACE inhibitor use, and beta-blocker use.",

    "168": "Recommendations regarding the clinical protocols for radionuclides of choice and diagnostic criteria for renovascular hypertension have been established by the consensus report on captopril renography. A review of the existing data indicates that postcaptopril renography alone is a safe and effective means of noninvasively screening hypertensive patients. A normal radionuclide study after captopril suggests with a reasonable degree of certainty that potentially reversible renovascular hypertension is unlikely. A positive study in an appropriately screened hypertensive patient with preserved renal function suggests renovascular disease is likely with a sensitivity and specificity in excess of 90%. In the comparative studies of Elliott and Miralles and colleagues, captopril renography was a more sensitive and specific screening test than the captopril plasma renin activity test. Although there may be confounding variables, such as renal dysfunction, medications, and types of stenosis, a positive captopril renogram may suggest a cure or improvement in blood pressure control with successful intervention such as PTRA or revascularization. Whether captopril renography can predict stabilization of individual kidney function is speculative and deserving of further study.",

The combination of ACEI + ARB induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria in every patient (to 3.3 +/- 3.7 g/24 h) than either drug alone (P = 0.039 by ANOVA). The enhanced antiproteinuric effect of the combined therapy could not be attributed to a more pronounced reduction of 24 h mean arterial pressure (basal, 106 +/- 8; ACEI, 97 +/- 5; ARB, 98 +/- 5; ACEI+ARB, 95 +/- 5 mmHg) or creatinine clearance (basal, 77 +/- 27; ACEI, 73 +/- 31; ARB 80 +/- 30; ACEI + ARB, 73 +/- 32 ml/min).",

    "178": "The current study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of a novel angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, RNH-6270, on exaggerated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in comparison with the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. RNH-6270 and temocapril significantly inhibited basal DNA synthesis in VSMCs from SHRs in a dose-dependent manner, but not in cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. SHR-derived VSMC showed a hyperresponse of DNA synthesis to serum and angiotensin II compared with that of WKY rats-derived VSMC. RNH-6270 did not affect serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMCs from both rat strains. RNH-6270 abolished angiotensin II-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMC from both rat strains. RNH-6270 significantly inhibited proliferation of VSMC from both rat strains, but the ACE inhibitor temocapril did not exert such an effect. RNH-6270 decreased the specific binding of angiotensin II to VSMC in a competitive manner for angiotensin II receptors in both rat strains. RNH-6270 and temocapril significantly decreased the expression of growth factor mRNAs and proteins in VSMC from SHR, but not in cells from WKY rats. These results suggest that RNH-6270 is a potent AT1 receptor antagonist and has anti-proliferative effects on VSMCs from SHR, which was not seen with an ACE inhibitor. The growth inhibitory effect of RNH-6270 may be associated with the inhibition of growth factors via antagonism to AT1 receptors.", 
    "179": "With 550,000 new cases each year, congestive heart failure is a major medical problem. Several medical therapies, including digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers, have reduced the number of re-hospitalizations and slowed the progression of congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, some beta-blockers, and the combination of hydralazine with nitrates have improved survival. Despite these benefits, medical therapy frequently fails to improve quality of life. Biventricular pacing has been introduced to resynchronize mechanical and electrical asynchrony frequently observed in patients with heart failure. The most recent pacing trials show an improvement in quality of life and functional class. Long-term data are needed to determine the effect of biventricular pacing on survival. The acute hemodynamic studies suggest that resynchronization pacing therapy may predict a positive long-term benefit for many patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "180": "ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) represent effective drugs more and more widely used in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, in post AMI patients and mainly, today, in CHF patients.A complete review of the scientific literature and of all the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), where ACE-I have been tested directly or in association with other drugs, have been performed. ACE-I effects on total mortality (TM) and arrhythmic mortality (AM) and other composite clinical endpoints have been evaluated. It is well known that frequent ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and a high incidence of sudden death (SD) can be documented in CHF patients; nevertheless a direct relationship between VA, TM, and AM has not been clearly demonstrated; neither beneficial effects, on the same endpoints, of the treatment and suppression of ambient VA in CHF. Conversely, sometimes clear negative effects on both TM and AM have been observed. According to individual studies and two recent complete and large metanalysis, ACE-I were unable to reduce AM, but they reduced TM. Furthermore, they can affect and modify many, if not all, of the triggering factors of VA and SD in this context. Differently from ACE-I, betablockers (BB) have been clearly associated with a reduction in TM and AM, in the same context. Thus, at present time, ACE-I, with or without BB, should be considered the standard therapy in all patients with CHF, if not contraindicated. Angiotensin II antagonists (AII-a) probably represent a comparably effective treatment, in all CHF patients and mainly in those patients, suffering from side effects or showing intolerance to ACE-I, but we are still lacking definitive data from RCTs. In many RCTs, conducted with traditional antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT), these drugs have been widely used, contributing probably, in a consistent way, to some of the positive results of these studies. All primary and some secondary implantable defibrillators (ICD) RCTs, in the prevention of SD, have included these drugs as the standard treatment of the underlying cardiac disease, with or without CHF. The same therapeutical strategy is regularly applied in all biventricular pacing (BP) RCTs, with or without the ICD. These trials are supposed to assess the reduction in TM and AM, preventing deterioration or progression of CHF and improving the quality of the patients' s life.Finally, according to these clinical evidences, in the last part of the review, we stress the need for a more widespread implementation of ACE-I and AII-a in treating CHF patients.", 
    "181": "The management of chronic heart failure in elderly patients is often complicated by the presence of multiple comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, psychosocial and financial concerns, and difficulties with adherence to complex medication and dietary regimens. In addition, few patients over 80 years of age have been enrolled in clinical trials, so that the efficacy of current heart failure therapies remains uncertain in this age group. Taken together, these factors contribute to the persistently high hospitalization and mortality rates as well as the poor quality of life associated with chronic heart failure in the elderly. In this article, nonpharmacologic aspects of care and the pharmacotherapy of systolic heart failure in elderly patients are reviewed. Optimal management requires a systematic approach comprising 5 key elements: coordination of care across disciplines, patient and caregiver education, enhancement of self-management skills, effective followup, and the judicious use of medications. However, it must be recognized that even with \"best practice\" interventions, the prognosis for established heart failure remains poor. Future research must therefore be directed at developing more effective strategies for the prevention of heart failure in our aging population.", 
    "182": "Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to characterize changes in left and right ventricular cardiac cycles following induction of experimental, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced, diabetes in male Wistar rats at different ages. The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril upon such chronic physiological changes were then evaluated, also for the first time. Diabetes was induced at the age of 7 weeks in two experimental groups, of which one group was subsequently maintained on captopril (2 g l(-1))-containing drinking water, and at 10 and 13 weeks in two further groups. The fifth group provided age-matched controls. All groups (each n = 4 animals) were scanned consistently at 16 weeks, in parallel with timings used in earlier studies that employed this experimental model. Cine magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition provided transverse sections through both ventricles at twelve time points covering systole and most of diastole. These yielded reconstructions of cardiac anatomy used to derive critical functional indices and their dependence upon time following the triggering electrocardiographic R waves. The left and right ventricular end-diastolic (EDV), end-systolic (ESV) and stroke volumes (SV), and ejection fractions (EF) calculated from each, control and experimental, group showed matching values. This confirmed a necessary condition requiring balanced right and left ventricular outputs and further suggested that STZ-induced diabetes produced physiological changes in both ventricles. Absolute left and right ventricular SVs were significantly altered in all diabetic animals; EDVs and EFs significantly altered in animals diabetic from 7 and 10 but not 13 weeks. When normalized to body weight, left and right ventricular SVs had significantly altered in animals diabetic from 7 and 10 weeks but not 13 weeks. Normalized left ventricular EDVs were also significantly altered in animals diabetic from 7 and 10 weeks. However, normalized right ventricular EDVs were significantly altered only in animals made diabetic from 7 weeks. Diabetic hearts showed major kinetic changes in left and right ventricular contraction (ejection) and relaxation (filling). Both the initial rates of volume change (dV/dt) in both ventricles and the plots of dV/dt values through the cardiac cycle demonstrated more gradual developments of tension during systole and relaxation during diastole. Estimates of the derived left ventricular performance parameters of cardiac output, cardiac power output and stroke work in control animals were comparable with human values when normalized to both body (or cardiac) weight and heart rate. All deteriorated with diabetes. Comparisons of experimental groups diabetic from 7 weeks demonstrated that captopril treatment relieved the alterations in critical volumes, dependence of SV upon EDV, kinetics of systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation and in the derived indicators of ventricular performance. This study represents the first demonstration using non-invasive MRI of early, chronic changes in diastolic filling and systolic ejection in both the left and the right ventricles and of their amelioration by ACE inhibition following STZ-induction of diabetes in intact experimental animals.", 
    "183": "A non-invasive cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was developed to allow, for the first time, detection and characterization of chronic changes in myocardial tissue volume and the effects upon these of treatment by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic male Wistar rats. Animals that had been made diabetic at the ages of 7, 10 and 13 weeks and a captopril-treated group of animals made diabetic at the age of 7 weeks were scanned. The findings were compared with the results from age-matched controls. All animal groups (n = 4 animals in each) were consistently scanned at 16 weeks. Left and right ventricular myocardial volumes were reconstructed from complete data sets of left and right ventricular transverse sections which covered systole and most of diastole using twelve equally incremented time points through the cardiac cycle. The calculated volumes remained consistent through all twelve time points of the cardiac cycle in all five experimental groups and agreed with the corresponding post-mortem determinations. These gave consistent myocardial densities whose values could additionally be corroborated by previous reports, confirming the validity of the quantitative MRI results and analysis. The myocardial volumes were conserved in animals whose diabetes was induced at 13 weeks but were significantly increased relative to body weight in animals made diabetic at 7 and 10 weeks. Captopril treatment, which was started immediately after induction of diabetes, prevented the development of this relative hypertrophy in both the left and right ventricles. We have thus introduced and validated quantitative MRI methods in a demonstration, for the first time, of chronic myocardial changes in both the right and left ventricles of STZ-diabetic rats and their prevention by the ACE inhibitor captopril.", 
    "184": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is a well-established principle in the treatment of hypertension, and numerous large scale clinical studies have clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) in hypertension. The clinical success of ACE inhibitors encouraged attempts to inhibit other key enzymes in the regulation of vascular tone, such as the neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Similar to ACE, NEP is an endothelial cell surface metalloproteinase, which is involved in the degradation of several regulatory peptides including the natriuretic peptides, and augments vasodilatation and natriuresis through increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. By inhibiting the RAS and potentiating the natriuretic peptide system at the same time, combined NEP/ACE inhibitors, the so-called \"vasopeptidase inhibitors,\" reduce vasoconstriction and enhance vasodilatation, and in turn decrease peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Within the vessel wall this may lead to a reduction of vasoconstrictor and proliferative mediators such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, and may increase local levels of bradykinin as well as natriuretic peptides. Based on these considerations, numerous preclinical studies with vasopeptidase inhibitors have been performed and reveal promising results in experimental hypertension. Correspondingly, large-scale clinical studies in patients with hypertension are on the way, to transfer the principle of vasopeptidase inhibition from bench to bedside.",

Because the cause is unknown, therapies are directed to improve peripheral blood circulation with vasodilators and antiplatelet aggregation drugs, to prevent the synthesis and release of harmful cytokines with immunosuppressant drugs, and to inhibit or reduce fibrosis with agents that reduce collagen synthesis or enhance collagenase production. The purpose of this review is to critically analyze conventional and new treatments of systemic sclerosis and localized scleroderma. The therapeutic options discussed for the treatment of systemic sclerosis include the use of (1) vasodilators (calcium channel blockers [nifedipine], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [captopril, losartan potassium], and prostaglandins [iloprost, epoprostenol]), (2) immunosuppressant drugs (methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and extracorporeal photopheresis), and (3) antifibrotic agents (D-penicillamine, colchicine, interferon gamma, and relaxin). The treatment options reviewed for localized scleroderma include the use of corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues (calcitriol, calcipotriene), UV-A, and methotrexate. Preliminary reports on new therapies for systemic sclerosis are also considered. These include the use of minocycline, psoralen-UV-A, lung transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation, etanercept, and thalidomide.",

To explore potential mechanisms for failure of PDGF A-chain to rescue mesangial cell phenotype, we investigated the biological effects and signaling pathways of PDGF AA and PDGF BB in metanephric mesenchymal (MM) cells isolated from rat kidney. PDGF AA caused modest cell migration but had no effect on DNA synthesis, unlike PDGF BB, which potently stimulated migration and DNA synthesis. PDGF AA and PDGF BB significantly increased the activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). PDGF BB was more potent than PDGF AA in activating PI 3-K or MAPK in these cells. Pretreatment of MM cells with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-098059 abrogated PDGF BB-induced DNA synthesis, whereas the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin had a very modest inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis (approximately Delta20%). On the other hand, wortmannin completely blocked PDGF AA- and PDGF BB-induced migration, whereas PD-098059 had a modest inhibitory effect on cell migration. These data demonstrate that activation of MAPK is necessary for the mitogenic effect of PDGF BB, whereas PI 3-K is required for the chemotactic effect of PDGF AA and PDGF BB. Although PDGF AA stimulates PI 3-K and MAPK activity, it is not mitogenic and only modestly chemotactic. Collectively, the data may have implications related to the failure of PDGF AA to rescue mesangial cell phenotype in PDGF B-chain or PDGF-beta-receptor deficiency.", 
    "209": "Young mice tolerate myocardial loss after coronary artery ligation (CAL) without congestive heart failure (CHF) signs or mortality. We predicted a CHF phenotype after CAL in aged mice. Left coronary artery ligation produced permanent myocardial infarcts (MI). Mortality was higher in male 14-mo-old C57BL/6N mice (Older mice) than in 2-mo-old mice (Young mice) (16 of 25 Older mice died vs. 0 of 10 Young mice, P < 0.02). After 8 wk, rales, weight loss, and lethargy preceded deaths. Captopril (50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) increased Older mouse survival (6 of 22 died, P < 0.02). Captopril improved systolic function (peak aortic blood velocity) from 76 +/- 6% of baseline in untreated Older mice to 93 +/- 8% (P < 0.036). At 24 h, MI comprised 28 +/- 4% of the left ventricle in Young mice, surprisingly larger than that in Older mice (18 +/- 2%, P < 0.011). Endocardial area underlying the infarct scar was significantly larger in Older mice than in Young mice. Captopril did not reduce expansion but markedly reduced septal hypertrophy. Aging reduces compensatory ability in mice despite smaller acute infarcts. Less effective myocardial repair, greater infarct expansion, and septal hypertrophy are seen with aging.

Will antiapoptotic agents act selectively on affected myocytes to provide clinical efficacy? Will antiapoptotic agents be effective, or will they be limited by dose heterogeneity? If antiapoptotic is proven to have long lasting efficacy, should it be used for all patients with myocardial infarction or confined only to patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Will antiapoptotic therapy be so effective that it replaces ACE inhibitors and betablockers, or will it always be used as an adjunct to an ACE inhibitor or a betablocker?

    "222": "To test the hypothesis that local vascular production of angiotensin II is necessary for the normal regulation of blood pressure, we engineered a new line of genetically altered mice that lack endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This was accomplished using a novel strategy of targeted homologous recombination to separate the transcriptional control of somatic ACE from its endogenous promoter and to substitute control to the albumin promoter. These new mice, termed ACE.3, do not produce ACE within the lung, the aorta, or any vascular structure. ACE activity within the kidney is only about 14% that of wild-type mice and is limited to tubular epithelium. In contrast, hepatic ACE expression in ACE.3 mice is about 87-fold that of wild-type. The blood pressure, plasma angiotensin II levels, response to ACE inhibitors, and renal function of ACE.3(-/-) mice are indistinguishable from littermate wild-type mice. These data show that, under basal conditions, the normal regulation of blood pressure and renal function is possible in a mouse devoid of endothelial ACE.",

Construction of concentration-response curves to Ang I and II in porcine femoral arteries, in the absence or presence of the AT(1) or AT(2) receptor antagonists irbesartan and PD123319, revealed that the approximately 2 fold difference in potency between Ang I and II was not due to stimulation of different AT receptor populations by exogenous and locally generated Ang II. 3. Measurement of Ang I and II and their metabolites at the time of vasoconstriction confirmed that, at equimolar application of Ang I and II, bath fluid Ang II during Ang I was approximately 18 times lower than during Ang II and that Ang II was by far the most important metabolite of Ang I. Tissue Ang II was 2.9+/-1.5% and 12.2+/-2.4% of the corresponding Ang I and II bath fluid levels, and was not affected by irbesartan or PD123319, suggesting that it was located extracellularly. 4. Since approximately 15% of tissue weight consists of interstitial fluid, it can be calculated that interstitial Ang II levels during Ang II resemble bath fluid Ang II levels, whereas during Ang I they are 8.8 - 27 fold higher. Consequently at equimolar application of Ang I and II, the interstitial Ang II levels differ only 2 - 4 fold. 5. Interstitial, rather than circulating Ang II determines vasoconstriction. Arterial Ang I, resulting in high interstitial Ang II levels via its local conversion by ACE, may be of greater physiological importance than arterial Ang II.",

The role of a constitutively active population of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors was analysed in arteries obtained from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and controls (WKY) divided into three groups: young prehypertensive, adult hypertensive, and adult animals chronically treated with captopril (50 mg kg(-1) per day orally) in order to prevent the hypertensive state. 2. In adult SHR, a significant increase in BMY 7378 potency (not in prazosin potency) was observed in aorta, mesenteric artery, and the first and second branches of the small mesenteric arteries with respect to WKY rats. This difference was not observed in iliac and tail arteries, which suggests an increased functional role of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors only in some vessels of SHR. 3. The increase in the resting tone (IRT) observed in absence of agonist, inhibited by BMY 7378, that represents the constitutively active population of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, was also significantly greater in aorta and mesenteric artery from adult SHR. 4. In young and captopril treated adult animals, no differences between strains with respect to BMY 7378 potency, or IRT were observed. 5. The increase in the functional role of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors and their constitutive activity observed in hypertension is prevented by captopril treatment. The pathological consequence of this change is the slower rate of recovery of the basal tone after removal of an adrenergic stimulus, observed in vessels from hypertensive animals that had shown an increase in the functionality of constitutively active alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors. This change was not observed in prehypertensive or captopril treated animals.",

We evaluated whether inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) would influence reparative angiogenesis in a murine model of limb ischaemia. 2. Perfusion recovery following surgical removal of the left femoral artery was analysed by laser Doppler flowmetry in mice given the ACE inhibitor ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) per day), the AT(1) antagonist losartan (15 mg kg(-1) per day), or vehicle. Muscular capillarity was examined at necroscopy. Ramipril-induced effects were also studied under combined blockade of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors. Furthermore, the effects of ischaemia on AT(1) gene expression and ACE activity were determined. 3. In untreated mice, muscular AT(1a) gene expression was transiently decreased early after induction of limb ischaemia, whereas AT(1b) mRNA was up-regulated. ACE activity was reduced in ischaemic muscles at 1 and 3 days. Gene expression of AT(1) isoforms as well as ACE activity returned to basal values by day 14. Spontaneous neovascularization allowed for complete perfusion recovery of the ischaemic limb after 21 days. 4. Reparative angiogenesis was negatively influenced by either ramipril (P<0.02) or losartan (P<0.01), leading to delayed and impaired post-ischaemic recovery (50 - 70% less compared with controls). Ramipril-induced effects remained unaltered under kinin receptor blockade. 5. The present study indicates that (a) expression of angiotensin II AT(1) receptors and ACE activity are modulated by ischaemia, (b) ACE-inhibition or AT(1) antagonism impairs reparative angiogenesis, and (c) intact AT(1) receptor signalling is essential for post-ischaemic recovery. These results provide new insights into the role of the RAS in vascular biology and suggest cautionary use of ACE inhibitors and AT(1) antagonists in patients at risk for developing peripheral ischaemia.",

After treatment withdrawal, SBP rose gradually reaching the level of control group within four weeks' follow-up. In functional bioassay of ACE inhibitory activity, effect of the tripeptides on angiotensin I or angiotensin II-induced contraction in rat mesenteric arteries was evaluated. IPP inhibited the angiotensin I-induced contraction, whereas the angiotensin II-induced contraction remained unaltered. In conclusion, long-term intake of IPP and VPP, or a sour milk containing these tripeptides attenuated the development of hypertension in SHR. One possible mechanism underlying this effect is ACE inhibition.",

However, cardiac autonomic abnormalities in non-ischemic (hypertensive) heart failure, which is prevalent in Black Africans is poorly documented. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 32 patients with congestive heart failure, mostly secondary to hypertension (aged 52 +/- 15 years, with ejection fraction of 0.38 +/- 11) and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (aged 51 +/- 11 years, 14 males/16 females). Cardiac autonomic function was assessed by the Valsalva's maneuver, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (for cardiac vagal tone) and the pressor and chronotropic changes following forearm isometric handgrip exercise and the assumption of upright posture (tests of sympathetic function). The exercise tolerance of the cardiac patients was assessed by the distance covered during 6 min of walking. The Valsalva ratio was significantly lower in chronic heart failure, 1.10 +/- 0.08 compared to the healthy controls 1.47 +/- 0.20 (p<0.001). Specifically, the phase IV bradycardia in heart failure, was significantly attenuated to 650 +/- 121 msec compared to the value of 935 +/- 101 msec in healthy controls (p<0.001). The phase 11 Valsalva tachycardia did not differ between the patients and controls. The respiratory sinus arrhythmia was also significantly reduced in chronic heart failure (p<0.05) compared to controls. Treatment of the heart failure patients with enalapril-digoxin and diuretics by 4 weeks, resulted in a reversal of the autonomic abnormalities. The phase IV bradycardia increased significantly to 798 +/- 164 msec (p<0.01) and the Valsalva ratio to 1.35 +/- 0.25 (p<0.01) and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia increased toward normal. There was close positive correlation between the Valsalva's ratio and the 6 min self paced distance covered (r = 0.44, p = 0.03 ANOVA), and a weak inverse correlation to cardiac size and cardiothoracic ratio (r = -0.31, p = 0.09). This study demonstrates cardiac autonomic dysfunction (especially reduced vagal tone) in Black Nigerians with mainly non-ischemic congestive heart failure. The parasympathetic dysfunction significantly correlates with severity of heart failure. Current treatment reverses autonomic dysfunction to values seen in healthy age matched controls, mainly through augmentation of cardiac parasympathetic activity.",

After positive inotropic stimulation using dobutamine stress echocardiography, the aortic valve area increased to 1.5 cm2 indicating an only moderate aortic stenosis.

To test the hypothesis that the benefits seen were not due to reduced blood pressure alone, we calculated blood-pressure-related risk estimates from the placebo group of the HOPE trial, and from earlier studies. We found that the benefits seen in HOPE were around three times greater than predicted from these calculations. In this well treated and largely normotensive population with coronary disease, but good left-ventricular function, the benefits from ramipril were additive to other proven therapies in normotensive patients and in those with higher baseline blood pressure.",

    "240": "A feasibility study was conducted using systematic review, meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness methods.", 
    "241": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) develops in about 1500 Australians each year. Of these, about 1000 are over 50 years of age (an incidence of about 200 per million, per year). Proteinuria, which is present in about 5% of the general population, confers an approximately 15-fold increased risk for ESRD. Twelve randomized trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), in 1943 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, hypertension and proteinuria, showed that the risk of developing ESRD can be reduced by about 30% over a 2- to 3-year period. In a general-practice-based screening model involving: (i) an opportunistic single dipstick test for protein, (ii) a confirming 24-h urine test for protein and (iii) commencement of ACEi in appropriate individuals, 20 000 people over 50 years of age would need to be screened to prevent one case of ESRD. To achieve this, approximately 100 people would need to be treated with ACEi for 2 to 3 years, and 1,000 would need to have a 24-h urine protein test (and of these, 700 would be false positives). Such a strategy may save health dollars but some critical research questions are still unanswered. What is an individual's risk of developing ESRD, given values for proteinuria, blood pressure and renal function? What is the benefit of ACEi in screen-detected cases, which are at low risk of ESRD? What psychological and physical harm is caused by screening, including the specific renal investigations and treatments that follow on from proteinuria detection?", 
    "242": "Given available data, screening middle-aged and older Australians for proteinuria and treating some with ACEi is, at best, a promising primary prevention strategy for preventing ESRD. However, a large population-based cohort study, with nested trial of ACEi, is still required to evaluate whether this model of screening for renal disease does more harm than good.", 
    "243": "We recently observed that the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) rapidly declines in a subgroup of Type 2 diabetic patients (D) with abnormalities of albumin excretion rate (AER) and typical diabetic nephropathy, despite tight blood pressure control. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether amelioration of blood glucose control, using insulin, improves the course of GFR. GFR decay was measured by spline modeling analysis of the plasma clearance rate of 51CR-EDTA, assessed every 6 months. We identified two groups of D using morphometric analysis of renal biopsy, who had values of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and fractional mesangial volume (Vv mes/glom) respectively below (Group A: 38) or above (Group B: 50) the mean+2SD of values found in 27 kidney donors (GBM: 389 nm; Vv mes/glom: 0.25), as previously described in detail. Median AER was similar at base line in the 2 groups (109 microg/min, 29-1950, in Group A, 113 microg/min, 37-1845, in Group B; n.s.). Conventional metabolic therapy (sulphonylureas and/or biguanides) was used both in Group A and B during a 3 year follow-up period (Period 1). Group B was further divided in two subgroups with body mass index below (Group B, a) and above (Group B, b) the value of 30 kg/m2. Mean +/- SD HbA1c was 8.2 +/- 1.6% in Group A, 8.3 +/- 1.7% in Group B (a) (n.s.) and 9.1 +/- 1.7% in Group B (b) (n.s.). Tight blood pressure control was achieved and maintained using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or beta blockers and/or calcium antagonists and/or thiazides. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was 92 +/- 3 mmHg in Group A and 91 +/- 4 mmHg in Group B (n.s.). GFR decay was significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (Group A vs B: +1.21 +/- 0.71 vs -5.86 +/- 1.61 ml/min/1.73 m2/year). Median AER significantly rose in Group B (177 microg/min, p<0.05 vs base line) but not in Group A (134 microg/min, n.s.) during the third year of follow-up. Groups A and B were then followed over 4.1 years (range 3.1-4.4) (Period 2) maintaining the above described antihypertensive regimen, resulting in MAP values similar to those described during Period 1. Group A patients were treated with the same conventional glycemic control during Period 2. Group B (a) was conversely treated with intensive insulin therapy to achieve a HbA1c value below 7.5% (3 daily injections of regular and 1 or 2 daily injections of intermediate acting insulin associated with metformin 500 mg twice daily in 64% of the patients). Group B (b) patients were only treated by metformin (850 mg thrice daily) to achieve a HbA1c value below 7.5%. HbA1c decreased below the 7.5% target value in Group B (a) (7.0 +/- 1.6%, p<0.01 vs Period 1), but not in Group B (b) (8.0 +/- 1.6%, p<0.05 vs Period 1) and in Group A (8.3 +/- 1.7%, n.s. vs Period 1). The GFR decay of Group B, a during Period 2 was lower than that during Period 1 (Period 1 vs Period 2: -5.9 +/- 1.8 vs -1.8 +/- 0.7 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, p<0.01). GFR decay during Period 2 was similar to that observed during Period 1 in Group A (Period 1 vs Period 2: +1.21 +/- 0.71 vs +0.7 +/- 0.6 ml/min/1.73 ml/year, n.s.) and in Group B (b) (Period 1 vs Period 2: -4.4 +/- 0.71 vs -4.2 +/- 0.6 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, n.s.). Median AER did not significantly change in the fourth year of Period 2 , either in Group A or B (Group A vs B: 141 vs 152 microg/min, n.s.). In conclusion, our findings seem to suggest that amelioration of blood glucose control is attained both by insulin and metformin intensive treatment, but only insulin decreases and maintains HbA1c levels below 7.5%.

For comparison, a physical mixture with beta-CD and colyophilized mixtures with trehalose and dextran were also prepared and subjected to a similar chemical stability test at 80 degrees C followed by HPLC analysis. Significant inhibition of degradation was observed only for colyophilized miscible mixtures with beta-CD and HP-beta-CD at molar ratios in excess of 1:1. Colyophilized mixtures with trehalose and dextran, shown to have phase separated, and the physical mixture with beta-CD exhibited no inhibiting effects. This suggests that specific molecular complexation is responsible for the significant inhibition by the beta-CDs. The tendency of quinapril to form molecular complexes in solution with the beta-CDs was measured by (1)H solution NMR, by estimating complexation constants from the chemical shift of specific groups on quinapril. Supporting evidence for solid-state complexation was provided by FTIR analysis. DSC and TSC measurements indicated that the beta-CDs do not have high enough glass transition temperatures to reduce reactivity by reducing molecular mobility.",

To evaluate lipid solubility of a group of cardiovascular agents a procedure to determine partition coefficients in n-octanol/water for a series of cardiovascular compounds was described. Ultraviolet absorbance measurements were used to assess partitioning between the two liquid phases of these compounds. In this study, sotalol was found to be the most hydrophilic (n-octanol/water ratio of 0.33) and fosinopril-sodium was the most lipophilic (ratio of 6.19). This is a versatile method permitting the evaluation of lipophilicity and, thus, parameters governing the events leading to pharmacologic actions such as gastrointestinal dissolution, absorption, and bioavailability. These observations can be related to a drug series, composed of several compounds having structural similarities or minor variations. The lipid solubility of a compound can markedly alter its side-effects profile, especially because lipophilic drugs enter the central nervous system with facility. Additionally, lipophilic agents may enter target tissue with greater ease than nonlipophilic compounds and thus possess local intracellular effects in addition to a macro systemic action.",

    "265": "Enalapril is an antihypertensive drug of the class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) used in pregnancy for treatment of pre-existing or pregnancy-induced hypertension. The use of ACE inhibitors (drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system) during the second and third trimester of pregnancy in humans is associated with specific fetal and neonatal injury. The syndrome, termed \"ACEI fetopathy\" in humans, does not appear to have a similar counterpart in experimental animals. The present paper reviews pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of enalapril that are physiologically important during pregnancy and intrauterine development in humans and in experimental animal species with the aim of better understanding the comparability of the manifestations of enalapril developmental toxicity in animals and humans. The human fetus is at a disadvantage with regard to in utero enalapril exposure in comparison to some of the animal species for which gestational pharmacokinetic data are available. Important reasons for the higher vulnerability of the human fetus are its accessibility by enalapril and the earlier (relative to animal species) intrauterine development of organ systems that are specific targets of ACEI pharmacologic effect (the kidney and the renin-angiotensin system). In humans, these systems develop prior to calcarial ossification at the end of first trimester of pregnancy. The specific pharmacodynamic action of enalapril on these systems during fetal life is the chief determinant of the etiology and pathogenesis of ACEI fetopathy in humans. In contrast, in most of the studied animal species, these target systems are not developed until close to term when the fetus is relatively more mature (and therefore less vulnerable), so that the window of vulnerability is narrower in comparison to the human. Among animal species, the best concordance in fetal pharmacodynamics to the human is seen in the rhesus monkey, but further studies are necessary to determine if similar developmental pathology is induced in this animal model upon repeated administration of the drug during the relevant period of intrauterine development. Animal-human concordance of developmental toxicity is least likely in the rat because of greater disparities in enalapril availability to the fetus and the relative development of the kidney and skeletal ossification compared to that in humans.",

We report the first case of DIL caused by lisinopril. Our patient had negative results on ANA testing and had histone antibodies (IgG anti-[H2A-H2B]-DNA) mirroring the disease course. Antibodies to the (H2A-H2B)-DNA complex are seen in more than 90% of patients with active DIL, excluding those with DIL due to hydralazine.

The study was conducted on 44 subjects with chronic, stable CAD and 54 myocardial infarction patients (15 treated with streptokinase and 39 subjected to primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, PTCA). The patients were divided into two subgroups: treated and untreated with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), enalapril. Activation of the fibrinolytic system and the prekallikrein during the exercise test was demonstrated. No significant kininogen consumption was observed. A decrease in kininase activity was found. The results suggest the possibilities of endothelial cells contribution to plasminogen activation in CAD patients. Kininogen and kallikrein directly, or through the released kinins, may participate in regulation of endothelial cell hemostatic functions. Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin may undergo under the influence of kallikrein. The bradykinin induces the tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) secretion, which depends also on the increased blood flow during the exercise test.",

The effect of captopril, an ACE inhibitor on Na, K-ATPase activities was also determined and correlated to morphological changes. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg) in male Long-Evans rats. ACE activity was inhibited by captopril (10 mg/kg given in the drinking water) for 1 month. Na, K-ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically or by a radioassay (32P-labeled ATP). The activity of ACE was determined by a radioassay using tritiated benzoyl-gly-gly-gly as substrate. Both the alpha1 and alpha2/alpha3 isoforms of Na, K-ATPase were present in the microvascular and neural compartments of retinas, whereas only one isoform, the alpha2/alpha3, was found in the RPE. In 2-month diabetic rats, the activity of the alpha2/alpha3 isoform was reduced in both the microvascular and neural compartments of retinas, while the activity of the alpha1 isoform was reduced only in the neural isolates. ACE activity was significantly decreased in the retinal neural compartment and unaltered in the microvascular compartment from 2-month diabetic rats. In 5-month diabetic rats, Na, K-ATPase activity was moderately but not significantly reduced in RPE preparations. Ultrastructural studies revealed a significant deepening of basal infoldings in the RPE and a noticeable increase in the size of the extracellular space between the basal infoldings of 5-month diabetic animals. Captopril stimulated Na, K-ATPase activity in the neural retina, but not in the RPE. Diabetes-induced morphological changes in the RPE were not improved by captopril. An enlargement of intercellular space between the RPE cells was a frequent finding in the treated group. In conclusion, captopril stimulated Na, K-ATPase activity in the neural retina of diabetic rats. This stimulation seems to be beneficial to the neural retina. ACE inhibition, however, did not improve RPE morphological changes. Although the clinical significance of increased intercellular spacing between RPE cells in treated animals is not clearly established, we speculate that it might contribute to an increased alteration of their barrier function. Additional studies are necessary to assess both the desirable and adverse effects of captopril and other ACE inhibitors in the retinas of diabetic patients.",

There is increasing clinical evidence that combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an AII receptor blocker (ARB) reduces proteinuria and blood pressure in patients with renal disease, although the mechanism of this synergistic effect remains poorly defined. This study tested whether the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB reduces plasma AII (AIIp) and kidney tissue AII (AIIk) beyond what is observed with either of these two agents alone. Mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, AIIp, and AIIk were measured in four groups of Wistar rats after 2 weeks of a low-salt diet and 1 week of treatment with captopril (2.4 mg/d), losartan (1.7 mg/d), combination captopril+losartan (1.7 mg/d of captopril, 0.7 mg/d of losartan), or no treatment (control). Administration of captopril, losartan, and captopril+losartan produced statistically significant reductions in mean arterial pressure (control, 130 +/- 4 mm Hg; captopril, 92 +/- 5 mm Hg; losartan, 88 +/- 4 mm Hg; captopril+losartan, 104 +/- 5 mm Hg) and mild reductions in glomerular filtration rate (control, 3.1 +/- 0.1 mL/min; captopril, 2.2 +/- 0.3 mL/min; losartan, 1.7 +/- 0.3 mL/min; captopril+losartan, 2.3 +/- 0.3 mL/min) when compared with control rats, but no significant differences were observed among the treated groups. Captopril and captopril +losartan reduced AIIp significantly when compared with control (captopril, 43 +/- 8 pg/mL; captopril+losartan, 47 +/- 5 pg/mL; control, 134 pg/mL) and with losartan (99 +/- 2 pg/mL). AIIk values were reduced in captopril (254 +/- 18 pg/g kidney weight) and losartan (292 +/- 33 pg/g kidney weight) when compared with control (1,235 +/- 79 pg/g kidney weight). Captopril+losartan (136 +/- 17 pg/g kidney weight) reduced AIIk to values significantly lower than captopril or losartan alone. Higher doses of captopril (5 mg/d and 7.5 mg/d) or losartan (4 mg/d and 6 mg/d) alone did not reduce AIIk to the levels observed with combination low doses of captopril+losartan. Combining low doses of ACE inhibitor plus ARB reduces AIIk more than higher doses of either agent alone. This reduction in AIIk with ACE inhibitor plus ARB provides a mechanism to understand the synergism of this combination in reducing proteinuria and blood pressure. The reduction in AIIk with ACE inhibitor plus ARB may have important implications in long-term organ protection in hypertension and renal disease.",

Forty hypertensive patients aged 60-76 years underwent 24-h ABPM at the end of the run-in (week 4) and active treatment (week 9) periods. The mean 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 161.9 (26.7) mm Hg to 150.6 (29.9) mm Hg (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 91.70 (14.7) mm Hg to 84.2 (17.3) mm Hg (P < 0.001). No episodes of mean arterial pressure (MAP) <50 mm Hg were seen during the placebo period. Instead 11 episodes were observed during the antihypertensive treatment (one in the 3 mg group and 10 in the 6 mg group, P < 0.01 between the two treatment groups). Fifty-four episodes of MAP <70 mm Hg were observed during the placebo period and 117 during the treatment period (P < 0.001). During the placebo period low MAPs were observed only during night time.

The study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group controlled trial. A total of 136 patients judged to have ACE-inhibitor cough during single-blind enalapril treatment which was lost during a subsequent placebo washout phase, were randomised to receive either eprosartan 300 mg twice daily, or enalapril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for 6 weeks. Self-completion questionnaires assessing quality of life and cough were examined at baseline and end of study. At study end point 23% of patients in the enalapril group and 5% in the eprosartan and placebo groups reported cough (which included definite, probable and possible coughs) (P = 0.02). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, the eprosartan group was not significantly different from either placebo or enalapril. There were no significant differences in the Psychological General Wellbeing Index (PGWB). In conclusion the incidence of self-reported cough on eprosartan was similar to that on placebo, and lower than on enalapril but this difference was not significant when adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. There were no differences in quality of life.", 
    "294": "The objective of this study was to compare quality of life and incidence of dry persistent cough among patients treated with eprosartan and enalapril for mild-moderate hypertension. This was a randomised 26-week double-blind controlled trial carried out in clinics in nine countries of North America, Europe and South Africa. A total of 529 patients aged 18 and over with diastolic blood pressure between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg were studied. Treatment comprised of eprosartan or enalapril monotherapy for 12 weeks with the option of hydrochlorothiazide addition for the remaining 14 weeks. The primary outcome measures were cough and the Psychological General Wellbeing Index (PGWB) total and subscales (anxiety, self-control, depression, general health, positive wellbeing and vitality). The results were that 17.8% of enalapril patients and 13.2% of eprosartan patients withdrew from randomised treatment. Those on enalapril were twice as likely to have gained a definite or possible cough by study end point as those on eprosartan (7.6% vs 3.2%) P = 0.099. At monotherapy end point the differences were greater (9.9% vs 2.1%) and of statistical significance, P = 0.001. Patients treated with enalapril, however, had small but significant improvements in measures of self-control and total PGWB compared with those on eprosartan. The effect sizes of 0.2 or less indicated that there were small differences. In conclusion eprosartan was associated with fewer coughs than enalapril but it performed less well on some aspects of quality of life.",

This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial carried out in 11 Spanish hospitals. A total of 103 type 2 diabetic patients with stable albuminuria and BP not controlled on monotherapy were randomised of which 93 finished the study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg (VT) or to enalapril/hydroclorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (EH). Treatment duration was 6 months. The main outcome measures were changes in BP, 24-h albuminuria, blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Overall BP was significantly reduced from 157.3 +/- 12.0/98.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 140.5 +/- 14.5/86.1 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and albuminuria significantly decreased from 508.6 +/- 693.8 mg/24 h to 253.4 +/- 517.2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001), both without significant differences between treatments. Glycated haemoglobin was not modified on VT: baseline, 5.91 +/- 1.43%; end of treatment, 5.94 +/- 1.62%, but increased on EH: baseline, 5.96 +/- 1.25%; final, 6.41 +/- 1.51%, (ANOVA interaction P = 0.040). At the end of the study, a blood glucose <126 mg/dL was attained in 72.7% of the VT group-improving in 29.5% and worsening in 6.8% of patients (P = 0.021)-and in 50% of the EH group, 13.6% of patients improved and 11.4% worsened (P = 1.000). There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine, uric acid, potassium, cholesterol, tryglicerides and serum albumin. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients not controlled on monotherapy, both treatments similarly reduced albuminuria. The combination verapamil/ trandolapril seems to allow a better metabolic control than enalapril/hydroclorothiazide.", 
    "296": "A case report of fosinopril-induced angioedema of the intestine with a chronic course accompanied by multiple acute exacerbations is described. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema of the intestine (AIAI) occurs in a minority of patients taking an ACE inhibitor. The clinical presentation encompasses acute abdominal symptoms, pronounced bowel edema and ascites with occasional facial and/or oropharyngeal swelling. AIAI is diagnosed based on the temporal relationship between the symptomatic presentation and drug use, absence of alternative diagnoses including other causes of angioedema, and the prompt resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Prompt radiological investigation (abdominal computerized tomography and/or ultrasound) is critical in making an early diagnosis and in preventing unnecessary surgical intervention. There is a female predominance of AIAI, which may reflect the interaction of estradiol with the various pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AIAI. Management of AIAI consists mainly of conservative measures and discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be considered as appropriate alternatives. Awareness and knowledge of AIAI are important because of the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, current delays in making the diagnosis, obvious management strategies once the diagnosis is made and the dysutility of alternative diagnoses, which may lead to considerable morbidity. AIAI must be considered in patients taking ACE inhibitors who develop gastrointestinal complaints irrespective of the duration of the therapy.",

Elderly patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and anticoagulants less frequently than younger patients did. The 1-year mortality rate was significantly higher in patients > or =70 years old (22% vs 13.7%, P <.001). Age was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality, increasing 2.8% by each year of age. Independent predictors of 1-year mortality in elderly patients were (1) > or =1 hospital admission in the previous year (relative risk [RR] 2.09, 95% CI 1.51-2.87), (2) systolic blood pressure (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99), (3) NYHA class III-IV (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.20-2.07), and (4) age (RR 1.028, 95% CI 1.001-1.056).",

    "301": "The influence of angiotensin II (ANGII) on the dynamic characteristics of renal blood flow (RBF) was studied in conscious dogs by testing the response to a step increase in renal artery pressure (RAP) after a 60 s period of pressure reduction (to 50 mmHg) and by calculating the transfer function between physiological fluctuations in RAP and RBF. During the RAP reduction, renal vascular resistance (RVR) decreased and upon rapid restoration of RAP, RVR returned to baseline with a characteristic time course: within the first 10 s, RVR rose rapidly by 40 % of the initial change (first response, myogenic response). A second rise began after 20-30 s and reached baseline after an overshoot at 40 s (second response, tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF)). Between both responses, RVR rose very slowly (plateau). The transfer function had a low gain below 0.01 Hz (high autoregulatory efficiency) and two corner frequencies at 0.026 Hz (TGF) and at 0.12 Hz (myogenic response). Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) lowered baseline RVR, but not the minimum RVR at the end of the RAP reduction (autoregulation-independent RVR). Both the first and second response were reduced, but the normalised level of the plateau (balance between myogenic response, TGF and possible slower mechanisms) and the transfer gain below 0.01 Hz were not affected. Infusion of ANGII after ramipril raised baseline RVR above the control condition. The first and second response and the transfer gain at both corner frequencies were slightly augmented, but the normalised level of the plateau was not affected. It is concluded that alterations of plasma ANGII within a physiological range do not modulate the relative contribution of the myogenic response to the overall short-term autoregulation of RBF. Consequently, it appears that ANGII augments not only TGF, but also the myogenic response.", 
    "302": "The renal medulla is sensitive to hypoxia, and a depression of medullary circulation, e.g. in response to angiotensin II (Ang II), could endanger the function of this zone. Earlier data on Ang II effects on medullary vasculature were contradictory. The effects of Ang II on total renal blood flow (RBF), and cortical and medullary blood flow (CBF and MBF: by laser-Doppler flux) were studied in anaesthetised rats. Ang II infusion (30 ng kg(-1) min(-1) i.v.) decreased RBF 27 +/- 2 % (mean +/- S.E.M.), whereas MBF increased 12 +/- 2 % (both P < 0.001). Non-selective blockade of Ang II receptors with saralasin (3 microg kg(-1) min(-1) i.v.) increased RBF 12 +/- 2 % and decreased MBF 8 +/- 2 % (P < 0.001). Blockade of AT(1) receptors with losartan (10 mg kg(-1)) increased CBF 10 +/- 2 % (P < 0.002) and did not change MBF. Losartan given during Ang II infusion significantly increased RBF (53 +/- 7 %) and decreased MBF (27 +/- 7 %). Blockade of AT(2) receptors with PD 123319 (50 microg kg(-1) min(-1) i.v.) did not change CBF or MBF. Intramedullary infusion of PD 123319 (10 microg min(-1)) superimposed on intravenous Ang II infusion did not change RBF, but slightly decreased MBF (4 +/- 2 %, P < 0.05). We conclude that in anaesthetised surgically prepared rats, exogenous or endogenous Ang II may not depress medullary circulation. In contrast to the usual vasoconstriction in the cortex, vasodilatation was observed, possibly related to secondary activation of vasodilator paracrine agents rather than to a direct action via AT(2) receptors.",

    "308": "The circulating renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. More importantly, the local tissue renin angiotensin plays a pivotal role in cell growth and remodelling of cardiomyocytes and on the peripheral arterial vasculature. In addition, the renin angiotensin system is related to apoptosis, control of baroreflex and autonomic responses, vascular remodelling and regulation of coagulation, inflammation and oxidation. The cardioprotective and vascular protective effects of the angiotensin receptive blockade appears to be related to selective blockade of the angiotensin II (A-II) Type I (AT(1)) receptors. However, there is now growing evidence showing that some of the effects of AT-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are related to the activation of the kinin pathways. This paper will review some of the recent mechanisms related to the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin and more specifically of ARBs. This paper will present the novel data on the role of ARB in the development of atherosclerosis, vascular remodelling, coagulation balance and autonomic regulation. Finally, the role of ARBs, used alone or in combination with ACE inhibitor in patients with heart failure, will be discussed.",

Early intravenous beta-blockade should be used during acute MI. beta-blockers should be continued indefinitely. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used in patients with acute MI with ST-segment elevation in two or more anterior precordial leads. ACE inhibitors should be used during and after acute MI in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) or with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =40%. There are no class I indications for using calcium channel antagonists during and after acute MI. Intravenous heparin should be used in patients with acute MI undergoing coronary revascularisation and in patients at high risk for systemic embolisation. Enoxaparin should be used in patients with non-Q-wave MI. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered in patients with acute MI with ST-segment elevation in contiguous leads of a 12-lead electrocardiogram or with left bundle branch block. Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be administered intravenously as an adjunct to heparin and aspirin in patients with non-Q-wave MI. Intravenous nitroglycerin should be used: (i) for the first 24 to 48 hours in patients with acute MI and CHF, large anterior MI, persistent ischaemia or hypertension; and (ii) continued beyond 48 hours in patients with recurrent angina pectoris or persistent pulmonary congestion. Long-acting nitrates should be given after MI, along with beta-blockers, to patients with angina pectoris. There are no class I indications for using intravenous magnesium during acute MI. The routine use of antiarrhythmic drugs other than beta-blockers during and after acute MI is not recommended.", 
    "310": "Previous studies in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have revealed abnormalities of cellular volume that might have an impact on the dysregulation of peripheral vascular resistance. Human mononuclear leukocytes (HML) represent a model for the study of cellular volume regulation. We investigated the impact of enalapril and carvedilol on HML volume and on the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger in 26 patients with CHF and 20 volunteers. Over a period of 4 weeks, 18 patients received enalapril in addition to the previous therapy while 8 patients additionally received carvedilol. HML diameters and the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger were measured by a Coulter Counter. Both patient groups showed abnormally increased initial volumes of HML compared to the volunteer group at baseline. Four weeks of therapy with enalapril in addition to therapy with diuretics and digoxin did not result in a statistically significant reduction of lymphocyte volume, whereas add-on therapy with carvedilol to therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin reduced the volume significantly. Alterations could not be found in the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger in either patient group compared to volunteers. Supplementary drug therapy with carvedilol in patients with CHF leads to a reduction of the increased lymphocytic volume, possibly reflecting the beneficial effect of beta-blockade.", 
    "311": "Hypotension associated with the rapid infusion of human serum albumin products was first recognised in Australasia in the early 1970s. An association with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor class of drugs (ACE-I) followed, leading to a proposed mechanism involving bradykinin generation through pre-kallikrein activator (PKA) presence in the infused fluid. The newer generation albumin products (Albumex) contain very low concentrations of PKA and are generally thought safe to use in most patient populations. Anecdotal reports of paradoxical hypotension with rapid infusion of 4% albumin in our department led to an audit of practice over three months. Four out of 36 patients (11%) who received 4% albumin intravenously experienced paradoxical hypotension. Three of these patients were taking ACE-I preoperatively (P=0.04). There was no observed hypotension associated with intravenous infusion of crystalloid fluid. We believe 4% albumin should be used with caution, particularly in those patients receiving ACE-I preoperatively.",

Baseline EF prior to beta blocker initiation (carvedilol = 6, atenolol = 1, metoprolol 1) was measured with isotope ventriculography (IVG), echocardiography, or left ventriculography. Post beta blocker ejection fraction (post BB EF) was measured in all patients with IVG at a mean of 17.25 +/- 5.38 months. Follow-up EF was measured using IVG after digoxin withdrawal at a mean of 6.99 +/- 4.34 months.",

Ramipril therapy resulted in an important reduction of proteinuria (0.3-0.5 g/24 h): no changes were observed in arterial pressure and renal function during the 12-month follow-up. We conclude that treatment with ramipril can be employed effectively and safely in GSD Ia patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria.",

In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by CHF, LQ was found to be related to the degree of hemodynamic disorders and to significantly improves with complex treatment of a tuberculous process and with correction of hemodynamic disorders.", 
    "319": "The effects of captopril (the inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme) and of angiotensins II and IV (3-8 fragment of angiotensin II) on cell proliferation of the prostatic epithelium was investigated in the rat. The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into cell nuclei was used as an index of cell proliferation. It was found that the treatment with captopril resulted in the suppression of prostatic epithelial cell proliferation. The antiproliferative effect of captopril was reversed (at least partially) by a simultaneous treatment with either angiotensin II or angiotensin IV. The effects of angiotensins were not blocked by the administration of losartan--AT1 angiotensin receptor blocker. These findings suggest the involvement of angiotensins in the control of prostatic growth, acting via the receptors different from the AT1-subtype (presumably via AT4 receptors).",

It is well established that elderly hypertensive patients benefit from drug treatment with regards to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Due to the comorbidity and reduced quality of life (QOL) in the elderly, drug-induced changes of well-being and QOL are especially important to maintain compliance and social abilities. Whereas in most studies different antihypertensive agents exerted similar influences on QOL, Captopril was found to be superior to other antihypertensives in some trials.",

An improvement of QOL was only seen with Quinapril, mainly due to better mood and lower depression scores. Analysis of underlying psychosocial factors on QOL found lack of social support, female sex and a current life event as additional significant negative influences on QOL.",

    "324": "Proteinuria is the hallmark of renal disease and proteinuria exceeding 1 gm a day in patients with renal disease augers a poorer prognosis. Proteinuria has been shown to be tubulotoxic and directly contributes to renal deterioration. Patients with non-selective proteinuria are more likely to have progressive renal disease. Diabetic patients with persistent microhaematuria have about 20 times the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. In essential hypertension, the onset of de novo proteinuria after years of adequate BP control is a marker of subsequent decline in renal function. In glomerulonephritis, more severe proteinuria is associated with faster rate of progression. Even though the initial phase of proteinuria in patients with glomerulonephritis is usually of immunological origin, in the vast majority of patients with established disease, the latter progressive phase of proteinuric glomerulopathy is the result of glomerular hyperfiltration which shifts glomerular non-selective pores to larger dimensions resulting in excessive leakage of protein in the urine. Endothelial injury resulting from glomerular hyperfiltration causes increase in local generation of Angiotensin II in the kidney as part of the hemodynamic response. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ATRA) can improve glomerular pore-selectivity by remodelling the glomerular basement membrane. In addition, these agents also have beneficial effects by decreasing TGF-beta production therapy decreasing mesangial cell proliferation, hence ameliorating disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy and IgA nephropathy. A number of recent clinical trials have shown that ACEI and ATRA therapy can retard the progression of renal deterioration in patients with NIDDM and those with IgA nephropathy and even restore normal renal function in those with mild renal impairment. Treatment and control of proteinuria in patients with renal disease should be regarded as important as treatment of hypertension as it can prevent renal failure.",

    "329": "To formulate a transdermal drug delivery system of captopril, monolithic adhesive matrix type patches containing 20% captopril, different pressure-sensitive adhesives, and various permeation enhancers were prepared using a labcoater. The effects of the adhesives and permeation enhancers on skin permeation of captopril from the prepared patches were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells fitted with excised rat skins. The permeation rate of the drug through the excised skin was dependent on the type of polyacrylate copolymers studied. Fatty alcohols resulted in a pronounced enhancing effect on the skin permeation of captopril, while dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, oleic acid, Transcutol, and polysorbate 20 showed no significant enhancing effect. The permeation-enhancing effect of the fatty alcohols reached the maximum at the level of 100%. Based on these results, a captopril patch may be developed with further optimization.", 
    "330": "We evaluated the effects of hyperthyroidism on cardiac structural changes and postischemic myocardial function, and also studied how an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril, can alter these changes. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily intraperitoneal injection of thyroxine (T4) (600 microg/kg) with or without cilazapril (10 mg/kg per day, orally), and control rats were given by vehicle. After 2 weeks of treatment, T4-treated rats showed increases in blood pressure and heart weight to body weight ratio (HW:BW). Cilazapril decreased blood pressure to control values and reduced HW:BW. In the isolated working heart preparation, T4-treated rats showed a poor postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure-rate product (14% of baseline at 30 minutes of reperfusion vs. vehicle 85%) and cardiac work (6% vs. 71%). Cilazapril recovered both values to 49% and 43%. Propranolol (500 mg/L in drinking water) decreased blood pressure to the same extent as cilazapril in hyperthyroid rats, but changed neither HW:BW nor the postischemic myocardial dysfunction. Percent recovery of cardiac work was inversely well correlated with HW:BW (R2 = 0.998, p < 0.001). Results indicate that T4-induced cardiac hypertrophy enhances postischemic cardiac dysfunction. Results also indicate renin-angiotensin system (RAS), but not sympathetic nerve activation, is involved in cardiac hypertrophy and postischemic myocardial dysfunction in hyperthyroid rats.",

In the omapatrilat group, urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide increased, and greater blood pressure reductions were seen compared with placebo. Concomitant omapatrilat treatment did not affect the acute diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis observed with chronic administration of furosemide. Neither effective renal plasma flow nor glomerularfiltration rate changed in either treatment group. No clinically significant safety issues were observed.

The plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increased by approximately 20% and 30% in CHF and control subjects, respectively, at 4 hours after intravenous or oral omapatrilat administration. Similar elevation in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration (25% to 35%) and ANP urinary excretion (21 ng/24 h to 22 ng/24 h) was seen in all treatment groups after omapatrilat administration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was > 90% inhibited at 4 hours after dosing and remained approximately 60% to 70% inhibited at 24 hours after dosing. The levels of endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 remained unchanged after oral or intravenous administration of omapatrilat. The maximal reduction in seated blood pressure compared with baseline was similarfor CHF and control subjects. Clinical pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in both groups after intravenous dosing, but maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve were elevated in CHF patients compared with controls after oral dosing. Omapatrilat was well tolerated; differences in systemic exposure and metabolism between CHF patients and controls did not appear to be clinically significant.",

We review the agents, sequence, and dosing used in clinical trials and propose a treatment algorithm. Multiagent antihypertensive therapy is required to attain goal blood pressure in most patients. Step sequences to obtain this goal are suggested. In general, we favor initial therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, followed by the addition of a diuretic. The presence of comorbid conditions may dictate variation from this scheme. The effect of antihypertensive agents on established cardiovascular diseases, proteinuria, renal function, and metabolic factors is discussed. Tailored recommendations for specific clinical scenarios are described.", 
    "334": "Confounding by indication is common in observational studies of outcomes that treatment is intended to affect. In light of the stepped-care approach to hypertension management, we reexamined the controversy around myocardial infarction (MI) risk in relation to antihypertensive agents by considering past drug history both as a confounder and as an effect modifier.", 
    "335": "Case-control design nested within a cohort of 19,501 adults initiating therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta-blockers in Saskatchewan (1990-93) and followed up to 1997. MI cases were identified using death certificates and hospital discharge diagnoses (ICD-9,410). Four controls were matched to each case to account for duration and timing of follow-up.", 
    "336": "812 MI cases were identified, of which 26% were fatal. At first, current use of CCB and ACEI (versus beta-blockers) appeared to be associated with an increased risk of MI (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.8-2.7 and RR = 1.3; CI = 1.0-1.6 respectively). Adjustment for drug use history attenuated both associations (RR = 1.6; CI = 1.1-2.2 and RR = 1.0; CI = 0.7-1.4). Moreover, the risk for CCB use disappeared when restricted to patients who had already used these agents in the past (RR = 1.1; CI = 0.77-1.7) whereas a high risk of MI for ACEI was found in digoxin users (RR = 9.4; CI = 3.2-27.5).", 
    "337": "Past drug history can be both a confounder and an effect modifier in observational studies. We found adjustment for medication history to attenuate the associations between antihypertensive agents and MI risk. In addition, the estimates significantly varied across drug history profiles thus suggesting the presence of preferential prescribing of specific drug classes to high-risk patients.", 
    "338": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) have been clearly proven to be effective in blood pressure control and haemodynamic control in heart failure patients. Moreover, there is evidence that ACEIs, both in animal models and in humans, also possess the ability to reduce remodeling in cardiovascular structures. Therefore, the reduction of the occurrence of arterial stiffness, leading to an increase in distensibility, is also anticipated.", 
    "339": "Other than physically measuring arterial wall, the assessment of Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) is also a widely used index of arterial distensibility, which deteriorates through the course of remodeling. To determine the efficacy of a particular ACEI, perindopril, in increasing arterial distensibility, thus reducing PWV, a 6-month multi-center study was conducted in 146 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The study population consisted of 70 men and 76 women, aged 56.36 (SD 9.4, range 28-73) years. 73 patients were newly diagnosed, 65 were treated patients but the blood pressure was not controlled, and 8 were treated patients with their blood pressure controlled but with adverse effects in need of switching treatment regimens.", 
    "340": "Mean blood pressure at the beginning of the study was 164.25/97.49 mmHg and 11.71 m/s (SD 2.29 range 7.35-20.12 m/s) in mean PWV. Perindopril was prescribed tritrating from 4 mg/day to 8 mg/day and adding a diuretic. 106 patients completed the study with 76.4 per cent of patients having their blood pressure controlled (Mean Blood pressure 138.6/85.18 mmHg, SD 11.34 and 7.10 Range 110-170/70-110 mmHg) (p<0.05).

    "342": "Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure.", 
    "343": "A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours.", 
    "344": "Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P<0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs.", 
    "345": "Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.", 
    "346": "In vitro characteristics of the human erythrocytes loaded by enalaprilat have been evaluated. Erythrocytes obtained from a healthy volunteer were loaded by enalaprilat using the hypotonic preswelling method, and the loading parameters, drug-release kinetics, hematological indices, particle size distribution, scanning electron microscopy view, osmotic and turbulence fragilities, and deformability of the resulting carrier cells were determined along with the sham encapsulated and unloaded cells. Carrier erythrocytes, having acceptable loading parameters, released their drug content according to zero-order kinetics. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin content values of the cells decreased, particle size dispersion increased, the cells transformed to cup-form, the erythrocytes became more fragile against osmotic pressure and turbulent flow, and, finally, the deformability of the cells decreased significantly upon drug loading.", 
    "347": "This guideline describes the recognition and management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). These are two of the three components of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These forms of ACS most often arise from erosion or rupture of coronary atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus formation causing incomplete coronary occlusion. The term ACS, as used in this guideline, refers to these two components only. The third component, not discussed here, is ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is most frequently associated with complete coronary occlusion. ACS is a clinical emergency requiring urgent assessment. It is characterised by chest pain, ST-segment changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a rise in the serum markers of myocardial injury/infarction. ACS encompasses a variety of clinical presentations. Risk stratification is essential to enable triage of patients to the optimal level of care and specific therapy. Careful clinical assessment is the cornerstone of this risk stratification. The pharmaceutical treatment of ACS is directed primarily at the dissolution of the developing intracoronary thrombus by antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) and anticoagulant therapy (heparin), and secondarily to the relief of symptoms by anti-anginal and analgesic medications. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is at least as effective and safe as standard intravenous unfractionated heparin (UH). Coronary angiography is advised for all high-risk patients and those in whom reversible ischaemia or left ventricular dysfunction is discovered. The need for coronary revascularisation is dictated by the findings at angiography. In high-risk patients, appropriate, early revascularisation is recommended in preference to standard medical therapy and 'ischaemia-driven' revascularisation. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors should be used in association with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in high-risk patients. All patients with ACS should receive secondary preventive treatment. It is imperative that they stop smoking. Dietary modification, physical rehabilitation, long-term low-dose aspirin use, b-blockade for those diagnosed with myocardial infarction, tight control of blood pressure, cholesterol lowering with a statin, and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be prescribed.", 
    "348": "Analysis of 636 surgical interventions for malignant tumors in 576 chronic coronary patients showed that beta-blockers decreased the relative risk of ischemia and myocardial infarction during the postoperative period. Calcium antagonists verapamil and dihydropyridines also essentially decreased the probability of myocardial infarction and less so of myocardial ischemia. Antiischemic effect of nitrates was insignificant, and they increased the risk of myocardial infarction. Antioxidants did not prevent ischemia but significantly decreased the risk of infarction. Therapy with non-fractionated heparin involved the risk of ischemia and myocardial infarction. The causes of low cardioprotective effects of nitrates and heparin can be explained by the discontinuation syndrome, which increases the risk of exacerbation of coronary disease during the postoperative period.", 
    "349": "Ischaemic heart disease is probably the most important cause of heart failure. All patients with heart failure may benefit from treatment designed to retard progressive ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. Patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease may also, theoretically, benefit from treatments designed to relieve ischaemia and prevent coronary occlusion and from revascularisation. However, there is little evidence to show that effective treatments, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers, exert different effects in patients with heart failure with or without coronary disease. Moreover, there is no evidence that treatment directed specifically at myocardial ischaemia, whether or not symptomatic, or coronary disease alters outcome in patients with heart failure. Some agents, such as aspirin, designed to reduce the risk of coronary occlusion appear ineffective or harmful in patients with heart failure. There is no evidence, yet, that revascularisation improves prognosis in patients with heart failure, even in patients who are demonstrated to have extensive myocardial hibernation. On current evidence, revascularisation should be reserved for the relief of angina. Large-scale, randomised controlled trials are currently underway investigating the role of specific treatments targeted at coronary syndromes in patients who have heart failure. The CHRISTMAS study is investigating the effects of carvedilol in a large cohort of patients with and without hibernating myocardium. The WATCH study is comparing the efficacy of aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin. The HEART-UK study is assessing the effect of revascularisation on mortality in patients with heart failure and myocardial hibernation. Smaller scale studies are currently assessing the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in patients with heart failure. Only when the results of these and other studies are known will it be possible to come to firm conclusions about whether patients with heart failure and coronary disease should be treated differently from other patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "350": "Patients may present with a variety of syndromes related to ischaemic heart disease. These include unstable or stable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and occasionally cardiac failure without prior anginal pain or infarction. For the purposes of this review, it will generally be assumed that the condition has been stabilised, though one important aspect of the rehabilitation process is the recognition of continuing or recurrent problems such as angina pectoris and cardiac decompensation. This should then be followed by appropriate intervention. The key components of post-hospital management of such patients are: (i) support; (ii) education; (iii) assessment; (iv) intervention (if necessary); (v) therapy; and (vi) lifestyle modification.", 
    "351": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common and potentially fatal condition. Primary prevention by reducing the risk of developing coronary atheroma disease has had an important effect on the incidence of the disease. However, for many, the first clinical presentation of their coronary atheroma is the development of acute coronary occlusion. The acute nature of such presentation is the result of the dynamic nature of the plaque event. Thus while measures such as increasing public education in areas of primary prevention are always important it needs to be recognised that real differences in outcome need to and can be made even once the event has occurred. Individuals developing chest pain need to be encouraged to present early, especially if they have a history of ischaemic heart disease. Once they have arrived at point of medical contact, rapid triage, early diagnosis and the institution of therapies designed to reduce the extent of myocardial damage are paramount.", 
    "352": "We sought to compare the neurohormonal responses and clinical effects of long-term, high-dose versus low-dose enalapril in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).", 
    "353": "Examination of neurohormonal and clinical responses in patients receiving different doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may provide insight into the potential for additional suppression with angiotensin II (AT-II) or aldosterone antagonists.", 
    "354": "Seventy-five patients with CHF were randomized to receive either high-dose (40 mg/day, n = 37) or low-dose (5 mg/day, n = 38) enalapril over six months. The results from exercise testing, echocardiography, tissue-specific ACE activity and monthly pre- and post-enalapril neurohormonal levels were compared.", 
    "355": "Despite greater intra-group improvements in plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels in the high-dose group, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in all variables, except for serum ACE activity at the end of study. Elevated serum aldosterone and plasma AT-II levels were observed in 35% and 85% of patients, respectively, at 34 weeks, an inter-group difference that was not statistically significant. A trend toward higher levels of tissue-specific ACE activity in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group at the end of study was observed (p = 0.054). A predefined composite end point of clinical events had a trend toward better improvement in the high-dose group.", 
    "356": "This study could not demonstrate a difference between high- and low-dose enalapril in terms of serum aldosterone and plasma AT-II suppression, despite a dose-dependent reduction in serum ACE activity. Even at maximal doses of enalapril, elevated serum aldosterone and plasma AT-II levels were frequently observed.", 
    "357": "Adrenomedullin (ADM), a potent natriuretic and vasorelaxing peptide with inotropic properties, is elevated in plasma in human and experimental congestive heart failure (CHF). Recent studies suggest that angiotensin II stimulates ADM production and secretion from cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. In the present study, we investigated cardiac ADM in experimental CHF, and tested the hypothesis that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition modulates cardiac ADM in CHF. Cardiac tissue ADM immunoreactivity and gene expression were assessed by radioimmunoassay, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis in normal and CHF dogs in the presence and absence of ACE inhibition. Experimental CHF was produced by progressive rapid ventricular pacing and characterized by increased ventricular ADM concentrations as well as increased ventricular ADM gene expression. ACE inhibition abolished the increases in ventricular ADM concentrations and ventricular ADM gene expression in CHF. Ventricular ADM gene expression was localized to ventricular myocytes and correlated with left ventricular mass index, suggesting that ventricular ADM is a marker for ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, atrial ADM concentrations and gene expression did not change in CHF with or without ACE inhibition. Increased plasma ADM concentrations in CHF were also abolished with ACE inhibition. The present study demonstrates that circulating and ventricular ADM are activated in pacing-induced experimental CHF and that ACE inhibition reverses ventricular ADM activation in CHF. This study also indicates that cardiac ADM gene expression is differently regulated between atrium and ventricle in CHF.", 
    "358": "Cardiovascular mortality for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is about 30 times the risk in the general population. About 30% of ESRD patients have hyperlipidemia. The 1998 National Kidney Foundation Task Force on Cardiovascular Disease recommends implementation of effective measures to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease in this population. Our intent was to evaluate the extent of use of cardioprotective drugs in ESRD patients through a quality improvement project. Twenty-eight dialysis facilities throughout Ohio volunteered for this project. Data regarding use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in heart failure, beta-blockers in myocardial infarction (MI), aspirin in coronary artery disease, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) were collected using chart abstraction for the period March through May 2000. The results were compared to Ohio hospital discharges from July through September 2000. This latter population was comprised of non--ESRD patients. Dialysis facilities were visited and interviews were conducted with staff members. Information was gathered regarding facility infrastructure, quality improvement process, and existing protocols. 27% of ESRD patients with a history of heart failure were on ACE-I, compared to 75.7% of non-ESRD patients. 34.8% of ESRD patients with a previous MI were taking beta-blockers, compared with 68.0% of non-ESRD patients with a prior MI. Aspirin use in ESRD patients with a previous MI was 52.8%, compared to 88% in non-ESRD patients with a prior MI. 17.3% of ESRD patients were on statins. Hyperlipidemia is found in 30% to 50% of ESRD patients. The use of cardioprotective drugs in the Medicare ESRD patient is lower than in the Medicare non-dialysis counterpart. Reasons for this are related to fragmentation of health care arising from communication and infrastructure issues. Until these issues are addressed and resolved, efforts at initiation of cardioprotective strategies will be slowed.", 
    "359": "The efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is well documented in the treatment of chronic severe heart failure. Because pharmacological mechanisms of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists differ from the effects of ACE inhibitors, an additional positive effect can be expected by combining these drugs.", 
    "360": "Sixty patients (mean age 68.3+/-10.0 years) with severe chronic heart failure receiving long term medication with digitalis, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and in part beta-blockers (68.3%) were randomly assigned after clinical recompensation to three groups: additional therapy with eprosartan (477.5+/-143.7 mg/day), telmisartan (65.9+/-17.7 mg/day) and control group according to a prospective study design. Hemodynamic measurements by impedance cardiography were performed before and during the observation period (9.6+/-3.4 days).", 
    "361": "Additional sartan treatment resulted in an improvement in cardiac output from 2.32+/-0.69 L/min to 3.12+/-1.24 L/min (P=0.003) in the eprosartan group and from 2.24+/-0.59 L/min to 2.76+/-0.91 L/min (P=0.001) in the telmisartan group; cardiac output in the control group did not increase. Furthermore, a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance was observed during treatment with eprosartan (23%, P=0.002) and telmisartan (18%, P=0.002). In the subgroup receiving combined therapy with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists, a significant increase in cardiac output was also observed.", 
    "362": "The additional treatment with AT1 receptor antagonists resulted in an increase in the cardiac output and a decrease in the peripheral resistance. This beneficial effect may be due to the additional property of sartans to block the interaction of locally and non-ACE-generated angiotensin II with their respective vascular and myocardial AT1 receptors.", 
    "363": "Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 can both be regulated by nuclear factor-kappaB. They are to varying degrees also capable of activating nuclear factor-kappaB and increasing the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB dependent genes. Angiotensin II related vascular effects are in part mediated by endothelin-1. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition facilitates angiotensin II related effects, which can be inhibited both by angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and by endothelin system inhibitors. This supports the notion that a combined therapeutic strategy of inhibiting angiotensin II and endothelin-1 generation or blocking their effects at the receptor level would be superior to either strategy alone. Animal studies are encouraging but not without conflicting results. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have a superb track record in experimental animal models and in a host of clinical studies. Selective and nonselective blockers of the endothelin-1 receptors are important research tools and are also undergoing clinical trials. Inhibitors of the endothelin converting enzyme have been developed. The recent elucidation of the endothelin converting enzyme's physical structure should facilitate the development of still more novel compounds to inhibit endothelin-1 generation.", 
    "364": "There is ample evidence to support the recommendation of renin-angiotensin system blockade therapy as the standard of care for strategies aimed at preserving renal function in chronic renal disease. Nevertheless, despite the well established antihypertensive effects of these drugs, the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers in renal transplantation has been quite limited so far, nephrologists being afraid of the possibility of inducing renal insufficiency in patients with a single kidney transplant. However, current knowledge of the ability of these agents to control blood pressure and urinary protein excretion, as well as post-transplant erythrocytosis, effectively in kidney transplant recipients suggests that it is now time to apply renin-angiotensin system blockers to the field of renal transplantation.", 
    "365": "Diets enriched with fish oil may favorably affect the vascular perturbations underlying synthetic graft thrombosis. Therefore, these studies were designed to test the hypothesis that diets enriched with fish oil would decrease the incidence of thrombosis in newly constructed polytetrafluorethylene grafts. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive 4000 mg of fish oil or 4000 mg of control oil. Both preparations were enriched with antioxidants and deodorized with peppermint. Patients began therapy within 2 wk after graft placement and were monitored for 12 mo or until thrombosis developed. With a permuted-block randomization schedule, 12 patients received fish oil and 12 patients received control oil. The primary patency rates at 365 d were 14.9% for the control group and 75.6% for the fish oil-treated group. Survival analysis revealed a significant difference between fish oil-treated and untreated patients (P < 0.03, Mantel-Cox test), with a power of 90%. Moreover, analysis of covariables, including age of > or =50 yr, gender, race, body weight, diabetes mellitus, bleeding times, and lipid profiles, indicated that this effect occurred principally as a result of fish oil administration. Importantly, fish oil treatment also decreased venous outflow resistance and systemic BP, compared with control values. Fish oils possess unique biologic properties that favorably affect the incidence of polytetrafluorethylene graft thrombosis, and they thus represent a potential treatment strategy for the prevention of access thrombosis.", 
    "366": "Aortic compliance is decreased in patients with end-stage renal disease. This malfunction contributes to high aortic systolic pressures and thus to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. It was hypothesized that besides structural vascular changes, functional changes as a result of hypervolemia and increased vasoconstrictor activity, in particular angiotensin II, play a role in decreasing aortic compliance. Nineteen hemodialysis patients were studied before and 24 h after they had been dialyzed to dry weight. Applanation tonometry of peripheral arteries was used to estimate aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), known to depend on aortic compliance, and aortic systolic pressure augmentation (augmentation index [Aix]). Predialysis aortic PWV was increased in the dialysis patients compared with matched healthy subjects (9.9 +/- 3.1 versus 7.5 +/- 1.1 m/s; P < 0.05). The AIx was also increased (35 +/- 6 versus 25 +/- 10; P < 0.05). Volume reduction with dialysis had no significant effect on PWV (9.3 +/- 1.5 m/s), but the AIx decreased (28 +/- 7; P < 0.05). A subset of 10 patients were restudied after 1 wk of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) with enalapril 5 mg once daily. ACEi decreased both predialysis as postdialysis BP but had no effect on pulse pressure and heart rate, which remained elevated compared with healthy subjects. ACEi also decreased predialysis aortic PWV, from 11.0 +/- 3.5 to 9.1 +/- 2.1 m/s (P < 0.05) but had no significant effect on AIx. During treatment with ACEi, the same volume reduction with dialysis decreased aortic PWV further to 8.0 +/- 1.4 m/s (P < 0.05), a figure not different from PWV in healthy subjects. AIx decreased to an even slightly subnormal value (12 +/- 23; P < 0.05). It was concluded that volume overload and angiotensin II both contribute to elevated PWV and AIx in dialysis patients. Volume reduction and ACEi both improve the aortic PWV and AIx. Combined volume reduction and ACEi has an enhanced effect that, in the present patients, was so large that PWV and AIx were no longer elevated. Monitoring and correcting of arterial pressure waves is feasible and may be an important tool in the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease.", 
    "367": "Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) has been recently identified as a mitogen specific for the endothelium of steroidogenic glands. Here we report a characterization of the signal transduction of EG-VEGF in a responsive cell type, bovine adrenal cortex-derived endothelial (ACE) cells. EG-VEGF led to a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that G alpha(i) plays an important role in mediating EG-VEGF-induced activation of MAPK signaling. The inhibitor of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation PD 98059 resulted in suppression of both proliferation and migration in response to EG-VEGF. EG-VEGF also increased the phosphorylation of Akt in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Consistent with such an effect, EG-VEGF was a potent survival factor for ACE cells. We also identified endothelial nitric-oxide synthase as one of the downstream targets of Akt activation. Phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in ACE cells was stimulated by EG-VEGF with a time course correlated to the Akt phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that EG-VEGF, possibly through binding to a G-protein coupled receptor, results in the activation of MAPK p44/42 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways, leading to proliferation, migration, and survival of responsive endothelial cells.", 
    "368": "In the HOPE-trial, the ACE inhibitor ramipril significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The benefit could only partly be attributed to the modest mean reduction of office blood pressure (OBP) during the study period (3/2 mm Hg). However, because according to the HOPE protocol ramipril was given once daily at bedtime and blood pressure was measured during the day, the 24-hour reduction of blood pressure may be underestimated based on OBP. Thirty-eight patients with peripheral arterial disease enrolled in the HOPE study underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement before randomization and after 1 year. OBP was measured in the sitting position immediately before fitting the ABP measuring equipment to the patients. Ramipril did not significantly reduce OBP (8/2 mm Hg, P=NS) or day ABP (6/2 mm Hg, P=NS) after 1 year. Twenty-four-hour ABP was significantly reduced (10/4 mm Hg, P=0.03), mainly because of a more pronounced blood pressure lowering effect during nighttime (17/8 mm Hg, P<0.001). The night/day ratio was also significantly lowered in the ramipril group. ABP shows greater falls, especially at night, than OBP during treatment with ramipril given once daily at bedtime. Although, OBP is the correct comparator when comparing with previous large intervention trials and epidemiological studies, the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen with ramipril in the HOPE study may, to a larger extent than previously ascribed, relate to effects on blood pressure patterns over the 24-hour period.", 
    "369": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with an impaired flow-mediated vasodilation that reflects an impaired endothelial function. Limited information is available, however, on whether and to what extent this impairment is improved by pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment. We measured radial artery diameter and blood flow by an echo-tracking Doppler device both at baseline and after 4 minutes of hand ischemia, which increases diameter through NO secretion mediated by an increase in flow and shear stress. Data were collected from 44 CHF patients (New York Heart Association class I to III) under standard treatment (diuretic, digitalis, and enalapril, 20 mg/d), in whom CHF severity was assessed by a cardiopulmonary stress test, and from 16 age- and sex-matched controls. CHF patients were then randomized to maintain for (A) 2 months of standard treatment (n=11), (B) treatment with double the ACE inhibitor dose (n=11), (C) standard treatment with an angiotensin II antagonist (losartan, 50 mg/d; n=11), or (D) standard treatment with bicycle training for 30 minutes, 3 times a week (n=11). At baseline, radial artery diameter and flow were similar in CHF patients and controls; CHF patients had a modest although significant impairment in flow increase (-36%) and a striking impairment (-78%) in diameter increase following the 4 minutes of ischemia. After 2 months, baseline diameter and flow remained unaltered in the 4 groups. After the 4 minutes of ischemia, radial artery flow and diameter increased as before in the group under standard treatment (A), whereas in the other 3 groups, the increase was significantly (P<0.05) and, for diameter, markedly (B, 83%; C, 92%; and D, 95%) greater. The vasodilatation induced by trinitroglycerin was similar in CHF and control subjects and not affected by treatments. In CHF, radial artery shows a marked reduction in flow-mediated vasodilation, reflecting impairment of endothelial function. This impairment can be markedly improved by treatments that effectively block the renin-angiotensin system either at ACE or at ACE plus angiotensin receptor level. This is the case also with nonpharmacological treatment of CHF.", 
    "370": "Reduced conduit arteries flow-dependent dilatation and altered compliance have been described during heart failure. However, the role of shear stress, the relation between endothelial dysfunction and mechanics, and the effect of chronic ACE inhibition on this relationship have not been investigated. The present study was designed to evaluate in heart failure patients the relationship between flow-dependent dilatation and radial artery mechanics at known shear stress levels and to assess the effect of chronic ACE inhibition. Sixteen stable congestive heart failure patients, who had never been treated with ACE inhibitors, participated in the study. Arterial pressure, cardiac output (bioimpedance), radial artery diameter (echo tracking) and flow (Doppler), total blood viscosity, and mean artery wall shear stress were assessed before and during a gradual increase in the forearm blood flow in response to gradual distal hand skin heating. Cross-sectional radial artery compliance and distensibility indexes were calculated at 34 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 44 degrees C. The endothelium-independent vasodilatation was evaluated by use of glyceryl trinitrate. All parameters were assessed before and 24 hours after the last administration of perindopril (4 mg once daily) or placebo in a 2-month double-blind randomized study. Before treatment, there was no difference between the 2 groups for all parameters. After chronic ACE inhibition, systolic arterial pressure decreased at baseline from 126+/-11 to 118+/-10 mm Hg (P<0.05). During heating, the increase in diameter in response to shear stress was higher after ACE inhibition than after placebo (time/treatment interaction, P<0.05). Moreover, in contrast to placebo, at the same shear stress, there was a significant increase in compliance (3.23+/-0.79 x 10(-7) to 6.82+/-2.47 x 10(-7) m(2)/kPa, P<0.05) and distensibility (5.71+/-1.35 x 10(-3) to 8.87+/-1.88 x 10(-3)/kPa, P<0.05) during heating after ACE inhibition. The effect of glyceryl trinitrate did not change. The present study demonstrates that chronic administration of the ACE inhibitor perindopril increases the magnitude of the flow-dependent dilatation and restores the flow-dependent increase in compliance and distensibility of the radial artery evaluated at stable shear stress. In addition, the decrease in baseline systolic arterial pressure after ACE inhibitor suggests an associated increase in the distensibility of the proximal elastic conduit arteries.", 
    "371": "This study was designed to examine the preventability of progressive deterioration of cardiovascular structure and function in very old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). To this end, male 18-month-old normotensive WKY rats were given either placebo or L-arginine (70 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) and an ACE inhibitor (enalapril, 30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 6 months. These control and treated rats were studied at the age of 2 years by examining: cardiovascular mass and collagen content, cardiac function, and systemic and regional (including coronary) hemodynamics. Additional data obtained in adult, 35-week-old WKY are included for comparison. ISH associated with increased total peripheral resistance was found in the old, untreated WKY, and this was prevented by the combined treatment. The untreated rats also exhibited impaired left ventricular function, as denoted by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and reduced maximal rates of rise and fall of left ventricular pressure. These functional changes were also ameliorated with the combined treatment. Coronary hemodynamics were also compromised in the untreated WKY; and therapy improved coronary flow reserve and minimal coronary vascular resistance in both ventricles of the old WKY in parallel with reduction of arterial pressure. Blood flow to various other organs was uncompromised in the old rats, although increased vascular resistances were observed in untreated old WKY with ISH. These changes were also improved by the combined therapy. Finally, therapy diminished left ventricular mass and collagen concentration in old WKY compared with the untreated WKY. However, when compared with the 35-week-old WKY, both groups of old WKY (untreated and treated) demonstrated myocardial fibrosis, depressed ventricular function, and compromised coronary hemodynamics. Therefore, L-arginine and ACE inhibitory therapy ameliorated the hypertensive and associated adverse cardiovascular changes in old WKY, although it failed to improve totally the progressive deterioration of cardiovascular structure and function that occurred with aging. The results suggest that different mechanisms may be responsible for the hypertension- and age-related cardiovascular changes, although they may appear to be similar.", 
    "372": "The biological actions of bradykinin (BK) are attributed to its B(2) type receptor (B(2)R), whereas the B(1)R is constitutively absent, inducible by inflammation and toxins. Previous studies in B(2)R gene knockout mice showed that the B(1)R is overexpressed, is further upregulated by hypertensive maneuvers, and assumes some of the hemodynamic functions of the B(2)R. The current experiments were designed to further clarify the metabolic function of the B(2)R and to explore whether the upregulated B(1)R can also assume the metabolic function of the missing B(2)R. One group of B(2)R-/- mice (n=9) and one of B(2)R+/+ controls (n=8) were treated for 3 days with captopril (which produced a similar blood pressure-lowering response in both groups) and studied with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. The knockout mice had fasting and steady-state blood glucose levels similar to those of the wild-type mice but a had tendency to higher fasting insulin levels (at 27.8+/-5.2 versus 18+/-2.9 mU/L, respectively). However, they had significantly higher steady-state insulin levels (749+/-127.2 versus 429.1+/-31.5 mU/L, P<0.05) and a significantly lower glucose uptake rate (31+/-2.4 versus 41+/-2.3 mg/kg per minute, P<0.05) and insulin sensitivity index (4.6+/-0.9 versus 10+/-0.7 P<0.001). Analysis of B(1)R and B(2)R gene expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues revealed significantly higher B(1)R mRNA level in the knockouts versus wild-type (P<0.05) at baseline and a further significant upregulation in mRNA by 1.8- to 3.2-fold (P<0.05) after insulin infusion. We conclude that absence of B(2)R confers a state of insulin resistance because it results in impaired insulin-dependent glucose transport; this is probably a direct B(2)R effect because, unlike the hemodynamic autacoid-mediated effects, it cannot be assumed by the upregulated B(1)R.", 
    "373": "Omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and ACE. The efficacy and hormonal profile of omapatrilat and lisinopril were compared in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients. On enrollment, antihypertensive medications were withdrawn, and patients received a single-blind placebo. On day 15, salt-sensitivity determinations were made. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients returned within 5 to 10 days for baseline evaluations of ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients were randomized to receive double-blind omapatrilat (n=28) or lisinopril (n=33) at initial doses of 10 mg for 1 week, increasing to 40 and 20 mg, respectively, for an additional 3 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure and urinary atrial natriuretic peptide were assessed at study termination. Both omapatrilat and lisinopril significantly reduced mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressures; however, omapatrilat produced significantly greater reductions in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (P=0.008), ambulatory systolic blood pressure (P=0.004), and ambulatory mean arterial pressure (P=0.005) compared with values from lisinopril. Both drugs potently inhibited ACE over 24 hours. Omapatrilat significantly (P<0.001) increased urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide over 0- to 24-hour (3.8-fold) and 12- to 24-hour (2-fold) intervals; lisinopril produced no change. Omapatrilat significantly (P<0.001) increased urinary excretion of cGMP over the 0- to 24- and 4- to 8-hour intervals compared with that from lisinopril. Neither drug had a diuretic, natriuretic, or kaliuretic effect. In conclusion, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients, omapatrilat demonstrated the hormonal profile of a vasopeptidase inhibitor and lowered ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressures more than lisinopril.", 
    "374": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether Src tyrosine kinases are one of the signaling intermediaries linking M(2) receptor stimulation to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cultures of canine colonic smooth muscle cells (CSMC). RT-PCR studies demonstrate expression of multiple Src tyrosine kinases, including Src, Fyn, and Yes, in CSMC. Muscarinic stimulation of CSMC with 10 microM ACh results in a twofold increase in Src activity within 10 min but does not increase the activity of Fyn. Treatment with the M(2) antagonist AF-DX 116 (10 microM) blocks ACh-stimulated Src activation in primary CSMC cultures that express both M(2) and M(3) receptors and in first-passage CSMC cultures that express predominantly M(2) receptors. Alkylation of M(3) receptors with 100 nM N,N-dimethyl-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate mustard has no effect on Src activity. Treatment with the pyrazolopyrimidine Src inhibitor PP1 (10 microM) or AF-DX 116 (10 microM) blocks ACh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Together these results indicate that M(2) receptors are coupled to Src tyrosine kinase and subsequent activation of ERK in cultured CSMC.", 
    "375": "Pulmonary vascular remodelling is an important pathological feature of pulmonary hypertension, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and reduced compliance. It involves thickening of all three layers of the blood vessel wall (due to hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of the predominant cell type within each layer), as well as extracellular matrix deposition. Neomuscularisation of non-muscular arteries and formation of plexiform and neointimal lesions also occur. Stimuli responsible for remodelling involve transmural pressure, stretch, shear stress, hypoxia, various mediators [angiotensin II, endothelin (ET)-1, 5-hydroxytryptamine, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines], increased serine elastase activity, and tenascin-C. In addition, there are reductions in the endothelium-derived antimitogenic substances, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin. Intracellular signalling mechanisms involved in pulmonary vascular remodelling include elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of the phosphatidylinositol pathway, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. In animal models of pulmonary hypertension, various drugs have been shown to attenuate pulmonary vascular remodelling. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, ET receptor antagonists, ET-converting enzyme inhibitors, nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, prostacyclin, Ca2+ -channel antagonists, heparin, and serine elastase inhibitors. Inhibition of remodelling is generally accompanied by reductions in pulmonary artery pressure. The efficacy of some of the drugs varies, depending on the animal model of the disease. In view of the complexity of the remodelling process and the diverse aetiology of pulmonary hypertension in humans, it is to be anticipated that successful anti-remodelling therapy in the clinic will require a range of different drug options.", 
    "376": "We investigated the binding characteristics of angiotensin receptors and used this assay to determine the predominant enzyme capable of converting angiotensin I in the human left ventricle. In homogenates of human left ventricle, (125)I-[Sar(1),Ile(8)]angiotensin II bound with sub-nanomolar affinity, with a corresponding K(D) of 0.42+/-0.09 nM, a B(max) of 11.2+/-2.3 fmol.mg(-1) protein and a Hill slope of 1.04+/-0.04. The rank order of inhibitory potency of competing ligands for the (125)I-[Sar(1),Ile(8)]angiotensin II binding site was CGP42112>angiotensin II> or =angiotensin III=angiotensin I>losartan. The angiotensin type II (AT(2)) receptor predominated in the human left ventricle over the angiotensin type I (AT(1)) receptor, with an approximate AT(1)/AT(2) receptor ratio of 35:65. No specific (125)I-angiotensin IV binding sites could be detected in the human left ventricle. Using competitive radioligand binding assays, we were able to demonstrate that the chymase/cathepsin G enzyme inhibitor chymostatin was more potent than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril at inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I in the human left ventricle. Aprotonin (an inhibitor of cathepsin G but of not chymase) had no effect on angiotensin I conversion, suggesting that the majority of the conversion was mediated by chymase. Thus, although the current therapies used for the renin-angiotensin system have focused on ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists, the left ventricle of the human heart expresses mainly AT(2) receptors and the tissue-specific conversion of angiotensin I occurs predominantly via chymase rather than ACE.", 
    "377": "The glycoprotein 130 (gp 130) signalling pathway is important in the development of heart failure. Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a cytokine acting via the gp 130 pathway, is involved in the process of ventricular remodelling following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in animals. The aims of the present study were to examine the profile of plasma CT-1 following AMI in humans, and its relationship with echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Serial measurements of plasma CT-1 levels were made in 60 patients at 14-48 h, 49-72 h, 73-120 h and 121-192 h following AMI and at a later clinic visit. LV function was assessed using a LV wall motion index (WMI) score on admission (WMI-1) and at the clinic visit (WMI-2). Compared with values in control subjects (29.5+/-3.6 fmol/ml), the plasma CT-1 concentration was elevated in AMI patients at 14-48 h (108.1+/-15.1 fmol/ml), 49-72 h (105.2+/-19.7 fmol/ml), 73-120 h (91.2+/-14.9 fmol/ml) and 121-192 h (118.8+/-22.6 fmol/ml), and at the clinic visit (174.9+/-30.9 fmol/ml) (P<0.0001). Levels were higher following anterior compared with inferior AMI. For patients with anterior AMI, CT-1 levels were higher at the clinic visit than at earlier times. WMI-1 correlated with CT-1 at all times prior to hospital discharge (P<0.05). On best subsets analysis, the strongest correlate with WMI-1 was CT-1 level at 49-72 h (R(2)=20%, P<0.05). In conclusion, plasma levels of CT-1 are elevated soon after AMI in humans and rise further in the subsequent weeks in patients after anterior infarction. CT-1 measured soon after AMI is indicative of LV dysfunction, and this cytokine may have a role in the development of ventricular remodelling and heart failure after AMI.", 
    "378": "Approximately 11 million Americans have both hypertension and diabetes mellitus. This double diagnosis places such patients at high risk for renal damage, especially end-stage renal disease. The sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends a blood pressure goal of less than 130/85 mm Hg to reduce or slow the onset of renal disease and cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Recent data, however, now suggest that an even lower diastolic blood pressure goal (ie, <80 mm Hg) may be necessary. Studies have shown that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can prevent the progression of microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria, reduce proteinuria in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy, slow the deterioration of the glomerular filtration rate, delay progression to end-stage renal disease, and lower blood pressure. Thus, all diabetic patients with blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg should begin angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and be titrated to moderate or high doses until the blood pressure goal is achieved. However, monotherapy still may not control blood pressure to the recommended target. Studies have shown that use of multiple antihypertensive agents is necessary and successful in helping patients reach their target blood pressure, and this may offer more renoprotection than one agent used singly. A case study that applies these concepts in outpatient practice is included.", 
    "379": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, or aldosterone antagonists can have important beneficial effects on the progression of renal disease associated with glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, especially if the adverse side effects (eg, hyperkalemia) can be minimized. Because it appears that chronic renal insufficiency and proteinuria may well be cardiovascular risk factors, it is exciting to note that recent large scale epidemiologic studies (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation [HOPE]) have shown both cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ACE inhibition. It appears paradoxic that such renoprotective effects are clearly evident in diabetes mellitus in which the plasma renin activity may be suppressed. Even in this setting, it appears that there is activation of the renal angiotensin system(s), and inhibitions of these intrarenal systems are involved in the renoprotective effects of these agents. Recent studies have identified nearly all of the components needed to generate angiotensin II in the renal luminal compartment, and suggest that there may be a direct effect through AT(1) receptors on NaCl transport in the distal nephron. The possibility that the components of this intraluminal renin-angiotensin system may be acutely regulated by variations in dietary salt intake provides an opportunity to better understand the normal maintenance of salt balance. Whether or not inhibition of these pathways is involved in the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists is an important issue to be addressed.", 
    "380": "Studies on genetic variability in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) provide intriguing data that support its possible relevance to renal pathophysiology. However, from the discrepancies between different studies it is clear that RAS polymorphisms do not provide simple markers for renal prognosis or therapy response. Rather than attempting to force a conclusion from the available discrepancies, we should attempt to develop strategies from the current state of knowledge to attack this complex issue from different angles. Unraveling their functional impact in renal pathophysiology can provide a framework for understanding that can guide further studies with the eventual purpose of improving the prognosis of renal patients. Clinical association studies should be large and prospective, to obtain the necessary robustness, with proper attention paid to the role of contextual factors. Moreover, studies elucidating the physiologic mechanisms of the genetic determinants of the disease phenotype are of prime importance. Such information is vital, not only to make sense of observed associations, but all the more so if one wants to apply the insights on the role of genetic factors into better strategies for disease intervention.", 
    "381": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has proven effective in retarding progression of renal disease in the remnant kidney model, as well as other experimental diseases, and, most importantly, in a range of progressive human renal diseases. Attention has focused on the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in propagating progression both by its hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic actions. Recent evidence, predominately in the remnant kidney model, indicates that the drugs used to block this hormone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also lower aldosterone levels. Thus, aldosterone, as well as angiotensin II, appears to be instrumental in sustaining the hypertension and fibroproliferative destruction of the residual kidney.", 
    "382": "Better understanding of the hemodynamic-independent actions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may lead to improved therapies for heart, kidney, and liver fibrosis. The conventional view of the RAS is that its role is solely hemodynamic. Pharmacologic blockade of the RAS is beneficial in treating hypertension, as well as primary renal and cardiac diseases. Recent findings from clinical trials and several laboratories that used different experimental approaches have revealed a whole new dimension to the RAS that is beyond the realm of hemodynamics. The RAS is best viewed as part of a system of interconnected molecules biologically designed to be activated after tissue injury to promote tissue repair and, when in excess, tissue fibrosis. This new understanding of the RAS has important clinical implications. It predicts and explains why blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), the newer receptor antagonists, or both together, will significantly slow the progression of fibrotic disease. However, it further suggests that higher doses and/or a combination of angiotensin II blockade with another agent or agents might truly halt progressive fibrosis.", 
    "383": "The renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in tubulointerstitial injury in a range of clinical and experimental settings. Angiotensin II, the major effector molecule of the RAS, in addition to its effects on systemic blood pressure and intrarenal hemodynamics, also acts as a local hormone and growth factor to modulate renal function and pathology. There is increasing evidence for a pivotal role of this hormone in influencing renal tubular and interstitial function and structure including regulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, promoting infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, promoting cellular proliferation, and inducing apoptosis. Pathologic actions of angiotensin II lead to tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation via a range of cytokines and chemokines including transforming growth factor (TNF)-beta1, osteopontin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expression and secreted). Blockade of production of angiotensin II by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonism with an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist has been shown to attenuate tubulointerstitial injury and reduce expression of cytokines and matrix proteins. The role of angiotensin II in tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation is addressed in this article.", 
    "384": "To evaluate the acute effects of tezosentan, a new dual parenteral endothelin receptor antagonist, on hemodynamics in a rat model of chronic heart failure (CHF), and further investigated if the combination of tezosentan with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, had additive hemodynamic effect.", 
    "385": "Hemodynamics was measured in rats with CHF, induced by ligation of the left coronary artery.", 
    "386": "At 3 to 5 weeks after myocardial infarction, rats developed CHF. This was evidenced by a marked increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) with mean values of 23 to 26 mmHg, by a 30 % to 40 % reduction in left ventricular dp/dt(max) and by a more than 10 % decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) as compared to sham-operated rats. In CHF rats, acute intravenous administration of either tezosentan (10 mg . kg) or enalapril (1 mg . kg) markedly decreased MAP and LVEDP, without affecting heart rate or dp/dtmax. Tezosentan had additive effects on MAP and LVEDP when given with enalapril compared with tezosentan (P < 0.05) or enalapril (P < 0.05) alone. There were no significant changes in heart rate and dp/dtmax with the combination treatment compared with tezosentan- or enalapril-treated CHF rats.", 
    "387": "Acute intravenous tezosentan improves cardiac hemodynamics and decreases LVEDP and afterload (MAP) without changes in heart rate and cardiac contractility dp/dtmax) in CHF rats. These favorable effects of tezosentan are similar to those of enalapril. Furthermore, the benefits of tezosentan are apparent in addition to ACE inhibition. Thus, tezosentan could be a useful therapeutic agent in the acute treatment of heart failure.", 
    "388": "Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly common. Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.", 
    "389": "Several recent comparative trials in hypertension have reported that similar blood pressure reductions may not necessarily translate into similar reductions in risk for cardiovascular complications. Thus, the method used to lower blood pressure may be important. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment To Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), low-dose chlorthalidone as the first-line drug was superior to doxazosin. The 25% higher risk for major cardiovascular events associated with doxazosin was attributed primarily to a doubling in the risk for heart failure. A meta-analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggested that despite achieving similar blood pressure reductions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs in reducing the risk for acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events, but not stroke. Although individual comparative trials have failed to show conclusively that calcium-channel blockers differ from other antihypertensive drugs, a meta-analysis that included all published trials concluded that calcium-channel blockers are inferior to other classes of drugs in reducing the risk for acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. These observations suggest not only that antihypertensive drugs may have important mechanisms of action apart from blood pressure lowering but also that effective treatment is not a matter of simply lowering blood pressure. These findings have potential implications for the regulatory approval of antihypertensive agents, revisions of treatment guidelines, the design of future randomized trials comparing different antihypertensive drugs and, most important, the selection of drugs for the treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "390": "Captopril, a well-known angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of arterial hypertension. Recent studies suggest that it may also act as a scavenger of free radicals because of its thiol group. Therefore, the present study describes a rapid, sensitive and relatively simple method for the detection of captopril in biological tissues with reverse-phase HPLC. Captopril was first derivatized with ThioGlo 3 [3H-Naphto[2,1-b]pyran,9-acetoxy-2-(4-(2,5-dihydro-2,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)phenyl-3-oxo-)]. It was then detected by fluorescence-HPLC using an Astec C(18) column as the stationary phase and a water:acetonitrile:acetic acid:phosphoric acid mixture (50:50; 1 mL/L acids) as the mobile phase (excitation wavelength, 365 nm; emission wavelength, 445 nm). The calibration curve for captopril was linear over a range of 10-2500 nM and the coefficient of variation acquired for the within- and between-run precision for captopril was 0.5 and 3.8%, respectively. The detection limit of captopril with this method was found to be 200 fmol/20 microL injection volume. Its relative recovery from biological samples was determined to the range from 93.3 to 105.3%. Based on these results, we believe that our method is advantageous for captopril determination.", 
    "391": "Captopril and enalapril-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors-were evaluated for their antioxidative protective action against adriamycin-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity. Rats were treated with either captopril (10 mg kg(-1)) or enalapril (2 mg kg(-1)) intragastrically (i.g.) daily for 7 days before single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with adriamycin (15 mg kg(-1)). The animals were killed 30 h after adriamycin administration. Adriamycin produced significant elevation in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which is an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and significantly inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in heart and liver tissues, with a significant rise in the serum levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating acute cardiac toxicity. A single injection of adriamycin did not affect the cardiac or hepatic glutathione (GSH) content or cardiac catalase (CAT) activity, but hepatic CAT activity was elevated. Pretreatment with ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the TBARS concentration in both heart and liver and ameliorated the inhibition of cardiac and hepatic SOD activity. In addition, the ACE inhibitors significantly improved the serum levels of GOT, GPT, CK-MB and LDH in adriamycin-treated rats. Thus, these results suggest that captopril and enalapril possess antioxidative potential that may protect the heart against adriamycin-induced acute oxidative toxicity. This protective effect might be mediated, at least in part, by the limitation of culprit free radicals and the amelioration of oxidative stress.", 
    "392": "Although sublingual captopril has been used clinically to treat hypertensive emergencies, a mechanistic understanding of sublingual permeation will facilitate the optimization of drug delivery. A correlation of sublingual steady-state flux with donor captopril concentration in a porcine model showed the absence of saturability and suggested a passive diffusion permeation mechanism. A simultaneous evaluation of permeability and partition coefficient demonstrated that the paracellular route is the predominant pathway for sublingual permeation. The enhancement factors of specific ion permeabilities in the presence of tight junction perturbants indicated that although the paracellular pathway is preferred by the ionized species of captopril, the lipophilic transcellular pathway is preferred by the neutral, un-ionized species.",

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for cancers overall and at selected sites. In addition, the authors performed a direct comparison of users of ACE inhibitors with users of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (n = 47,579 individuals) by means of a Cox proportional hazards model.", 
    "395": "Overall, 909 cancer cases were observed among users of ACE inhibitors, with 846 expected based on general population rates, yielding an SIR of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.15). No risk reductions were observed for cancers of the breast and female reproductive tract, whereas nonsignificantly decreased SIRs were observed for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and liver. Cancer of the kidney was found in significant excess (SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Stratification by duration of follow-up or number of prescriptions revealed no apparent trends, except for a tendency toward decreasing risk with increasing length of follow-up for smoking-related cancers. The direct comparison of users of ACE inhibitors with users of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers yielded results comparable to those derived from the comparison with the general population, with a hazard ratio for cancer overall of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.09).", 
    "396": "This large, population-based cohort study did not confirm a protective effect of ACE inhibitors on the development of cancer. The excess of kidney cancer observed likely reflects a correlation between hypertension and kidney cancer. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of ACE inhibitors beyond the observation period of this and previous studies. Also, the suggestive evidence of decreased risks for upper digestive system cancers and for smoking-related cancers over time may warrant additional investigation.",

During the follow-up, no patient died and one patient (1%) developed non-Q wave myocardial infarction. The frequency of chest pain was unchanged or increased in 24 patients (36%) and decreased or disappeared in 42 patients (64%). The angina status was improved only in 16 of 33 patients treated with calcium channel blockers alone.

    "401": "This study was designed to investigate diverse effects of angiotensin II (AngII) type I receptor antagonists, losartan, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, fosinopril, and calcium channel blockade, amlodipine on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and AngII in the left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The SHRs were randomized to four groups: SHR-L (treated with losartan, 30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), SHR-F (with fosinopril, 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), SHR-A (with amlodipine, 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and SHR-C (with placebo). The cardiomyocyte apoptosis was examined by in situ TDT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, AngII concentrations of plasma and myocardium were measured by radio immunoassay at 8 and 16 weeks of the study respectively. The results showed that: (1) compared with SHR-C at 8 and 16 weeks respectively; the systolic blood pressure was decreased similarly in the three treatment groups. Left ventricular weight and mass indexes were reduced in the three treatment groups. The latter parameter at 16 weeks was lower in SHR-F than that in the other two treatment groups. (2) Compared with SHR-C, the cardiomyocyte apoptotic index (APOI) was reduced significantly at 8 weeks only in SHR-F, and at 16 weeks in all three treatment groups. The APOI of SHR-F was lowest among the three treatment groups examined at latter endpoint. (3) Compared with SHR-C at both endpoints of this study, plasma and myocardium AngII levels were increased in SHR-L. However, plasma AngII concentrations were not altered in SHR-F and SHR-A, myocardium AngII concentrations were reduced significantly at 8 weeks only in SHR-F, and at 16 weeks in SHR-F and SHR-A. Meanwhile, myocardium AngII in SHR-F at 16 weeks was lower than that in SHR-A. The results of this study indicate that losartan, fosinopril, and amlodipine each effectively reverses heart hypertrophy and inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and fosinopril may be most effective in these cardioprotective effects. These findings suggest that the effects of the three blockers on myocardiocyte apoptosis and left ventricular hypertrophy were related to inhibition of the myocardium rennin-angiotensin-aldsterone system.", 
    "402": "The effects of chronic treatment with the new sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, zofenopril, in comparison with the classical sulfhydryl ACE-inhibitor captopril or enalapril or placebo on the development of atherosclerosis were determined in apolipoprotein-E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice. Groups of 2-month-old male mice received either placebo (N=10), 0.05 mg/kg/day of zofenopril (N=10), 1 mg/kg/day of zofenopril (N=10), 5 mg/kg/day of captopril (N=10) or 0.5 mg/kg/day of enalapril (N=8). After 29 weeks of treatment, computer-assisted imaging analysis revealed that zofenopril reduced the aortic cumulative lesion area by 78% at 0.05 mg/kg/day and by 89% at 1 mg/ml/day of zofenopril compared to that of the placebo (P<0.0001). Captopril reduced by 52% aortic lesions compared to placebo (P<0.01 vs. placebo; P<0.05 vs. zofenopril at both doses). Enalapril did not reduce aortic lesions. Furthermore, 0.05 mg/kg/day of zofenopril reduced susceptibility of plasma LDL to in vitro oxidation compared to captopril, enalapril or placebo, as shown by significant reduction of malondialdehyde content (P<0.001 vs. placebo or enalapril; P<0.05 vs. captopril), as well as by the prolongation of lag-time (P<0.01 vs. placebo or enalapril P<0.05 vs. captopril). More importantly, mice treated with 1 mg/ml/day of zofenopril had a significant decrease in the intimal immunohistochemical presence of oxidation-specific epitopes on oxLDL (NA59 monoclonal antibody, P<0.01), macrophages derived foam cells (F4/80 monoclonal antibody, P<0.05) and native LDL (NP monoclonal antibody, P<0.01) compared to placebo, captopril or enalapril. Thus, chronic treatment with the new sulfhydryl ACE-inhibitor zofenopril has antiatherosclerotic and antioxidant effects in the arterial wall of hypercholesterolemic apoE(-/-) mice. This protection was significantly higher than that reached with captopril and at lower doses of the drug. Treatment with 0.5 mg/kg/day of enalapril did not provide any protective effect.", 
    "403": "Nephropathy, interstitial pneumopathy, and renal and lung fibrosis are major complications of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study evaluated the antifibrotic property of an angiotensin II (A2) type-1 receptor blocker (L-159,809) and compared it with those of Captopril and Enalapril, two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in a rat model of BMT. Male WAG/Rij/MCW rats received a preparative regimen of 60 mg/kg body wt of cytoxan (i.p., Days 9 and 8) and 18.5 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) in six twice daily fractions (Days 2, 1, and 0) followed immediately (Day 0) by BMT. Modifiers were given in drinking water from Day 10 until autopsy, 8 weeks after BMT. Rats treated with TBI plus cytoxan alone developed severe nephropathy. Trichrome staining showed marked collagen deposition in glomeruli, renal interstitium, and renal arteries and arterioles (especially in their adventitia). Collagen deposition and renal damage were markedly reduced by the three modifiers. Of the three, L-158,809-treated rats had slightly thinner vessels and slightly less collagen than nonirradiated normal controls. The study shows the effectiveness of these drugs in the protection of the renal parenchyma from the development of radiation-induced fibrosis. It also indicates a role for angiotensin II in the modulation of collagen synthesis.", 
    "404": "This study investigated the control of drinking in elasmobranch fish through manipulation of the homologous renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The smooth muscle relaxant papaverine was found to increase basal drinking levels in the European lesser-spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, almost 20-fold. However, this response was significantly reduced with the coadministration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril which had no effect when administered alone. Captopril was also found to block a 7-fold increase in drinking rate following administration of homologous angiotensin I in S. canicula. Finally, administration of homologous angiotensin II produced a dose-dependent response in drinking rate in two species of elasmobranchs, S. canicula and the Japanese dogfish, Triakis scyllia. These results demonstrate a central role of the RAS in the control of drinking in elasmobranch fish.", 
    "405": "Dobutamine stress echo provides potentially useful information on idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). From February 1, 1997, to October 1, 1999, 186 patients (131 men and 55 women, mean age 56 +/- 12 years) with IDC, ejection fraction <35%, and angiographically normal coronary arteries were studied by high-dose (up to 40 micro/kg/min) dobutamine echo in 6 centers, all quality controlled for stress echo reading. In all patients, wall motion score index (WMSI) (from 1 = normal to 4 = dyskinetic in a 16- segment model of the left ventricle) was evaluated by echo at baseline and peak dobutamine. One hundred eighty-four patients were followed up (mean 15 +/- 13 months) and only cardiac death was considered as an end point. There were 29 cardiac deaths. Significant parameters for survival prediction at univariate analysis are: DeltaWMSI (chi-square 20.1; p <0.0000), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (chi-square 17.57; p <0.0000), rest ejection fraction (chi-square 10.41; p = 0.0013), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (chi-square 8.23; p = 0.0041), and hypertension (chi-square 8.08, p = 0.0045). In the multivariate stepwise analysis only DeltaWMSI and NYHA were independent predictors of outcome (DeltaWMSI = hazard ratio 0.02, p < 0.0000; NYHA class = hazard ratio 3.83, p < 0.0000). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a better outcome for patients with a large inotropic response (DeltaWMSI > or =0.44, a cutoff identified by receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis) than for those with a small or no myocardial inotropic response to dobutamine (93.6% vs 69.4%, p = 0.00033). Thus, in patients with IDC, an extensive contractile reserve identified by high-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography is associated with a better survival.", 
    "406": "Bradykinin accumulation is a potent cardioprotective mechanism underlying angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in ischemia and/or reperfusion injury. There is, however, concern about treatment with ACE inhibitors in the very early phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to adverse systemic hemodynamic effects. We tested the hypothesis that cardiac bradykinin metabolism can be influenced by very low doses of intracoronary ACE inhibitors without harmful systemic effects in patients with AMI. Twenty-two patients with AMI in Killip classes II to III who underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) were randomized to intracoronary enalaprilat (50 microg) or saline, given immediately after reopening of the infarct-related artery. Hemodynamics and electrocardiograms were monitored continuously and samples for determination of ACE activity, angiotensin II, bradykinin, kininogen, and cardiac marker proteins were collected from pulmonary arterial and central venous blood. Enalaprilat had no adverse effects on systemic hemodynamics, but rather stabilized arterial pressure and cardiac rhythm during reperfusion. Enalaprilat induced a 70% reduction of ACE activity and a significant increase of bradykinin in pulmonary arterial blood. Angiotensin II was not significantly affected by enalaprilat either in pulmonary arterial or in central venous blood. Myoglobin release was lower and the duration of reperfusion arrhythmias was significantly reduced in the enalaprilat group (p <0.05). Thus, in this pilot study, intracoronary enalaprilat infusion in the infarct-related artery is feasible in the setting of primary angioplasty and is safe and well tolerated. Effective cardiac ACE inhibition can be achieved by low-dose intracoronary enalaprilat, which primarily causes a potentiation of bradykinin.", 
    "407": "Isolated systolic hypertension is the most common type of hypertension in the elderly. A number of trials have widely shown that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review focuses the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension, its pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The optimal treatment strategy is to maximize reduction in systolic blood pressure and to minimize reduction in diastolic blood pressure. All classes of antihypertensive agents can be used, but calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors and, more recently, the angiotensin II antagonists appear to be more successful in improving large artery stiffness and therefore are especially useful in treating isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. A careful evaluation and treatment has to be made in particular in those patients with more risk factors, in order to choose the most appropriate drug and to avoid dangerous drug-drug interactions where polypharmacy occurs.",

Treatment was randomly given from 1 until 4 months after MI: placebo in 12 rats (P), fosinopril in 9 (F) and spironolactone + fosinopril in 12 (SF). The score of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) was related to the MI size and the delay from MI (p < 0.01). VPB's reduction/increase required to demonstrate anti/pro-arrhythmic effects were 55 and 59%. Mass indexes were lower in F and SF (p = 0.01).

Ideal VA candidates were more likely to undergo thrombolytic therapy at arrival (OR [VA relative to Medicare] 1.40 [1.05, 1.74]) or to receive ACE inhibitors (OR 1.67 [1.12, 2.45]) or aspirin (OR 2.32 [1.81, 3.01]) at discharge and equally likely to receive beta-blockers (OR 1.09 [1.03, 1.40]) at discharge.",

    "416": "To differentiate the relative effects of nuclear and cell surface angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors, we mutated the angiotensinogen cDNA by removing the signal sequence-encoding region to produce a nonsecreted form of angiotensinogen [Ang(-S)Exp]. Rat hepatoma cells (which produce renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNAs) were stably transfected with Ang(-S)Exp/pSVL (or a corresponding control) expression plasmid, and mitotic indices were measured for stably transfected cell lines. Experimental clonal cell lines demonstrate an average of 33+/-4.4% (P<0.001) increase in percentage-labeled nuclei compared with control cell lines. The mitogenic effect is blocked by 10(-6) mol/L losartan and by 1 micromol/L renin antisense phosphorothioate oligomers but not by 10(-6) mol/L candesartan. In addition, phenylarsine oxide, which blocks angiotensin receptor internalization, abolishes the losartan inhibitory effect, suggesting that after cell-surface receptor-mediated endocytosis, losartan blocks Ang II nuclear receptors. PDGF mRNA levels are elevated 2.2-fold in Ang(-S)Exp transfected cell lines; addition of anti-PDGF antibodies to the culture medium partially blocks the mitogenic effect of Ang(-S)Exp, while anti-Ang II antibodies have no effect. These results suggest that the Ang(-S)Exp growth effect is due, in part, to autocrine/paracrine stimulation by secreted PDGF after Ang II/Ang II receptor intracellular interactions. We further demonstrate that these cells produce the alternative renin transcript, renin 1A, which apparently lacks a signal sequence and is maintained intracellularly. Collectively, these studies of cultured cells suggest that some cell types may possess components of the renin-angiotensin system that permit intracellular processing of angiotensinogen to Ang II and that Ang II generated intracellularly may be mitogenic.", 
    "417": "1. The present studies were aimed at testing the hypothesis that S-nitrosylated captopril (CapNO), a novel crystalline nitric oxide (NO) donor, readily permeates both in vitro and in vivo endothelial monolayers, resulting in its pharmacodynamic effects. 2. CapNO and Captopril (Cap) were added to apical side of endothelial monolayers formed on microporous membranes, and the permeated drugs were collected from basolateral side and detected by a HPLC method. The permeability coefficient (P(app); cm sec(-1)) of CapNO across the endothelial monolayers was 6.0 x 10(-5), higher than that of Cap (3.13 x 10(-5)), indicating the enhancement effect of the attached NO group in CapNO on cellular permeability. The P(app) of CapNO and Cap across Caco-2 cells were 3.15 x 10(-5) and 1.53 x 10(-5), respectively. The low P(app) of CapNO to Caco-2 cells may be attributed to the high membrane resistance of Caco-2 cells. 3. A bolus injection of CapNO to epicardial coronary artery of chronically-instrumented awake dogs caused significant increases in coronary blood flow and coronary diameters dose-dependently without significant changes in aortic pressure. In contrast, the equimolar doses of Cap did not produce haemodynamic responses. 4. Intravenous CapNO caused an instant increase in the regional cerebral blood flow determined by H(2)-clearance, whereas the equimolar doses of Cap did not enhance the cerebral blood flow. 5. These results conclude that the NO group, an active component of CapNO, enhances both in vitro and in vivo endothelial permeability to the entire compound, resulting in instant increases in blood flow and vascular diameters. In contrast, the equimolar Cap does not have the instant vascular effects.", 
    "418": "Renal blood flow (RBF) is modulated by renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). However, agents that are supposed to reduce sympathetic tone, such as rilmenidine and captopril, influence RBF also by direct arteriolar effects. The present study was designed to test to what extent the renal nerves contribute to the renal hemodynamic response to rilmenidine and captopril. We used a technique that allows simultaneous recording of RBF and RSNA to the same kidney in conscious rabbits. We compared the dose-dependent effects of rilmenidine (0.01-1 mg/kg) and captopril (0.03-3 mg/kg) on RBF and RSNA in intact and renal denervated (RNX) rabbits. Because rilmenidine and captopril lower blood pressure, studies were also performed in sinoaortically denervated (SAD) rabbits to determine the role of the baroreflex in the renal hemodynamic response. Rilmenidine reduced arterial pressure, RBF, and RSNA dose dependently. In intact rabbits (n = 10), renal conductance (RC) remained unaltered (3 +/- 5%), even after the 1-mg/kg dose, which completely abolished RSNA. In RNX rabbits (n = 6), RC fell by 18 +/- 5%, whereas in SAD rabbits (n = 7) RC increased by 30 +/- 20% after rilmenidine. In intact rabbits, captopril increased RSNA maximally by 64 +/- 8%. RSNA did not rise in SAD rabbits. Despite the differential response or absence of RSNA, captopril increased RC to a comparable degree (maximally 40-50%) in all three groups. Using spectral analysis techniques, we found that in all groups, independently of ongoing RSNA, captopril, but not rilmenidine, attenuated both myogenic (0.07-0.25 Hz) and tubuloglomerular feedback (0.01-0.07 Hz) related fluctuations in RC. We conclude that, in conscious rabbits, the renal vasodilator effect of rilmenidine depends on the level of ongoing RSNA. Its sympatholytic effect is, however, blunted by a direct arteriolar vasoconstrictor effect. In contrast, the renal vasodilator effect of captopril is not modulated by ongoing RSNA and is associated with impairment of autoregulation of RBF.",

Aspirin did not significantly affect the heart rate or systolic blood pressure response in either the placebo or carvedilol groups. The effect of ASA became more significant on multivariate analysis. The change in LVEF was also influenced by carvedilol dose, etiology of heart failure, baseline heart rate, EF and coumadin use. The detrimental effect of ASA on the improvement in LVEF was dose-related and was present in both placebo and carvedilol groups, although the effect was statistically significant only in the much larger carvedilol group.",

    "424": "The presence of an altered renal function in essential hypertension, advanced heart failure (HF) and after a myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Indices of altered renal function (e.g., microalbuminuria, increased serum creatinine concentrations, decrease in estimated creatinine clearance or overt proteinuria) are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in any of the three clinical situations. These parameters should then be routinely evaluated in clinical practice. These facts have several therapeutic implications. First, although there is no evidence-based information on the level of blood pressure that confers optimal renal protection, levels substantially lower than past recommendations are advisable. Second, hypertensive kidney damage should be prevented by early treatment of hypertensive patients, particularly those with microalbuminuria. Finally, to avoid further aggravation of high cardiovascular risk, antihypertensive agents devoid of unwanted metabolic side effects should be used for the treatment of hypertensive vascular damage. In HF, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker seem to be the most renoprotective. Renal outcome is also improved by ACE inhibition after an MI. Finally, renal and cardiovascular outcome seem to run in parallel in all these situations.",

A single centre, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, comparative study to address the efficacy of controlled release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mmHg) in cyclosporin (CsA)-treated renal transplant recipients was performed. Recipients were randomised to receive either lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). The dose was doubled on indication. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg on monotherapy) were addressed during the early post-transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant phase (from 3 to 12 months after renal transplantation) in the same patient population. One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure> or =95 mmHg) were randomised within 3 wk after renal transplantation. One hundred and twenty-three patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) nifedipine-treated recipients responded during the early, and 26 (38%) during the late post-operative phase (months 4-12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%) lisinopril-treated recipients responded during the early, and 18 (33%) during the late post-transplant phase. Non-responders were, on average, 8.5+/-1.5 kg heavier both in the early phase and after 1 yr of treatment (p<0.01), and 6.1+/-0.9 yr older than responders (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that both controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally efficient in the treatment of post-transplant hypertension.

Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA) has pathological implications in inflammatory diseases and renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The present study aimed at determining if renal cortical HA in the adult rat is correlated to the abnormal morphology and function in rats treated neonatally with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. In adult control rats (23 weeks old), the cortical HA content was very low [about 5 microg g(-1) dry weight (d.w.)] and about 1% of the papillary HA content. In rats treated neonatally with enalapril (days 3-13), the cortical HA level was 15 times that in control rats already at 21 days after birth, and it persisted at this level during adulthood (at 23 weeks). At 13 weeks the enalapril-treated animals showed markedly reduced ability (-53%) to concentrate urine during 24-h thirst provocation. At 21 days as well as at 23 weeks the enalapril-treated kidneys displayed morphological changes, such as papillary atrophy, dilation of the tubules and cellular infiltration of the cortical tissue. Histochemical staining confirmed the HA quantification assay and revealed a patchy staining for HA located in the same regions as the infiltrating cells. In conclusion, neonatal treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril results in renal morphological and functional abnormalities during adulthood. Cortical HA levels are already seriously elevated at day 21 and coexist with infiltrating cells. Besides the known effects of angiotensin II in development, the accumulation of HA in these kidneys may be involved in the genesis of at least the cortical abnormalities in enalapril-treated animals because of the proinflammatory effects and water-binding properties of HA.", 
    "439": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and is the only major cardiovascular disease increasing in prevalence. Despite abundant evidence to support their efficacy and cost-effectiveness, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are sub-optimally used in patients with CHF. This paper reviews the evidence for the sub-optimal use of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF, the factors contributing to this, and its implications for health systems. A systematic review of all articles assessing practice patterns (specifically the use of ACE inhibitors in CHF) identified by MEDLINE, search of bibliographies, and contact with content experts was undertaken. 37 studies have documented the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF. Studies assessing use among all patients with CHF document 33% to 67% (median 51%) of all patients discharged from hospital and 10% to 36% (median 26%) of community dwelling patients were prescribed ACE inhibitors. Rates of ACE inhibitor use range from 43% to 90% (median of 71%) amongst those discharged from hospital having known systolic dysfunction, and from 67% to 95% (median of 86%) for those monitored in specialty clinics. Moreover, the dosages used in the 'real world' are substantially lower than those proven efficacious in randomised, controlled trials, with evaluations reporting only a minority of patients achieving target doses and/or an overall mean dose achieved to be less than one-half of the target dose. Factors predicting the use and optimal dose administration of ACE inhibitors are identified, and include variables relating to the setting (previous hospitalisation, specialty clinic follow-up), the physician (cardiology specialty versus family practitioner or general internist, board certification), the patient (increased severity of symptoms, male, younger), and the drug (lower frequency of administration). In light of the substantial evidence for reductions in morbidity and mortality, clearly, the prescription of ACE inhibitors is sub-optimal. Wide variability in ACE inhibitor use is noted, with higher rates consistently reported among patients having systolic dysfunction confirmed by an objective assessment--an apparent minority of the those having CHF. Optimisation of the prescription of proven efficacious therapies has the potential to confer a substantial reduction in the total cost of care for patients with CHF by reducing hospitalisations and lengths of hospital stays. It is likely that only multifaceted programs targeted toward the population at large will yield benefits to the healthcare system, given the widespread nature of the sub-optimal prescription of therapies proven effective in the management of patients with CHF.", 
    "440": "Compliance with medical therapy represents a multifactorial problem with marked consequences for individual and public health. Among the many contributing factors, the choice of drug may also determine the degree of compliance. Various studies investigating either compliance or persistence with antihypertensive therapy using a variety of methods have suggested that adherence to therapy may show the following pattern: diuretics < beta-blockers < calcium channel blockers < ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, two recent studies have shown that therapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers may be associated with better long-term adherence than other antihypertensive monotherapies including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Since medication compliance with antihypertensive therapy, among other factors, closely correlates with the experience of side effects, it may be speculated that the different classes of antihypertensives may induce varying degrees of compliance and persistence due to their different tolerability profiles. Side effects may induce variable compliance and nonpersistence by yet another mechanism. Therapy turbulence, ie, any change in medication, is also associated with nonpersistence. Therefore, side effects may directly or indirectly (via inducing therapy turbulence) underly variable compliance and nonpersistence.",

    "445": "Various mechanisms have been proposed for opioid receptor down regulation in different experimental preparations. The present study was aimed to test whether distinct mechanisms can mediate opioid receptor down regulation within the same cell. For this purpose we transfected HEK-293 cells with rat delta-opioid receptor (DOR). We exposed the cells to the opioid agonist etorphine in the absence or presence of various pharmacological agents and measured the binding of the opioid ligand [(3)H]diprenorphine to either isolated cell membranes or whole cells. We found that internalization of the receptors into the cell was mediated by clathrin coated pits and that the internalized receptors were degraded either in lysosomes or by proteosomes. Down regulation involved phosphorylation and at least two different kinases, a tyrosine kinase (TK) and MAPK kinase (MEK), mediated DOR down regulation in parallel routes. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) was found to have only a minor role in DOR down regulation in HEK-293 cells. On the other hand, in N18TG2 cells that endogenously express delta-opioid receptors, GRK was the predominant kinase mediating DOR down regulation, with only a minor role for TK and MEK. We conclude that down regulation can take place via divers pathways within the same cell, and that in different cells down regulation is mediated by different mechanisms, depending on the kinase profile of the cells and the compartmentalization of the receptors within the cells.",

The metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia resolved upon appropriate medical intervention and discontinuation of TMP-SMZ. While hyperkalemia has commonly been reported with high dose of TMP-SMZ, severe metabolic acidosis is quite uncommon with regular dose TMP-SMZ.

The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during ramipril or non-ACE inhibitor treatment were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, whereas the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles. Ramipril decreased Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35% and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01) in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001) but not by basal GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable among the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition do not depend on severity of renal insufficiency. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-lasting treatment may result in GFR stabilization and definitive prevention of ESRD.", 
    "461": "Pharmacologic blockade of the renin and endothelin (ET) systems is an established strategy to interfere with progression of renal failure. In the Heyman nephritis model, additive benefits of decreases in BP with the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and ET(A) receptor antagonists (ET-RA) were demonstrated. To further investigate these findings and to exclude confounding effects of BP decreases, this issue was reassessed in a low-renin model of subtotal kidney resection. Subtotally nephrectomized (SNX) and sham-operated rats were left untreated or received an ACE-i, an angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist (AT1-RA), an ET-RA, or combinations thereof (ACE-i plus ET-RA or AT1-RA plus ET-RA). The parameters studied were the glomerulosclerosis index (GSI), tubulointerstitial index, vascular damage index, glomerular geometry, and albumin excretion. After 12 wk, BP values were comparable. Urinary albumin excretion rates were significantly higher for untreated SNX rats (24.3 +/- 31.3 mg/24 h), compared with untreated sham-operated rats (0.71 +/- 0.40 mg/24 h). Rates were significantly lower for all treated, compared with untreated, SNX groups. GSI values were significantly higher for untreated SNX rats than for untreated sham-operated rats. ACE-i caused significantly lower GSI in SNX rats (0.46 +/- 0.06), compared with AT1-RA (0.60 +/- 0.10) or ET-RA (0.65 +/- 0.10). GSI values were significantly decreased further with ACE-i plus ET-RA (0.29 +/- 0.09) or AT1-RA plus ET-RA (23 +/- 0.05) treatment. Changes in the tubulointerstitial index and vascular damage index proceeded in parallel. The results document BP-independent effects of the ACE-i and AT1-RA on the GSI and urinary albumin excretion and an effect of the ET-RA on the GSI. The contrasting results suggest different pathogenetic pathways for glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria. The combination of treatments provided superior effects on the GSI and tubulointerstitial index but not on urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "462": "Clinical data have established microalbuminuria/proteinuria as an independent risk factor for the development and progression of renal disease in patients with either diabetes or essential hypertension. Decreased kidney function is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, even at modest reductions in estimated creatinine clearance (to approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or modest elevations in serum creatinine (>1.4 mg/dL). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown in clinical trials to delay or stabilize the rate of progression of renal disease. Reduction in cardiovascular events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, also has been shown in these high-risk individuals. These effects are dependent and independent of blood pressure control, suggesting a nonhemodynamic effect in blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In conjunction with other therapeutic interventions, such as dietary modification and control of serum lipids, it appears that for at least a subgroup of patients it is possible to delay or prevent progression of kidney failure. There frequently is a clustering of risk factors in these individuals, including insulin resistance, salt sensitivity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The mechanism of the relationship between albuminuria and cardiovascular disease is unclear but may be related to endothelial cell dysfunction. Nonetheless, the presence of microalbuminuria/proteinuria as a marker for cardiovascular disease has important implications for the identification and treatment of individuals at risk.", 
    "463": "A rapid global increase in the number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy necessitates that effective strategies for renal protection are developed and applied widely. We review the experimental and clinical evidence in support of individual renoprotective interventions, including angiotensin-converting enzyme therapy, control of systemic hypertension, dietary protein restriction, reduction of proteinuria, treatment of hyperlipidemia, and smoking cessation. We also consider potential future renoprotective therapies. To achieve maximal renal protection, a comprehensive strategy employing all of these elements is required. This strategy should be directed at normalizing clinical markers of renal disease to induce a state of remission.", 
    "464": "To evaluate the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril, a renally excreted angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, we assessed supervised administration of the drug after hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed by interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring, and endocrine responses were assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA) before and after dialysis. Lisinopril dose was titrated at biweekly intervals. If this was not effective after full titration (lisinopril to 40 mg three times weekly), ultrafiltration was added to reduce dry weight. The primary outcome variable was change in BP from the end of the run-in period to the end of the study. No change in mean ABP was noted during run-in. However, mean 44-hour ABP decreased from 149 +/- 14 (SD)/84 +/- 9 to 127 +/- 16/73 +/- 9 mm Hg, a decrease of 22/11 mm Hg (P < 0.001) at final evaluation. Of 11 patients who completed the trial, only 2 patients had systolic hypertension (>/=135 mm Hg) and 1 patient had diastolic hypertension (>/=85 mm Hg) at the final visit. Four patients were administered 10 mg of lisinopril; 5 patients, 20 mg; and 2 patients, 40 mg; only 1 of these patients required ultrafiltration therapy. There was a persistent antihypertensive effect over 44 hours. BP reduction was achieved without an increase in intradialytic symptomatic or asymptomatic hypotensive episodes. PRA increased in response to dialysis, as well as lisinopril. In conclusion, supervised lisinopril therapy is effective in controlling hypertension in chronic HD patients. This may be related to blockade of angiotensin II generation by kidneys despite the loss of excretory function.", 
    "465": "Vascular access complications are common in hemodialysis patients. To investigate whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors influences the rate of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft complications, we compared the rate of intervention-free graft survival among patients treated versus not treated with ACE inhibitors. We retrospectively analyzed the survival of grafts placed at our institution between January 1, 1995, and October 31, 1999. Among 121 grafts, 25 grafts were placed in 19 patients treated with ACE inhibitors and 96 grafts were placed in 68 patients not treated with ACE inhibitors. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 5 years. Ten of 25 grafts failed in the ACE-inhibitor group and 62 of 95 grafts failed in the non-ACE-inhibitor group. Actuarial intervention-free access survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) were significantly greater in the ACE-inhibitor than non-ACE-inhibitor group (71% versus 53% at 6 months, 58% versus 35% at 12 months, and 44% versus 22% at 24 months; P = 0.04). Using a Cox model adjusting for age, race, sex, and diabetes, the relative risk (RR) for access failure in the ACE-inhibitor group was 53% less than in the non-ACE-inhibitor group (RR, 0.47; p < 0.03). In a more complex Cox model with additional adjustment for comorbid conditions, the RR was even lower (RR, 0.32; P = 0.003) for the ACE-inhibitor compared with non-ACE-inhibitor group (reference = 1.00). The lower RR was observed for patients with and without congestive heart failure. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors offer clinical promise in the prevention of PTFE graft failure. A prospective randomized trial is warranted to confirm the benefit of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "466": "Perindopril is the newest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to be approved in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension either alone or in combination with other antihypertensives, especially thiazide diuretics. Perindopril must be converted to perindoprilat, its active metabolite. The drug's prolonged duration of action allows for once daily administration. This article reviews clinical trials performed using perindopril alone and in combination to treat essential hypertension. The use of perindopril for congestive heart failure is reviewed. The influence of perindopril on arterial wall properties is discussed. Tolerability, drug interactions, and dosage and administration of the drug are reviewed.", 
    "467": "Pulmonary artery hypertension occurs when there is a sustained elevation of the mean pulmonary pressure above normal physiologic values. This may then lead to cor pulmonale or enlargement of the right ventricle due to any lung disease in the absence of left heart failure. When the ability of the right ventricle to compensate is overwhelmed, right-sided heart failure can occur. Pulmonary artery hypertension may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a variety of lung parenchymal diseases, airways disease, pulmonary circulatory disorders, systemic illnesses, or thoracic mechanical abnormalities. Treatment strategies for cor pulmonale include supplemental oxygen, assisted mechanical ventilation, digoxin, and diuretics. Pulmonary vasodilator compounds should be used with caution because they can compromise gas exchange in cor pulmonale from secondary pulmonary hypertension. Trials with digoxin and inotropic agents have been evaluated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have not shown significant utility, at least acutely. Anticoagulation may decrease mortality in some patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and cor pulmonale.", 
    "468": "Increasing arterial stiffness and decreasing arterial compliance are now thought to occur at the beginning of the hypertension disease process. Decreased arterial compliance is associated with isolated systolic blood pressure elevations. Many clinical trials of isolated systolic hypertension provide indirect evidence that improving compliance lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program showed that antihypertensive therapy in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension lowers systolic blood pressure and narrows pulse pressure without unduly lowering diastolic blood pressure. Treatment over 5 years significantly reduced the incidence of stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death, all cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. The Systolic Hypertension in Europe and Systolic Hypertension in China trials showed similar effects on pulse pressure and on clinical end points. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation was a primary prevention study of the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in subjects who were not necessarily hypertensive but were at risk for cardiovascular events. With minimal lowering of blood pressure, ramipril therapy provided significant risk reduction in all major end points--overall mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. ACE inhibitors restore endothelial cell balance to improve arterial compliance, thus they can provide benefits beyond lowering blood pressure.", 
    "469": "Hypertension is a syndrome in which dysfunction of the blood vessels and of neuroendocrine systems play a major role. Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are distinct processes in arterial disease. Arteriosclerosis begins with thickening and hardening of the arterial wall, with loss of elasticity. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process that begins with endothelial dysfunction, and leads to vascular occlusion. The endothelial dysfunction that causes atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease results from an imbalance between nitric oxide and angiotensin-II. This balance becomes tipped toward angiotensin-II in the presence of hypertension. When arteries stiffen as a result of hypertension and aging, they are not able to store blood volume properly, systolic blood pressure rises, and pulse pressure widens. Because the tissue renin-angiotensin system is responsible for promoting the adverse structural arterial changes, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is effective in restoring the health of both large and small arteries by blocking angiotensin and by increasing bradykinin.", 
    "470": "Traditionally, the main emphasis in hypertension treatment has been on lowering diastolic blood pressure. Recently, this emphasis has been shifting toward systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, the latter of which might be a better indicator of future clinical events than either blood pressure reading alone or in combination. Increased pulse pressure indicates increased arterial stiffness and hence is commonly seen in older subjects. As patients age and vessels stiffen, there is a resulting loss of arterial compliance, the ability of the vessel to store blood volume temporarily as it is ejected with each systole. The arterial system acts like a Windkessel, or pump, as it converts intermittent flow from the heart into continuous flow to the organs. The process of stiffening occurs via vascular remodeling, a redistribution of the heterogeneous elements of the vascular wall. Endothelial dysfunction can trigger this remodeling process, increasing stiffness, raising blood pressure and pulse pressure, and ultimately leading to atherosclerosis, plaque formation, and attendant clinical events. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists can restore arterial compliance, they are suitable choices for hypertension treatment when it is complicated by vascular stiffness.", 
    "471": "Although drug treatment for hypertension has been widely used for many years, overall control of this disease continues to be less than optimal. Hypertension treatment has had a positive impact on stroke rates, but rates of coronary heart disease remain high. One reason for this lack of success in treatment is that physicians have focused too narrowly on lowering blood pressure. Blood pressure is a critical element of hypertension, but many other interrelated risk factors contribute to form a complex syndrome of hypertension. Studies show that young adult subjects who do not yet have high blood pressure but do have a family history of hypertension exhibit increased incidence of other risk factors, such as high cholesterol, left ventricular dysfunction, reduced arterial compliance, and insulin resistance. These patients with \"normotensive hypertension\" share many characteristics with patients with fully developed hypertension, both uncontrolled and controlled. The link between these many risk factors and high blood pressure seems to lie in endothelial cell balance. If this balance is upset, elements of the hypertension syndrome start to become manifest, often before blood pressure becomes elevated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can restore this critical balance, improving overall arterial health and arterial compliance and thus preventing the progression of the hypertension syndrome to high blood pressure and, ultimately, target organ damage.", 
    "472": "In its simplest and most succinct definition, heart failure can be defined as an inability of the heart to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Despite the diverse etiologies of heart failure in the pediatric population, the presentation of heart failure represents a common constellation of symptoms, signs, and physical findings. In infants, an inability to maintain growth either secondary to decreased nutritional intake or an increased catabolic state is a hallmark of heart failure. Infants exhibit increased sympathetic tone with excessive diaphoresis and increased heart rate. Physical findings in the infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) include increased work of breathing, tachypnea and hepatomegaly. In older children, in contrast, new onset heart failure may be less overtly symptomatic. Malaise, decrease in the level of daily activity, and weight loss may be present. Symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea and anorexia can be present and sometimes divert attention from the real etiology. Physical findings include rales and peripheral edema. If there is hepatomegaly, there will likely be hepatic tenderness as well. A gallop rhythm and tachycardia are commonly present. The long-term treatment of CHF in children includes digoxin, diuretics and afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Digoxin decreases sympathetic tone and improves growth in infants. Diuretics should be used to relieve symptoms but may not be necessary in all children. ACE inhibitors are increasingly valuable in maintaining cardiac function long term. New uses of medications include the addition of spironalactone (Aldactone, G. D. Searle & Co., Chicago, IL) which, in adults, has been shown to significantly decrease both the death rate from CHF and the need for hospitalization. Beta-Blockers have been used in children in limited studies and may have a role in the treatment of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Surgical treatment, such as partial vectriculectomy, has shown short-term benefit and has been used sparingly in infants.", 
    "473": "Omapatrilat is the most clinically advanced of a new class of drugs, vasopeptidase inhibitors, which are being studied for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. Omapatrilat inhibits the enzymatic activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. The end result is blockade of angiotensin-II formation and inhibition of the catabolism of vasodilatory hormones, such as the natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin. Some of the ultimate pharmacologic effects include vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis, which may be beneficial in the management of various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. The pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat are compatible with once-daily dosing and a duration of antihypertensive efficacy of more than 24 hours. Omapatrilat decreases blood pressure in both high-renin and low-renin states, which suggests antihypertensive efficacy that is independent of the status of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, the antihypertensive effect of omapatrilat is indiscriminate of age or race. Omapatrilat has consistently shown efficacy in decreasing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to a similar or greater extent than either lisinopril or amlodipine; however, systolic pressure is more responsive to omapatrilat treatment than diastolic pressure. Although the role of omapatrilat in heart failure is still evolving, preliminary results are promising: hemodynamic improvements and clinical benefits of omapatrilat are similar or greater to those achieved with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Future studies (specifically the OVERTURE Study) will be of pivotal importance in establishing the role of omapatrilat in the treatment of patients with heart failure. The side-effect and drug-interaction profiles of omapatrilat are largely incomplete, but suggest excellent tolerability and a side-effect profile that is similar to placebo. Omapatrilat could be a revolutionary addition to the management of cardiovascular disease, and its clinical development will be followed closely by many who are curious if larger clinical trials will echo the impressive preliminary data that have been seen thus far.", 
    "474": "Aspirin (ASA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy reduce mortality when administered early after the onset of myocardial infarction. ASA can antagonize some effects of ACEi therapy by inhibiting the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins; however, the evidence for this effect from large controlled trials is contradictory. The authors analyzed a database of 18,895 patients of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio-3 (GISSI-3) Trial in which patients were allocated either to receive lisinopril or not to receive lisinopril within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of myocardial infarction. The aim of the study was to verify the possible negative interaction between ASA and the ACEi lisinopril in the postacute phase of acute myocardial infarction. Of 18,895 analyzable patients, 15,841 received ASA at entry. Overall lisinopril reduced 42-day mortality from 7.1% to 6.3%. In patients receiving ASA, mortality was reduced by lisinopril from 6.0% to 5.4%, and from 13.0% to 10.8% in patients not receiving ASA. The difference in proportional reductions of mortality corresponds to the fact that a more marked lisinopril effect is seen in patients at higher baseline risk across all study subgroups, one of which coincides with the no-ASA group. The analysis of the inhospital incidence of major clinical events did not reveal a potentially negative interaction between ASA and lisinopril. The same findings were obtained from the analysis of reinfarction at 42 days. The interaction between ASA and lisinopril was also tested by multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding variables at entry, and the interaction tests were not statistically significant. Serum creatinine levels at 42 days were significantly higher in lisinopril group than in the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in lisinopril group were significantly lower than controls at 42 days. The effect of lisinopril on creatinine and blood pressure did not differ between the ASA and no-ASA groups. ASA does not decrease the mortality benefit of early lisinopril after myocardial infarction, nor does it increase the risk of major adverse events. Lisinopril is safe and effective when given early after the onset of myocardial infarction, regardless of a concomitant administration of ASA started early and continued over a 6-week period.",

Diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States, and is primarily responsible for the 9% increase in prevalence of end-stage renal disease during the past 10 years. However, there is evidence that tight blood-pressure control can reduce the vascular complications of diabetes. This reduction was demonstrated in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, in which patients who were randomized to a tight blood-pressure control group had 24% fewer vascular complications (including strokes and diabetic retinopathy) than patients in usual-care groups. Thus, the target goal for blood pressure in patients with diabetes is 130/85 mmHg. Microalbuminuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, and is most pronounced in patients whose 24-hour blood pressure shows a nondipping pattern (failure of the blood pressure to fall at night). The prevalence of nondipping blood pressure is increased in patients with diabetes and in patients with renal disease due to other causes. Further, there is evidence that patients with nondipping blood pressure show more rapid deterioration of renal function than patients with dipping blood pressure. High nocturnal pressure in patients with nondipping blood pressure may accelerate glomerular damage. For example, studies of animals with diabetes have shown that the afferent glomerular arteriole is dilated when compared with the efferent arteriole, thereby exposing the glomerulus to the systemic arterial pressure. Numerous studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are superior to some antihypertensive agents (particularly beta blockers and diuretics) in the prevention of renal damage. This observation is based on results of a metaanalysis that demonstrated a 9%/year glomerular filtration rate decrease in patients taking beta blockers or diuretics, but only a 1%/year decrease in patients taking ACE inhibitors. The role of calcium channel blockers is more controversial, but there is evidence to suggest that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may confer the same benefit as ACE inhibitors. Alpha blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers show promise, but have been less widely studied.", 
    "476": "As the developing world becomes increasingly industrialized and urbanized, and its vast populations adopt more westernized diets and lifestyles, the burden of cardiovascular disease and disability is growing at an alarming rate. The results of prospective observational studies conducted in both western and eastern populations have established the strong association between the primary incidence of stroke and the level of blood pressure. Further, randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have demonstrated a reduction in primary stroke risk. Among persons with a history of cerebrovascular disease, data from the United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack Aspirin Trial (UKTIA) has demonstrated a similar relationship between blood pressure and secondary stroke risk. Trials of blood-pressure lowering in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease also suggested a reduction in stroke risk. However, patients numbers in these trials were small, and the results were not conclusive. PROGRESS (Perindopril pROtection aGainst Recurrent Stroke Study) is a large, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to provide a definitive answer to these questions. Its primary aim is to determine the effect of blood-pressure lowering on stroke incidence in patients with a history of a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 6,105 patients were randomized to receive perindopril (plus indapamide) or placebo in seven regions of the world. The current mean follow-up period exceeds 30 months, and a total follow-up period of at least 4 years is planned. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of other major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, and of cognitive decline and dementia. Both the major event rate and the degree of adherence to randomized therapy exceed initial projections, which suggests that the study should have the power to achieve its main objectives by the planned completion date of 2001.", 
    "477": "The arterial circulation is composed of conduit arteries that store blood in systole (capacitive function), small branch points that contribute to pressure oscillations and reflected waves (oscillatory function), and arterioles that control blood flow (resistance function). These vessels are lined by endothelial cells that secrete nitric oxide and other substances that influence smooth-muscle tone, growth, and structural remodeling. The role of endothelial function is greater in thin-walled vessels than in conduit arteries, including proximal elastic vessels with thick walls. Thus, endothelial dysfunction is most likely to raise resistance and alter pressure oscillations than to produce early changes in the conduit artery wall. Later structural changes, facilitated by endothelial dysfunction, lead to reduced large artery compliance and widened pulse pressure as markers of risk for a cardiovascular event. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly those with vascular effects, tend to restore endothelial function and may result in regression of the structural alterations. Pulse contour analysis is the most sensitive means of assessing both capacitive oscillatory and resistance vessel function of the vasculature. Noninvasive radial artery tonometry with computer analysis of diastolic pressure decay provides independent measures of capacitive function, oscillatory function, and resistance, which allows screening and monitoring of arterial function. Such monitoring should lead to more individualized management that could supplement pressure monitoring as a guide to the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.", 
    "478": "The goal of antihypertensive treatment, in addition to lowering blood pressure, is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Until recently, however, only conventional treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers had been studied in terms of cardiovascular end points. In this article, Dr Yeun reviews the results of recent trials comparing these agents with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. She examines the confounding elements in the trials, provides an interpretation of study results, and suggests a practical approach to initial treatment of uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "479": "It is becoming increasingly clear that high blood pressure is not the sole cause of the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension. Reduction of blood pressure is of utmost importance, but many other factors contribute significantly to the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and death. In this article, Dr Glasser reviews hypertension as a syndrome, emphasizing therapy to improve blood pressure control, increase arterial compliance, and inhibit or reverse vascular remodeling.", 
    "480": "Patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes have a particularly high risk for heart failure and a poor prognosis once they develop heart failure. The choice of drugs for the management of heart failure in these patients should be directed at changing the natural history of the disease. The various drugs available for the treatment of heart failure, including ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers, are known to be beneficial and should be given as first-line agents. Aggressive risk-factor modification and tight blood pressure and glycemic control are crucial. Much work is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of various oral antidiabetic agents, especially the TZDs, for which the theoretic benefits are substantial and overall morbidity and mortality impact remain ill-defined.", 
    "481": "A procoagulant state has been found to exist in diabetes mellitus. There may be activation of the intrinsic coagulation system, decreased fibrinolytic activity, or alterations in platelet function. Intensive glycemic control with insulin is effective in reducing the impact of this procoagulant state by favorably affecting all three components of the system. Decreased fibrinolytic activity, as influenced by plasma PAI-1 levels, may be favorably affected by weight loss, exercise, a low-GI diet, or by metformin, thiazolidinediones, gemfibrozil, and ACE inhibitor therapy. Insulin has variable effects on plasma PAI-1 activity. Estrogens will lower the elevated PAI-1 levels seen in the menopausal state. Collaborative trial evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin as a primary or secondary prevention strategy in diabetic persons who are at high cardiovascular risk. A recent study suggests that this category includes virtually every type 2 diabetic individual in the United States. The American Diabetes Association recommends enteric-coated aspirin, 81 to 325 mg/day, as the first choice. In the case of aspirin allergy, clopidrogel is an alternate choice. Thus, recognition of and therapy for a procoagulant state in diabetes mellitus is likely to result in a decrease in the atherothrombotic events that characterize the later stages of this disease.", 
    "482": "After the menopause the consequences of hypertension in women change. Their risks of myocardial infarction and stroke rise steeply, a rise that has been blamed in part on the loss of estrogen and the onset of menopausal metabolic syndrome, with endothelial dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and derangement in coagulation. Hypertensive menopausal women have not had optimum treatment. They have poorer prognoses than men of the same age. Their antihypertensive management therefore merits special attention. Hormone replacement, aspirin prophylaxis and lipid-lowering drugs have their place. The antihypertensive drug chosen should not worsen the metabolic syndrome: angiotensin-II converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are therefore among the first-line drugs. Few drugs have been specifically aimed at menopausal hypertension and these are reviewed here.", 
    "483": "Successful management of the patient presenting with acute cardiovascular compromise requires a thorough working knowledge of the therapeutic agents available for treatment. This article focuses on the indications for, dosing, and monitoring employed for successful use of the vasoactive agents and antiarrhythmic medications in current widespread use in the veterinary intensive care setting.", 
    "484": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most often prescribed drugs for the treatment of hypertension, but there is still uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits of their use as first-line drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Compared with placebo, dihydropyridine CCBs (long-acting nifedipine and nitrendipine) reduce the risk for cardiovascular endpoints, and in a pooled analysis of available studies on treatment of hypertension, significantly decrease the risk for strokes and cardiovascular and total mortality. This also holds true for patients with diabetes who have a clearly reduced risk when treated with CCBs as compared with placebo. However, compared with other active treatments in mixed study populations, CCBs are associated with a small risk increase for myocardial infarction and heart failure, but for cardiovascular mortality, there is only a very small and nonsignificant trend to a risk increase, and total mortality is similar. Among patients with diabetes, compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in particular, available data suggest that CCB use is associated with a moderate increase in cardiac endpoints. Therefore, among patients with diabetes and those with heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferable as first-line drugs; among the large fraction of patients without these conditions, there is no convincing evidence that long-acting dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine CCBs are inferior to other blood pressure-lowering drugs. In these patients, the choice of blood pressure-lowering medication can be based on the expected tolerability, costs, and personal preferences.",

Adult patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were randomized to either Group 1 (treatment with diuretics or beta-blockers) or Group 2 (treatment with calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and followed for 5 +/- 1 months. Physicians practiced standard care while documenting medications, BP measurements, and health care resource use for their patients. A subsequent analysis evaluating the relationship between BP and physician visits was performed for the whole population and for a subpopulation of patients with at least 4 months of follow-up data. Cox regression was used to model time to next visit.", 
    "488": "A total of 512 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were followed: 399 had follow-up data for at least 4 months. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test showed that the time to next visit for patients with uncontrolled BP was significantly shorter than for patients whose BP was controlled (P < 0.05). On average, patients with uncontrolled BP (> or = 140/90 mm Hg) had follow-up office visits approximately 13 days earlier than patients with controlled BP (< 140/90 mm Hg). This association remained significant after adjustment for repeated measures, and after exclusion of the first return visit. Cox regression analysis showed that higher systolic and diastolic BP measurements were significantly associated with a shorter time to next visit, after adjustment for age and sex. Total estimated costs during the study period were $170 per patient for medications and $283 per patient for office visits.",

IR and hyperinsulinemia have an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Thus, antihypertensive drugs that lower IR, may have an additional beneficial effect in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in these patients. In this preliminary study we examined the effect of Losartan (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) treatment on IR and beta cell function in five hypertensive non-diabetic chronic hemodialysis patients. All other known causes of IR in end stage renal failure were excluded. After a washout period of two weeks, Losartan 50 mg, was administered for 6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels were measured before and after the treatment IR and beta cell function were calculated using the \"homeostasis model assessment\"-HOMA. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) have not changed significantly throughout the study. FBG increased significantly from 76 mg/dL +/- 1 to 89 mg/dL +/- 4 (p < 0.01), however, insulin levels have not changed significantly. Calculated IR values did not show a difference, but calculated beta cell function decreased significantly after Losartan treatment from 291% +/- 50 to 146% +/- 10, (p < 0.016). These preliminary results suggest that in chronic hemodialysis hypertensive non-diabetic patients short treatment with Losartan has deleterious effect on glucose homeostasis mediated via a decrease in beta cell function.",

At the age of 10 weeks, 5/6 nephrectomized SHR were allocated to receive two doses of CS-866 (CS-3; 3 mg/kg/day, or CS-10; 10 mg/kg/day), temocapril (TEM; 10 mg/kg/day), a combination of CS-866 (3 mg/kg/day) and temocapril (10 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle alone via oral gavage for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary protein excretion (UprotV) were measured every two weeks. At the age of 18 weeks, the rats were decapitated and the blood, remnant kidney, aorta and heart were collected and used for biochemical measurements and histopathological studies. There was no significant difference in body weight among the groups during the study. All drug treatments significantly reduced SBP, UprotV, glomerular sclerosis index (GSI), relative interstitial volume (RIV) and the heart weight to body weight ratio. The hypotensive effects were in the order of combination therapy > CS-10 = TEM > CS-3. For correlational analysis, we used values for SBP and UprotV derived from the average of values in rats over the age of 12 weeks through 18 weeks. UprotV, GSI and RIV were found to be highly correlated with SBP among the individual rats pooled from all groups (r = 0.511, r = 0.754, r = 0.817, respectively) and the correlation was maintained among the group means (r = 0.945, r = 0.989, r = 0.918, respectively). Furthermore, the heart weight to body weight ratio was found to be highly correlated with SBP among the individual rats pooled from all groups (r = 0.923) and the correlation was maintained among the group means (r = 0.996). We conclude that organ protective effects of CS-866, TEM, or combination therapy are closely related to the magnitude of their antihypertensive effects.",

    "501": "The objective of the present study was to determine the autonomic effects of angiotensin II (AT(1)) receptor blocker therapy in heart failure. In a randomized double-blind cross-over study, we compared the effects of candesartan and placebo on baroreflex sensitivity and on heart rate variability at rest, during stress and during 24 h monitoring. Acute effects were assessed 4 h after oral candesartan (8 mg) and chronic effects after 4 weeks of treatment (dose titrated to 16 mg daily). The study group comprised 21 patients with heart failure [mean (S.E.M.) ejection fraction 33% (1%)], in the absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We found that acute candesartan was not different from placebo in its effects on blood pressure or mean RR interval. Chronic candesartan significantly reduced blood pressure [placebo, 137 (3)/82 (3) mmHg; candesartan, 121 (4)/75 (2) mmHg; P<0.001; values are mean (S.E.M.)], but had no effect on mean RR interval [placebo, 857 (25) ms; candesartan, 857 (21) ms]. Compared with placebo there were no significant effects of acute or chronic candesartan on heart rate variability in the time domain and no consistent effects in the frequency domain. Baroreflex sensitivity assessed by the phenylephrine bolus method was significantly increased after chronic candesartan [placebo, 3.5 (0.5) ms/mmHg; candesartan, 4.8 (0.7) ms/mmHg; P<0.05], although there were no changes in cross-spectral baroreflex sensitivity. Thus, in contrast with previous results with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockade in heart failure did not increase heart rate variability, and there was no consistent effect on baroreflex sensitivity.", 
    "502": "Plasmapheresis is a general term involving extracorporeal plasma separation by centrifugation or primary membrane plasma separator (MPS). Further plasma processing can be accomplished by the use of secondary membrane plasma fractionation (PF), as in double filtration plasmapheresis, also called cascade filtration, low-density lipoprotein pheresis, thermofiltration, and cryofiltration apheresis. Otherwise, the separated plasma is replaced by colloid solution as in plasma exchange (PE). PE is used, unselectively, to treat patients with immunological, neurological, hematological, renal, and metabolic disorders. Secondary PF may be a more selective alternative. In general, the primary MPS and secondary PF are safe, effective, and biocompatible. The advantages of the primary MPS include its simplicity to use with blood pumps and no observed white blood cell or platelet loss, compared with centrifugation. The disadvantages are lack of versatility, the need to monitor transmembrane pressure to prevent hemolysis, and possible biocompatibility issues such as use of polyvinyl alcohol membranes. The advantages of secondary PF, compared with PE, include selective removal of macromolecules according to molecular weight and filter pore size. No deficiency syndromes or sepsis are observed, nor is replacement solution required. More than 1 plasma volume may be processed, and it is less expensive than PE. Cryofiltration apheresis, using the cryoglobulin filter, selectively removes cryoproteins and is a specific treatment for cryoprecipitate-induced diseases. The disadvantages of PF include biocompatibility, especially with concomitant ACE inhibitor use, and membrane plugging. An important disadvantage is that most PFs are investigational in the United States. This article reviews the availability, safety, efficacy, and biocompatibility of primary MPSs and secondary PF in the United States.", 
    "503": "Several different techniques of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis are available for management of severe hypercholesterolemia. Among them, the adsorption system with a dextran-sulfate cellulose (DSC) column is most widely used. In addition to adsorption of LDL, DSC adsorbs plasma constituents that have the following characteristics: proteins containing apolipoprotein B (Lp[a]); proteins involved in the initial contact phase of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (coagulation factor XII, high-molecular-weight kininogen and prekallikrein); factors with lipophilic characteristics (coagulation factor VII, coagulation factor VIII, and vitamin E); and proteins with adhesive or other characteristics (von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, serum amyloid P component, hepatocyte growth factor). The adsorption of these proteins seems to ameliorate prevention or regression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, plasma treatment by the DSC column may be useful for treatment of inexorable diseases, such as amyloidosis. On the other hand, the DSC column generates bradykinin by activation of the initial contact phase of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Bradykinin generation may explain the functional improvement in the circulatory system, as well as hypotension during LDL apheresis, which is observed in patients taking ACE inhibitors.",

In the present study, we describe a facile route for the purification of the human recombinant chymase. Chymase being produced as inactive prochymase, to be cathepsin C-activated, newly raised anti-chymase Ig were used to follow the purification. In order to complete the available tools for the search of chymase inhibitors, we developed and assessed a new 96-well plate based assay for the measurement of enzyme activity, as well as a low throughput, HPLC-based one. The assays used an original derivative of angiotensin I, or the native hormone. Chymase was produced in CHO cells and appropriately matured. The amount of enzyme obtained at the end of the process is compatible with the medium-throughput screening (up to 10,000 points per day), about 800 microg x L(-1) of culture medium with a specific activity of 6.16 mmol of angiotensin I cleaved per minute per mg of protein. All the biological and technical tools are now available for the discovery of new classes of chymase inhibitors.", 
    "529": "The important neuroendocrine systems involved in heart failure are reviewed with special emphasis on their possible role in pathophysiology and their relation to prognostic and diagnostic information. Plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA), renin, vasopressin, endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are all elevated in heart failure. Activity of the sympathetic nervous system as reflected by NA is correlated to mortality and seems to possess independent prognostic information. Several studies have now documented the beneficial effect of beta-blockade in chronic heart failure (CHF). Renin seems to be a poor prognostic marker in CHF possibly because of the interference with diuretic treatment, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonist, and probably also because of the significance of tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS), poorly reflected by plasma renin. On the other hand, several large-scale trials with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have demonstrated reduced mortality and morbidity in CHF. Plasma vasopressin does not seem to possess prognostic information but testing of non-peptide antagonists is ongoing. Endothelin-1 seems to have independent prognostic information and endothelin receptor antagonists may represent a therapeutic possibility. The natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP are correlated to prognosis and possess independent information. Brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal ANP seem to increase early, i.e. in asymptomatic heart failure. Plasma BNP being more stable than ANP is therefore a promising measure of left ventricular dysfunction. Increase in ANP and BNP, potentially beneficial, may be achieved by administration of neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, at present an unsettled therapeutic possibility. Several cytokines are increased in heart failure and especially TNF-alpha has drawn attention. Experimental studies suggest that TNF-alpha is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure and preliminary studies indicate that inhibition of TNF-alpha seems to be a possible therapeutic approach. Thus, neuroendocrine markers seem to (i) have a role in diagnosis and classification of heart failure, (ii) be useful in providing a 'neuroendocrine profile' which enlightens different aspects of heart failure, and therefore (iii) in the future probably will be valuable in the choice of medical treatment of the individual patient. In addition to beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists several new drugs based on neuroendocrine modification are on their way and might become important in the future.", 
    "530": "Rilmenidine is an imidazoline derivative that appears to lower blood pressure (BP) by an interaction with imidazoline (I1) receptors in the brainstem (and kidneys). Rilmenidine is as effective in monotherapy as all other first-line classes of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. It is well tolerated and can be taken in combination for greater efficacy. Sedation and dry mouth are not prominent side effects and withdrawal hypertension is not seen when treatment is stopped abruptly. Recently, in addition to a reduction in BP, this agent has been shown to improve glucose tolerance, lipid risk factors, and insulin sensitivity. These changes would be consistent with a reduction in long-term cardiovascular risk, as would recently described actions on the heart (reducing left ventricular hypertrophy) and the kidney (reducing microalbuminuria). Although no data are yet available from prospective long-term outcome studies, rilmenidine could represent an important new development in antihypertensive therapy and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "531": "Whereas individual research papers about antihypertensive treatment in diabetics might be somewhat confusing, the weight of the evidence strongly suggests that: 1) In patients with type 1 diabetes, it is advantageous to use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as primary treatment. 2) In type 2 diabetics, aggressive blood pressure (BP) lowering is warranted and, the calcium antagonist controversy notwithstanding, all drugs appear to be similarly useful in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Specifically, in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe study, compared with placebo, a calcium antagonist dramatically reduced cardiovascular (CV) events in elderly diabetics. The Hypertension Optimal Treatment study showed that, using a calcium antagonist-based regimen, the degree of BP lowering determines the degree of CV event reduction. Furthermore, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) did not find a difference in CV events reduction in patients treated with beta-blockers or with ACE inhibitors. In the UKPDS, the effect of BP lowering on reduction in CV events was more substantial than the degree of CV reduction by blood sugar lowering. 3) Both the CAPtopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) studies found that treatment with an ACE inhibitor may be useful in reducing the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. 4) Finally, insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes mellitus and a strong predictor of future CV disease, is differentially affected by antihypertensive treatment. beta-Blockers and diuretics worsen insulin resistance, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockers and central imidazoline binding agents increase insulin sensitivity. The effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin blockers may also positively affect insulin resistance, but the results are not uniformly positive. It stands to reason that the differential effect of various drugs on insulin resistance and primary CV events may be clinically relevant particularly in the course of the long-term prevention of mild hypertension. All current trials investigate the effect of the treatment on secondary prevention of CV events among patients with advanced complicated diabetes and hypertension.",

    "537": "The aim of this study was to compare the mechanical and intrinsic effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, vs a beta-blocker, on brachial arterial compliance. In a double blind study, 34 essential hypertensive patients were treated for 3 months with either ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n = 17, age 57 +/- 7 y, 11 males) or atenolol 50-100 mg daily (n = 17, age 53 +/- 8 y, 11 males). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and effective compliance (Ceff), were measured before and at the end of the study. Isobaric evaluation (Ciso) was performed in the entire population studied at an average mean BP of 110 mmHg. Ramipril significantly reduced BP from 155 +/- 16/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 140 +/- 15/85 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate (HR; 74 +/- 10 vs. 75 +/- 12 bpm). In addition, it significantly improved both PWV (18%; p < 0.001) and arterial compliance (45%; p < 0.001), from which 35% was related to a pressure independent effect (p < 0.01). Atenolol also induced a reduction in both BP (159 +/- 17/96 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 13/81 +/- 8 mmHg; p < 0.001) and HR (76 +/- 10 to 57 +/- 7 bpm; p < 0.001). In a similar way, PWV (11%; p < 0.05) and Ceff (30%; p < 0.05) were significantly improved without significant change in Ciso. This suggests that blood pressure reduction was responsible for compliance improvement. In conclusion, it is suggested that atenolol induces only hemodynamic changes, mediated mainly by BP reduction. In contrast, the improved brachial buffering function observed after ramipril involves not only hemodynamic changes, but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as modification of wall structures.", 
    "538": "Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has greater vascular selectivity than other calcium channel antagonists and does not depress the intact myocardium in vivo. It should be taken on an empty stomach. Both rapid-release and coat-core formulations are available for clinical use, but only the coat-core formulation extends antihypertensive, antiischemic, and antianginal effects throughout the dosing interval when given once daily. The coat-core formulation in daily doses of 10 to 40 mg does not cause the proischemic effects reported with the rapid-release formulation. When given as monotherapy, the coat-core formulation is highly effective in lowering blood pressure to a similar extent as other long-acting calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The antihypertensive effects are potentiated when the coat-core formulation of nisoldipine is given in combination with lisinopril. In patients with stable angina pectoris nisoldipine coat-core increases exercise duration, reduces anginal frequency and myocardial ischemia, and is effective as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blockers. In monotherapy the drug is as effective as other long-acting calcium channel blockers or a beta-blocker. The effects of nisoldipine coat-core in patients with heart failure are unclear at present.",

In the myometrium, the ACE activity was significantly higher in dioestrous than in oestrous. ACE activity correlated negatively with the day of gestation in the endometrium and myometrium but positively in the placentome and allantoamniotic membrane. Autoradiography showed, that ACE was localized in vascular endothelial cells in all compartments. ACE was also expressed in the endometrial stroma and uterine glands, most pronounced in the outer part of the basal zone. In the intercotyledonary membrane and the placentome, the mesenchymal cells located near the trophoblast cells expressed ACE. Solitary macrophage- or monocyte-like cells showing intense renin immunoreactivity were found in the uterus, while the uterine and the glandular epithelial cells displayed inconsistent reactivity. No renin was observed in the placentomes or in the fetal membranes. The findings demonstrate a regulated expression of angiotensin-forming enzymes throughout the bovine uteroplacental unit.

It is estimated that perhaps 50 million women worldwide will go into menopause annually. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, osteoporotic fractures and Alzheimer's dementia are common chronic disorders after menopause, representing major health problems in most developed countries. Apart from being influenced by environmental factors, these chronic disorders recognize a strong genetic component, and there are now considerable clinic evidences that these disorders are related to low hormonal milieu of postmenopausal women. Here, we review up-to-date available data suggesting that genetic variation may contribute to higher susceptibility to four sporadic chronic syndromes such as osteoporosis (OP), osteoarthritis (OA), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). For these four syndromes candidate genes that today appear as major loci in genetic susceptibility encode for proteins specific of a given system, as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene for the skeleton and, therefore, OP or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) for the cardiovascular system and, therefore, CAD. The investigation of gene polymorphisms in various pathological conditions typical of postmenopause offer an explanation not only of their genetic inheritance but also of their co-segregation in given individuals. In this view, it may be possible to identify a common set of genes whose variants contribute to a common genetic background for these different disorders. Ideal candidates appear genes of the estrogen response cascade [i.e. estrogen receptor (ERs), enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism or co-activators and co-inhibitors]. All together this information may represent the basis both for future recognition of individuals at risk and for the pharmacogenetic driving of drug responsiveness.",

By inhibiting NEP and ACE, vasopeptidase inhibitors enhance the natriuretic peptide and kallikrein-kinin systems and inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

This study compared the cardiorenal and humoral actions of omapatrilat with those of ACE inhibition. The actions of omapatrilat were further defined in the presence and absence of a natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist.

However, the specific effect of omapatrilat on cardiac function and left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertension remains controversial. Therefore, we investigated the effect of omapatrilat on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Studies were performed in SHR that received vehicle (n = 9), omapatrilat (n = 10), or fosinopril (ACE inhibitor, n = 7) by daily gavage for 56 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured by tail plethysmography. Left ventricular fractional shortening and left ventricular mass were measured by echocardiography at day 56. Omapatrilat and fosinopril significantly decreased SBP and MBP from day 1 through day 56, and omapatrilat markedly reduced SBP and MBP compared with fosinopril from day 21 to day 56. Although both omapatrilat and fosinopril decreased left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass-to-body weight ratio with increased LV fractional shortening, omapatrilat had a more potent effect on the reduction of left ventricular mass and improvement of cardiac function. This study shows that in SHR, omapatrilat mediated a potent and stable antihypertensive effect and a reduction in left ventricular mass with improvement of cardiac function, compared with ACE inhibition alone.",

The PUFA intake induced large alterations in heart and kidney phospholipid fatty acid profile, but did not influence body weight, cardiac hypertrophy, renal left atrophy and right hypertrophy. Within 4 weeks, BP raised from 120-180 +/- 2 mm Hg in the control group, but only to 165 +/- 3 mm Hg in the n-3 PUFA groups. After stabilization of BP in the 3 groups, the rats received a short administration of increasing dose of perindopril. The lower dose (0.5 mg/kg) moderately decreased BP only in the control group. With higher doses (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg) BP was normalized in the 3 groups, with a higher amplitude of the BP lowering effect in the control group. A moderate n-3 PUFA intake can contribute to prevent the development of peripheral hypertension in rats by a mechanism that may involve angiotensin converting enzyme.",

Twelve patients with macroalbuminuria (>300 mg albumin/day) and 12 age- and sex-matched patients with normoalbuminuria (<50 mg albumin/day) participated in the study.

Plasma lipid and glycaemic indices were measured at the same times. The combined and grouped data was analysed using paired t tests and correlation and regression analyses. The meal resulted in significant increases in plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. While the meal resulted in a similar increase in basal blood flow rate in both patient groups, post-meal reactive hyperaemic flow increased significantly (p=0.04) in normoalbuminuric patients (mean individual increase: 33%) but remained unchanged in patients with macroalbuminuria (mean individual increase: 4%). The use of antihypertensive agents and insulin was also associated with an attenuated post-prandial hyperaemic response. In summary, our study demonstrated that the degree of renal impairment in patients with Type 2 diabetes may influence vasoactivity following a meal. Patients with evidence of diabetic nephropathy had a decreased post-prandial hyperaemic response, a result that indicated a reduced vasodilator reserve. The mechanism of this reduction in vasodilatation of peripheral vessels during the post-prandial period is probably multifactorial. These changes in vasoactivity have the potential to combine with other cardiovascular risk factors to enhance the development of atheroma.", 
    "579": "The present study evaluated whether hyperinsulinemia is a predictor of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty in 69 patients who underwent elective coronary balloon angioplasty; patients were excluded if they were known diabetics being treated with insulin. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed before and after angioplasty and at follow-up. Restenosis was defined as the presence of > or = 50% stenosis at follow-up. Plasma insulin responses before, 30, 60, and 120 min after 75 g glucose load (OGTT) were measured. Plasma insulin levels were higher in patients with restenosis than in patients without restenosis. Minimal lumen diameter at follow-up was smaller, and percent diameter stenosis at follow-up was higher and late loss was greater in the highest sum of insulin levels during OGTT (sigma insulin) quartile (0.95+/-0.15 vs 1.47+/-0.09 mm, p=0.005; 66.3+/-5.8 vs 40.5+/-3.3%, p=0.0003; 0.90+/-0.15 vs 0.49+/-0.08 mm, p=0.02). Even after adjustment for coronary risk factors and administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, the association of hyperinsulinemia with restenosis leads to the conclusion that hyperinsulinemia is a strong risk factor for restenosis.", 
    "580": "Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events. Indeed, people with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to die from cardiovascular causes than individuals without diabetes. Despite evidence to suggest that the burden of cardiovascular disease may be decreasing in Western populations, this trend has not been repeated in diabetic populations. Diabetes is also the most common cause of new-onset end-stage renal disease, blindness and amputations. The growing incidence of diabetes throughout the world, particularly in developing nations, suggests that diabetes-related cardiovascular disease and other chronic cardiovascular diseases will constitute a serious global threat to health and well-being. The HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study was designed to determine if the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, prevents cardiovascular events in high risk patients. As people with diabetes have a high risk of such events, this group was specified for inclusion and analysis in the HOPE study. The HOPE study was designed to include up to 4,000 people with diabetes and was designed with high power to detect an 18% risk reduction in the diabetic sub group alone. A total of 3,577 individuals with diabetes were randomised to receive either 10 mg of ramipril or placebo. After a period of 4.5 years of follow-up, the group of patients receiving ramipril had a statistically and clinically significant risk reduction of 25% in the primary outcome of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cardiovascular (CV) death. This comprises a 37% risk reduction in CV death, a 22% risk reduction in MI, a 33% reduction in stroke and a 24% reduction in all-cause mortality. The MICRO-HOPE (Microalbuminuria, Cardiovascular, and Renal Outcomes) sub study assessed the effect of ramipril on diabetic nephropathy. This was detected by a centrally measured urine albumin:creatinine ratio and confirmed by timed urine collection. Ramipril significantly reduced the risk of overt nephropathy by 22% (P = 0.045), and overt nephropathy, laser therapy or dialysis by 15% (P = 0.05). ACE inhibition with ramipril represents a new macrovascular and microvascular preventive therapy for people with diabetes.", 
    "581": "Endothelial cells are strategically located between the circulating blood and the vascular smooth muscle. These cells are involved in regulating the functions of vascular smooth muscle and circulating blood cells by releasing numerous vasoactive substances. Important endothelium-delivered vasodilators include prostacyclin, bradykinin, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor. Nitric oxide is also important in inhibiting cellular growth and migration, and acts in concert with prostacyclin to exert potent antiatherogenic and thromboresistant effects by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. These effects are counterbalanced by vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, which exert prothrombotic inflammatory and growth-promoting properties. Cardiovascular risk factors give rise to cardiovascular disease by causing endothelial dysfunction. Consequently, modern therapeutic strategies focus on preserving or restoring endothelial integrity. Calcium antagonists counteract the effects of angiotensin II and endothelin-1 at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing Ca2+ inflow and facilitating the vasodilator effects of nitric oxide. In addition to their role in inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors raise the activity of bradykinin, thereby leading to an increase in nitric oxide release. In patients with cardiovascular risk, chronic ACE inhibition improves endothelial function. This may explain why patients treated with ACE inhibitors experience a greater cardiovascular benefit than is attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. Recently developed neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, particularly in combination with ACE inhibitors, induce potent antihypertensive effects. These effects are due partly to decreased breakdown of natriuretic peptides but also as a result of the inhibition of endothelin-1 production. Experimental studies suggest that endothelin-1 antagonists are effective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensives, and also exert beneficial clinical and haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure. Further clinical studies are under way to determine whether restoration of endothelial function has clinical benefits for patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "582": "Over a 4.5 year follow-up period, the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial, and the MICRO-HOPE (Microalbuminuria, Cardiovascular, and Renal Outcomes) and SECURE (Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound changes in patients treated with Ramipril and vitamin E) substudies have all demonstrated a large benefit of ramipril versus placebo in patients over 55 years at high risk (by reason of a prior vascular event), or by being diabetic subjects with one additional risk factor. The baseline blood pressure on average was normal, at 139/79 mmHg, and was modestly reduced by 3.3/1.4 mmHg. Patients with known left ventricular dysfunction were excluded, as were those with uncontrolled hypertension. The incidence of stroke was reduced by 32%, myocardial infarction by 20% and cardiovascular death by 25%. The benefits conferred were in addition to, and largely independent of, other conventional treatments such as aspirin, lipid-lowering agents, beta-blockers, diuretics and calcium channel blockers. The relative risk reduction was very similar whether or not the patient was a known hypertensive at baseline. High dose ACE inhibition with ramipril is applicable to a far wider population of patients at high risk of cardiovascular events than the current indications of hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "583": "The HOPE (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation) study has demonstrated a clear and beneficial effect of ramipril on cardiovascular events and disease progression. The cost-effectiveness of treatment with ramipril remains an important question that is being addressed by analysis of data from the main HOPE study and from a Swedish substudy. Data from the main HOPE study indicate that hospital costs per patient were reduced in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group. The net effect indicates that ramipril is cost neutral or could even be cost saving in US non-Medicare patients. In the Swedish health economic substudy, a separate protocol and separate case record forms were utilised to generate more specific data from the 537 Swedish patients taking part in HOPE. In this analysis, costs and effects associated with each treatment group were assessed and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. The primary analysis was cost per life year gained which amounted to 29,000 Swedish Kroner. In a world with a growing prevalence of cardiovascular disease and with additional constraints on healthcare expenditure, analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive and curative medications is increasingly important. In this context, the early observations on the cost-effectiveness of ramipril appear very hopeful.", 
    "584": "Experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system and oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein cholesterol both play important roles in atherosclerosis. A substudy of the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial, the SECURE trial (Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound changes in patients treated with Ramipril and vitamin E), evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, and with vitamin E on atherosclerosis progression in high risk patients. A total of 732 patients were enrolled into the study. These patients were 55 years or older, had vascular disease or diabetes with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, but did not have heart failure or low ejection fraction. Patients were randomly assigned according to a three-by-two factorial design to receive placebo, ramipril 2.5 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day and placebo or vitamin E 400 IU/day. Progression of atherosclerosis was evaluated by B-mode carotid ultrasonography. The primary outcome evaluated was the annualised progression slope of the mean maximum carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT) across 12 pre-selected carotid arterial segments. The average follow-up was 4.5 years. The progression slope of the mean maximum IMT was 0.0217 +/- 0.04 mm/year in the placebo group, 0.018 +/- 0.44 mm/year in the ramipril 2.5 mg/day group and 0.0137 +/- 0.04 in the ramipril 10 mg/day group (P = 0.33 for the overall effect of ramipril and P = 0.028 for the comparison between patients receiving ramipril placebo and ramipril 10 mg/day). The reduction in atherosclerotic progression observed with ramipril remained significant after adjusting for systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes (P = 0.043) and after multivariate adjustment (P = 0.046). Administration of vitamin E 400 IU/day had no impact on atherosclerosis progression. The SECURE study is the first demonstration, in human subjects, of an effect of ACE inhibition on atherosclerotic progression. This benefit cannot be explained by the lowering of blood pressure alone. Vitamin E 400 IU/day had a neutral effect on the ultrasound measurements of atherosclerosis progression in the SECURE trial.", 
    "585": "To whatever extent the improvement in symptoms and survival rendered by treatment with ACE inhibitors is attributable to their effects on the circulation and the kidneys, this benefit can be rescinded by concomitant administration of aspirin. Although some useful prostaglandin-independent actions may persist, shutting down the entire prostaglandin system and trading off a substantial portion of the potential risk reduction with forfeit of salutary hemodynamic and renal effects is a high price to pay just to suppress production of TXA2. In patients requiring treatment for heart failure, if possible, aspirin should be avoided and the integrity of prostaglandin metabolism respected; the severer the heart failure the more compelling. There are other ways to inhibit platelet aggregation, some equally effective or even better than aspirin. Orally active platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, which may be more efficient than aspirin, have been developed and are now in clinical testing. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, although more expensive than aspirin, are as easy to use and at least as effective as aspirin. Finally, because patients with severer heart failure are likely to be those with very low ejection fractions, these patients are good candidates for oral anticoagulation even though this treatment requires additional monitoring.", 
    "586": "In the management of chronic heart failure, polypharmacy is common, necessary, and often overlooked. The increasing costs of care, noncompliance, and frequent adverse drug interactions have led to diminishing benefits by simply adding additional drugs to the already complex regimen. This review outlines a rational pharmacotherapeutic protocol based on establishing overall therapeutic goals and confirming treatment targets, tailoring therapy to individual patients by balancing beneficial and adverse drug effects, and paying particular attention to patient education and other nonpharmacologic support.",

VTP for 5 weeks induced CHF, local atrial conduction slowing, and interstitial fibrosis and prolonged atrial burst pacing-induced AF. Atrial angiotensin II concentrations and MAPK expression were increased by tachypacing, with substantial changes in phosphorylated forms of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38-kinase. Enalapril significantly reduced tachypacing-induced changes in atrial angiotensin II concentrations and ERK expression. Enalapril also attenuated the effects of CHF on atrial conduction (conduction heterogeneity index reduced from 3.1+/-0.4 to 1.9+/-0.2 ms/mm, P<0.05), atrial fibrosis (from 11.9+/-1.1% to 7.5+/-0.4%, P<0.01), and mean AF duration (from 651+/-164 to 218+/-75 seconds, P<0.05). Vasodilator therapy of a separate group of VTP dogs with hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate did not alter CHF-induced fibrosis or AF promotion.",

    "590": "Angiotensin II activates 2 distinct G protein-coupled receptors, the AT(1) and AT(2) receptors. Most of the known cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II are mediated by the AT(1) receptor subtype. The aim of the present study was to test whether deletion of the AT(2) receptor gene in mice (AT(2)-KO mice) leads to long-term functional or structural alterations in the cardiovascular system.", 
    "591": "In vivo pressure responses to angiotensin II or the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine were greatly enhanced in AT(2)-KO mice. Deletion of the angiotensin AT(2) receptor did not lead to a compensatory increase of the activity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, and arterial blood pressure was identical in wild-type control mice (WT) and AT(2)-KO mice. Cardiac contractility as assessed by LV catheterization and by rapid MRI also did not differ between AT(2)-KO and WT mice. Isolated femoral arteries from AT(2)-KO mice, however, showed enhanced vasoconstriction to angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and K(+) depolarization compared with WT. Morphometric analysis of large and small femoral arteries revealed a significant hypertrophy of media smooth muscle cells. Phospho-P70S6 kinase levels were significantly increased in aortas from AT(2)-KO mice compared with WT mice. Treatment of mice with an ACE inhibitor for 8 weeks abolished the increased pressure responsiveness, vascular hypertrophy, and enhanced P70S6 kinase phosphorylation in AT(2)-KO mice.",

    "593": "Specific blockers of the angiotensin type1 receptor, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been introduced as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) for the treatment of heart failure. In comparison with ACEi, ARBs are better tolerated and have similar effects on haemodynamics, neurohormones and exercise capacity. Early studies have suggested that ARBs might have a superior effect on mortality. However, the first outcome trial, ELITE II (Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study), did not show any significant difference between losartan and captopril in terms of mortality or morbidity. This commentary outlines the role of ARBs in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "594": "The results of recent randomized trials to test the influence of antioxidants on coronary-event rates and prognosis in patients with coronary-artery disease were disappointing. In none of these studies did the use of vitamin E improve prognosis. In contrast, treatment of coronary-artery disease with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced coronary-event rates and improved prognosis. ACE inhibition prevents the formation of angiotensin II, which has been shown to be a potent stimulus of superoxide-producing enzymes in atherosclerosis. The findings suggest that inhibition of superoxide production at enzymatic levels, rather than symptomatic superoxide scavenging, may be the better choice of treatment.", 
    "595": "The publication of the results of the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 (STOP-2) and the termination of the doxazocin arm of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT) study again raise the question of whether all antihypertensives deliver equal cardiovascular outcome benefits. Data from research on congestive heart failure and from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial illuminate the roles and possible mechanisms of humoral mediators of vascular damage, suggesting, first, that some antihypertensives (thiazides, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) can deliver more improvement in outcomes than other agents and, second, that decisions on whom to treat are best made based on risk appraisal, not merely pressures.", 
    "596": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is associated with unsatisfactory outcomes in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure, in that activation of this system is correlated strongly with both the incidence and extent of end-organ damage. Despite the availability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the AT1 receptor antagonists, unblocked aldosterone levels remain an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease progression. New preclinical data generated over the past few years strongly support the hypothesis that aldosterone has important deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system independent of the classical action of this hormone on renal epithelial cells. The new selective aldosterone receptor antagonist eplerenone has been shown to produce significant cardioprotective effects in experimental models of cardiovascular disease. Early clinical testing suggests that eplerenone may have important therapeutic benefit in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "597": "Diabetes and hypertension are major contributors to the increasing incidence of progressive renal disease. In addition to more potent antihypertensive agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, drugs that modulate other pathogenetic pathways are also in development. Recent preclinical studies indicate that compounds that interfere with the formation and action of advanced glycation end products may have a role in the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy, as may agents targeting the activity of protein kinase C.",

New data regarding the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors now exist and low molecular weight heparins are used more frequently with greater efficacy than unfractionated heparin. New thrombin inhibitors are also receiving a fresh look. An expert panel has recently published guidelines for the treatment of unstable angina.", 
    "599": "Electrolyte disturbances are common in patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) especially during long-term treatments. Unlike potassium, little is known of how magnesium is affected in these patients. This study was carried out to determine the serum and urinary concentration of magnesium in patients with CHF who were treated with lisinopril [Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI)], frusemide (diuretic) and digoxin, at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. 45 patients (Group I; 24 male, 21 female; average age 49.7 years) with CHF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III were matched with 45 healthy controls (Group II; 24 male, 21 female, average age 49.3 years). Serum and urinary magnesium were assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis was made by Student's t-test. At baseline, serum magnesium concentration in CHF patients was not significantly lower than in controls, p > 0.1. However, a higher loss of magnesium in urine was found in CHF patients compared with control subjects at baseline, p < 0.01. Serum magnesium concentration decreased significantly during treatment except in CHF patients on lisinopril, p < 0.05. The lowest excretion of magnesium was also found in this group of patients. Our study shows that lisinopril is magnesium-sparing in patients with CHF.", 
    "600": "Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is associated with biochemical evidence of electrolyte imbalance including magnesium deficit, which may increase myocardial electrical instability, risk of malignant arrhythmias and sudden death. The aim of this study was to determine serum magnesium concentration in 45 patients (Group I; 24 male, 21 female; the average age 49.7 years) with CHF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III who were treated with lisinopril [Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI)], frusemide (diuretic) and digoxin. All patients were subjected to resting 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and ventricular arrhythmias were analysed in relation to serum magnesium concentration at baseline and at end of the fourth week of treatment. Control group (Group II; 24 male, 21 female; the average age 49.3 years) were matched with Group I. Serum magnesium was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Statistical analysis was with Student's t-test. It was observed that 6 (13.3%) CHF patients had ventricular arrhythmias at the commencement of the study. This number increased to 17 (37.8%) by the end of the fourth week of treatment. At four weeks, there was significant difference in serum magnesium between CHF patients without arrhythmias (0.69 +/- 0.11 mmol x L(-1)) and those with arrhythmias (0.50 +/- 0.01 mmol x L(-1)), P < 0.0001. Results obtained suggest that CHF patients having hypomagnesemia had higher prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. It should be stressed, however, that 24 hour ECG monitoring and classification of ventricular arrhythmias according to Lown may give a more accurate picture. Nevertheless, routine serum magnesium assays, as part of the electrolyte profile of CHF patients would assist in early prevention and detection of magnesium depletion. This would go a long way to reduce the susceptibility to lethal arrhythmias and sudden death.", 
    "601": "Growth hormone (GH) has been attracted as a possible adjunctive treatment for severe heart failure. However, its treatment effects have been still controversial. To assess severity of basal cardiac disease states in which GH might be effective, we analyzed the relation of treatment effects of GH following chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on cardiac function and structures to infarct size in rat model of chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction. One day after coronary occlusion, rats were randomized to either an ACE inhibitor, temocapril (T) (80 mg/L in drinking water) or placebo for 12 weeks. The animals received concomitant recombinant human (rh) GH (2 mg/kg/day, SC) (T + GH) or vehicle during the final 2 weeks. Compared with the T group, the T + GH group with large MI had smaller increments of left ventricular (LV) dP/dt(max) (0 vs 17%) and cardiac output (9 vs 49%), less improvement of LV relaxation (tau) (-3 vs 29%) and systemic vascular resistance (8 vs 29%), and a greater increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (123 vs -5%) than did the T+GH group with moderate MI. In the T + GH group when compared with the T group, these functional alterations were associated with a 12% reduction in the LV capillary density and a 21% increase in hydroxyproline contents in rats with large MI, whereas a 12% increase in the density and similar collagen contents were found in rats with moderate MI. Thus, prominent beneficial cardiovascular effects of the additive short-term, high-dose GH to chronic high-dose ACE inhibition were obtained in rats with moderate MI, whereas little additional benefit or even detrimental effects of GH were found in rats with large MI. The present study may provide an insight into the therapeutic strategy of GH given late after MI in the presence of chronic ACE inhibition in congestive heart failure.", 
    "602": "Essential hypertension is a polygenic disease involving a major contribution of various environmental factors. It is therefore not surprising that antihypertensive medications, whatever their mechanism(s) of action, only normalize the blood pressure for a fraction of hypertensive patients when administered as monotherapies. It is unfortunately not possible to predict with any degree of certainty which type of blood pressure-lowering agent is the most appropriate for a given patient. Although very attractive, genetic mapping is not really helpful in selecting a treatment for any individual patient. In most patients the association of two medications having different impacts on the cardiovascular system is necessary to normalize blood pressure. Fixed-low-dose combinations are becoming increasingly popular as first line treatment as they increase the probability of bringing the patient's blood pressure under control while minimizing the incidence of dose-dependent adverse effects.", 
    "603": "Most patients with hypertension will need, at some stage, more than one drug to lower their blood pressure. Although monotherapy is still the preferred option for first-line treatment of hypertension, low-dose combination therapy as the initial medication has been increasingly recommended by National and International Guidelines. The use of perindopril/indapamide is an example of such a combination which contains 2 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and 0.625 mg of the diuretic indapamide, these doses being respectively half and a quarter of the usual doses in monotherapy. This combination appears to lower blood pressure effectively with a good safety profile. It can be used in the elderly and also in patients with reduced renal function. Studies are underway to assess its efficacy on target organ damage.", 
    "604": "Despite dramatic improvements in the management of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, much remains to be accomplished. Arterial stiffness, through its effects on central aortic pressure, is a key determinant of increased cardiovascular risk. Increased pulse pressure is a late manifestation of increased arterial stiffness. What is needed is a simple, reliable, non-invasive method of detecting early disturbances in central artery stiffness at a time when therapeutic intervention can be most beneficial. Currently, intervention studies support initiating antihypertensive therapy in uncomplicated hypertension when systolic blood pressure > or = 160 mmHg, whereas the benefit of treating systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg, the largest subset of persons with hypertension, has yet to be tested in controlled trials. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal target goal for blood pressure reduction in both uncomplicated hypertension and in hypertension complicated by diabetes, coronary heart disease, or renal disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may provide selective cardiac and renal protection beyond their blood pressure-lowering effect in the presence of specific cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. In contrast, there is as yet no definitive answer as to the relative benefit of blood pressure lowering versus specific drug effects in minimizing cardiovascular events in uncomplicated hypertension. Although there has been a recent increase in hypertension awareness and treatment, only a small percentage of affected individuals are being treated to goal. Hypertensive cardiovascular disease represents a world-wide public health challenge that can be solved only by new innovative measures aimed at both prevention and treatment.", 
    "605": "More than 50% of patients with mild uncomplicated hypertension will need combination therapy to reach target blood pressure, as defined by the Joint National Committee. This percentage is even higher in hypertensive patients with diabetes, renal impairment and congestive heart failure in whom target blood pressures are lower. Combination therapy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and low dose diuretic offers distinct advantages in the treatment of essential hypertension. The two drug classes may have a synergistic effect on hypertensive target organ disease and blood pressure. Triple therapy with a calcium antagonist may be needed to achieve blood pressure control in more severely hypertensive patients.", 
    "606": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disorder characterized by the loss of alveolar architecture through epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation. Recent studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is increased in fibrotic tissues, and ACE inhibitors administered in vivo ameliorate fibrosis, suggesting that ACE may play a critical role. However, the regulation of ACE expression is not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that bleomycin, a chemotherapeutic agent which induces pulmonary fibrosis in animals and humans, increases gene expression of ACE. Treatment of primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells with 0.1 to 1.0 microg/ml bleomycin increased ACE enzymatic activity and ACE mRNA, as monitored by hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine assay and competitive quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Luciferase reporter constructs showed that upregulation of ACE transcription by bleomycin is mediated through element(s) in the 97-bp ACE promoter. Bleomycin activated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and induced nuclear translocation and activation of the early growth response (Egr)-1 transcription factor, a factor previously shown to positively regulate ACE expression. The MAPK kinase1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126 blocked MAPK and Egr-1 activation by bleomycin, suggesting that Egr-1 activation is MAPK dependent. These data provide the first evidence that bleomycin activates ACE gene expression through the MAPK pathway and Egr-1.", 
    "607": "The pharmacological profile of a vasopeptidase inhibitor is dependent on the ratio of neutral endopeptidase (NEP)vs angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition of the particular drug. We used in vitro autoradiography to determine the local renal and cardiac NEP and ACE inhibition after oral treatment with the dual NEP/ACE inhibitor omapatrilat in rat. Maximal inhibition of both renal NEP and ACE was achieved at the omapatrilat dose of 40 mg kg(-1)day(-1). Effective local ACE inhibition was detected also in the myocardium. The haemodynamic effects were similar to captopril, but omapatrilat treatment produced more favorable effect on natriuretic peptide levels. In conclusion, good tissue penetration of omapatrilat and balanced NEP/ACE inhibition may prove to be useful in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.",

    "609": "In 47 PMI patients recently submitted to cardiological assessment and in 42 controls (50-70 years old men), traditional risk factors (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure, cigarette smoking and body mass index) and the following variables were measured: fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], total homocysteine, plasma folates, vitamin B12, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and C3 complement. Most patients were taking beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins. Accordingly, patients had lower blood pressure and cholesterol values than controls. Moreover, they consumed less alcohol and coffee and did not differ from controls in cigarette smoking and body mass index. Conversely, patients had higher levels of homocysteine, fibrinogen, C3 complement and Lp(a), although of these factors only C3 and homocysteine remained significantly associated with PMI in multivariate analysis. C-reactive protein, PAI-1 and especially C3 often correlated with traditional risk factors in controls, but these correlations tended to disappear or reverse in PMI patients. Fibrinogen inversely correlated with alcohol consumption. Homocysteine correlated (inversely) with plasma folates only. Lp(a) did not correlate with any variable.",

    "612": "Heart rate variability was assessed in a resting condition by power spectrum analysis to evaluate the low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power and LF/HF ratio in 19 hypertensive patients and 23 normotensive controls. Moreover, the coherence between the tachogram and the systogram was evaluated, and the baroreflex gain (alphaLF-index), describing the transfer function of variability in the systolic pressure signal to variability in the RR interval, was obtained. Then a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed. The 19 hypertensive patients were randomized to either enalapril or losartan treatment, and after 2 months were re-submitted to the RR variability and baroreflex study and to blood pressure monitoring. The subjects then crossed to the other antihypertensive treatment and were re-evaluated after an additional two months. No significant difference was found either in LF power and HF power and LF/HF ratio between normotensive and hypertensive subjects whereas a slight though significant difference was observed in the alphaLF-index. In hypertensive patients, both the treatments with enalapril and losartan reduced blood pressure and had no effect on heart rate. No significant change was observed in autonomic balance or in baroreflex sensitivity during the two antihypertensive treatments.", 
    "613": "In hypertensive patients, the angiotensin system or bradykinins do not seem to have any modulatory effect on the sympathetic/parasympathetic control of blood pressure and baroreflex sensitivity, in a resting condition. Since heart rates were unchanged by the two antihypertensive treatments despite a significant reduction of blood pressure, a resetting of baroreflex function was observed during both ACE-inhibition and angiotensin II ATI receptor blockade.", 
    "614": "Recent advances in the understanding of vascular disease genesis suggest that atherosclerosis and hypertension, primary targets of therapy in the INternational VErapamil SR/trandolapril STudy (INVEST), are closely related. A unified model for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is emerging from recent advances related to atherosclerosis and hypertension. The process of vascular disease appears to begin early in life, when signs of endothelial dysfunction first appear. A primary cause of CVD progression is increased oxidative stress in the endothelium caused by multiple risk factor conditions, including heredity, dyslipidemia, smoking, diabetes, and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP > 110 mmHg). The renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems are important regulators of blood pressure and atherosclerosis. In the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mediates generation of angiotensin II (ang II) at local vascular sites and in the plasma and also degrades bradykinin. Information derived from INVEST will help to identify treatment strategies, such as those containing a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor, that are targeted directly at the vascular disorder responsible for hypertension and atherosclerosis.", 
    "615": "This study was conducted to examine the effects of single dose enalapril (1.6 mg/kg) on platelet aggregation alone and after an intravenous bolus dose of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 40 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2 and 6 h after the administration of drugs in rhesus monkeys. Enalapril was administered via a nasogastric tube while L-NNA was administered by the intravenous route. Platelet aggregation was stimulated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in platelet rich plasma (PRP). Enalapril significantly inhibited platelet aggregation with a peak effect at 6 h. Upon administration of L-NNA, there was a significant increase in the percentage of platelet aggregation. This effect was partially antagonized by enalapril. The present study demonstrates that enalapril may possess antiaggregatory effects, which may be mediated via nitric oxide mechanisms.", 
    "616": "According to contemporary views, the endothelium is not only a barrier separating blood from surrounding tissues, but a dynamic, heterogeneous organ, which possesses many secretory, metabolic and immunologic functions. Endothelial cells produce mediators, which regulate blood flow, influence platelet adhesion and aggregation, coagulation and fibrinolysis and also immunological response. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as an imbalance between vascular relaxing and contracting factors, between procoagulant and anticoagulant mediators or growth-inhibiting and growth-promoting substances. The definition is often confined to dysfunction of the vessel wall tonus control. The endothelial dysfunction frequently proceeds structural changes in vessels, as e.g. atherosclerotic plaque formation, neointima formation and vessel wall remodelling. This dysfunction has been confirmed in systemic hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac syndrome X, heart failure, using various invasive and non-invasive techniques. There are pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods to modify endothelial functions. It is obligatory to reduce risk factors of atherosclerosis, which lead to endothelial cell damage, i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, estrogen deficiency and elevated levels of homocysteine. The role of physical exercise, low-cholesterol diet, discontinuation of smoking is emphasised. Among drugs statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and hormone replacement therapy are considered particularly beneficial. The importance of angiotensin receptor antagonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, L-arginine, growth factors and calcium-channel blockers for the improvement of endothelial function is studied.",

An oedema of the face and throat represents a life-threatening situation. Apart from the clinical condition of the patient and detailed knowledge of the medical history (incl. medical applications), the treatment should depend on the different pathogenesis. In this reported case, we describe the severe clinical development of an angio-oedema under a long-term treatment with an ACE-inhibitor, which in the end was only successfully treated with the application of a C1 inhibitor concentrate.", 
    "618": "1. Transient and sustained calcium-independent outward K(+) currents (I(t) and I(SS)) as well as action potentials were recorded in cardiac ventricular myocytes isolated from two models of diabetes mellitus. 2. Rats injected (I.V.) with streptozotocin (STZ, 100 mg kg(-1)) 6-10 days before cell isolation developed insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes. I(t) and I(SS) were attenuated and the action potential prolonged. Incubation of myocytes (6-9 h) with the angiotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers saralasin or valsartan (1 microM) significantly augmented these currents. Inclusion of valsartan (1 g l(-1)) in the drinking water for 5-10 days prior to and following STZ injection partially prevented current attenuation. 3. Incubation of myocytes from STZ-treated rats (6-9 h) with 1 microM quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, significantly augmented I(t) and I(SS) and shortened the ventricular action potential. I(t) augmentation was not due to changes in steady-state inactivation or in recovery from inactivation. No acute effects of quinapril were observed. 4. The effects of quinapril and valsartan were abolished by 2 microM cycloheximide. 5. Myocytes were isolated from the db/db mouse, a leptin receptor mutant that develops symptoms of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes. K+ currents in these cells were also attenuated, and the action potentials prolonged. Incubation of these cells (> 6 h) with valsartan (1 microM) significantly enhanced the transient and sustained outward currents. 6. These results confirm recent suggestions that cardiac myocytes contain a renin-angiotensin system, which is activated in diabetes. It is proposed that chronic release of ATII leads to changes in ionic currents and action potentials, which can be reversed by blocking the formation or action of ATII. This may underlie the proven benefits of ATII receptor blockade or ACE inhibition in diabetes, by providing protection against cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "619": "Cardiac extracellular matrix undergoes extensive and continuous turnover involved in the lesion-reparation process, such as in cardiac remodeling, in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, in dilated cardiomyopathy, after myocardial infarction in the transition to heart failure, and during the progression of left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis is a major determinant of diastolic dysfunction and pumping capacity, and it may provide the structural substrate for arrhythmogenicity, thus potentially contributing the to progression of heart failure and sudden death. Aldosterone was shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in various experimental models. It was demonstrated that spironolactone may oppose the effect of aldosterone in promoting cardiac fibrosis. Measurement of cardiac collagen turnover by use of serological markers is a useful tool for monitoring cardiac tissue repair and fibrosis in experimental models or clinical conditions. We found that high serum levels of a marker of collagen turnover (procollagen type III N-terminal peptide ) in patients with chronic heart failure receiving conventional therapy, including ACE inhibitors, was associated with high mortality and hospitalization rates. In RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), in patients randomized to placebo, markers continued to increase or remained unchanged after 6-month follow-up. On the contrary, adding spironolactone 25 mg daily significantly decreased the levels of these serum markers during the same period. Most importantly, the spironolactone-related morbidity and mortality benefit was most predominant in subgroups with highest baseline levels of serum markers. These results suggest that limitation of the aldosterone-related excessive extracellular matrix turnover may be one of the various extrarenal mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effect of spironolactone in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "620": "Oxidative stress is involved in both the pathogenesis and complications of diabetes. ACE inhibitors can slow the progression of cardiac and renal impairments related to diabetes. The effect of enalapril treatment on oxidative stress and tissue injury was studied in hearts, kidneys, and livers from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Twenty-four rats were divided into the following groups: streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, single intraperitoneal dose), streptozotocin+enalapril (20 mg enalapril/L drinking water), and control (intraperitoneal saline). Seven months after streptozotocin injection, organs were studied by light microscopy and collagen III immunolabeling. Tissue lesions and collagen labeling were graded by a semiquantitative score (0 to 4). Total glutathione content, glutathione redox status (reduced/oxidized glutathione), antioxidant enzyme activities, protein-associated sulfhydryls, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and fluorescent chromolipids were determined in tissue homogenates. Glycemia was higher in both the streptozotocin and streptozotocin+enalapril groups relative to the control group. In the streptozotocin group, creatinine clearance and body weight were lower, and systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were higher than in the streptozotocin+enalapril and control groups. Heart, kidney, and liver lesion/labeling scores were significantly higher in the streptozotocin group compared with the streptozotocin+enalapril and control groups. Kidney and liver total glutathione was lower in the streptozotocin group relative to the control group (P<0.05). Enalapril treatment significantly attenuated the reduction of total glutathione. In the heart, kidney, and liver, both glutathione and proteins were relatively more oxidized in the streptozotocin group relative to the control group (P<0.05). Protein and glutathione oxidation were attenuated in the streptozotocin+enalapril group in the 3 tissues studied (P<0.05). Enalapril treatment attenuated the oxidation of lipids in the heart and kidney (P<0.05). Tissue fibrosis scores were inversely correlated with (1) both total glutathione and reduced/oxidized glutathione in heart, kidney, and liver and (2) glutathione reductase activity in the kidney. These results suggest that in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the protective action of enalapril might be mediated, at least in part, by its effect on tissue oxidant/antioxidant status.",

It has been shown that the mammalian corpus cavernosum produces and secretes physiologically relevant amounts of the vasoconstrictive peptide Ang II and that intracavernosal injection of Ang II terminates penile erection in the dog. Thus, we speculated whether a dysregulation in the secretion or degradation of Ang II might contribute to the manifestation of ED.", 
    "622": "Thirty-four healthy adult men and 48 patients with ED of either organogenic or psychogenic etiology were exposed to visual and tactile erotic stimuli to elicit penile tumescence and, in the group of healthy subjects, rigidity. Whole blood was simultaneously aspirated from the corpus cavernosum and the cubital vein during the different functional conditions of the penis. Ang II plasma levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay.", 
    "623": "In healthy men, the Ang II levels in the cavernous plasma increased from 22.1 +/- 7.1 pg/mL in the phase of penile rigidity to 27.9 +/- 10 pg/mL in the detumescence phase. In the peripheral plasma, the Ang II levels were 17.2 +/- 6.2 to 19.5 +/- 6.5 pg/mL over the respective penile stages. The courses of Ang II registered in the patients were similar to those detected in the healthy men. In the patients and healthy men, systemic Ang II levels were found to be lower than the concentrations detected in the cavernous blood. In the group of organogenic patients, the Ang II levels during penile flaccidity in the systemic and cavernous blood were higher than those registered in the blood samples taken from the healthy men.", 
    "624": "Our results suggest that cavernous smooth muscle tone is, in part, balanced by Ang II-induced contraction and that Ang II might be involved in the initiation of penile detumescence in men. That Ang II plasma levels are generally elevated in the systemic and cavernous blood of patients with an organogenic etiology of ED may hint at the significance of Ang II in the pathophysiology of ED. Since the tissue and plasma levels of Ang II are regulated by the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, there might be a rationale for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of vasculogenic ED.", 
    "625": "This review evaluates the current position of calcium channel blockers (CCB) in antihypertensive treatment in the light of three major comparative studies and two extensive meta-analyses. The latter both show that CCB are equivalent to conventional (initial beta-blocker or diuretic therapy) when total and cardiovascular mortality are the end points. Divergent points between the meta-analyses include stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). One meta-analysis compared CCB with conventional therapy, to find a small 13% reduction in stroke and a small, nonsignificant 12% increase in MI. The other meta-analysis found a 26% increase in MI when CCB were compared with all other therapies including the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This increase was most robust (P < .001) when comparing CCB with ACE inhibitors, consonant with proposed protective effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular risk. At present, only the comparison of CCB with conventional therapy, and not that with ACE inhibitors, rests on secure comparative data. When cost is compelling, conventional therapy is less expensive. For the individual patient, issues of quality of life (for example, impotence with diuretics and beta-blockers) might be decisive. Nonetheless, beta-blockers are preferred in postinfarct patients or in those with heart failure or unstable angina (a contraindication to dihydropyridines in the absence of beta-blockade). In others, the benefits of only a borderline stroke reduction with CCB versus an equally borderline increase in MI should be evaluated for each individual patient, taking into account the age group and the patient's preferences. In conclusion, overall CCB are neither better nor worse than conventional therapy, allowing for possible small differences in stroke and MI. The ACE inhibitors may protect better, although data are incomplete.", 
    "626": "Left ventricular remodeling in hypertension is associated with cardiac interstitial and perivascular collagen deposition. The dual angiotensin I converting enzyme/neutral endopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (also called vasopeptidase inhibitor) improves left ventricular remodeling in experimental heart failure. We hypothesized that omapatrilat would induce regression of cardiac and vascular fibrosis in hypertension. We, therefore, investigated the effect of omapatrilat on collagen deposition in heart and aorta of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Twenty-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, untreated SHRSP, and SHRSP treated with omapatrilat (40 mg/kg per day, orally) for 10 weeks were investigated. Collagen in the heart and the descending thoracic aorta was stained with Sirius red. After 10 weeks, systolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly (P < .01) reduced in omapatrilat-treated versus untreated SHRSP. Interstitial collagen density was significantly decreased in the subendocardial myocardium (to 2.71 +/- 0.24% v 4.12 +/- 0.30%, respectively, P < .05) and in the midmyocardium of omapatrilat-treated versus untreated SHRSP (to 3.01 +/- 0.25 v 4.19 +/- 0.17% respectively, P < .05). Perivascular collagen was significantly (P < .05) decreased in the subepicardial, mid-myocardial and, subendocardial regions of the myocardium of omapatrilat-treated versus untreated SHRSP. Aortic collagen content decreased in omapatrilat-treated versus untreated SHRSP (to 36.1 +/- 2.8 v 58.8 +/- 6.1 x 10(3) microm2/mm section, respectively, P < .05). In conclusion, in addition to being a potent antihypertensive agent, omapatrilat significantly improves cardiac and vascular fibrosis in SHRSP.", 
    "627": "Intrathecal cytisine, a nicotinic receptor agonist, elicits greater dose-dependent increases in blood pressure, heart rate and nociceptive responses in SHR than normotensive rat strains. Similar to adult rats, cardiovascular and nociceptive responses were augmented in prehypertensive SHR than age-matched WKY. While hydralazine or captopril pretreatment significantly lowered blood pressure in both SHR and WKY rats, responses to i.t. cytisine were still greater in SHR. By contrast, i.t. cytisine elicited responses were not exaggerated in DOCA-salt hypertensive WKY rats. Pressor and irritation responses to i.t. cytisine can be divided into a transient, initial and persisting, late phases. Both are augmented in SHR. In F1 rats, only the late phase pressor and pain responses to i.t. cytisine are similar in magnitude to those observed in SHR suggesting a possible dominant trait in the SHR. Overall, our findings suggest that hyper-responsiveness in nociception and pressor activity to spinal cytisine in SHR may be pathogenetically associated, but not a consequence, of hypertension.", 
    "628": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produce a number of beneficial effects in a condition where diabetes - mellitus and hypertension co-exist. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of chronic treatment with losartan (2mg/kg, p.o.) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced (45mg/kg, single dose, tail vein) diabetic nephropathy in rats. Treatment of rats with STZ produced a significant loss of body weight, polyuria. polydipsia, hypoinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and increase in blood pressure. There was a significant increase in blood glucose levels in STZ-diabetic rats. Serum cholesterol, creatinine, urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were found to be increased significantly in the STZ group diabetic rats. Treatment with losartan significantly prevented the raise in cholesterol, creatinine, urea and blood urea nitrogen levels. Creatinine clearance was significantly less in STZ-diabetic rats as compared to control animals and treatment with losartan significantly increased creatinine clearence. Our data suggest a beneficial effect of losartan in STZ-induced nephropathy in rats.", 
    "629": "Many therapeutic options are proposed for the treatment of diastolic heart failure although no consensus has been established. In experimental trials, several drugs have demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect on ventricular diastolic dysfunction and could be used for diastolic heart failure: nitrate derivatives, converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, spirolactones and bradycardia agents. CLINICAL PRACTICE: In everyday clinical practice, low-dose diuretics and treatments aimed at reducing the triggering factor leading to episodes of heart failure are used alone or in combination with treatments aimed at the underlying cause of the diastolic dysfunction: betablockers, calcium inhibitors or nitrate derivatives for ischemic heart disease, drug therapy for hypertension, anti-diabetes agents, anti-arrhythmic agents for atrial fibrillation. Digitalics are not indicated. In experimental trials, converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have demonstrated interesting properties for the left ventricle but to date are not warranted for diastolic heart failure. TREATMENT OF THE CAUSE: Due to the lack of consensus on the optimal treatment for diastolic heart failure, most clinicians rely on treating the underlying heart disease and triggering factors.", 
    "630": "To assess the possible contribution of the circulatory and cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to the cardiac hypertrophy induced by a beta-agonist, the present study evaluated the effects of isoproterenol, alone or combined with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor or AT(1) receptor blocker, on plasma and LV renin activity, ANG I, and ANG II, as well as left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) weight. Male Wistar rats received isoproterenol by osmotic minipump subcutaneously and quinapril or losartan once daily by gavage. Plasma and LV ANGs were measured by radioimmunoassay after separation by HPLC. Isoproterenol alone decreased blood pressure, more markedly when combined with losartan or quinapril. Isoproterenol significantly increased LV and RV weight and total collagen. Neither losartan nor quinapril inhibited the increases in LV or RV weight. Losartan prevented the increase in RV collagen but enhanced the increase in LV collagen. Isoproterenol increased plasma renin, ANG I, and ANG II three- to fourfold. Isoproterenol combined with losartan or quinapril, caused marked further increases except for a significant decrease in plasma ANG II with quinapril. Isoproterenol alone did not increase LV ANG II and, combined with losartan or quinapril, actually decreased LV ANG II. These results indicate that isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with clear increases in plasma ANG II, but not in LV ANG II. Both losartan and quinapril lower LV ANG II below control levels, but do not prevent the isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These findings do not support a role for the circulatory or cardiac RAS in the cardiac trophic responses to beta-receptor stimulation.",

General analysis and radiology was made to all of them including renal arteriography as gold standard. Two renal scintigraphies with 99mTc-DMSA were made to all of them, baseline study and one hour after administration of 50 mg of captopril, a week between both studies. Renal scintigraphy (anterior and posterior images) was obtained 4 hours after the administration of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 99mTc-DMSA and results were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively calculating unilateral renal function. We considered positive for renovascular hypertension studies with decrease of more than five percentual points in unilateral renal function or a new defect absent in baseline study. Scintigraphic results were compared with arteriography to determine sensitivity, specificity and predictive values.",

Renal scintigraphy with captopril using 99mTc-DMSA demonstrated sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 60% and negative predictive value of 91%. We identified 3 patients with segmental defects of uptake consistent with chronic pyelonephritis scarring.",

The utility of DMSA in identify renal abnormalities, as specially pyelonephritis scarring, add value to renal studies with captopril using others tracers. DMSA could identify renal etiologies of renovascular hypertension different to renal artery stenosis.", 
    "635": "Cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels and ET receptor expression are increased in congestive heart failure (CHF). In order to determine whether this results in increased responsiveness of ET-A or ET-B receptors to ET-1, we evaluated the contractile effects of ET-1 in isolated papillary muscles isolated from hearts of control rats and from rats 4 weeks post myocardial infarction (MI) having received no therapy or chronic quinapril therapy. The ET-1 dose-response was biphasic in normal muscles. The use of the selective ET-A receptor antagonist BQ123 and the selective ET-B receptor antagonist BQ788 revealed that the initial decrease in tension was the result of ET-B receptor stimulation. Blockade of nitric oxide (NO) production with L-NAME abolished the initial decrease in tension. MI resulted in CHF that was partially reversed by quinapril. In MI, the positive inotropic effects of ET-1 were enhanced due to the loss of the initial ET-B receptor mediated decrease in tension, as well as an increase in the positive inotropic effects of ET-A receptors. This was associated with an increase in ET-A and ET-B receptor mRNA and a decrease in cardiac ecNOS protein. Four weeks of therapy with quinapril attenuated the positive inotropic effects of ET-1 and prevented the increase in ET-A receptor mRNA. Although quinapril did not restore the effects of ET-B receptor stimulation or prevent the increase in ET-B mRNA, it did restore cardiac ecNOS protein expression. Thus, the inotropic response to ET-1 is biphasic due to an overall positive inotropic effect of ET-A receptor stimulation and an ET-B receptor mediated decrease in contractility at low ET-1 concentrations which appears to be mediated by cardiac ecNOS (NO). In post-MI CHF, responsiveness to ET-A receptors increases and the ET-B mediated negative inotropic response is lost despite an increase in both receptor subtypes. Quinapril therapy attenuates these effects and normalises cardiac ecNOS protein.", 
    "636": "The adjective 'epidemic' is now attributed to the rapidly growing number of patients with diabetes mellitus, mainly type 2. and the specific complications linked to this disorder. Provided they are recognised early enough, these different complications can be treated; in some patients the evolutive course of these complications can be slowed or even stopped. Furthermore, some recent observations suggest that specific tissular lesions may be prevented or even reversed. Although glycaemic control is essential, other therapeutic measures that must also be taken include those to control blood pressure and to lower lipid levels. Of the agents available to control the complications of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular drugs, and particularly ACE inhibitors, have a pre-eminent place. Experimental and epidemiological data suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in increasing in the micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. Not only are ACE inhibitors potent antihypertensive agents but there is a growing body of data indicating that also they have a specific 'organ-protective' effect. For the same degree of blood pressure control, compared with other antihypertensive agents, ACE inhibitors demonstrate function and tissue protection of considered organs. ACE inhibitors have been reported to improve kidney, heart, and to a lesser extent, eye and peripheral nerve function of patients with diabetes mellitus. These favourable effects are the result of inhibition of both haemodynamic and tissular effects of angiotensin II. Finally, there are a growing number of arguments favouring the use of ACE inhibitors very early in patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "637": "We determined the acute effects of the angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on the arterial mechanics in rats at different ages, based on the exponentially tapered T-tube model. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats aged 4 and 12 months were individually referred to as young (n = 8) and adult rats (n = 8) and were anesthetized and thoractomized. The pulsatile aortic pressure and flow signals before and after the administration of captopril (20 mg/kg, i.p.) were measured by a high-fidelity pressure sensor and an electromagnetic flow probe, respectively. In each age group, captopril showed little change in basal heart rate as well as cardiac output. However, captopril produced a drop of 15% in mean aortic pressure in young and a fall of 12% in adult rats. In addition. captopril reduced total peripheral resistance by 21% in young and by 23% in adult animals. As for the pulsatile nature of the arterial system, captopril had increased wave transit time of the lower body circulation of 10% in young and of 12% in adult rats. By contrast, captopril reduced wave reflection factor by 22% in young and by 25% in adult animals. In conclusion, the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has a stiffness-decreasing effect on Windkessel vessels and a dilated effect on resistance arterioles in either young or adult rats. No age dependence of vascular response and reflex tachycardia to captopril has been found in rats between 4 and 12 months.", 
    "638": "Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor and the goal of its pharmacologic treatment is to reduce morbidity and mortality. Treatment is usually initiated with a low dose of a single agent and titrated to a higher dose as required. As many as 50% of patients require the addition of a second agent to achieve satisfactory blood pressure control. The aim of this study was to assess the dose-response relationship of nitrendipine and enalapril alone or in fixed combination in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. A total of 496 patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, factorial-design, parallel-group clinical trial comparing placebo, nitrendipine (5, 10, and 20 mg) and enalapril (5, 10, and 20 mg) alone or in combination. After a single-blind, 2-week placebo run-in period, 414 patients whose diastolic blood pressure ranged between 90-109 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a treatment group. The combination of nitrendipine and enalapril, particularly regimens including nitrendipine 20 mg and enalapril 5 or 10 mg, were significantly superior to both monotherapies; mean diastolic blood pressure reductions from baseline to last visit were -12.5 and -14.3 mm Hg, respectively. Response surface analysis provided further evidence that these combinations were optimal in terms of anti-hypertensive efficacy. All treatments were well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. In summary, the anti-hypertensive efficacy of the combination was found to be superior to both monotherapies at any doses. The dose combination achieving the greatest blood pressure reduction was nitrendipine 20 mg and enalapril 10 mg.",

New long-term treatments are emerging for diffuse SS, including cyclophosphamide for patients with progressive interstitial lung disease or stem cell transplantation for those with early organ involvement. The most effective treatments remain symptomatic, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for acute renal crisis, calcium channel antagonists for Raynaud's phenomenon, and proton pump inhibitors for the complications of gastroesophageal reflux.

Exercise led to an approximately 20-fold increase (P < 0.001) in ANG II levels in the control group (5.4 +/- 1.0 to 102.0 +/- 25.1 pg/ml), whereas this response was blunted during ACE blockade (8.1 +/- 1.2 to 13.2 +/- 2.4 pg/ml) and in response to an orthostatic challenge performed postexercise. Apart from lactate and cortisol, which were higher in the ACE-blockade group vs. the control group, hormones, metabolites, VO(2), and RER followed the same pattern of changes in ACE-blockade and control groups during exercise. Splanchnic blood flow (at rest: 1.67 +/- 0.12, ACE blockade; 1.59 +/- 0.18 l/min, control) decreased during moderate exercise (0.78 +/- 0.07, ACE blockade; 0.74 +/- 0.14 l/min, control), whereas splanchnic glucose production (at rest: 0.50 +/- 0.06, ACE blockade; 0.68 +/- 0.10 mmol/min, control) increased during moderate exercise (1.97 +/- 0.29, ACE blockade; 1.91 +/- 0.41 mmol/min, control). Refuting a major role of the RAS for these responses, no differences in the pattern of change of splanchnic blood flow and splanchnic glucose production were observed during ACE blockade compared with controls. This study demonstrates that the normal increase in ANG II levels observed during prolonged exercise in humans does not play a major role in the regulation of splanchnic blood flow and glucose production.", 
    "649": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of cardiovascular drug that simultaneously inhibit both neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). They increase the availability of peptides that have vasodilatory and other vascular effects; they also inhibit production of angiotensin II. In animal models vasopeptidase inhibitors decrease blood pressure in low, medium, and high renin forms of hypertension, and they also appear to confer benefits in models of heart failure and ischaemic heart disease. Studies in human hypertension show that these agents are effective in decreasing blood pressure regardless of race or age. Experience with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced of these drugs, has shown it to be more effective than currently available ACE inhibitors or other widely used antihypertensive agents. Studies with omapatrilat in congestive heart failure have shown beneficial effects on haemodynamics and symptoms. The vasopeptidase inhibitors appear to have safety profiles similar to ACE inhibitors, though the frequency of side-effects such as angio-oedema and cough remains to be established. Large trials with clinical endpoints, some already in progress, are needed to establish the place of this class of drug beside that of established therapies in conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and nephropathy.",

Preoperative blood samples were used to estimate creatinine clearance using a standard formula that takes age, sex, and weight into account. Impaired renal function was defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (fifteenth percentile). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between NSAID use (alone or in combination with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) and impaired renal function.",

This association was almost exclusively the result of the use of NSAIDs with a half-life of 4 or more hours (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.7). Patients who used diuretics with NSAIDs (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7 to 8.3) or without NSAIDs (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.6 to 7.6) had a higher risk of impaired renal function than did patients using NSAIDs alone (OR = 1.6) or none of these drugs (reference).

Recent trials have focused on the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) necessary to achieve maximum reduction in clinical events. Data also exist demonstrating that intensive lowering of LDL-C in patients with unstable angina reduces the incidence of adverse clinical events. The statins appear to be fundamental therapy in patients with established coronary disease as well as a mainstay for those with early evidence of atherosclerosis. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated a reduction in ischemic events in patients with heart failure. Recent trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with vascular disease who do not have the traditional indications for ACE inhibition have shown a reversal of endothelial dysfunction and a reduction in adverse clinical endpoints. A role for the use of calcium antagonists in patients with atherosclerosis is less well established, despite the evidence of excellent results in patients with symptomatic coronary disease. A recent clinical trial, using a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with novel mechanisms, found promising results with regard to its effects on atherosclerosis",

    "659": "The presence, and in many cases the regulated synthesis, of components of the renin-angiotensin system have been demonstrated in multiple tissues, indicating the existence of tissue angiotensin-generating systems. These vary with respect to which renin-angiotensin system components are synthesized locally and which are taken up from plasma. Enzymes unrelated to the classical renin-angiotensin system may also contribute to tissue angiotensin synthesis. However, based on the available data, the prevailing opinion that kidney-derived renin is in all cases the only physiologically relevant renin in tissues must be revised. Also there is evidence indicating a role for tissue angiotensin systems in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and in cardiovascular structural remodeling. The angiotensin-regulated synthesis of aldosterone in cardiac tissue has been described, suggesting the possibility that a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system exists in the heart. In addition, intracellular (intracrine) sites of angiotensin action have been reported. Some of these findings have implications for therapeutics and, in particular, for the use of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Finally, tissue angiotensin systems outside the cardiovascular system also appear to be physiologically relevant.", 
    "660": "1. The influence of bradykinin (BK) on blood glucose and plasma insulin levels was investigated in anaesthetized rats. 2. Blood glucose level was dose-dependently increased by intravenous infusion of BK. This effect of BK was enhanced by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), a kinin B1 receptor agonist, did not modify blood glucose levels while the effect of BK was inhibited by Hoe-140, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist. 3. The effect of BK was reduced by the NO-synthase inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. The effect of BK was suppressed by the association of propranolol with phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. It was also reduced by hexamethonium, a ganglion-blocking drug. In adrenalectomized rats, the infusion of BK slightly decreased blood glucose levels. 4. The hyperglycaemic effect of adrenaline was suppressed by propranolol associated with phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine, but it was not modified by L-NAME. 5. Infusion of BK did not modify plasma insulin levels. However, after phentolamine and propranolol, BK induced a transient 2 fold rise in plasma insulin levels. The release of insulin was dose-dependent and inhibited by Hoe-140. 6. We conclude that infusion of BK induces, via a stimulation of B2 receptors, the release of NO and of prostanoids. The latter agents activate through a reflex pathway the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. This release increases blood glucose levels and reduces plasma insulin levels. After adrenoceptor inhibition, BK induces a secretion of insulin, via the stimulation of B2 receptors.",

In this sub-study, we investigated the effects of atenolol vs placebo on LVEF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, workload, and peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2)).",

We evaluated LVEF once a year and evaluated workload, pVO(2), and NYHA class before and after 6, 12, and 24 months. Repeated measures of analysis of variance were used for comparison of serial measurements. After 2 years, both atenolol (18% +/- 5% vs 36% +/- 18%, p < 0.05) and placebo (18% +/- 5% vs 23% +/- 5%, p < 0.05) increased LVEF, with a more pronounced effect of atenolol (p = 0.02), which also changed NYHA class distribution more favorably over time (p < 0.05).

Results from 2213 rHuEPO na\u00efve patients were compared between patients receiving rHuEPO alone and patients receiving both rHuEPO and ACE inhibitors. Because of the demographic differences between the two groups, a propensity score was used to eliminate the influence of confounding factors and to match the patient population in these two patient groups. Multiple regression analysis also was performed.",

Tubular damage is partly referable to toxic effects on the tubular epithelial cells induced by filtered plasma proteins. Patients with nonselective proteinuria, that is, increased urine excretion of high-molecular-weight plasma proteins such as IgG in comparison to albumin, often have poor renal outcome. The present observational study examined correlations between the degree of tubular damage, measured by urine concentration of protein HC, and the levels of urine IgG and albuminuria.",

Furthermore, alterations in the urinary excretion of the two proteins in single patients correlated significantly to each other (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). The correlation between the degree of albuminuria and the protein HC excretion was significant at the time of kidney biopsy, but ceased to exist during the follow-up time. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that in comparison with the creatinine clearance and albuminuria, only the changes in urinary IgG excretion were related to the corresponding changes in urinary protein HC excretion (r = 0.84 and r2 = 0.7, P < 0.001).", 
    "671": "The findings of the study suggest that the urinary protein HC concentration correlates to the degree of IgG-uria but not to the degree of albuminuria during the course of proteinuric glomerular disease. Whether this correlation is to be explained by an intrinsic toxic effect on tubular cells executed by IgG or perhaps by some other high molecular weight proteins, needs to be investigated further.

    "676": "Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glycoprotein in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. It contains an Arg-Gly-Asp cell-binding sequence and a thrombin-cleavage site. OPN is mainly present in the loop of Henle and distal nephrons in normal kidneys in animals and humans. After renal damage, OPN expression may be significantly up-regulated in all tubule segments and glomeruli. Studies utilizing OPN gene-deficient mice, antisense-treated or anti-OPN-treated animals have demonstrated that OPN promotes accumulation of macrophages, and may play a role in macrophage-mediated renal injury, but that the effect may be mild and short-lived. On the other hand, OPN has some renoprotective actions in renal injury, such as increasing tolerance to acute ischemia, inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing nitric oxide synthesis, reducing cell peroxide levels and promoting the survival of cells exposed to hypoxia, decreasing cell apoptosis and participating in the regeneration of cells. In addition, OPN is associated with renal stones, but whether it acts as a promoter or inhibitor of stone formation is controversial. It has been demonstrated that OPN receptors include two families: integrin and CD44. The OPN integrin receptors include alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(v)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(9)beta(1), and alpha(4)beta(1). In normal human kidneys, standard CD44 is expressed most dominantly. Different OPN functions are mediated via distinct receptors. Parathyroid hormone, vitamin D(3), calcium, phosphate and some cytokines increase OPN expression in vitro or in vivo, whereas female sex hormones and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists decrease OPN expression in some renal damage states.",

A minimum effective dose for ANG I and ANG II was 5 ng x kg bw(-1); that for ANG III was 10 ng x kg bw(-1). DABF and CVBF rates increased during the first 2 min and remained elevated for 20-50 min. Flow responses similar to those of ANG II in form and magnitude followed iv injections of extracts of corpuscles of Stannius (CS-EXT). Increases in DABF and CVBF following injections of ANG I, human renin substrate (hRS), and CS-EXT were all blocked by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril. Increases in DABF and CVBF which followed injections of hRS and CS-EXT were blocked completely by pepstatin A. [Sar(1), Val(5)]-ANG II (Sarile) blocked completely the DABF and CVBF responses to ANG II and CS-EXT, but the mammalian receptor antagonists losartan (AT1) and PD123319 (AT2) only partially blocked them. These findings support strongly the hypothesis that the corpuscles of Stannius secrete renin or isorenin and that the renin-angiotensin system regulates cardiovascular function in freshwater eels and other bony fishes that possess them.",

Patients with insulin resistance are more likely to develop diabetes and coronary heart disease. Better treatment of diabetes may result in less coronary heart disease, although this has not yet been established. Reliance on fasting glucose determinations alone will overlook a substantial number of patients at risk for diabetes and subsequent coronary heart disease. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin should be a routine part of screening for patients at risk for diabetes. Patients with glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the high-normal range should be treated more aggressively with diet, exercise, and medication because evidence is good that diabetes can be prevented (or its onset delayed). Patients with borderline elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and with high-normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be considered for statin therapy, and patients with hypertension with high-normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line agents.

During the 5-min reperfusion, the signals returned to normoxic levels. In isolated mitochondria exposed to anoxia and reoxygenation the radical forms of .QH and FeS2 changed in a similar manner as in the intact heart.

Forty-eight consecutive patients with their first AMI and 15 control subjects were studied. Patients with AMI were stratified according to the changes in s-PICP levels between days 1 and 90 (DeltaPICP) and divided into group I with < or =16.0 microg/l or group II with >16.0 microg/l. Patients in group II were characterized by LV dilatation, no improvement in ejection fraction and development of impaired diastolic filling from day 1 to 360, findings which were in contrast to group I. Cox regression analysis identified changes in s-PICP of >16.0 microg/l as an independent predictor of cardiac death or heart failure during follow-up. In conclusion, DeltaPICP relates to long-term changes in LV function and size, and provides prognostic information following AMI.",

Of home-dwelling individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD, n = 717, 28.6%), 61.0% of women and 68.3% of men used aspirin, 58.4% and 52.9% nitrates, 54.7% and 52.4% beta-blockers, 20.0% and 13.7% (angiontensin-converting enzyme) ACE inhibitors and 25.1% and 21.1% calcium-channel blockers. Only 14.3% and 19.4% were on cholesterol-lowering drugs. The difference in ACE inhibitor, diuretic and digoxin use was statistically significant (P < 0.05) between genders (women used more).",

    "706": "From February 1998 to September 1999, the Italian Ministry of Health limited angiotensin-II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist reimbursement only to patients who necessitated discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment due to cough or angioedema. We assessed the consequences of this decision on the reporting of ACE inhibitor-associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs).",

In 1998-1999, the dispensation of ACE inhibitors showed little variation, while that of AT1 receptor antagonists grew about twofold.", 
    "709": "There was a clear correlation between ACE inhibitor-associated ADR reporting and limitation to AT1 receptor antagonist reimbursement status.

    "710": "Few studies have prospectively and systematically explored the factors that acutely precipitate exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Knowledge of such factors is important in designing measures to prevent deterioration of clinical status. The objective of this study was to prospectively describe the precipitants associated with exacerbation of CHF status in patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction Pilot Study.", 
    "711": "We conducted a 2-stage, multicenter, randomized trial in 768 patients with CHF who had an ejection fraction of less than 40%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive enalapril maleate, candesartan cilexetil, or both for 17 weeks, followed by randomization to receive metoprolol succinate or placebo for 26 weeks.

    "714": "To investigate the genetic susceptibility associated with cough related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes, 189 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with proteinuria or hypertension treated with perindopril were studied. Cough was considered to be present if the patients had been bothered by a cough during treatment and if they had had related symptoms for at least 2 weeks without an identifiable cause. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was used to detect polymorphisms of ACE and bradykinin B2-receptor genes. After 8 weeks of treatment, 49.2% (93 of 189) of our NIDDM patients were found to be suffering from ACEI-related cough. ACEI-related cough was mainly associated with female patients, with 71.7% (76 of 106) of female and only 20.5% (17 of 83) of male patients experiencing cough after ACEI treatment. There was a significant association of ACE II genotype with ACEI-related cough. The genotype frequencies were 58.2% for II, 47.8% for ID, and 16.7% for DD in patients with ACEI-associated cough and 41.8% for II, 52.2% for ID, and 83.3% for DD in subjects without ACEI-associated cough (chi(2) = 10.268; df = 2, P =.006). As female patients made up the majority of the subjects suffering from ACEI-related cough, we further analyzed the association of ACE I/D genotype with ACEI-related cough separately by sex. Male patients with ACEI-related cough were not associated with ACE I/D genotype distribution, while female patients were strongly associated with ACE I/D genotype polymorphism (chi(2) = 16.12; df = 2; P <.001). There was no association between the bradykinin B2 receptor gene -58T/C polymorphism with ACEI-related cough. In conclusion, our results indicate that Chinese diabetic female subjects are susceptible to ACEI-related cough, and this susceptibility may be genetically predetermined.", 
    "715": "The novel Cluj property indices are used for modeling the biological properties of dipeptides: the ACE inhibition activity of a set of 58 dipeptides and the bitter tasting activity of a set of 48 dipeptides, taken from the literature.

    "716": "Using angiotensin II (AngII) type 1A receptor-deficient mice [AT1(-/-)], in which we induced protein overload nephropathy, we explored the potential implication of AngII and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the tubulointerstitial damage because of persistent proteinuria. At day 7, AT1(-/-) showed marked proteinuria to a similar extent to that of wild-type mice (WT). However, at day14, AT1(-/-) had significantly less proteinuria, renal damage, transforming growth factor-beta, and matrix mRNA expression and mortality. AT1(-/-) also showed a significant diminution in the activation of the transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappaB and AP-1. Unexpectedly, AT1(-/-) had a higher interstitial infiltration than WT. The administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril to WT caused a marked improvement in proteinuria and renal lesions, resembling that seen in untreated AT1(-/-). However, the interstitial infiltration persisted in AT1(-/-) when treated with quinapril. Because ET-1 may participate in the recruitment of mononuclear cells, we also studied the implication of this peptide. AT1(-/-) had a significantly higher ET-1 expression in tubular epithelial cells than WT. The administration of the dual ETA/ETB antagonist bosentan to AT1(-/-) considerably reduced the interstitial infiltrates. Bosentan also exerted a beneficial effect on proteinuria, renal lesions, and mortality in WT. These data show that in overload nephropathy, proteinuria and renal lesions are, to a large extent, AngII-dependent. The up-regulation of ET-1 in tubular epithelial cells in AT1(-/-), associated with interstitial infiltrates, suggests that the combination of drugs interfering with both vasopeptides may be of therapeutic interest in renal diseases with severe proteinuria and tubulointerstitial damage.", 
    "717": "In proteinuric nephropathies tubular atrophy leads to glomerular-tubule disconnection through an unknown mechanism. Here we studied whether proteinuria promoted glomerular-tubule disconnection in individual nephrons and whether this phenomenon was prevented by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and control rats were studied at 4 and 8 months. Two additional groups of PHN rats received lisinopril (40 mg/L) or a calcium channel blocker (lacidipine, 3 mg/kg) from day 7 after surgery to 8 months. At sacrifice, kidneys were serially sectioned to identify glomerular- tubule abnormalities in individual nephrons and changes in interstitial volume. In PHN rats, the time-dependent increase in proteinuria was paralleled by tubular atrophy leading to glomerular-tubule disconnection and interstitial volume enlargement. Marked apoptosis was invariably found in atrophic tubules in contrast to the absent or very mild terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining in tubules normally connected to glomeruli in PHN animals. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor prevented hypertension, proteinuria, the formation of atrophic tubuli, glomerular-tubule disconnection and limited the fractional interstitial volume expansion. Although lacidipine limited hypertension, it did not reduce proteinuria or prevent tubular atrophy and disconnection. Multivariate analysis showed that the appearance of atubular glomeruli and the increase in interstitial volume were better predicted by proteinuria than blood pressure. This study suggests that ACE inhibitors effectively prevent glomerular-tubule disconnection possibly by their ability of reducing proteinuria, which in turn favors proximal tubular cell apoptosis. Agents that only reduced hypertension but not proteinuria do not affect tubular behavior.", 
    "718": "The toxicity and efficacy of S-nitrosocaptopril (CapNO), a novel vasodilator possessing the capacities of both a nitric oxide donor and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were examined in rodents. In single-dose acute toxicity studies in ICR mice, the median lethal dose (LD(50)) for CapNO was 674+/-94 mg/kg (iv) and 2078+/-100 mg/kg (po), whereas for oral captopril was 4286+/-173 mg/kg. S-nitrosoglutathione, containing the same S-nitroso moiety as CapNO, showed an LD(50) equal to CapNO when the values were expressed by the mol/kg. The cause of acute death by the high doses of CapNO was lethal hypotension. In the subacute toxicity studies, oral CapNO was well tolerated in normotensive and hypertensive rats at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day for 3 months, except for considerable reductions in food consumption and growth rate observed in the 500 mg/kg/day group. Serum chemistry and hematology tests performed in the subacute toxicity studies revealed no adverse effects of oral CapNO except for a significant decrease in cholesterol levels in hypertensive SHR rat. At autopsy, no histopathological changes in major organs were observed over the subacute period. Administration of a therapeutic dose of CapNO (iv, 250 microg/kg which produced 25% decreases in blood pressure) revealed no changes in the hematological parameters. Subchronic treatment of SHR and SS/Jr rats with oral CapNO (50 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced mean arterial pressure to the normotensive level. Considering the absence of adverse effects of CapNO in the subchronic toxicity study, CapNO appears to be a safe drug for further clinical trials, but particular caution must be taken because it can cause hypotension when overdosed.", 
    "719": "The goals of care for patients at risk for cardiomyopathy induced by cancer treatment should include prevention, early diagnosis, treatment of subclinical cardiac dysfunction, prevention of disease progression, and prolongation of patient survival. Any strategy aimed to minimize the cardiotoxic effects of cancer treatment should maintain the treatment's antineoplastic efficacy. Successful therapy achieves the highest health-related quality of life that is defined by the balance between maximizing the efficacy of oncologic therapy and minimizing the toxicity of this therapy. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity can be reduced by limiting the overall cumulative dose. There is no specific treatment for cancer therapy-related cardiomyopathy, and symptomatic patients should receive standard treatments for congestive heart failure such as afterload reduction, beta-blockers, diuresis, and digoxin. Afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril and captopril may be indicated in patients with elevated afterload and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction diagnosed by echocardiography. Beta-blockers may improve myocardial systolic dysfunction and may be useful in the treatment of cancer treatment-induced cardiomyopathy. Cardiac transplantation remains a viable option in patients with cancer treatment-induced end-stage heart disease.", 
    "720": "Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). Diabetic cardiomyopathy has been acknowledged as a distinct disease entity that is an additional risk for diabetic patients to develop CHF, especially when they are affected by hypertension or epicardial coronary artery disease. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy has been documented to lead to CHF even in the absence of other risk factors. As the combination of hypertension and diabetes has shown to be particularly detrimental, aggressive blood pressure control with a goal of less than 130/85 mm Hg is of critical importance. The first choice for pharmacologic treatment is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Double- or triple-drug therapy is frequently required for good control. The increased risk of epicardial coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes warrants stringent treatment of dyslipidemia. If dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction is present, therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, beta-blockers, and spironolactone (for patients with New York Heart Association class III to IV functional status) is indicated. If cardiac dysfunction consists predominantly of impaired diastolic function, heart rate control with a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist is of particular importance. Control of blood glucose should be achieved, with hemoglobin A(1c) levels of less than 7%. Hyperinsulinemia should be avoided when possible; therefore, insulin-sensitizing agents are preferred over insulin-secretion-enhancing agents. Symptoms of CHF and acutely decompensated CHF should be treated no differently than nondiabetic patients. Care for patients with diabetes always includes lifestyle changes consisting of smoking cessation, decreasing obesity, regular exercise, and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.", 
    "721": "The management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) heart failure starts with the determination of the underlying diagnosis, definition of the hemodynamic character (eg, systolic, diastolic, valvular, right- and left-sided heart dysfunction), recognition of complicating factors (eg, atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction), and consideration for any surgically remedial lesions (eg, severe valvular regurgitation, high-grade coronary artery occlusive disease). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blocking agents, digoxin, and judicious diuretic administration make up the therapeutic plan for patients with symptomatic DCM heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzymes are indicated for patients with DCM who have mild or no detectable symptoms; whether this subgroup would benefit from long-term beta-blockade remains to be established. Spirolactone also has been shown to be effective in patients with more advanced stages of heart failure. Biventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy) recently has been approved for use in patients with DCM and a left ventricular or intraventricular conduction defect and a QRS duration of longer than 140 msec. More intense pharmacotherapy, mechanical devices, and transplantation are directed at patients with severely symptomatic end-stage DCM. The effectiveness of any heart failure treatment plan is very much dependent on nonpharmacologic approaches, including dietary measures, exercise conditioning, and similar considerations, all of which are best delivered by dedicated heart failure programs.", 
    "722": "This review focuses on cerebral complications of hypertension, which include stroke, impairment of cognitive function, dementia, and possibly depression and anxiety. These conditions are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly.", 
    "723": "Not only elevated diastolic blood pressure, but also isolated systolic hypertension and elevated pulse pressure play an important role in the development of brain complications. Randomised placebo-controlled trials have provided evidence that reduction of hypertension decreases safely and effectively morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly. The new classes of drugs, in particular calcium-channels blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to be as effective as the originally used diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "724": "Several trials are currently in progress and should provide more information on the benefit of antihypertensive treatment in very elderly persons (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial, HYVET) and secondary prevention of stroke (PROGRESS). The importance of assessing new dosages of the presently used antihypertensive drugs as well as the benefit of new classes of drugs is emphasised. Further trials specifically focusing on the prevention of dementia by antihypertensive drugs are needed to confirm the results of the Syst-Eur Vascular Dementia Project. The benefit of calcium antagonists in the prevention of dementia in elderly hypertensive patients should be assessed in the Dementia Prevention in Hypertension trial (DEPHY)."
