    "0": "Trandolapril is a non-sulfhydryl prodrug which, after oral administration, is hydrolysed in the liver to its active diacid, trandolaprilat. Trandolaprilat inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and displays similar pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, improving haemodynamic and cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4mg once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative trials, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to that of atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and sustained release nifedipine, but was more effective than captopril. Combined therapy with trandolapril and hydrochlorothiazide or sustained release nifedipine had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug treatment alone. Further comparative trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse events being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril lacks adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, trandolapril, with its favourable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate hypertension, is likely to provide a well tolerated option for the treatment of this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "Remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is influenced not only by hemodynamic but possibly by neurohumoral factors as well. Ibopamine is an orally active dopamine agonist (DA) with both hemodynamic and neurohumoral properties in humans. The latter property prevails in rats. To study the dose-dependent effect of ibopamine on myocardial remodeling and compare it with the effect of captopril, we randomized rats with (n = 27) or without (n = 27) experimental MI to captopril (25 mg/kg/day), low-dose ibopamine (10 mg/kg/day), high-dose ibopamine (30 mg/kg/day), or no treatment. After 8-week treatment, hearts were isolated and left ventricular (LV) function, LV cavity volume, and infarct size (IS) were evaluated. Both ibopamine and captopril significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels in rats with MI. In untreated but not in treated infarcted rats, LV function was significantly reduced as compared with that of controls. IS was reduced in all three active treatment groups as compared with untreated rats. LV cavity volume was significantly increased in untreated rats with MI as compared with controls. This dilatation was attenuated by both ibopamine and captopril. Ibopamine, comparable to captopril, administered early after coronary ligation reduced IS and subsequent ventricular dilatation, resulting in preservation of cardiac function in this rat model. This observation suggests a major role for neurohumoral activation in the process of remodeling.", 
    "2": "We wished to determine whether chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevents the vascular toxicity of cyclosporine A (Cx). In aortas isolated from rats treated with ramipril [10 mg/kg/day orally (p.o.) for 4 weeks], the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) were potentiated (the area under the curve (AUC) decreased from 154 +/- 35 to 63 +/- 12, p < 0.05), but contractions induced by phenylephrine (PE) and angiotensin II (AII) were not affected. Therefore, we studied three groups of rats in parallel. Group 1 received ramipril 10 mg/kg/day p.o. for 4 weeks and ramipril 10 mg/kg/day p.o. plus Cx 20 mg/kg/day intramuscularly, in fifth week; group 2 received Cx only (20 mg/kg/day i.m. for 1 week), and group 3 served as control. In group 2, ACh-induced relaxations were reduced as compared with those of the control group (AUC increased from 141 +/- 34 to 240 +/- 32, p < 0.05), whereas in group 1, AUC was not significantly different from that of group 3 (195 +/- 28 vs. 141 +/- 34). In group 2, PE- and AII-induced contractions were enhanced; AUC values for PE and AII were 495 +/- 45 versus 348 +/-38 in group 3 and 424 +/- 28 versus 314 +/- 17 in group 3, respectively (p < 0.05). In group 1, AUCs for PE and AII were not significantly different from those of group 3. After mechanical removal of the endothelium, the increased responsiveness to PE and AII persisted in group 2 whereas AUC values in group 1 were not different from those of group 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We studied CSH from the Bio 53.58 dilated strain (n = 76), in which myocardial necrosis is known to develop from age 30 days, whereas congestive heart failure (CHF) is observed only after age 6 months. Animals were randomly assigned to three groups. In early-treated animals, perindopril (1 mg/kg body weight once daily in distilled water) was administered by force-feeding from age 1 month to 9 months (PE1, n = 21). Animals receiving delayed treatment received distilled water from age 1 month to 6 months, followed by 1 mg/kg body weight from age 6 to 9 months (PE2, n = 34). Controls received distilled water from age 1 month to 9 months (C, n = 21). At endpoint (9 months), mechanical properties of LV papillary muscles and serum ACE activity were studied in a subgroup of 32 CSH (C, n = 8; PE1, n = 10; and PE2, n = 14). Maximum unloaded shortening velocity, maximum extent of systolic shortening in twitch with preload only, and normalized peak of isometric active force were measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces vascular smooth muscle cell migration and growth in vitro and induces DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle in vivo. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists inhibit neointimal hyperplasia in many experimental models of restenosis. However, recent clinical trials (MERCATOR and MARCATOR) reported that treatment with low (antihypertensive) doses of an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) failed to prevent restenosis. Because ACE activity is induced in the neointima after injury, we hypothesize that the inhibition of neointimal development may be dependent on the suppression of tissue ACE activity, which in turn is dependent on the dose of the ACE inhibitor.", 
    "5": "To test this hypothesis, we treated rats with increasing doses of an ACE inhibitor, quinapril, before injury of the carotid artery. Blood pressure, serum and tissue ACE activity, and neointimal area were measured. The results demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition by quinapril of serum and tissue ACE activities and neointima formation. However, the IC50s for blood pressure reduction and serum ACE inhibition were significantly lower than that observed for the suppression of neointima formation. The degree of neointimal formation showed a better correlation with residual tissue ACE than with serum ACE or blood pressure.", 
    "6": "These results demonstrate a dissociation of the ability of an ACE inhibitor to decrease blood pressure and inhibit circulating ACE activity from its ability to inhibit tissue ACE activity. These results suggest that the need for a higher dose of an ACE inhibitor for the inhibition of neointima formation may be due to the relative difficulty in inhibiting tissue ACE activity.", 
    "7": "The effect of the thiol containing compounds N-acetylcysteine and captopril on glutathione metabolism in human erythrocytes has been investigated non-invasively using 1H spin echo NMR. N-Acetylcysteine was found to increase the reduced form of glutathione while captopril increased the oxidized form, but no changes in the total glutathione concentration were observed. Incubation of the cells with buthionine sulphoximine to inhibit de novo glutathione synthesis did not affect the response. The results show that these compounds act by altering the redox balance of glutathione rather than by stimulating its synthesis, and that their mechanisms of action are different, and not simply due to the presence of the thiol group.", 
    "8": "Cardiac transplant atherosclerosis is thought to result from immune-mediated vessel wall injury. The present experiments were designed to test whether CsA alone or in combination with the ACE-inhibitor cilazapril has any effect on graft atherosclerosis in a rat cardiac transplant model. Cardiac grafts were transplanted heterotopically into either syngeneic or allogeneic recipients and followed by daily palpation; long-surviving grafts were removed after 100 days and the extent and degree of atherosclerosis was assessed using computerized morphometry. Atherosclerosis was more extensive in grafts removed from untreated allogeneic recipients compared with syngeneic recipients; CsA treatment increased the extent of atherosclerosis in syngeneic transplants. The extent and degree of vascular occlusion in allogeneic grafts from recipients treated with 15 mg/kg of CsA every other day was not different from that in grafts removed from recipients that received initially higher CsA doses. Cilazapril had no effect on the extent of graft atherosclerosis but decreased the degree of luminal narrowing in grafts from CsA-treated recipients significantly. Some grafts showed neovascularization in the subendocardial region adjacent to organized intraventricular clots, suggesting the release of angiogenic factors from such clots; such growth factors may contribute to the atherosclerotic vessel wall reaction in this model. We conclude that CsA promotes the development of graft atherosclerosis in heterotopically transplanted syngeneic cardiac grafts in the rat. We furthermore found that cilazapril has a beneficial effect on the degree of atherosclerosis in CsA-treated recipients.", 
    "9": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the selective angiotensin AT2 receptor ligands, CGP 42112B (Nic-Tyr-(N alpha-benzoyloxycarbonyl-Arg)Lys-His-Pro-Ile-OH) and PD 123319 ((s)-1-[[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methyl-phenyl]methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl+ ++)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]-pyridine-6-carboxylic acid) are agonists at angiotensin receptors influencing blood pressure and renal function in the enalaprilat-treated anesthetized rat. The agonist angiotensin II significantly increased blood pressure and renal vascular resistance. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged by angiotensin II. Effective renal blood flow decreased significantly in response to angiotensin II leading to a significant increase in filtration fraction. Angiotensin II did not induce significant change in urinary potassium excretion or free water formation but significantly increased both urine volume and urinary sodium excretion. At doses up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than angiotensin II, CGP 42112B also significantly increased blood pressure, filtration fraction, glomerular filtration rate, urine volume and urinary sodium excretion, but did not significantly affect effective renal blood flow or renal vascular resistance. The selective angiotensin AT2 receptor ligand PD 123319 had no significant effects on blood pressure nor any measured parameter of renal function. The changes in blood pressure and renal function produced by angiotensin II and CGP 42112B could be completely blocked by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan. The results therefore only support a role for angiotensin AT1 receptors and not angiotensin AT2 receptors in the control of renal function in the rat and demonstrate that at high doses the angiotensin AT2 selective ligand CGP 42112B behaves as an agonist at angiotensin AT1 receptors.", 
    "10": "Whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are now indicated for all grades of chronic heart failure, the 2 adverse effects that limit use of these drugs are systemic hypotension and renal dysfunction. The recognized clinical correlates such as hyponatremia and high diuretic dose, which predict occurrence of these adverse effects in severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), are rarely evident in patients with mild-to-moderate CHF. Accordingly, we studied 36 patients with stable, moderate CHF in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion to evaluate by multiple discriminate regression analysis the pathophysiologic determinants of changes in blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion after initial converting enzyme inhibition with captopril 25 mg. A captopril-mediated decrease in mean arterial pressure was predicted by 3 factors (r2 = 0.74): the decrease in serum angiotensin II (F ratio = 10.3, p < 0.01), the decrease in plasma norepinephrine (F = 8, p = 0.02), and, inversely by pretreatment mean arterial pressure (F = 5.6, p = 0.04), patients with higher initial values exhibiting greater decreases in response to captopril. A captopril-mediated decline in glomerular filtration rate, determined by radioisotope elimination, was also predicted by 3 factors (r2 = 0.67): a decrease in renal plasma flow (F = 48.6, p < 0.01), low pretreatment glomerular filtration rate (F = 11.1, p < 0.01), and low absolute post-treatment serum angiotensin II (F = 5, p = 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Animal studies suggest additional benefits may be obtained with earlier initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The effects on LV function of captopril and enalapril initiated within 24 hours of myocardial infarction were studied. Two hundred twenty-five patients with acute myocardial infarction were enrolled within 24 hours of the onset of chest pain. They were randomized to receive either captopril 25 mg three times daily, enalapril 5 mg three times daily, or placebo. LV ejection fraction (EF) and volumes were measured by radionuclide ventriculography at baseline during treatment and at 3 months after a 3-day withdrawal from therapy. The ACE inhibitor group had a significant increase in EF (45 +/- 1 to 47 +/- 1%; p = 0.005) and significantly attenuated LV dilatation compared with results in the placebo group (175 +/- 6 to 189 +/- 7 ml in the placebo group vs 168 +/- 4 to 172 +/- 4 ml in the ACE inhibitor group; p = 0.051 for LV end-diastolic volume; and 99 +/- 6 to 108 +/- 7 ml in the placebo group vs 94 +/- 3 to 94 +/- 4 ml; p = 0.026 for LV end-systolic volume).

    "12": "There is increasing evidence that the renin-angiotensin system may play a important role in cardiac hypertrophy. To assess the role of angiotensin II in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy, three groups of adult mice were subjected to left ventricular pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). For the next 7 days the groups received either the specific angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist (losartan, 1.05 g/l; n = 17), an angiotensin enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 2 g/l; n = 17), or no treatment (n = 22) administered in the drinking water and compared with three similarly treated sham-operated groups (n = 7 each). TAC resulted in a significant increase in heart weight-to-body weight ratio (0.634 +/- 0.087 vs. 0.525 +/- 0.039, g/g x 100, P < 0.05), which was prevented by losartan (0.506 +/- 0.069, g/g x 100, P < 0.0001) despite similar hemodynamic load (proximal systolic pressure 146 +/- 31 vs. 136 +/- 32 mmHg, untreated vs. losartan, P = NS). Proximal systolic pressure was positively correlated with the development of ventricular hypertrophy. In the presence of AT1-receptor blockade, the increase in heart weight-to-body weight ratio at any given systolic pressure was significantly attenuated compared with untreated TAC mice. The increase in heart weight-to-body weight ratio was also significantly attenuated by captopril compared with untreated banded controls (0.542 +/- 0.091, g/g x 100, P = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Selective, as well as mixed, inhibitors of the two zinc metallopeptidases, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), are of major clinical interest in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure. New thiol inhibitors, corresponding to the general formula HS-CH(R1)-CH2-CH(R2)-CONH-CH(R3)-COOH, were designed in order to explore the putative S1 subsite of the active site of NEP. The inhibitors were also tested on ACE and the most representative on thermolysin (TLN) for comparison. The relatively low inhibitory potencies exhibited by these compounds (IC50S in the 10(-7) M range for NEP and in the 10(-6) M range for ACE) as compared to that of thiorphan (IC50S 2.10 x 10(-9) M on NEP and 1.40 x 10(-7) M on ACE) clearly indicate the absence of the expected energetically favorable interactions with the active site of both peptidases. A 100-fold loss of potency for these inhibitors was also observed for thermolysin as compared to thiorphan. Using the mutated Glu102-NEP, it was possible to demonstrate that the inhibitors do not fit the S1 subsite of NEP but interact with the S'1 and S'2 subsites through binding of their R1 and R2 residues and that the C-terminal amino acid is located outside the active site. These results seem to indicate that these thiol inhibitors are not well adapted for optimal recognition of the S1 subsite of NEP, and probably ACE, and that other zinc-chelating moieties such as carboxylate or phosphonate groups may be preferred for this purpose.", 
    "14": "A variety of compounds were prepared to determine whether dual angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/thromboxane synthase (TxS) inhibition could be obtained in the same molecule. These compounds would be used to explore the concept that a dual inhibitor would have superior antihypertensive activity in the spontaneous hypertensive rat compared to an ACE inhibitor. Potent in vitro dual ACE and TxS inhibition was obtained in the same molecule with five series of compounds. Potent blood pressure lowering in the SHR was observed after oral administration of 8b and 11. However, a correlation between blood pressure lowering and the A1 pressor response inhibition was not observed. The blood pressure-lowering actions of enalapril were significantly potentiated by concurrent administration of 3, a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Analysis of the area under the curve for 24 h showed nearly a doubling of the blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "15": "A prospective open clinical trial was carried out with 23 hypertensive type I diabetics (13 men, ten women, mean age 49 +/- 9.1 years, duration of diabetes 18 +/- 9.1 years) with early nephropathy. Glomerular and tubular renal function and metabolic parameters were monitored during 8 months' treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, in addition to previous antihypertensive treatment with one or more drugs. Blood pressure control tended to improve on captopril (systolic pressures 152 +/- 13 vs 140 +/- 13 mm Hg, P < 0.05; diastolic pressures 89 +/- 10 vs 87 +/- 10 mm Hg, not significant). Proteinuria (> 0.5 g/24 hours) fell into the microalbuminuria range (albumin excretion 2-20 mg/mmol creatinine) in four out of 13 patients, and microalbuminuria disappeared in four out of ten patients. Urinary levels of the brush border enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), a marker of tubular dysfunction, were initially raised and fell significantly after 8 months' treatment with captopril (20.3 +/- 14.4 vs 8.8 +/- 8.1 U/g creatinine; P < 0.01). Captopril did not affect metabolic control (HbA1, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B) or the insulin dosage. These results show that long-term treatment with captopril may favourably influence both albumin excretion and NAG activity, a marker of tubular dysfunction, in type I diabetics with nephropathy.", 
    "16": "In an open-label, randomized trial using a 3 x 3 Latin square design, single doses of 24 mg of the ACE inhibitor spirapril, or 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or their combination were given to 18 healthy male volunteers. No alteration in the area under plasma drug concentration curve (AUC), peak plasma level, time to peak level, or elimination half-life was detected for hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril, or its active metabolite, spiraprilat, during combination therapy. It was concluded that there was no significant effect of spirapril on single-dose kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide, nor of hydrochlorothiazide on single-dose kinetics of spirapril. Significant reductions in systolic blood pressure were noted 2--6 h after either spirapril or combination treatment, but no evidence of any synergistic effect of single-dose effects on blood pressure was seen during combination therapy.", 
    "17": "Previous experiments showed that acute administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ceronapril, shares with neuroleptic drugs an ability to enhance latent inhibition (LI), which consists of retardation in conditioning to a stimulus as a consequence of its prior non-reinforced pre-exposure. Experiment 1 tested whether ceronapril would produce a neuroleptic-like effect in the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) at one trial a day. The PREE refers to the increased resistance to extinction observed in animals trained on a partial reinforcement (PRF) schedule compared with those trained on a schedule of continuous reinforcement (CRF). Two groups of rats were trained to run in a straight alley. The CRF group received food reward on every trial. The PRF group was rewarded on a quasi-random 50% schedule. All animals were then tested in extinction in which no reward was given. Ceronapril at a dose of 0.05mg/kg was administered in a 2 x 2 design, with drug or no drug in acquisition and drug or no drug in extinction. Rats receiving vehicle in acquisition showed a PREE, regardless of their drug treatment in extinction. In contrast, ceronapril administered in acquisition attenuated the PREE irrespective of drug treatment in extinction, by both increasing resistance to extinction in CRF animals and decreasing resistance to extinction in PRF animals. This pattern of results does not resemble that produced by neuroleptics. The PREE procedure necessitated repeated administration of ceronapril whereas the previous demonstrations of neuroleptic-like enhancement of LI have been obtained with acute administration. Experiment 2 therefore tested the effects of chronic ceronapril administration on LI. Under these conditions, ceronapril abolished LI. The results are discussed in relation to the antipsychotic, anti-anxiety and cognitive-enhancing effects formerly attributed to ACE inhibitors.",

    "19": "Rat arterial muscle cells show an elevated Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux during the established phase of hypertension. This association of enhanced K+ efflux with high arterial pressure implies that changes of in vivo blood pressure can alter the level of K+ channel current in arterial membranes. We directly tested this hypothesis by comparing K+ current density between patch-clamped aortic muscle membranes of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and SHR treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (3.5 mg/kg per day PO) to normalize blood pressure. Peak macroscopic K+ current was measured during progressive depolarizing steps (10 mV) from -60 and +60 mV in cells dialyzed with pipette solution containing 10(-6) mol/L calcium to amplify Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current. With the use of this approach, maximum K+ current density in aortic muscle membranes of untreated SHR was 2.6-fold higher than in untreated WKY rats (SHR, 31 +/- 3 pA/pF; WKY, 12 +/- 1 pA/pF) and was predominantly blocked by 2 mmol/L tetraethylammonium. K+ current density in SHR aortic membranes was unchanged after 1 week of ramipril therapy, but it was reduced 42% (to 18 +/- 1 pA/pF) after 2 weeks of treatment. Parallel tension-recording studies showed that untreated SHR aortic segments but not aortic segments from WKY rats or ramipril-treated SHR constricted strongly after block of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels by tetraethylammonium. Our findings imply that Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current density in arterial muscle membranes shows a positive correlation with chronic arterial blood pressure levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "It has been reported that kinins mediate part of the beneficial cardiac effects induced by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in situations such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, it is not known whether the heart contains an independent kallikrein-kinin system. We measured kallikrein in tissue and in the incubation medium of heart slices. Heart slices released active and total (trypsin-activatable) kallikrein into the medium (46 +/- 5 and 380 +/- 18 pg bradykinin/mg, respectively, after 1 hour and 78 +/- 6 and 654 +/- 14 pg bradykinin/mg after 2 hours, n = 7). Release was not due to tissue damage because lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic marker, decreased from 8.9 +/- 2.9 to 2.9 +/- 1.0 U/mg per hour. Although kallikrein was released, total tissue kallikrein in the slices did not change (423 +/- 25 pg bradykinin/mg in nonincubated slices and 370 +/- 42 pg bradykinin/mg after 2 hours, P = NS), suggesting pool replenishment. Cardiac kallikrein activity was inhibited by incubation with anti-glandular kallikrein antibodies. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (10 mg IP) lowered release of active kallikrein from 78 +/- 6 to 22 +/- 4 pg bradykinin/mg and total kallikrein from 654 +/- 14 to 113 +/- 9 pg bradykinin/mg (P < .001). By using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with kallikrein family oligonucleotide primers and a specific kallikrein probe, we found that mRNA for tissue kallikrein is present in both atrial and ventricular RNA. Kallikrein activity was also detected in primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial and ventricular cardiocytes and their incubation medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "To determine whether chronic treatment with enalapril initiated early in life prevents glomerular injury secondary to normal aging, CF1 mice received enalapril (20 mg/L, n = 10) or nifedipine (40 mg/L, n = 10) in their drinking water from the time of weaning to 12 months of life. Control mice (n = 10) received tap water ad libitum. Immunocytochemical detection of renin confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition resulted in recruitment of renin-containing cells along the preglomerular vessels. Morphometric analysis of glomeruli included assessment of glomerular diameter and the percentage of mesangial area per glomerulus. Glomerular diameter and mesangial area were higher in control mice (99.7 +/- 0.5 microns, 12.7 +/- 0.3%) than in enalapril-treated mice (88 +/- 0.8 microns, 8.6 +/- 0.6%) (P < .05). Glomerular diameter and mesangial area in the nifedipine-treated group (99.1 +/- 0.9 microns, 12.4 +/- 0.9%) were not different from control mice. These results demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition prevents the glomerular enlargement and mesangial expansion observed during natural aging. In addition, control glomeruli expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin in a mesangial distribution. This effect was prevented by enalapril treatment but not by nifedipine. We conclude that long-term treatment with enalapril from early life prevents the early changes associated with glomerular injury and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in the glomerulus. alpha-Smooth muscle actin may participate in and serve as an early marker of the glomerular injury during the normal aging process.", 
    "22": "In hypertension, the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure, is increased in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Morphological studies suggest that it is not the quantity but rather the quality, or structure, of myocardium that confers such risk. Iterations in tissue structure that appear in hypertensive heart disease include a remodeling of intramyocardial coronary arterioles, similar to that found in systemic organs, and a disproportionate accumulation of fibrillar collagen within their adventitia and neighboring interstitial space. Microscopic scars replacing necrotic cardiac myocytes are also evident. These expressions of fibrosis appear in the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right and hypertensive, hypertrophied left ventricles and are linked to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Cardiac myocyte growth, the major determinant of myocardial mass, is related to ventricular loading. Mechanisms responsible for the reactive and reparative fibrosis with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation are under investigation. In vitro quantitative autoradiography has identified angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin, and bradykinin receptors in the myocardium. A nonendothelial tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme, whose binding density is marked in the matrix of heart valves, adventitia, and sites of fibrosis, irrespective of its pathogenic basis, has also been found. This angiotensin-converting enzyme may be responsible for regulating local concentrations of angiotensin II and bradykinin that govern fibroblast collagen turnover. Based on a paradigm of discordant reciprocal regulation, in which a relative abundance of stimulators (eg, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and endothelins) of collagen synthesis exceeds inhibitors (eg, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and glucocorticoids), fibrous tissue appears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Angiotensin I and II are generated by the vascular wall. Whether this generation depends on renin or on other enzymes is debated. We tested the hypothesis that remikiren, a highly specific inhibitor of human and guinea pig renin, may inhibit the vascular renin-angiotensin system. Isolated hindquarters from guinea pigs were perfused with an artificial medium, and angiotensin I and II release was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Guinea pig hindquarters released angiotensin I (23.8 +/- 5.6 fmol/30 min; n = 13) and angiotensin II (95.2 +/- 19 fmol/30 min; n = 13) spontaneously. Inhibition of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme by captopril (10 nmol/mL) suppressed angiotensin II by 85% and increased angiotensin I by 352% (n = 5, P < .05). Infusion of remikiren (1.6 nmol/mL) in addition to captopril decreased angiotensin I release by 68% (P < .05 versus captopril alone, n = 5 each). We conclude that renin generates angiotensin I in an isolated guinea pig resistance vessel bed. Our study demonstrates that renin rather than nonrenin enzymes is responsible for the major part of vascular angiotensin formation.",

This serine protease is also present in dog and marmoset vasculature. We examined the vasoconstrictor effects of Ang II putatively generated from an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-resistant convertase synthetic substrate (SUB) in vivo and in vitro. In marmosets, SUB (7 to 700 micrograms/kg i.v.) or Ang I (0.1 to 30 micrograms/kg) caused similar dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (10 to 100 mm Hg) and decreases in heart rate. Pressor effects of SUB were slightly attenuated at low (but not high) doses by captopril (CAP, 1 mg/kg i.v.) and blocked by losartan (5 mg/kg i.v.); in contrast Ang I pressor effects were substantially blocked by both. In isolated canine superior mesenteric artery, Ang I-induced contraction was eliminated by losartan and reduced but not eliminated by 10 mumol/L CAP. When combined with the serine protease inhibitor chymostatin, CAP eliminated Ang I-induced contraction, but chymostatin alone had no effect. SUB-induced contraction was not blocked by CAP but was equally blocked by chymostatin (25 mumol/L) alone or by the combination of CAP (10 mumol/L) and chymostatin (25 mumol/L); losartan (10 mumol/L) eliminated SUB-induced responses. Previous studies have suggested that Ang I-convertase is important for production of Ang II in the heart. Our results are consistent with a potential role for Ang I-convertase in the production of Ang II in the vasculature, resulting in Ang II-mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "25": "Angiotensin II receptor binding sites in type 1 interstitial cells in the inner stripe of the outer medulla are readily labeled in vitro by the radioligand but not in vivo after systemic radioligand administration. In anesthetized rats, we investigated if reduced vascular delivery due to angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction or, alternatively, prior occupancy of these sites by endogenous angiotensins modulates angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor binding to renal medullary interstitial cells in vivo using electron microscopic autoradiography. Using 125I-angiotensin II, administered systemically, as a radioligand, binding in control rats occurred predominantly in the glomeruli and proximal tubules, while only low binding was observed in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. Pretreatment of rats with unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II or with the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan before receiving the radioligand completely abolished binding to all sites. Renal vasodilatation induced by sodium nitroprusside or use of the radiolabeled antagonist analogue 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II did not alter binding to the inner stripe. In contrast, chronic salt loading or inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by perindopril significantly increased binding not only to the cortical sites but also to the sites in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. Electron microscopic autoradiographs of the inner stripe detected binding in the interstitial cells only in rats treated with chronic salt loading or perindopril. These results suggest that endogenous angiotensins may modulate binding of circulating angiotensin II to the interstitial cells in vivo, and these angiotensin II receptor-bearing cells are more likely to be more responsive to interstitial angiotensin II than to the circulating hormone.", 
    "26": "Chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition prevents endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Long-term treatment with cyclosporin A impairs endothelium-dependent relaxations and augments contractions to angiotensin II in the rat aorta. The present study compares vasomotor responses to several vasoconstrictor and dilator stimuli after 6 weeks of oral treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (10 mg/kg per day), the angiotensin subtype 1 receptor antagonist D 8731 (10 mg/kg per day), cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg per day), or a combination of cyclosporin A with lisinopril or D 8731 (n = 15 rats per group). Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, aortic rings were mounted in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and calcium ionophore were impaired by cyclosporin A but not affected by the vasodilators. Cyclosporin A-induced endothelial dysfunction was prevented by cotreatment with lisinopril or D 8731. Relaxations to nitroglycerin, SIN-1, and forskolin were not affected by any treatment. Contractions to phenylephrine and serotonin were reduced by lisinopril but not by D 8731. In contrast, contractions to angiotensin II were augmented by cyclosporin A, lisinopril, and the combination of both but not by D 8731 or D 8731 plus cyclosporin A. The data suggest a role for angiotensin II in cyclosporin A-induced endothelial dysfunction. Chronic ACE inhibition reduces overall smooth muscle contractility. The selective augmentation of angiotensin II effects by ACE inhibition and cyclosporin A suggests upregulation of angiotensin receptors in the aortic smooth muscle by these treatments. Chronic angiotensin subtype 1 receptor blockade does not appear to affect angiotensin receptor function.", 
    "27": "We have reported that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril attenuates the cardiovascular responses to bilateral carotid occlusion in conscious rabbits and proposed that the attenuation results from removal of a facilitatory action of angiotensin II on the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of carotid occlusion on renal sympathetic nerve activity in conscious rabbits and to investigate the effect of the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan on the cardiovascular and renal sympathetic nerve activity responses to carotid occlusion. In seven conscious, aortic depressor nerve-sectioned rabbits, carotid occlusion elicited prompt and reproducible increases in mean arterial pressure from 75 +/- 2 to 124 +/- 5 mm Hg (P < .001), heart rate from 285 +/- 8 to 317 +/- 9 beats per minute (P < .01), and renal sympathetic nerve activity to 165 +/- 11% of control (P < .01). In the same rabbits, losartan (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased mean arterial pressure by 9 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .01), increased renal sympathetic nerve activity to 143 +/- 13% of control (P < .05), but did not alter heart rate. Losartan significantly attenuated (P < .01) the mean arterial pressure (66 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 2 mm Hg), heart rate (282 +/- 9 to 289 +/- 7 beats per minute), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (143 +/- 13% to 159 +/- 15% of control) responses to carotid occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "We performed these studies to assess the potential role of hemodynamic forces in mediating the changes in aortic fibronectin mRNA expression that occur in the rat in response to angiotensin II administration. With the use of an acute hypertensive model involving a 3-day infusion with a pressor dose of angiotensin II given by osmotic minipump, a selective increase in fibronectin mRNA expression but not of several other extracellular matrix genes was documented. This change was inhibited by losartan, indicating the importance of angiotensin receptors in the response. Prazosin, hydralazine, or L-arginine added to the drinking water all lowered the angiotensin II-induced increase in blood pressure but did not attenuate the increase in fibronectin mRNA expression. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition using trandolapril did reduce fibronectin mRNA in the angiotensin II-infusion model, despite an inability to reduce blood pressure, whereas when angiotensin I was infused, quinapril lowered both blood pressure and fibronectin expression even at doses that did not completely normalize blood pressure. These studies suggest that angiotensin II induced an increase in aortic fibronectin mRNA that was not dependent solely on blood pressure.",

Newborn, 7-day-old, and 4-month-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used. SHR and WKY rat breeders were treated with captopril (0.4 mg/mL, 100 mg/kg per day) in drinking water, and their pups were maintained on captopril treatment until experimentation. Control groups were untreated, age-matched SHR and WKY rats. The density, affinity, and subtypes of renal Ang II receptors were determined using radioligand binding techniques and receptor antagonists specific for Ang II receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (losartan, an AT1-specific antagonist, and CGP 42112B, an AT2-specific antagonist). AT1 receptor density in kidneys was higher than AT2 receptor density in both neonatal and adult rats. AT1 receptor density in kidneys increased approximately twofold from birth to 7 days of age in all groups. Newborn and 7-day-old SHR showed significantly greater Ang II receptor densities in kidneys than other rat groups because of significantly greater densities of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. At 4 months of age, there were no significant differences in Ang II receptor densities in kidneys between captopril-treated and control SHR. Our data indicate that the expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors in kidneys is differentially regulated during development. Enhanced activity of the renal renin-Ang II system in newborn and probably fetal SHR may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "The relation between basal intrarenal hemodynamics and the renal response to acute inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril and albuminuria was assessed in 106 lean patients with essential hypertension without detectable proteinuria. It was observed that the microalbuminuric group (24.5% of the total population) was characterized by a higher systemic arterial pressure, a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and similar mean values of age, duration of hypertension, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, and plasma renin activity when compared with normoalbuminuric subjects. In response to captopril, a significant renal vasodilatation without a change in glomerular filtration rate or a fall in filtration fraction was observed in normoalbuminuric patients only. In contrast, the renal vasodilator response was abolished in microalbuminuric subjects, together with blunting of the rise in plasma renin activity associated with captopril. This occurred despite similar indexes of activity of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system. It is suggested that microalbuminuria may be a marker of early functional or fixed intrarenal vascular dysfunction in never-treated lean patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "31": "Lifetime treatment with oral captopril prevents the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We tested the hypothesis that this treatment also prevents the hypertensive response that occurs when untreated NaCl-sensitive SHR are placed on a high NaCl diet. Female SHR were continuously treated with oral captopril before conception and throughout lactation, and the offspring were similarly treated with oral captopril throughout life. At 6 weeks of age, treated male SHR were placed on an 8% (or remained on a 1%) NaCl diet, and systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, and body weight were monitored for 2 weeks. The 8% NaCl diet caused a rapid increase in arterial pressure in the lifetime captopril-treated rats, and 18 days after the initiation of the diet, the mean arterial pressure of this group was 136 +/- 7 mm Hg compared with 100 +/- 2 mm Hg in the 1% NaCl diet rats. The results of a second experiment confirmed the hypertensive effect of the high NaCl diet in lifetime captopril-treated SHR and demonstrated that after 18 days on the diet the dietary NaCl-induced hypertensive response was greater in magnitude in lifetime captopril-treated compared with untreated SHR. The results also demonstrated that lifetime captopril-treated Wistar-Kyoto rats, which are normotensive irrespective of captopril treatment, display no significant increase in arterial pressure when given a high NaCl diet. A third experiment demonstrated that rapidly progressing NaCl sensitivity is also present in female lifetime captopril-treated SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We designed the present study to examine the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on regional differences in the lower limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (either 10 mg/kg captopril or SQ 29,852 in saline) were intravenously injected 15 minutes before hemorrhagic hypotension was induced. Cerebral blood flows to the parietal cortex and thalamus were simultaneously measured by hydrogen clearance. Both captopril and SQ 29,852 significantly decreased mean arterial pressure by 14 to 18 mm Hg and also reduced calculated cerebral vascular resistance by 11% to 15% of resting values, which resulted in a well-maintained cerebral blood flow. The lower limits of autoregulation were 76 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) and 77 +/- 2% of resting values in the cortex and thalamus, respectively, in control rats. Administration of either captopril or SQ 29,852 significantly reduced the lower limits to 65 +/- 3% (P < .01 versus control) and 67 +/- 2% (P < .05), respectively, in the cortex, which were slightly but always larger than the 71 +/- 3% and 71 +/- 2% reduction, respectively, in the thalamus. The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme activities thus may be more protective against acute hypotension for cerebral microcirculation in the cortex than in the thalamus.",

This is done by reclaiming a greater fraction of filtered sodium and water and elevating systemic vascular resistance to keep perfusion pressure to vital organs constant despite diminished cardiac output.

    "64": "Potassium (K+) and angiotensin-II (Ang-II) are two distinct secretagogues for aldosterone release. However, a local adrenal renin-angiotensin system is present, and several studies suggest a complex interaction between K+ and locally produced Ang-II. First, superfusing zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells with K+ stimulates the secretion of both Ang-II and aldosterone. Second, K(+)-stimulated aldosterone secretion can be reduced in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not specific inhibitors of the adrenal renin-angiotensin system, we further tested the hypothesis that locally produced Ang-II participates in K(+)-stimulated aldosterone release from rat ZG cells by using a specific Ang-II antagonist. Although type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) Ang-II receptors are present in ZG cells, only AT1 antagonist has been shown to mediate Ang-II-induced aldosterone secretion. Losartan, a specific AT1 antagonist, was used in this study. In the presence of losartan (10 microM for 9 mM K+ and 100 microM for 5 mM K+), the average aldosterone secretion during 2 h of superfusion with 9 mM K+ and 5 mM K+ was 70.1 +/- 5.4% (n = 5) and 58.5 +/- 2.2% (n = 3), respectively, of that in its absence. Losartan did not alter the amount of Ang-II secreted. The inhibitory effect of losartan lasted longer than 60 min after it was terminated.

Twenty patients (14 males and 6 females; 25-57 years of age), after a six week drug wash-out phase, underwent 24h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) (Spacelabs 90207) and, the day after, maximal bicycle exercise testing. Patients then received a once daily treatment with fosinopril and ABPM and exercise testing were repeated 45-60 days later. Fosinopril decreased average 24h SBP and DBP (-13.5 mmHg and -9.7 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.002); a significant BP reduction was observed both in day and in nighttime, without alteration in diurnal BP profile. The antihypertensive effect was still evident 24h after dosing. Trough to peak ratio was 0.58 +/- 0.16. Fosinopril induced a reduction of SBP and DBP during exercise testing (-20 and -11 mmHg at baseline; -17 and -8 mmHg at peak exercise; -24 and -14 mmHg at the sixth minute of recovery; P < 0.002), with a slight prolongation of exercise time (+46 seconds, P = 0.041). These results indicate that fosinopril at a once daily dose of 20 mg provides a sustained 24h BP reduction associated with BP reduction during physical exercise.

Since the kidney plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, the effect of a low Ca diet (0.01%Ca) on blood pressure and pressure natriuresis response was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, a possible role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hypertension and an altered pressure natriuresis response resulting from low dietary Ca intake was investigated. In the low Ca diet group, systolic blood pressure determined by the tail-cuff method was significantly higher than in the normal Ca diet group (1.1%Ca) 1 week after the diet (113.0 +/- 7.1 vs. 105.0 +/- 9.5 mmHg, p < 0.05). Furthermore, low dietary Ca treatment significantly inhibited the water and sodium excretory responses to acute elevation of renal perfusion pressure. Treatment with an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, captopril (30 mg/kg/day), attenuated both the development of hypertension and the reduced pressure natriuresis response observed in Ca-deficient rats. Although plasma renin activity was not different between the low and normal Ca diet groups after the 2-week dietary regimen, the pressor response to angiotensin II injection was significantly greater in the low Ca diet group. These results indicate a possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hypertension and the inhibitory effects of the pressure natriuresis response caused by low dietary Ca intake, via enhanced sensitivity to angiotensin II.", 
    "67": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common chronic glomerulonephritis of unknown cause. Two factors are important in the pathogenesis of IgAN; one is IgA immune complex (IgA-IC) formation and the other is IgA-IC deposition to mesangium. For the formation of IgA-IC, antibody of IgA class, T-cells which help the generation of IgA antibody, and antigen are necessary. The serum IgA level in patients with IgAN is elevated probably due not only to the activation of B-cell but also to the hyperactivity of alpha beta chain positive T-cells. Analysis of the immunoglobulin gene of IgAN patients indicated that the genetic polymorphism could be correlated with the production of IgA antibody. The gamma delta chain positive T-cell may play some role for the formation of IgA-IC. Food, bacteria, viral proteins are reported to be the antigens of IgA-IC. Regarding to IgA-IC deposition, cytokines from T-cells and the molecular weight of IgA-IC are also indispensable factors. Clinically, long-term prognosis of IgAN are not unanimously the same. Approximately 15% patients progress to renal failure over a period of 10 years, and 25% to renal failure within 20 years. Roughly, patients can be classified into three groups in view of clinical course. First group maintains stable renal function for more than 20 years, second exhibits progressive course in more than 20 years and third progresses more rapidly than the second. Although the exact mechanism(s) governing the fate of renal function in IgAN is unclear, non-immunological factors, such as intraglomerular hypertension, are presumed to participate in its progression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Human inflammatory arthritides are characterized by synovial hypoperfusion, hypoxia and proliferation. We aimed to localize and characterize receptors for AII in human synovium. 2. We used quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography with [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII and [125I]-AII on human synovium from patients with chondromalacia patellae, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 3. [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII and [125I]-AII bound to similar sites on synovial blood vessels, lining cells and stroma. Binding to microvessels (< 100 microns diameter) was more dense than to arteriolar media, and vascular binding was more dense than that to lining cells and stroma. 4. Microvessels and arterioles which displayed angiotensin converting enzyme-like immunoreactivity also displayed specific binding of [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII. 5. Specific binding of [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII to each structure was completely inhibited by 10 microM dithiothreitol and was inhibited by unlabelled ligands with the rank order of potency (Sar1, Ile8)AII > AII > losartan = SKF108566 > PD123319 indicating an AT1 subclass of angiotensin receptor. 6. GTP gamma S (1 microM) abolished specific binding of [125I]-AII and abolished the high affinity component of the binding inhibition curve for AII against [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII, indicating G protein coupling. 7. The distribution of [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII binding sites was similar in all disease groups and no significant differences in binding densities, affinities or specificities were observed between disease groups. 8.

The group comprised 44 patients, incl. 16 with normal blood pressure and 28 with hypertension. All were at first given prednisone and cyclophosphamide--for an average of 18 months--and the patients with systemic hypertension conventional antihypertensive drugs. At the termination of treatment proteinuria in the whole group was significantly lower, while glomerular filtration was unaltered, i.e. normal. When the results in normotonic and hypertonic patients were evaluated separately, it was obvious that normotonic patients have a significantly lower proteinuria and a glomerular filtration significantly higher than hypertonic patients. After termination of immunosuppression the authors started to administer to all patients acetylsalicylic acid (1/4 tablet Anopyrin in 24 hours) and in hypertensive patients the conventional antihypertensive drugs were replaced by ACE inhibitors, combined in some with Ca channel blockers. Antiaggregation therapy persists now for more than three years, treatment with ACE inhibitors for more than two years. The results at the end of the investigation indicate that there is no significant difference between normotonic and hypertonic subjects. All have proteinuria lower than 2.0 g/24 hours, stabilized glomerular filtration and after 15 years of glomerulonephritis none of the patients suffers from chronic renal failure. The authors assume that combined immunosuppression, antiaggregation therapy and treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors can contribute to the stabilization of chronic glomerulonephritis.",

Therefore we investigated renal function by clearance and micropuncture techniques in dogs maintained either on normal or low-salt diet before and after ACE inhibition with an i.v. bolus of 0.1 mg/kg ramiprilat followed by an infusion of 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1. Subgroups each comprising six dogs were also treated with either HOE-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. In general, renal effects of ramiprilat were more pronounced in dogs fed on low salt than in those on normal diet.

In the actively treated groups, mean diastolic pressure was reduced during surgery and increases in heart rate and arterial pressure after surgical incision were attenuated. During operation, stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were significantly higher in the ramipril group. In contrast, beta 1, adrenergic block caused no significant changes in SV or CO.

Isolated detrusor strips from 11 patients were contracted by ANG I (1 microM) in the absence or presence of enalaprilat (10 microM), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI, 200 micrograms/ml), or both. The metabolic activity in detrusor membranes from four patients was studied separately using Hip-Gly-Gly or ANG I as a substrate, with or without various protease inhibitors. The contractile response to ANG I (1 microM) was depressed by enalaprilat from 66 +/- 22 (mean +/- SD) to 39 +/- 13% of the K+ (124 mM)-induced response (P < 0.01, n = 11), and the combination of enalaprilat and STI resulted in a further reduction in contractile amplitude to 25 +/- 14% (P < 0.01 vs. K+, and P < 0.05 vs. enalaprilat alone) and a significantly slower developing contraction with a time to peak of 3.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3 min for ANG I alone (P < 0.01). In detrusor membranes, a low ACE activity, inhibitable by captopril, was demonstrated by the formation of hippuric acid (0.70 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1) from the synthetic ACE substrate, Hip-Gly-Gly. However, the conversion of ANG I (166 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1) to ANG II was not affected by ACE inhibition, while serine protease inhibitors, e.g., STI and chymostatin, completely prevented ANG II formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The inhibitory effects of HOE 140, a novel bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, on pulmonary vascular and airway responses to bradykinin (BK) were investigated under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and ventilation and constant left atrial pressure in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung. Under baseline conditions, BK produced dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure without changing airway pressure. However, when pulmonary arterial pressure was raised to a high steady level, increases in pulmonary arterial pressure in response to BK were enhanced and BK then produced dose-related increases in airway pressure. Responses to BK were reproducible with respect to time and were not different when the inspired fraction of O2 was 0.21 or 0.95 and HOE 140 was 0.8 nM/ml (50 micrograms/kg) and decreased both pulmonary vascular and airway responses to the peptide. HOE 140 had no significant effect on pulmonary vascular responses to angiotensin II, serotonin, nitric oxide, sodium nitroprusside, albuterol, or pinacidil. Additionally, in these experiments, HOE 140 had no effect on the pulmonary arterial pressor response to ventilatory hypoxia. These results suggest BK has significant vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor effects that are mediated by B2 receptors and are dependent on the baseline level of tone in the airways and in the pulmonary vascular bed. The present results suggest that HOE 140 is a highly selective, BK B2 receptor antagonist in the pulmonary vascular bed of the rat. These data also suggest that HOE 140 may be a useful probe for studying the role of BK in the pulmonary vascular bed in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

Intralobar injections of ANG I, II, and III caused dose-related increases in lobar arterial pressure, whereas ANG (1-7) and ANG (3-8) (ANG IV) had modest pressor activity. ANG I, II, and III had similar activity and were more potent than norepinephrine and ANG (1-7) and ANG IV but less potent than the thromboxane A2 mimic, U-46619, in increasing lobar arterial pressure. The time course of responses to ANG I, II, and III was similar, and after administration of ANG receptor antagonists, DuP 532 and L-158,809, responses to ANG I, II, and III was reduced, whereas responses to norepinephrine, serotonin, and U-46619 were not altered. After administration of the ANG-converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, responses to ANG I were reduced. The converting-enzyme inhibitor enhanced pressor responses to ANG II and III but did not alter responses to norepinephrine, U-46619, or serotonin. Moreover, under elevated-tone conditions, pulmonary vasodilator responses to bradykinin were increased following administration of captopril, whereas vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and nitrovasodilators were not altered. These results demonstrate that ANG I, II, and III have similar pulmonary pressor activity and that responses are mediated by ANG II type 1 receptors.

Changes in hepatic and splenic vascular volumes were determined from organ diameters (sonomicrometry) at 15, 30, and 45 min after enalaprilat injection. Changes in vascular capacitance were assessed from organ pressure-diameter curves obtained during transient hepatic outflow occlusion. Thirty minutes after enalaprilat, hepatic volume was increased by 52 +/- 14 ml (P < 0.01), and portal and hepatic vein pressures were decreased from 10.2 +/- 0.9 to 8.7 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P < 0.01) and from 3.9 +/- 1.6 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 mmHg (P < 0.05), respectively. Splenic volume did not change. Enalaprilat shifted the hepatic pressure-diameter curve upward, resulting in a larger hepatic volume at any given pressure. Curve intercept was increased, suggesting an increase in unstressed vascular volume. Curve slope was unchanged. In conclusion, enalaprilat increased hepatic vascular volume during acute left ventricular failure in dogs. The pressure-diameter curve shift suggests a reduction in the smooth muscle tone of hepatic capacitance vessels.", 
    "90": "The nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) is hydrolyzed at multiple sites during a single passage through the rat pulmonary vascular bed. Hydrolysis of one bond, Arg1-Pro2, appears to be catalyzed by an aminoacylproline hydrolase called aminopeptidase P (AmP). To help clarify its role in BK degradation, we have characterized rat pulmonary AmP in vivo in terms of its ability to react with intravascular substrates, its saturability and its contributions to the inactivation of circulating BK. By using indicator dilution methodology, hydrolysis of tracer doses of the AmP substrate Arg-Pro-Pro-[3H]benzylamide ([3H]APPB) during a single transit through the pulmonary vascular bed was measured. Transpulmonary hydrolysis of [3H]APPB obeyed first-order enzyme kinetics and was inhibited by carrier substrate (APPB) and two alternative AmP substrates, BK and des-Arg9-BK. APPB, des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg1-BK, all capable of binding to AmP in vitro, potentiated hypotensive effects of BK injected i.v. A saturating dose of APPB, 2 mumol/kg, in coinjections with BK, potentiated effects of i.v. BK by about 4-fold when pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was active or inhibited completely. Complete inhibition of ACE potentiated blood pressure effects of i.v. BK by 40- to 120-fold. When both AmP and ACE were inhibited, the effects of i.v. BK were potentiated by up to 800-fold, and the hypotensive effects of BK injected i.v. on systemic mean arterial blood pressure were equivalent to effects of BK injected into the ascending aorta (i.a.); the BK i.v. and i.a. log dose-response curves were virtually superimposable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "91": "ACE inhibitors, as well as aminocephalosporins with peptide-like structures, are transported by the intestinal peptide carrier. We investigated the transport mechanism using intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbits and observed that enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and substrate of the peptide carrier, noncompetitively inhibited the uptake of cephradine, an aminocephalosporin and substrate of the peptide carrier, with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 2.6 mM when it was present on the cis side (outside) of the vesicles. By contrast, enalaprilat, cefadroxil and GlyPro competitively inhibited cephradine transport with Ki values of 5.4, 3.8 and 5.1, respectively. These results suggest the presence of an enalapril-specific inhibitory binding site on the peptide carrier. In addition, enalapril on the trans side (inside) of the vesicles inhibited the uptake of cephradine, suggesting an apparent reduction of carrier availability by a trapping mechanism. On the other hand, cefadroxil stimulated the uptake of cephradine in the trans experiment, consistent with the concept of countertransport. These findings reveal the uniqueness of enalapril regarding its mode of interaction with the peptide carrier(s) which has been of increasing interest regarding its role in the intestinal absorption of peptide-type drugs.",

Numerous synthetic substrates are known with which to measure the enzyme activity. A discontinuous method using hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine was tested and improved. The cleavage product, hippurate, reacts with cyanuric chloride to give a yellow complex which can be measured at 405 nm using a spectral line photometer. Enzyme activity, kinetic constants and activation energy are dependent on the chloride ion concentration. Optimal test concentrations are 1.1 mol/l potassium chloride and 3.0 mmol/l hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine at pH 8.3. Higher substrate concentrations effect an inhibition of the enzyme reaction. A Michaelis constant of 0.9 mmol/l was found with serum as enzyme source. An activation energy of 57 kJ/mol was obtained from the relation between the logarithm of velocity of enzyme reaction and reciprocal value of absolute temperature. Furthermore, a linear dependence on chloride ion concentration was observed. The histogram of the enzyme activities in sera from 146 healthy volunteers shows a non-gaussian distribution. The reference interval at 25 degrees C is characterized by a median of 24 units/l with the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles at 13 units/l and 42 units/l, respectively. The corresponding values at 37 degrees C are 27 units/l and 86 units/l with a median of 48 units/l. No significant sex and age dependence could be found. A potent ACE inhibitor such as captopril leads to a rapid decrease of the enzyme activity within 60 min after oral administration. In the following hours, the enzyme activity slowly increases.", 
    "101": "In heart failure, both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system play important pathophysiological roles, and the two systems may interact with each other, e.g., angiotensin II facilitating noradrenaline release. An abnormality in beta-adrenoceptor density (i.e., a decrease) occurs in clinical and pacing-induced heart failure. This observation together with the therapeutic effectiveness of converting-enzyme inhibitors in the management of patients with heart failure led to the current investigation. The aim was to explore the impact of chronic enalapril treatment on the status of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors in dogs paced (250 beats.min-1) to end-stage heart failure. Placebo or enalapril treatment (5 mg b.i.d.) commenced 1 week after the onset of ventricular pacing and continued until end-stage heart failure was reached. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity were assessed by radioligand binding with [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Left ventricular angiotensin II formation and noradrenaline concentration were measured. In addition, plasma renin activity and plasma noradrenaline levels were determined. The results showed that there was a significant increase in beta-adrenoceptor density following enalapril treatment compared with placebo in the heart-failure group. Enalapril did not change the beta-adrenoceptor density in the control animals. However, in both heart failure and control animals, enalapril caused an unexpected increase in Kd. Furthermore, in heart failure, enalapril caused a significant increase in myocardial angiotensin II formation. We conclude that enalapril prevents or reverses the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor abnormality seen in heart failure and promotes angiotensin II formation.",

    "107": "There is now little dispute that clinical tolerance of organic nitrates occurs, particularly when these drugs are used by themselves to treat patients with stable angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. Classical hypotheses of nitrate tolerance suggest the phenomenon to result from vascular depletion of critical sulfhydryl groups, which are necessary to bring about vasorelaxation from nitrates. While this mechanism of nitrate tolerance probably operates when isolated blood vessels are exposed to high concentrations of nitrate in vitro, there is little evidence to suggest that it contributes to clinical nitrate tolerance. Instead, emerging data suggest that nitrates can cause significant shifts in fluid distribution and secretion of neurohormonal factors that can modulate their vasorelaxant effects. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics in conjunction with nitrates may alleviate the development of tolerance, but the experience has not been universally favorable. Other receptor-effector systems that affect cardiovascular function, such as the adrenergic system, may also be affected by nitrate tolerance. The mechanisms of nitrate tolerance are therefore likely to be multifactorial, involving vascular biochemical changes, physiologic compensation, and possibly receptor regulation.", 
    "108": "Recent studies have strengthened the arguments for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the early postinfarct period. Those with clinically detectable heart failure, and hence at highest risk, will benefit most, as shown in the AIRE study, but those at lower risk with left ventricular dysfunction still have some benefit, theoretically through ventricular remodeling. In patients in the very early stages of acute myocardial infarction, three trials have shown discordant results. In CONSENSUS-II, intravenous enalaprilat followed by oral enalapril gave no benefit, rather causing excess hypotension and a possible increase in mortality. In ISIS-4 and GISSI-3, mortality improved by 0.46% and 0.8%, respectively, with risk reductions of 9% and 11%. Added transdermal nitrate in GISSI-3 gave a total reduction of 17%. In view of the risk of hypotension (20% in ISIS-4, compared with placebo 10%), very early ACE inhibition will probably only be used for selected patients. Logically, one target group would be those seen 7-24 hours after the onset of symptoms, particularly 7-12 hours, at which time captopril alone gave a reduction of 14.5% in risk. These mortality differences compare favorably with those recently found when comparing tPA and streptokinase in the GUSTO study.",

Regional wall motion abnormalities in left ventricular systolic function can be identified in the hyperacute period and generally persist in patients who complete a myocardial infarction.

Some infarct survivors are also prone to further progressive alterations in the shape and size of the left ventricle, a process that has been termed postinfarction ventricular remodeling. Although left ventricular remodeling appears to represent an adaptive process serving to preserve stroke volume (and cardiac output) following myocardial injury, the enlargement process may have undesirable long-term effects on global left ventricular function and on clinical prognosis. Fortunately, recent experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates that ventricular remodeling and its deleterious consequences may be preventable.", 
    "110": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective across the whole spectrum of heart failure from mild to severe but there are little data on the use of ACE inhibitors specifically in patients with postinfarct heart failure. Pharmacological properties that might potentially be relevant to the choice of drug after myocardial infarction include differences in metabolism, possession of a sulphydryl group, tissue binding, duration of action, and side effect profile. Of these duration of action is probably the most important, as longer acting drugs generally cause more prolonged first-dose hypotension that shorter acting agents and first-dose hypotension is a particular concern in the early postinfarct period. In the SAVE study captopril was effective in reducing mortality and delaying the onset of symptomatic heart failure after myocardial infarction. Similarly, ramipril reduced mortality in the AIRE study. In contrast, enalapril was largely ineffective in CONSENSUS II. These differences result largely from study design and do not indicate an inherent superiority of captopril or ramipril over enalapril. Nonetheless, a short-acting agent should probably be used for the initial dose in postinfarct heart failure to minimize the risks of prolonged hypotension. This aside, the choice of agent is far less important than appropriate patient selection and appropriate maintenance dosages.", 
    "111": "Twelve patients with ischemic heart disease had complete left and right catheterization before and after sublingual captopril. Hemodynamic measurements were ten (10) minutes apart and were monitored for thirty (30) minutes. The heart rate increased from 70 +/- 13 to 76 +/- 11 beats/minute (P = .04). There was no change in the arterial blood pressure, although the systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1500 +/- 400 to 1026 +/- 480 dynes-sec-cm-5 (P < .0001). The pulmonary artery pressure was increased 15 +/- 6 to 25 +/- 5mmHg (P = .005) and the pulmonary vascular resistance increased from 288 + 160 to 376 + 160 dynes-sec-cm-5 (P < .0001). The wedge pressure increased from 7 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 3 mmHg (P = .05). The cardiac output (CO) increased from 5.06 +/- 1.06 to 578 +/- 1.58 Lt/min. (P.05 =. The left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) increased from 128 +/- 40 to 145 +/- 37cc)P = .002), without change in the end systolic volume (ESV). The ejection fraction (EF) increased from 56 +/- 3 to 61 +/- 4% (P = .02). These pressure changes appeared at two (2) minutes and disappeared after thirty (30) minutes. The study shows that, sublingual captopril produces a transient elevation of the pulmonary artery pressure and resistance.", 
    "112": "BACKGROUND Many peptides now identified in the brain were previously thought of as exclusively peripheral hormones. Among those, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is not only found to be of great importance in peripheral vasomotor and electrolyte homeostasis but also acts as neurotransmitter or modulator in the central nervous system. Here we review a number of experiments performed by us pointing to a modulation effect of the RAS unrelated to its vasoactive mechanisms. The biochemical basis as well as the different methods employed will be described in detail. METHODS RAS enzyme activity within the different ocular structures were determined by means of fluorimetric measurements. Possible neurophysiological effects of the RAS on retinal function were established through electroretinographic in-vitro and in-vivo recordings. Immunocytochemical staining was employed to morphologically identify possible sites involved. RESULTS The performed fluorimetric measurements revealed highest Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) activity within the neuroretina. Electroretinographic experiments have shown that variation in angiotensin-II activity is followed by reversible, dose-dependent effects on inner retinal signals. Clear evidence was found by immunohistochemistry that there is a discrete subpopulation of angiotensin-positive cells in the inner retina. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that the Renin-Angiotensin-System has neuronal sources and is physiologically active in the mammalian retina not purely related to vasoactive mechanisms. The RAS effector hormone angiotensin-II might therefore be a putative neurotransmitter in a subpopulation of retinal neurons. Reported side-effects of vasoactive substances, such as ACE-inhibitors on the visual function might be explained hereby.", 
    "113": "Chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) results in interstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney. In this study we determined that enalapril ameliorates the increased production of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in the tubulointerstitium during UUO. The relative volume (Vv) of the tubulointerstitium measured by a point-counting method increased significantly at three or five days of UUO as compared to the contralateral kidney. Enalapril significantly blunted this increase at either three or five days. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that collagen type IV increased remarkably in both the tubular basement membrane (TBM) and the interstitial space at three or five days of UUO. Glomeruli did not show any change. Collagen types I and III were faintly stained in the control kidneys while they were obviously increased in the interstitial space of the obstructed kidney. We examined the expression of collagen type IV (COL IV) because this basement membrane matrix protein appeared to be a major ECM protein deposited in the tubulointerstitium of the obstructed kidney. Semiquantitative analysis of COL IV by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that enalapril reduced slightly (21%) but significantly (P < 0.01) the deposition of COL IV in the obstructed kidney. Measurement of cyanogen bromide peptides from the obstructed kidney by Western blotting showed an increase of COL IV. This increase was reduced slightly (20%) by enalapril. The level of COL IV mRNA measured by reverse transcription-PCR was very low or undetectable in the control and contralateral kidneys, while it was significantly increased in the obstructed kidney at three or five days of UUO. COL IV mRNA was abundant in glomeruli while it was almost undetectable in renal tubules in the control and contralateral kidneys. However, COL IV mRNA was increased in renal tubules but not in the glomeruli of the obstructed kidney. Enalapril treatment resulted in a 42% decrease (P < 0.01) in COL IV mRNA in the cortex and a remarkable decrease in the renal tubules of the obstructed kidney at five days. Enalapril treatment resulted in an 89% decrease in the number of infiltrating ED-1 positive monocytes/macrophages. These results indicate that enalapril treatment ameliorates the tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney in UUO. This effect of enalapril on fibrosis may be due to the severe reduction in monocytes/macrophages capable of secreting the profibrotic factor TGF-beta 1.", 
    "114": "We have shown that acute (24-hr) unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) induces the genes encoding for renin, in juxtaglomerular apparatuses and in tubules, for angiotensin converting enzyme in vascular endothelial cells, and for angiotensinogen in perivascular fat. These molecular changes occur in temporal association to marked reductions in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), suggesting that angiotensin II (Ang II) is at least partly responsible for the renal vasoconstriction. We tested the hypothesis that down-regulation of the Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1-R) gene occurs in UUO in response to Ang II, by examining the effects of an ACE inhibitor [lisinopril (Li), 5 mg/kg/day] and of the specific nonpeptidic AT1-R blocker, losartan (Lo) (10 mg/kg/day). UUO or sham operated (which included manipulation but not obstruction of the ureter) rats (S) were studied. Northern blot analysis of the steady state concentration of AT1-R mRNA corrected for GAPDH mRNA showed a marked decrease in receptor expression (-77%, N = 4, P < 0.01) in the obstructed kidney (UUO) compared to S; sham diminished gene expression modestly compared to the contralateral kidneys (C) of UUO. In situ hybridization for AT1-R mRNA also showed diminished expression in UUO compared to C kidneys (N = 4). Treatment of UUO rats (N = 4) with Lo increased AT1-R mRNA five times above the levels in UUO rats receiving vehicle; the increase induced by Li was 50% that of Lo; S (N = 4) and C (N = 4) did not change. Losartan, but not vehicle treatment increased RBF (sixfold) and GFR (fivefold) in the UUO kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "115": "This study examines the effects of dietary protein and of uninephrectomy on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the normotensive rat, with particular regard to the kidney. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were fed isocaloric diets containing 5, 16 or 50% protein for three weeks. Other groups of rats were subjected to either left unilateral nephrectomy or sham operations, and the rats were killed eight days after surgery. ACE activity was measured in the kidney medulla, cortex, proximal tubule brush border membrane and in the plasma, heart and lung. Renal cortex and brush border ACE activity increased in parallel with protein intake, whereas plasma and lung ACE activity decreased; heart and kidney medulla ACE activity did not vary significantly. Uninephrectomy also led to a high increase in brush border ACE activity in the contralateral kidney, with no effect in the renal medulla or in the other tissues. The increase in ACE activity in the brush border membrane corresponded to a similar increase in the maximum number of binding sites of 3H-ramiprilat. This suggested that the increase in ACE activity corresponded to an increase in ACE concentration. The increase in renal tubular ACE activity could result in higher angiotensin II levels, and could consequently play a role in the modification of sodium reabsorption and cellular growth which occurs in the proximal tubule in these experimental models.", 
    "116": "The progression of diabetic nephropathy can be positively influenced by maintaining a low blood pressure level. This has been shown in studies with conventional antihypertensive treatment as well as with ACE inhibitors. Whether the latter group of drugs is more effective remains to be proven and was the aim of our study. In a prospective randomized study we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on retarding progression of renal function in IDDM patients with an early stage of overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, 15 were randomized for treatment with captopril and 14 for atenolol. Every 6 weeks blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured. GFR was measured every 6 months as 51Cr-EDTA clearance. Baseline values for blood pressure, renal function and albuminuria were identical in the two groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different. In the captopril-treated patients MAP before and after 2 years was 110 +/- 3 (SEM) and 100 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively and in the atenolol-treated patients 105 +/- 2 vs 101 +/- 2 mm Hg. Both drugs reduced albuminuria and total proteinuria to the same extent. With captopril albuminuria decreased from 1549 (989-2399) to 851 (537-1380) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 2.5 (1.6-3.8) to 1.2 (0.8-1.8) g/24 h. With atenolol albuminuria decreased from 933 (603-1445) to 676 (437-1047) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 1.5 (1.0-2.4) to 0.9 (0.6-1.5) g/24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "117": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dihydropyridine calcium antagonist isradipine on left ventricular (LV) structure and function in patients with essential hypertension. Cuff blood pressure and Doppler echocardiographic variables were assessed in 26 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure range 95-110 mmHg) before and after 12 weeks of therapy with either isradipine 5 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily. The study was of double-blind, parallel design, with a placebo run-in period of 15 days. Three subjects withdrew from isradipine treatment because of flushing and 2 from enalapril treatment due to cough before completing the study. Both drugs significantly reduced cuff systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate. By virtue of the decrease in both septal wall (p < 0.01) and posterior wall thicknesses (p < 0.05), isradipine treatment produced a significant reduction in LV mass adjusted for height (p < 0.001) in comparison with placebo; also LV end-systolic dimension showed a slight decrease (p < 0.05). Enalapril induced a similar reduction in LV end-systolic dimension (p < 0.05) but the changes of wall thickness and LV mass did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, our results indicate that isradipine treatment improves LV systolic function and causes a significant reduction in LV mass. This reduction is observed early in the course of antihypertensive treatment and is effective in both patients with and without LV hypertrophy.",

Discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor results in rapid alleviation of the cough, although this is not always necessary, as most patients may experience a cessation or decrease in cough. We report a case of cough following the administration of quinapril, with complete resolution after changing to the alternative ACE inhibitor fosinopril in a patient with essential hypertension.",

    "123": "1. The effect of induced water absorption on the intestinal permeability of antipyrine, atenolol and enalaprilat in the proximal jejunum was studied in eight healthy subjects with a regional intestinal perfusion technique. 2. The mean (+/- s.d.) net water flux changed from a secretory status of 1.2 +/- 1.2 ml h-1 cm-1 to an absorptive status of -3.7 +/- 3.5 ml h-1 cm-1 (P < 0.0025) on the introduction of a hypo-osmolar glucose-containing electrolyte solution. 3. The mean permeability values for the three drugs in the eight subjects were unchanged despite the increase in net water absorption (5.7 +/- 3.0 to 7.0 +/- 3.6 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for antipyrine, 0.1 +/- 0.2 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for atenolol and 0.3 +/- 0.3 to 0.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for enalaprilat). One subject showed a large change in the permeability for antipyrine and atenolol in parallel with a large increase in water absorption, but enalaprilat was unaffected. 4. The luminal recovery of PEG 4000 was similar before (100 +/- 4%) and during (101 +/- 7%) induction of water absorption, which indicates that the barrier function of the intestine appears to be maintained during glucose-stimulated fluid absorption in man. 5. We conclude that induced net water absorption in man does not influence the paracellular permeability of hydrophilic drugs or drugs with high molecular weight to any significant extent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "124": "We compared the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril to those of selective beta-blockade with atenolol and calcium channel blockade with verapamil in 10 hypertensive subjects in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. All antihypertensive agents reduced baseline mean arterial pressure equally and did not modify forearm vascular resistance compared to placebo. In response to sustained handgrip exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular resistance during handgrip, whereas quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo. It is concluded that quinapril and verapamil reduce the pressor response during isometric exercise by quantitatively different effects on the vasoconstrictor response in, as well as outside of, skeletal muscles.", 
    "125": "We developed an in vitro autoradiographic method to localize and quantify active renin in primate tissues. Active renin in monkey kidney sections was labeled with the primate specific renin inhibitor, 3H-CGP29287, and quantitated with autoradiography and computerized densitometry. Microscopic emulsion autoradiography was carried out to clarify the detailed localization of the binding. Non-specific binding to aspartyl proteases other than renin was blocked using 1 mumol/L of N-acetyl-pepstatin. To assess the usefulness of this procedure, binding of 3H-CGP29287 was examined both by film and emulsion autoradiography in the kidneys of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) that were given chronically either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (E4177), or vehicle. 3H-CGP29287 was found to bind very selectively to the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) under control conditions. In monkeys treated with trandolapril or E4177, 3H-CGP29287 binding was increased in proportion to the increase in renal renin concentration determined enzymatically; in these kidneys, emulsion autoradiography revealed radioinhibitor binding extending far from the JGA. The potency of a series of unlabeled renin inhibitor in competing for 3H-CGP29287 binding in the autoradiographic system closely paralleled their potencies, as determined in inhibiting renin by an enzymatic assay. This technique permits specific labeling of the catalytic site of renin in the monkey kidney sections.", 
    "126": "Numerous factors may influence an individual patient's response to antihypertensive therapy. The physician should select therapy that is more likely to effectively control the patient's blood pressure. In addition to age and race, specific properties of the drugs plus the method of administration can influence response. Most antihypertensives can be given once or twice daily without the need for sustained-release dosage forms. The appropriate selection of regular-release products can significantly reduce the cost of therapy and improve adherence to the regimen. Because most antihypertensives exist as isomers of two compounds, response to a given agent can be influenced by the type of product (eg, sustained-release) or the method of administration. When these variables are considered for individual patients, it is more likely that a given drug will be effective.",

We used the kinin antagonist HOE 140 to investigate the role of endogenous kinins in the acute antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in chronic and acute renal hypertensive rats. 2. In normotensive rats, treatment with HOE 140 (33 micrograms/kg, sc) caused a complete blockade of the depressor effect of bradykinin (100 ng, ia) without affecting the depressor effect of sodium nitroprusside (1 microgram, i.v.) or the basal blood pressure. 3. HOE 140 treatment (33 micrograms/kg, sc, plus 330 ng/min, i.v.) did not affect basal blood pressure of chronic (6-7 weeks) one-kidney, one clip and two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and in rats with acute hypertension, elicited by unclamping the renal pedicle that had been occluded for 5 h, but HOE 140 completely blocked the hypotensive response to bradykinin (100 ng, ia) during the 60-min period after enalapril administration (2 mg/kg, i.v.). 4. Acutely hypertensive rats treated or not with HOE 140 (33 micrograms/kg, sc, plus 330 ng/min, i.v.) presented a similar fall in blood pressure after enalapril (165 +/- 5 to 137 +/- 6 mmHg and 166 +/- 5 to 136 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively). 5. Untreated two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats presented a rapid and sustained fall in blood pressure after enalapril (177 +/- 4 to 148 +/- 4 mmHg) that did not differ from the HOE 140-treated (33 micrograms/kg, sc, plus 330 ng/min, i.v.) group (177 +/- 6 to 154 +/- 4 mmHg). 6. One-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats treated with HOE 140 (33 micrograms/kg, sc, plus 330 ng/min, i.v.) showed a significantly smaller fall in blood pressure after enalapril (204 +/- 7 to 179 +/- 9 mmHg) compared to the untreated rats (197 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 2 mmHg). 7.

After 2-4 weeks of placebo run-in period, patients received active treatment for 3 months starting with 4 mg perindopril once daily. Dose titration was at second and third month of active treatment if the supine DBP was > 90 mmHg. The dose was doubled and if necessary, 50 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide was added in the last month.

At the end of the study, 80 per cent of the patients showed normalisation of the supine diastolic blood pressure (supine DBP < or = 90 mmHg) with 30 per cent receiving combined therapy of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no significant change in routine haematology or serum biochemistry except for slight increase of potassium levels in patients receiving 8 mg perindopril monotherapy. The incidence of side effects and withdrawal from treatment were quite low. Cough was the major side effect reported comprising 13.6 per cent with only 1 case withdrawn.

    "130": "Treatment with ACE inhibitors has improved the prognosis of cardiac failure (CF). The results of CONSENSUS I, SOLVD and V HEFT II show clinical improvement and longer survival with this therapeutic class of drugs. However, the search for the optimal dosage was not undertaken in these trials (a standard dose was fixed at the onset, average dose of enalapril from 15 to 20 mg/day). In clinical practice, patients are prescribed lower doses of ACE inhibitors (enalapril: 7.5 mg/day) than the averages used in large scale trials. In order to optimise the use of ACE inhibitors, the ATLAS study (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival) was undertaken with the precise objective of comparing two dosages (2.5 to 5 mg/day vs 32.5 to 35 mg/day) of lisinopril on the morbidity and mortality of patients with CF.

    "131": "The objective of classical treatments of cardiac failure (diuretics, digitalis) was to relieve patients' symptoms. Vasodilators and ACE inhibitors also improve morbidity and mortality. The introduction of the latter class of drugs for cardiac failure will, however, lead to a significant increase in the cost of medication at national level. These costs may increase even further in theory due to a predictable increase in the number of patients with cardiac failure (ageing of the general population, improved survival of cardiac patients) and due to the extension of prescription of these drugs to populations of subjects with cardiac failure hitherto relatively undertreated. On the other hand, economies may be realised in the management of cardiac failure related to fewer and shorter hospital admissions and reduced indirect costs or to the suppression of previous, less useful drugs (calcium antagonists, digitalis). Cost-effective analyses with ACE inhibitors carried out in different countries (Canada, netherlands) tend to show that the costs induced by prescription of these drugs are more than compensated by the economies realised by the reduction in hospital admissions. This is even more marked in the treatment of patients with severe cardiac failure. In subjects at low risk, the prescription of ACE inhibitors would not seem to be justified from both the clinical and economic points of view. It is up to each physician to decide the threshold of basic risk below which this treatment becomes \"economically\" acceptable.", 
    "132": "Myocardial hypertrophy is an established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beyond quantitative and mechanical aspects hypertrophy is associated with alterations in cardiac gene expression, resulting in a more fetal-like myocyte phenotype with a fragile Ca++ homeostasis. Depressed expression of sarcoplasmatic reticulum ATPase is the hallmark of this overload phenotype. Conversely, the gene expression and the activity of sodium calcium exchanger is up-regulated in endstage heart failure. Both alterations contribute to prolonged cytosolic Ca++ transients, disturbed relaxation and, probably, to electrophysiologic instability. Angiotensin II is a growth promoting agent and several lines of circumferential evidence suggest that the local formation of angiotensin II might contribute to the trophic response and phenotype shift in cardiac overload. The cardiac gene expression of angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensinogen is increased early after cardiac overload and in patients with severe heart failure. Chronic ACE inhibition suppresses plasma and tissue ACE activity, reduces LV hypertrophy and improves long-term survival. The hallmark of the peripheral adaptation in chronic heart failure is systemic vasoconstriction, associated with neurohumoral activation. Several mechanisms are involved in the impaired peripheral perfusion, including increased sympathetic tone and increased vascular stiffness. Recently, data suggest an important role of the endothelium for perfusion of skeletal muscle in heart failure. Endothelium-dependent dilation of resistance vessels is blunted in patients with severe chronic heart failure. Conceivably, this abnormality may be involved in the impaired reactive hyperemia in patients with chronic heart failure. Moreover, alterations of skeletal muscle emerge in chronic heart failure contributing to reduced exercise performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "133": "The recently published \"Survival and Ventricular Enlargement\" (SAVE), prospective controlled trial over 4 years including over 2,000 patients, has shown that long-term treatment with captopril reduced cardiovascular mortality (- 19%) and morbidity in patients with post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction without signs of cardiac failure. Based on the trial data, the extra cost of treating the patients with captopril compared with the placebo branch is estimated at 9.3 million french francs. This expense is compensated by a reduction in the cost of hospitalisation for cardiac failure of 1.6 million francs and a reduction in the cost of further coronary events of 3.4 million francs. Above all, the extra cost is compensated by a gain of 47 deaths avoided, corresponding to about 493.5 years of life saved. The cost-effectiveness of captopril administration is therefore about 8.750 francs per year per life saved. The ratio is significantly less than that of other primary or secondary prevention therapeutic strategies. On this basis, we conclude that captopril therapy of high risk post-infarction patients is a solution that is not only medically effective but also economically sound.",

Tranilast was added to culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cultures were pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine (TdR) or 3H-proline (Pro). TdR and Pro uptake into VSMC were measured. The effect of tranilast on migration of VSMC was examined by using culture dishes of an original design. We also examined the inhibitory effects of various drugs, such as a Ca antagonist, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, elastase, colchicine, and mitomycin C, on proliferation and migration of VSMC. Our data showed that the inhibitory effects of tranilast on migration and proliferation of, and collagen synthesis by, VSMC were prominent. Maximal percentage inhibition of proliferation, migration and collagen synthesis was 60.8 +/- 2.3%, 52.7 +/- 14.7% and 62.1 +/- 8.1%, respectively. On the other hand, the inhibitory effects of other drugs, with the exception of colchicine and mitomycin C, on proliferation and/or migration of VSMC were not very strong. Although the inhibitory effects of colchicine and mitomycin C were strong in vitro, their clinical usefulness may be limited by systemic side-effects. These results indicate the potential usefulness of tranilast for prevention of restenosis of coronary arteries after PTCA.",

To evaluate the effects of the novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril on these exercise-related responses, we studied 9 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. After a week of perindopril 4 mg orally daily or placebo therapy, volunteers performed a treadmill effort test; the sequence was repeated after a 1-week washout period. Perindopril caused a significant reduction in mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) without increasing resting heart rate (HR); 15-min post-exercise SBP was also significantly reduced. There were no significant differences between the perindopril and placebo effort tests with respect to metabolic indexes studied (serum K+, plasma glucose, plasma free fatty acids) or plasma hormonal concentrations measured (ACTH and cortisol, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI), glucagon and insulin, growth hormone and prolactin, renin activity). In the perindopril arm of the study, however, there were modest but significant increases in mean serum K+ before exercise to immediately after exercise (0.4 +/- 0.1 mM, p < 0.01) and mean plasma glucose from before exercise to 5 min (0.6 +/- 0.2 mM, p < 0.01) and 15 min (0.5 +/- 0.2 mM, p < 0.05) after exercise. These data show that perindopril does not impair the hormonal changes associated with exercise in healthy subjects but induces a more consistent increase in blood K+ and glucose concentrations.", 
    "136": "We examined the effect of non-antihypertensive doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, kinins, and/or nitric oxide on left ventricular hypertrophy in rats with aortic coarctation. We investigated the effect of either HOE 140, a specific B2 receptor antagonist, or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, on the antihypertrophic effect of ramipril at non-antihypertensive doses (10 micrograms/kg per day) failed to alter left ventricular hypertrophy significantly, although a small decrease was obtained. Given at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks, ramipril prevented increased blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy after aortic coarctation. Neither of these effects was blocked by simultaneous administration of HOE 140 (500 micrograms/kg per day). In rats with aortic coarctation treated with L-NAME, blood pressure increased further but left ventricular weight did not. Ramipril (1 mg/kg per day) significantly reduced left ventricular hypertrophy, although blood pressure was still higher than in rats given water alone. The slope of the correlation between left ventricular weight and blood pressure in rats that received L-NAME was significantly lower than in rats that did not (0.52 versus 1.29; P = .008). This suggests that for each 1 mm Hg that the blood pressure increased, the increase in left ventricular weight was less in the L-NAME groups. Thus, only antihypertensive doses of ramipril possessed antihypertrophic activity. Kinins did not participate in the chronic antihypertensive and antihypertrophic effects of ramipril. In hypertension induced or aggravated by chronic nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME partially impaired development of left ventricular hypertrophy for reasons that are unclear.", 
    "137": "The aim of this study was to assess the existence of mechanisms regulating the intensity and duration of action of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the main candidate inhibitory transmitter released from capsaicin-sensitive afferents in the guinea-pig ureter. In a first series of experiments, performed in capsaicin-pretreated ureters, exogenously administered human alpha CGRP (h alpha CGRP) produced inhibition of contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ureter evoked by direct electrical stimulation of smooth muscle. The intensity and duration of the inhibitory effect of h alpha CGRP were potentiated by the inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase, thiorphan, while captopril and bestatin were without effect. In a second series of experiments, background motility of the guinea-pig ureter was evoked by administration of endothelin-1 (ET-1): electrical stimulation of intramural nerves produced a transient suppression of the ET-1-evoked contractions, ascribable to release of endogenous CGRP. Thiorphan enhanced the inhibitory effect produced by endogenous CGRP, while bestatin and captopril were without effect. These findings demonstrate that a thiorphan-sensitive mechanism, presumably neutral endopeptidase, regulates the intensity and duration of the inhibitory activity of both exogenous and endogenous CGRP in the guinea-pig ureter. The existence of a mechanisms for inactivation of the released peptide is consistent with the proposed role of CGRP as inhibitory neurotransmitter in this preparation.", 
    "138": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a type I glycoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic domain near its carboxyl terminus. The enzymatically active extracellular domain of ACE is slowly released from the cell by cleavage-removal of its membrane-anchoring carboxyl-terminal region. In the present study, we investigated the role of N- and O-glycosylation in intracellular transport and extracellular cleavage-secretion of rabbit testicular ACE. For ACE expression, we used an in vitro translation system, a permanently transfected mouse cell line, and human and Chinese hamster cells transiently transfected with vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase-driven expression vectors. Sugar modifications of ACE were analyzed by testing its sensitivity to specific glycosidases. Cellular protein glycosylation was inhibited by using chemical inhibitors and a mutant cell line defective in protein glycosylation. Our experiments demonstrated that newly synthesized ACE acquires both N- and O-linked sugars before its cleavage-secretion and complete blockage of glycosylation results in rapid intracellular turnover of underglycosylated ACE. However, ACE synthesized without N-linked complex sugars and O-linked sugars can undergo normal transport and cleavage-secretion, and the underglycosylated protein is enzymatically active.",

    "140": "Adopting a societal viewpoint, we designed a decision analytic model to analyze the costs and effectiveness of three therapies available for the treatment of congestive heart failure: standard therapy (digoxin and diuretic therapy) plus (1) no vasodilator agents, (2) hydralazine hydrochloride-isosorbide dinitrate combination, and (3) enalapril. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses to determine which model variables were influential in determining incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost of drug, cost of hospitalization, efficacy of agents, etc). We used data from three major randomized controlled trials to estimate treatment efficacy, mortality rates, and hospitalization rates.", 
    "141": "An additional year of life gained by a patient receiving hydralazine-isosorbide combination therapy compared with standard therapy required an additional expense (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) of $5600. Compared with the hydralazine-isosorbide combination therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for enalapril therapy was $9700 per year of life saved. These results were insensitive to wide variations in our baseline assumptions.", 
    "142": "The cost per year of life saved by vasodilator therapy is much lower than that of other accepted medical therapies. Although the cost per year of life saved for hydralazine-isosorbide combination therapy is lower than that for enalapril therapy, enalapril therapy saves more lives, and the incremental cost of enalapril therapy is justified by the added benefits.",

The most frequently used 0.01% solution of sodium nitroprusside must be increased in some patients to amounts which involve the risk of intoxication. This applies to patients with an increased sympathoadrenal activity and ready mobilization of the renin-angiotensin system. The objective of the present investigation was to test the inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme in hypotension controlled by nitroprusside.", 
    "144": "To twenty patients before a spondylosurgical operation as premedication angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE)--captopril--was administered, 25 mg by the oral route. The control group was formed by 20 patients with spondylosurgery under controlled hypotension with nitroprusside administration. The effect of captopril was manifested by a reduced amount of nitroprusside needed to maintain the median pressure of 8 kPa; in the captopril group 1.073 +/- 0.52 microgram.kg-1.min-1 was used, as compared with 1.786 +/- 1.04 micrograms.min-1 in the control group (p < 0.01). Concurrently monitored values of plasma renin activity were higher in the patients given captopril: 7.352 +/- 5.75 nmol.l-1, as compared with 5.583 +/- 3.73 nmol.l-1 (p < 0.05).",

This finding is the first demonstration of an intrinsic action of des-Asp-angiotensin I and, together with earlier finding of its increased production in the hypothalamus of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, may support the suggestion that the nonapeptide is a functional angiotensin that regulates the pressor action of angiotensin II and angiotensin III in the brain.",

    "148": "GISSI-3 is a multicentre randomised clinical trial to assess the efficacy of lisinopril, transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), and their combination in improving survival and ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Between June, 1991, and July, 1993, 19,394 patients were randomised from 200 coronary care units in Italy. Eligible patients presented within 24 h of symptom onset and had no clear indications for or against the study treatments. In a factorial design patients were randomly assigned 6 weeks of oral lisinopril (5 mg initial dose and then 10 mg daily) or open control as well as nitrates (intravenous for the first 24 h followed by transdermal GTN 10 mg daily) or open control. Complete clinical data and 6-week follow-up were available for 18,895 (97.4%) patients randomised. Two-dimensional echocardiographic data were available for 14,209 patients. Overall 6-week mortality was 6.7%. Lisinopril, started within 24 h from AMI symptoms, produced significant reductions in overall mortality (odds ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) and in the combined outcome measure of mortality and severe ventricular dysfunction (0.90 [0.84-0.98]). In the same trial the systematic administration of transdermal GTN did not show any independent effect on the same outcome measures (0.94 [0.84-1.05] and 0.94 [0.87-1.02]). Systematic combined administration of lisinopril and GTN also produced significant reductions in overall mortality (0.83 [0.70-0.97]) and in the combined endpoint (0.85 [0.76-0.94]). The favourable effect of lisinopril alone or with GTN was clear also in the predefined high-risk populations (elderly patients and women) for the combined endpoint. These findings were obtained in a population intensively exposed to recommended treatments (thrombolysis 72%, beta-blockade 31%, and aspirin 84%); non-protocol treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and nitrates was allowed for specific clinical indications. No excess of unfavourable clinically relevant events in the treated groups was reported.", 
    "149": "The overflows (i.e., veno-arterial concentration differences multiplied by plasma flow) of angiotensin-(1-10) decapeptide (ANG I) and angiotensin-(1-8) octapeptide (ANG II) from blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ were studied. Special precautions were taken to minimized ex vivo generation and/or degradation of angiotensins in the sampled blood. ANG I was found to be generated in the catheter system supplying the gracilis muscle with arterial blood, but plasma renin activity and ANG II levels were uninfluenced by the catheter system. A positive venoarterial concentration difference over the muscle itself was found for ANG II but not for ANG I under basal conditions. Isoprenaline elicited vasodilatation, reduced ANG I overflow, and tended to increase ANG II overflow, whereas beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol had no effect on these variables. In conclusion, we found no evidence for a local de novo synthesis of ANG II from the gracilis muscle vasculature in vivo. The net overflow of ANG II was most likely caused by local conversion in the tissue of ANG I artifactually generated in the arterial catheter system. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation enhanced the local conversion of ANG I to ANG II, probably by exposing a greater endothelial surface containing angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "150": "To investigate the prolonged effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on intrarenal hemodynamics, whole kidney and renal micropuncture studies were performed in male 21-wk-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats treated for 3 wk with quinapril (3 mg/kg), terazosin (1 mg/kg), or in their combination (quinapril 1.5 mg/kg and terazosin 0.5 mg/kg). In WKY, only quinapril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) associated with reduced afferent arteriolar resistance; there were no other significant changes. In contrast, all treatments similarly decreased MAP in SHR. Quinapril increased renal plasma flow and decreased filtration fraction. With respect to intrarenal hemodynamics, quinapril increased single-nephron plasma flow and reduced glomerular capillary pressure (from 53.1 to 47.8 mmHg; P < 0.01), associated with reduced afferent (from 4.80 to 3.17 10(10)dyn.s.cm-5; P < 0.01) and efferent (from 1.70 to 1.17 10(10)dyn.s.cm-5; P < 0.01) arteriolar resistances, and increased ultrafiltration coefficient (from 0.037 to 0.052 nl.s-1.mmHg-1; P < 0.05). Terazosin only reduced arteriolar resistance. The combined treatment attenuated either agent's independent effects on glomerular hemodynamics. These data demonstrate that prolonged ACE and adrenergic inhibition therapy alone or in combination produce different effects than when given by vein, suggesting that prolonged renopressor system inhibition may be more effective than adrenergic in SHR.", 
    "151": "To investigate the potential modulating influence of angiotensin II (ANG II) on sympathetic activity in response to changes in baroreflex activity, renal and total norepinephrine (NE) spillover rates were examined during sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and phenylephrine (PE) infusions in four groups of conscious rabbits: 1) saline (control); 2) subpressor ANG II (ANG II, 2 ng.kg-1.min-1); 3) enalaprilat (MK-422, 200 micrograms/kg and 3.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1); and 4) MK plus ANG II (MK+ANG II). Upper plateaus of baroreflex-NE spillover curves for renal and total NE spillover were reduced in the MK group (25 and 81 ng/min) compared with control (38 and 125 ng/min) and MK+ANG II (37 and 155 ng/min). To investigate the interaction of ANG II and sympathetic activity during treadmill exercise, hindlimb NE spillover rate was examined in three groups of rabbits: 1) control, 2) MK, and 3) MK+ANG II. Exercise at 6 and 12 m/min produced similar effort-related hemodynamic responses in the three groups. At maximal exercise, hindlimb NE spillover was reduced in the MK group (29 +/- 3 ng/min) compared with control (62 +/- 17 ng/min, P < 0.05) and MK+ANG II group (51 +/- 10 ng/min). It is concluded that endogenous ANG II enhances sympathetic activity during pharmacological (baroreflex) and physiological stimulation.", 
    "152": "We have previously reported that the mRNA levels of endothelin (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha), (TNF-alpha), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B chain, transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) all increased with age in diabetic rat glomeruli. We have now assessed the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the expression of the ET-1, TNF-alpha, PDGF-B, TGF-beta, and bFGF genes in 24-week-old rat glomeruli after streptozotocin injection. Animals were divided into controls, enalapril-treated diabetic rats, and untreated diabetic rats. Treatment continued for 24 weeks. Enalapril reduced both creatinine clearance (p < 0.001) and urinary protein excretion (p < 0.01) in diabetic rats. Enalapril produced a nonsignificant 15 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure in diabetic rats. Enalapril also attenuated the increases in ET-1 mRNA levels observed in the glomeruli of diabetic rats (0.5-fold compared with untreated diabetic rats at 24 weeks [p < 0.01]) but had no effect on increased mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, PDGF-B, TGF-beta, and bFGF. These findings suggest that enalapril therapy may be effective in reducing ET-1 mRNA expression in the glomeruli of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "153": "[D-Ala2,Leu5]Enkephalin was readily metabolized by membranes (40,000 g pellet) prepared from heads of the housefly, Musca domestica, with Gly3-Phe4 being the major site of cleavage. This hydrolysis was only partially inhibited (40%) by 10 microM phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11, but was almost totally abolished in the presence of a mixture of 10 microM phosphoramidon and 10 microM captopril, a potent inhibitor of mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). An assay for ACE employing Bz-Gly-His-Leu as the substrate was used to confirm the presence of an ACE-like peptidyl dipeptidase activity in fly head membranes. The peptidase had a Km of 1.91 mM for Bz-Gly-His-Leu and a pH optimum of 8.2. The activity was inhibited by 100 microM EDTA and was greatly activated by ZnCl2 but not other bivalent metal ions. Captopril, lisinopril, fosinoprilat and enalaprilat, all selective inhibitors of mammalian ACE, were also good inhibitors of the insect enzyme with IC50 values of 400 nM, 130 nM, 16 nM and 290 nM respectively. An M(r) value of around 87,000 was obtained for this enzyme from gel-filtration chromatography, indicating that the insect enzyme is similar in size to mammalian testicular ACE (M(r) = 90,000-110,000) and not the larger form of the enzyme (M(r) = 150,000-180,000) found in mammalian somatic tissues. The fly peptidyl dipeptidase was released from membranes into a soluble fraction by incubating the head membranes at 37 degrees C but not at 0 degree C, suggesting that the insect ACE-like enzyme can be solubilized from cell surfaces through the activity of a membrane-bound enzyme activity. In conclusion, we have shown the existence of a peptidyl dipeptidase in membranes from the heads of M. domestica, which has similar properties to those of mammalian ACE.",

    "158": "To assess the feasibility of diuretic discontinuation in patients with stable congestive heart failure (CHF) and to identify risk factors for subsequent development of congestion, a prospective, 12-week clinical trial of unmasked diuretic withdrawal was conducted with continuation of background CHF therapy and double-blind randomization to placebo or lisinopril. Forty-one patients with a history of CHF and continuous diuretic use for > or = 3 months had all diuretic therapy discontinued, and therapy with lisinopril 5 mg (target 20 mg)/day (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) begun the next day. A diuretic was restarted if new or worsening CHF symptoms and signs developed. Twelve patients (29%) did not require diuretic reinitiation at any time during follow-up, whereas 29 (71%) restarted diuretic therapy after a median of 15 days (range 2 to 42). Fourteen patients taking lisinopril and 15 taking placebo required diuretic drugs (p = NS). The baseline daily furosemide dose of > 40 mg, a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.27, and history of systemic hypertension were independently predictive of early diuretic reinitiation by Cox proportional-hazards analysis. The probability of remaining diuretic-free after 6 weeks was 71% if none of these criteria were present. This trial demonstrates the feasibility of discontinuing diuretic drugs in certain patients with stable CHF and predicts those patients likely to require reinitiation of therapy. Diuretic withdrawal may be warranted when the furosemide dose is < or = 40 mg/day, left ventricular ejection fraction is > 0.27 and when no history of systemic hypertension is present.", 
    "159": "The effects of enalapril therapy on radionuclide ejection fraction and plasma N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 52 patients with acute myocardial infarction. The medication was begun intravenously within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. At discharge and the end point of 6 months, the radiographic size of the heart was significantly smaller in patients receiving (n = 28) than in those not receiving (n = 24) enalapril therapy (p < 0.03 vs < 0.01). However, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased simultaneously from 50 +/- 10% to 47 +/- 11% in patients treated with enalapril, whereas it increased from 48 +/- 13% to 50 +/- 14% in control patients (p < 0.05 for the difference of the changes). The decrease in ejection fraction was most marked in the infarct-related region of the left ventricle (p < 0.01). During the in-hospital period, plasma N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide was decreased in patients treated with enalapril, whereas it was increased in those treated with placebo with complicated acute myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). During the following 6 months, the differences remained insignificant. Early administration of enalapril significantly attenuated heart enlargement after myocardial infarction and probably improved hemodynamics during the acute phase of complicated infarction. The decrease in ejection fraction during recovery indicates an impairment of systolic function. The decrease in infarct-related regional ejection fraction suggests that the impairment may be due to poor healing of the infarction scar.",

Sham-operated rats (n = 10) served as controls. Coronary blood flow was measured with radiolabeled microspheres during baseline and maximal coronary dilation induced by dipyridamole (2 mg.kg-1.min-1 over 10 minutes). Right and left ventricular (LV) weight was increased in infarcted rats compared with sham-operated animals and enalapril- and losartan-treated MI rats. Minimal LV and right ventricular coronary vascular resistance was increased in MI rats but normalized with enalapril and losartan (LV:sham, 8.9; MI-placebo, 12.7; MI-enalapril, 9.2; MI-losartan, 8.8 mm Hg.mL-1.min-1.g-1, all P < .05 versus MI-placebo). Interstitial fibrosis determined from perfusion-fixed hearts was increased in infarcted rats but reduced by both enalapril and losartan. Myocardial capillary density improved with enalapril and losartan. In separate groups treated as above, plasma and tissue ACE activity was determined and demonstrated significantly higher ACE activity in noninfarcted LV tissue of MI-placebo rats compared with sham (0.64 vs 0.27 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1, P < .05).

    "163": "Previous studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) acts as a growth-promoting factor directly on cardiac myocytes and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor induces regression of hypertrophied hearts both in experimental animals and in humans. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the formation of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). To elucidate the role of RAS in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy, we evaluated the effect of an Ang II receptor antagonist on LVH in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and investigated the molecular mechanisms by which antagonizing Ang II receptors reduces cell hypertrophy of myocytes using the in vitro model of mechanical stretch.", 
    "164": "In the in vivo study, we treated SHRs with the nonpeptide Ang II receptor antagonist TCV-116 (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg per day) or hydralazine (10 mg/kg per day). Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method, and wall thickness of left ventricle was serially monitored using M-mode echocardiography. Rats were killed at the age of 13, 17, 21, or 25 weeks, and left ventricular (LV) weight, transverse diameter of cardiomyocytes, relative amount of V3 myosin heavy chain (MHC), and degree of interstitial collagen accumulation were examined. Untreated SHRs progressively developed severe hypertension, but treatment with TCV-116 or hydralazine inhibited the increase in blood pressure. Treatment with TCV-116 reduced LV weight, LV wall thickness, transverse diameter of myocytes, relative amount of V3 MHC, and interstitial fibrosis, whereas treatment with hydralazine slightly prevented an increase in LV wall thickness but did not exert significant reduction in other parameters. In the in vitro study, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured on deformable silicone dishes and mechanically stretched with or without pretreatment of CV-11974 (an active metabolite of TCV-116), and [3H]phenylalanine incorporation, activity of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and c-fos mRNA expression were analyzed. Pretreatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with 10(-7) mol/L CV-11974 inhibited an increase in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation, MAP kinase activity, and c-fos gene expression induced by stretch of cardiomyocytes.",

    "166": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone secreted from cardiac atria in response to increased atrial pressure. Because of a longer half-life and greater stability, the N-terminal of ANF prohormone (N-terminal proANF) may be a better integrator of atrial peptide secretion than ANF itself. After myocardial infarction, elevation of ANF and other neurohormones has been associated with a poor prognosis. However, when left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other important clinical variables are included in multivariate analysis, the independent predictive value of these neurohormones has been reduced markedly.", 
    "167": "To test the prognostic value of N-terminal proANF after myocardial infarction, its plasma concentration was measured a mean of 12 days after infarction in 246 patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study. N-terminal proANF was a much stronger predictor of survival than ANF itself. Furthermore, in multivariate analysis of cardiovascular mortality and development of heart failure, N-terminal proANF in contrast to ANF and other neurohormones was still a powerful and independent predictor when the model included age, gender, prior myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, use of thrombolysis, Killip class, infarct location, and LVEF.",

    "169": "The concentration of transferrin mRNA was evaluated during pregnancy and lactation in rabbit mammary gland and liver using northern blot and dot blot assays. Transferrin mRNA was present in the virgin rabbit mammary gland and its concentration increased as pregnancy proceeded, with a major enhancement after day 15. A high concentration was reached 3 days after parturition, with no additional increase during lactation and with a marked decline after weaning. During the same period, the concentration of transferrin mRNA showed only a very weak variation in liver. This mRNA was six times more abundant in mammary gland than in liver of lactating rabbit. The accumulation of transferrin mRNA in the mammary gland was concomitant with the accumulation of alpha s1-, beta-, kappa-casein and WAP (whey acidic protein) mRNAs. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, taken as a non-inducible control mRNA, declined progressively during pregnancy to reach its lower level in lactation. These observations suggest that casein, WAP and transferrin mRNAs are subjected to a similar control mechanism in vivo, at least in the second half of pregnancy and during lactation. Experiments carried out in vitro using isolated rabbit epithelial mammary cells cultured on collagen I gel indicated that transferrin mRNA was abundant and only weakly inducible by the lactogenic hormones insulin, cortisol and prolactin, as opposed to caseins and WAP mRNAs. R5020, an analogue of progesterone, inhibited at most very slightly the accumulation of alpha s1-casein mRNA in the presence of prolactin and it did not reduce the expression of transferrin gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "170": "Firm recommendations concerning the testing procedures, radionuclides of choice, and diagnostic criteria for RVHT are somewhat difficult, given the lack of rigorous standardization of these complex protocols. Nevertheless, review of the existing data indicates that post-captopril renography alone appears to be a safe and effective means of noninvasively screening hypertensive patients for renovascular disease. A normal study after captopril suggests with a reasonable degree of certainty that potentially reversible RVHT is unlikely. A positive study in an appropriately screened hypertensive patient with preserved renal function suggests that renovascular disease is likely, with sensitivity and specificity in excess of 90%. In the comparative study of Elliott et al, captopril renography was a more sensitive and specific screening test than the captopril PRA test. Although there may be confounding variables such as renal dysfunction, medications, and types of stenosis, a positive captopril renogram might also suggest a cure or improvement in blood pressure control with successful intervention such as PTRA or revascularization. Whether captopril renography might predict stabilization of individual kidney function is speculative and deserves further study.", 
    "171": "Long-term treatment of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has a persistent effect on blood pressure when treatment is withdrawn. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this effect could be mediated by the effect of treatment on resistance-artery structure. We determined the dose dependence of ACE-inhibitor therapy on blood pressure and small-artery structure during treatment and on the recovery of blood pressure when treatment was withdrawn. SHR (40 per group) were treated from age 4 to 24 weeks with one of three doses of perindopril (0.4, 0.8, or 1.5 mg/kg per day). Control groups were untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats. At 24 weeks, treatment was stopped and small arteries were taken from half of the rats from the mesenteric, femoral, cerebral, and coronary vascular beds for morphological and functional measurements. The blood pressure of the other half of the rats was followed until 36 weeks of age. During treatment, perindopril caused a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure and in the media-lumen ratio and media area of the small arteries, whereas there was a dose-dependent increase in lumen diameter. The effect of treatment on the structure of arteries from the different vascular beds was homogeneous. Compared with values from Wistar-Kyoto rats, blood pressure normalization in SHR was not associated with full normalization of structure. After withdrawal of treatment, there was an inverse relation between perindopril dose and the persistent effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "172": "We investigated the acute effects of captopril and nitrendipine on renal function and sodium excretion in hypertensive, male, heterozygous transgenic rats harboring a mouse renin gene [TGR (mRen-2)27]. Both drugs reduced blood pressure dose dependently in conscious transgenic rats. The oral ED20 for captopril was 0.5 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg for nitrendipine. In orally salt-loaded (20 mL/kg saline) transgenic rats captopril (0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg) reduced sodium excretion by approximately 90% in the 6 hours after administration, whereas equally antihypertensive doses of nitrendipine increased sodium excretion by approximately 100%. The antinatriuretic effect of captopril was accompanied by a reduction in creatinine clearance and a decrease in the excretion of cyclic GMP. In orally water-loaded (20 mL/kg water) transgenic rats captopril also reduced sodium excretion by more than 90%, and nitrendipine slightly increased sodium excretion. In control Sprague-Dawley rats the effects were opposite; namely, captopril tended to increase natriuresis, and nitrendipine caused a small but distinct decrease in sodium excretion. Intravenous captopril in anesthetized transgenic rats caused an antinatriuresis with a decrease in inulin clearance but not in Sprague-Dawley rats. To control for non-renin-related effects of captopril, we gave transgenic rats oral losartan. Losartan also decreased urinary sodium excretion. The results suggest a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion in transgenic TGR (mRen-2)27 rats.", 
    "173": "Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have higher blood pressure than females. We compared renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density among intact SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats of both sexes, male and female SHR gonadectomized at 4 weeks of age, and gonadectomized SHR supplemented with testosterone. Additional groups of SHR were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, from 5 to 14 weeks of age. Renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density was higher in males than females in both SHR and WKY rats. Female SHR and WKY rats had identical low renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density. Castration of male SHR reduced the male-female differences in blood pressure and renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density by 60%. Treatment with testosterone raised blood pressure and renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density to the intact male levels in both gonadectomized males and females. Treatment with enalapril decreased blood pressure but not renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density in both male and female SHR. We conclude that (1) both renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density and blood pressure are influenced by sex in SHR and WKY, (2) renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density like blood pressure is regulated by androgens, and (3) increased renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density is not a consequence of high blood pressure in male SHR.", 
    "174": "Drug-induced disease of any system or organ can be associated with high morbidity and mortality, and it is tremendously costly to the health care of our country. More than 100 medications are known to affect the lungs adversely, including the airways in the form of cough and asthma, the interstitium with interstitial pneumonitis and noncardiac pulmonary edema, and the pleura with pleural effusions. Patients commonly do not even know what medications they are taking, do not bring them to the physician's office for identification, and usually do not relate over-the-counter medications with any problems they have. They assume that all nonprescription drugs are safe. Patients also believe that if they are taking prescription medications at their discretion, meaning on an as-needed basis, then these medications are also not important. This situation stresses just how imperative it is for the physician to take an accurate drug history in all patients seen with unexplained medical situations. Cardiovascular drugs that most commonly produce a pulmonary abnormality are amiodarone, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Pulmonary complications will develop in 6% of patients taking amiodarone and 15% taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with the former associated with interstitial pneumonitis that can be fatal and the latter associated with an irritating cough that is not associated with any pathologic or physiologic sequelae of consequence. The beta-blockers can aggravate obstructive lung disease in any patient taking them. Of the antiinflammatory agents, acetylsalicyclic acid can produce several different airway and parenchymal complications, including aggrevation of asthma in up to 5% of patients with asthma, a noncardiac pulmonary edema when levels exceed 40 mg/dl, and a pseudosepsis syndrome. More than 200 products contain aspirin. Low-dose methotrexate is proving to be a problem because granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis develops in 5% of those patients receiving it. This condition occurs most often in patients receiving the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, but it has been reported in a few patients receiving it for refractory asthma. Chemotherapeutic drug-induced lung disease is almost always associated with fever, thus mimicking opportunistic infection, which is the most common cause of pulmonary complications in the immunocompromised host. However, in 10% to 15% of patients, the pulmonary infiltrate is due to an adverse effect from a chemotherapeutic agent. This complication is frequently fatal even when recognized early.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "175": "A-II exerts its activity on various target tissues by binding to its receptors. The discovery of local RASs and A-II receptors within various tissues has generated interest in the clinical usefulness of RAS inhibition by directly blocking the action of A-II at the receptor level. Different A-II receptor subtypes have been identified and subsequently termed AT1 and AT2. AT1-receptor subtypes are the predominant receptor subtypes existing in most organs and, by coupling to a transmembrane G protein, seem to be the main subtypes participating in the vasoactive responses of A-II. Saralasin, a peptide with specific A-II receptor-antagonistic activity, had limited practical long-term usefulness as a result of its short half-life, significant agonistic properties, and lack of oral bioavailability. The discovery of simple benzyl-substituted imidazoles, which possess weak but highly selective A-II receptor antagonistic properties, led to the development of losartan (DuP 753). Losartan is a potent, orally active, specific, competitive nonpeptide A-II receptor antagonist that appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent both in animal studies and in preliminary clinical trials. The therapeutic usefulness of losartan, however, is not limited to its antihypertensive effects. The potential benefits of A-II receptor antagonists include roles in postmyocardial infarction therapy, slowing A-II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, 154, 155 slowing the progression of heart failure, preventing postangioplasty restenosis, and in slowing the progression of renal disease. Furthermore, losartan, a selective A-II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, has also been a valuable pharmacologic probe for studying the mechanism of A-II stimulation of its receptors. A-II receptor antagonism appears to be as effective as ACE inhibition in the treatment of hypertension and other pathologic processes that involve the RAS and may offer an alternative to those patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of their side effects.",

    "180": "To elucidate the interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and arginine vasopressin (AVP), we investigated the change in the renal AVP receptor in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril. SHR (age 15 weeks) were given oral cilazapril 10 mg/kg body weight daily for 25 days (ACEI group). Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in the ACEI group as compared with the untreated SHRs (control group) after day 2. Urine volume in the ACEI group was 3- to 5-fold higher than that in the control group. Under these conditions, the renal AVP receptor was studied using the radiolabeled receptor assay (RRA) of [3H]-AVP from renal medulla membrane fractions. The serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, urea nitrogen and creatinine were not significantly different between the two groups. The plasma concentration of AVP in the ACEI group was higher than that in the control group. The dissociation constant (Kd) in the ACEI group was significantly lower than that in the control, although there was no significant change of maximum binding capacity (Bmax) between the two groups. We previously reported that the number of renal AVP receptors decreased in rats with diabetes insipidus which were treated with lithium, suggesting that the change in the AVP receptor is a primary cause of polyuric state induced by lithium. In the present study, the diuretic state and the decrease in blood pressure induced by cilazapril resulted in a marked decrease in the Kd of the renal AVP receptor and an increase in the plasma AVP level. It is suggested that plasma AVP and renal AVP receptors in SHR responded to the diuretic state induced by cilazapril by increasing the secretion and renal receptor affinity. We conclude that the AVP system plays an important role in the regulation of the fluid balance under diuretic conditions caused by ACE inhibitor treatment.", 
    "181": "Pre- and afterload reduction is known to have beneficial effects in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. To date, no controlled study has been reported analyzing the long term influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment on patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the effects of one year angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril on myocardial performance in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients with moderate to severe isolated chronic mitral regurgitation and no coronary disease on coronary angiography were studied under control conditions and followed up until one year of quinapril therapy (10-20mg/day) using echocardiography and simultaneous right heart catheterization, and radionuclide ventriculography at rest and exercise. As the result of a significant pre- and afterload reduction after one year quinapril treatment regurgitant fraction fell from 0.43 +/- 0.10 at control before therapy to 0.25 +/- 0.08 (p = 0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume was reduced from 146 +/- 26 to 109 +/- 24 ml/m2 (p = 0.0001) and end-systolic volume decreased from 63 +/- 43 to 47 +/- 29 ml/m2 (p = 0.02). Left ventricular ejection fraction at control averaged 0.59 +/- 0.20 at rest, increased to 0.65 +/- 0.21 with maximum exercise and was unchanged after one year quinapril therapy. After one year treatment left ventricular mass was reduced by 15% (p = 0.0004) and septal wall thickness decreased from 11.8 +/- 0.7 to 10.8 +/- 0.8 mm (p = 0.0006). Moreover, there was significant functional improvement of nearly one NYHA class after one year quinapril therapy. In conclusion, in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation long term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril reduces regurgitation and decreases left ventricular size and mass thereby demonstrating functional improvement. In addition, these data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition might have the potential of delaying mitral valve surgery.", 
    "182": "A high molecular form of angiotensin-converting enzyme with mol mass about 600 kDa was found simultaneously with the well-known low molecular enzyme form of 190 kDa after fractionation of freshly prepared extracts from bovine kidney cortex and lung tissues by means of ammonium sulfate or gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was adequately Cl'-dependent for both these enzyme forms and specific inhibitors nonapeptide SQ 20881 and pentapeptide SQ 20475 inhibited similarly their activity. The enzyme high molecular form transformed into its low molecular derivative after storage, in freezing-thawing and ultrafiltration. Aprotinin, the inhibitor of serine proteinases, inhibited this kind of transformation. Stable form of the high molecular angiotensin-converting enzyme, which did not transform into its low molecular derivative, was obtained after treatment with agarose-immobilized aprotinin. Endogenous serine proteinases, which may regulate the angiotensin-converting activity in vivo, appears to be responsible for the enzyme transformation into its low molecular derivative.", 
    "183": "An endogenous activator of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), unknown earlier, was detected in freshly prepared human neutrophils. Supernatants of the neutrophil suspension produced a 1.6-2-fold activation of the ACE isolated from bovine kidney cortex. The ACE activating effect of these supernatants correlated with concentration of neutrophils in the initial suspension. The activator did not penetrate through membranes of Centricon-30. This activator was also found in blood serum of patients with hereditary deficiency of the complement CI-esterase inhibitor. The neutrophil-released ACE activator is likely to be involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses.", 
    "184": "We now have conclusive data that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, morbidity, and symptoms in patients with low ejection fraction and/or heart failure. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should be routinely used in all such patients, as long as there are no clear contraindications. Routine use of ACE inhibitors will lead to prolongation of survival and a reduction in the number of hospitalizations for heart failure and ischaemic events. The reduction in costs associated with the prevention of these events is likely substantially to offset the cost of the use of these therapies. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should be instituted as early as possible in patients with LV dysfunction.", 
    "185": "Unlike most cell-types in the body, cardiomyocytes do not replicate in adult life. Consequently myocardial infarction produces irreparable damage to the heart which in turn increases the likelihood of premature death. Recent trials indicate that immediate aspirin and thrombolytic therapy beneficially modify the natural history of myocardial infarction, reducing both short- and long-term mortality rates. However, the occurrence of early heart failure in as many as one third of patients continues to carry with it a particularly poor prognosis. Recent trials with ACE inhibitors indicate that delayed initiation (beyond 24 h) and long-term maintenance treatment of patients selected on the basis of either heart failure (AIRE Study) or an ejection fraction of less than 40% (SAVE Study) result in large reductions in all-cause mortality. Although the exact mechanism of this benefit remains uncertain the reduction of further myocyte death due to reinfarction or gradual toxic attrition has been suggested. The currently unreported ISIS-4 and GISSI-3 should provide additional information as to whether the clinical indications for ACE-inhibitor therapy should be extended to other patient groups.", 
    "186": "The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study demonstrated that long-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to recent survivors of myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Analysis of multiple subgroups demonstrated that baseline demographics (older age) and clinical characteristics (such as prior MI, history of diabetes or hypertension), that have previously been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, were associated with greater end point event rates in SAVE regardless of therapy assignment at the time of randomization. The effectiveness of captopril therapy in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was examined in multiple subgroups. Although not all subgroups provided adequate statistical power, the benefits of captopril therapy were relatively uniform in the SAVE study. This indicates that the benefits were not confined to one particular subgroup and conversely that targeting of captopril therapy should be to the broadest group, as defined by SAVE entry criteria, to result in a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.", 
    "187": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on mortality following acute myocardial infarction (MI) has recently been studied in several clinical trials. The rationale for the use of these drugs following an injury to the myocardium is largely based on their ability to attenuate left ventricular volume expansion and modulate neurohormonal activation. Left ventricular dilatation following MI is due to complex structural changes in the infarcted myocardium as well as alterations in the non-infarcted contractile myocardium. The magnitude of this remodelling is associated with adverse prognosis. Neurohormonal systems are activated in the early phase of acute MI. Prolonged neurohormonal activation mainly occurs among patients with marked left ventricular dysfunction. The CONSENSUS II trial examined the effects on mortality of the ACE inhibitor enalapril, when initiated within 24 h from the onset of the infarct and continued for 6 months. There were 6090 patients randomly assigned to placebo (n = 3046) or enalapril (n = 3044). At the end of the trial, 598 patients had died: 286 (9.4%) in the placebo group and 312 (10.2%) in the enalapril group (P = 0.26). These results are in contrast to some other studies in which mortality was reduced by ACE inhibitor therapy post-MI. It is considered likely that the positive effects of ACE inhibitors following MI are confined mainly to patients with marked left ventricular dysfunction and prolonged neurohormonal activation.", 
    "188": "We evaluated, firstly, the sensitivity to cardiac ischemic ATP breakdown during the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) v Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls, and secondly, the effects of short-term (8 days) and prolonged (3 months) antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on hypertrophy and sensitivity to global ischemia. In isolated perfused hearts, ischemia was induced by a stepwise lowering of the perfusion pressure and the appearance of the ATP breakdown products (purines) in the coronary effluent was assessed as a measure of ischemia. Hearts from 2.5- and 4-month-old SHR started to release purines at a higher perfusion pressure than hearts of WKY, associated with a higher maximum concentration in the coronary effluent. This increased ischemic ATP breakdown in 2.5- and 4-month-old SHR could be attributed to a decreased flow at a given perfusion pressure, because of a two-fold increase in coronary vascular resistance (CVR). In contrast, the maximal purine concentration in the coronary effluent in hearts of 7-month-old SHR was reduced compared to the younger SHR and only slightly higher than 7-month-old WKY, despite a persistent increase in CVR. Enalapril normalized the blood pressure, but only prolonged treatment, significantly prevented and regressed cardiac hypertrophy, and reduced CVR. Whereas enalapril did not influence ATP breakdown in WKY, in SHR both short- and long-term treatment normalized it to the pattern observed in WKY. We conclude that during the early phase of cardiac hypertrophy the hearts of SHR become more sensitive to ischemic ATP breakdown solely because of an increase in CVR, whereas during the established hypertrophic phase, the hearts appear to adapt metabolically, resulting in normalized purine release. Enalapril normalized the transient increase in sensitivity to ischemic ATP breakdown during the development of hypertension in SHR, independent of effects on cardiac hypertrophy, apparently by improving coronary flow at low perfusion pressures.",

Congestive heart failure is a complex disorder with a poor long-term prognosis. The major causes of congestive heart failure are ischemia, infarction, and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Patients often present with dyspnea and a low exercise tolerance. In congestive heart failure there may be an alteration in preload, afterload, and contractility of the heart. Many compensatory mechanisms occur to support the failing heart. Cardiac symptoms slowly develop and eventually systemic symptoms develop. The cornerstones of pharmacologic therapy are cardiac glycosides, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "192": "Regional hemodynamics following intravenous injection of furosemide were studied in conscious rats instrumented with Doppler flowprobes. Furosemide caused a dose-dependent acute (within 3 min) transient increase in renal resistance (RR) followed by a later generalized vasoconstriction in the renal, mesenteric and hindquarter (HQR) vascular bed. With in vitro experiments a possible direct effect of furosemide on renal artery segments was excluded. The acute rise in RR was partly (approximately 40%) attenuated by pretreatment with phentolamine or prazosin, but not prevented by renal denervation, volume repletion or pretreatment with captopril, losartan, indomethacin, aminophylline, nifedipine, or a vasopressin V1A-receptor-antagonist. However, the acute renal vasoconstriction was absent in water diuretic rats. The later vasoconstriction was blunted by captopril (RR+HQR), losartan (RR) and phentolamine (HQR) pretreatment. We conclude that the later generalized vasoconstriction following furosemide involves regional specific stimulation of angiotensin II and alpha-adrenoceptors. The mechanism of the acute renal vasoconstriction could not be fully determined. Because of its absence in water diuretic rats, its rapid onset, transient nature and relative insensitivity for pharmacological tools in euvolemic rats, the acute increase in RR following furosemide may be caused by cell swelling as a result from dissipation of the renal medullary gradient.", 
    "193": "The predominant trend in pediatric antihypertensive management is towards increasing reliance on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers because of their general effectiveness, low incidence of adverse reactions and potential specific benefit in patients with renal disease. The common aetiological relationship between renal disease and elevated BP also is the reason that diuretic therapy continues to be included in many treatment regimens. A number of ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, although only captopril has been subjected to any meaningful degree of investigation in children. Initial doses of captopril are 0.5 mg/kg in children > 6 months of age and 0.01-0.1 mg/kg in neonates, because of an apparent increased antihypertensive effect and duration of action in this age group. Side-effects are few and the major adverse effect is a reduction in glomerular filtration in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. The calcium channel blockers reduce cytosolic calcium concentration and are particularly effective in patients with volume dependent forms of hypertension. The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are similar with drug clearance by hepatic metabolism. In particular, nifedipine has a rapid onset of action and is widely used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Although it has been used sublingually, the effectiveness of the drug is due to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Few side-effects from these drugs have been reported in children. Heart rate and cardiac output increase but return to pretreatment levels within a few weeks. As is the case with the ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on renal function.",

Because the individual mean AERs were significantly associated with their respective SDis, the data was loge transformed. LogeSDi was estimated as 0.420, and its 90% probability range (0.353-0.490) was calculated using the bootstrap method.",

However, subjects with an initial AER > or = 53 or > or = 80 micrograms/min have a 95 and 99% probability of persistent microalbuminuria.

Relative change in albuminuria (ratio of first year of treatment/baseline) and albuminuria during first year of treatment were significantly correlated to fall rate in glomerular filtration rate during 3 years of treatment (r = 0.73, p < 0.001) and (r = 0.60, p < 0.01), respectively. Arterial blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate measured at baseline, during first year of treatment or relative changes in these variables did not correlate with fall rate in glomerular filtration rate during 3 years of treatment. Haemoglobin A1c, serum-cholesterol, protein intake and sodium excretion remained unchanged during treatment, and were not correlated with loss of kidney function. Reduction in albuminuria during captopril treatment predicts an attenuated rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate in early diabetic nephropathy (glomerular filtration rate > 70 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2). The finding suggests a clinical application in monitoring the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in early diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "208": "The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to assess the haemodynamic effects, safety and tolerability in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) of one month of oral captopril, one month of oral isosorbide mononitrate and 24 h of intravenous magnesium. It was carried out in four United Kingdom and six Polish hospitals in consecutive phases: oral captopril vs oral mononitrate vs placebo were compared among 400 patients in a 'three-way' study; and then oral captopril vs placebo and oral mononitrate vs placebo were compared among 474 patients in '2 x 2' and '2 x 2 x 2' factorial studies (with 208 patients in the latter study also randomized between intravenous magnesium and open control). The factorial studies differed from the three-way study in that one group of patients was allocated both oral captopril and oral mononitrate, a higher maintenance dose of captopril was used (following the same initial dose), and once daily controlled-release mononitrate was used. In the three-way study, the mean of the lowest systolic blood pressures recorded during the first 4 h after randomization were (mmHg +/- standard error): 104 +/- 2 captopril vs 105 +/- 1 mononitrate vs 112 +/- 2 placebo (P < 0.001 for captopril or for mononitrate vs placebo), and in the factorial studies were 105 +/- 1 captopril vs 110 +/- 1 placebo (P < 0.01) and 106 +/- 1 mononitrate vs 108 +/- 1 placebo (NS). There was an excess of hypotension recorded among patients allocated active treatment (captopril > mononitrate > placebo) and there was a small, but significant, excess of cardiogenic shock with captopril compared with control in the factorial study. However, in these studies, neither captopril nor mononitrate were associated with any overall increase in the incidence of hypotension considered severe enough to lead to treatment being stopped. No other serious complications were observed, and compliance with study tablets at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the active and placebo groups. Patients allocated magnesium in the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study had a slightly lower mean systolic blood pressure just after the initial 15 min bolus injection (126 +/- 2 magnesium vs 134 +/- 3 control; P < 0.05) but there were no significant differences during the subsequent 24 h maintenance infusion period. Apart from some facial flushing, magnesium did not appear to be associated with any complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "209": "Eight patients with biopsy-proven primary nephrotic syndrome were included in an open, prospective, two-year study of lovastatin. One patients was withdrawn after 6 months due to an asymptomatic rise in creatinine phosphokinase, which was rapidly reversed after interruption of lovastatin. In the remaining patients, treatment was well-tolerated and produced no side effects. After 2 years of treatment, these 7 patients had decreases in total cholesterol from 446 +/- 165 to 250 +/- 57 mg/dl (p < 0.001), LDL cholesterol from 343 +/- 121 to 174 +/- 49 mg/dl (p < 0.001), Apo B lipoprotein from 162 +/- 60 to 108 +/- 42 mg/dl (p < 0.05), triglycerides from 336 +/- 273 to 182 +/- 71 mg/dl (p < 0.04). There was no change in HDL cholesterol. The LDL/HDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratios fell from 15.0 +/- 12.1 and 19.1 +/- 17.2 mg/dl before the study to 4.4 +/- 1.2 and 6.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl, respectively, at 2 years. A decrease in proteinuria from 8.6 +/- 4.6 to 5.0 +/- 3.7 g/24 h (p < 0.02) was noted in 4 patients on concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Renal function remained stable in all patients throughout the study, except for one whose moderate impairment progressed to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis 3 months poststudy. We conclude that long-term lovastatin in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome is an effective and generally safe treatment for accompanying dyslipidemia.", 
    "210": "During 1993 the indications for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were expanded to include patients with left ventricular dysfunction and acute myocardial infarction. The role and use of ACE inhibitors in patients with chronic systolic ventricular dysfunction, established in earlier trials, has been further clarified. Increasing attention is being focused on ACE inhibitors, specifically the mechanisms by which they improve mortality, their side effects, and the possibility of further increasing their use by avoiding renal dysfunction and first-dose hypotension. Although most of the interest has centered on ACE inhibitors, the importance of diuretics and their use in combination with ACE inhibitors is being clarified. Most important has been the demonstration over the past year of the effectiveness of digoxin in preventing cardiac deterioration in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction and sinus rhythm. The increased understanding of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, its modification by ACE inhibitors, and the interaction of ACE inhibition with other drugs provides the basis for a further improvement in morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.", 
    "211": "The past few years have witnessed an extraordinary number of important developments in the study of compensatory and maladaptive responses to cardiac dysfunction. It now seems clear that the process whereby the heart remodels in response to left ventricular injury is of paramount importance in the expression of clinical heart failure. There have been parallel attempts by basic scientists and clinical investigators to understand better the fundamental biologic processes that underlie remodeling and to assess numerous new treatments--especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A general consensus seems to be emerging that holds that the response of the heart to acute injury includes a number of highly compensatory and adaptive mechanisms that ultimately become maladaptive and contribute to cardiomegaly and severe congestive heart failure. Such mechanisms undoubtedly include local and systemic release of cytokines, peptides, and neurohormones, and altered loading conditions leading to unusual mechanical forces on cardiac myocytes and other cells of the heart. At the organ level there is hypertrophy, dilatation and growth of the interstitium. Preliminary evidence also suggests there may be some \"remodeling\" at the cardiac myocyte level. Reduction in peripheral vasodilator reserve is seen in experimental animal models of heart failure. Patients with heart failure also develop an endothelial-dependent form of peripheral vascular dysfunction expressed clinically as an attenuated ability to dilate in response to such stimuli as acetylcholine. The transition point whereby these myocardial and peripheral vascular abnormalities become clearly dysfunctional and contribute toward the full clinical expression of heart failure remains to be further investigated.", 
    "212": "The treatment of heart failure has advanced greatly over the past two decades. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have become standard therapy, not only in symptomatic patients but also in those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Diuretic regimens have become increasingly potent and sophisticated. Much of the controversy over the efficacy of digoxin has been resolved, although its effect on survival is still uncertain. Most symptomatic patients, therefore, should be treated with what has become \"standard\" triple therapy, but practices vary as to when and at what dose to use these medications. More problematic is how to treat the patient who remains symptomatic on a three-drug regimen, and how to manage ancillary but important issues such as arrhythmias and thromboembolic risk. This article reflects the author's personal approach to managing the patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in 1994.", 
    "213": "Numerous trials have demonstrated the negative effects of some antihypertensive drugs upon glucose handling. Such findings seem particularly interesting in aged hypertensive patients who are also insulin resistant and affected by physiological changes in the renal and cardiovascular systems. It appears that calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the most appropriate drugs to lower blood pressure in aged insulin-resistant hypertensive patients. All calcium channel blockers studied have displayed similar metabolic effects, while among the ACE inhibitors studied, lisinopril was associated with the best metabolic responses. beta-Blockers and thiazide diuretics have strong negative effects on glucose handling. Further studies are needed in order to investigate the metabolic effects of alpha 1-antagonists in aged patients with insulin resistance and hypertension.",

    "215": "The efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of amlodipine and enalapril were compared in a multicentre, double-blind, general practice study in 461 mild and moderate hypertensives over a 50-week active treatment period. Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were found to be similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while not adversely affecting quality-of-life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group compared with 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was normalised or reduced by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Side-effects were, in general, mild or of little clinical significance. The major side-effects recorded were class-typical of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and oedema (amlodipine), respectively. Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) being withdrawn from the study due to side-effects definitely related to treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy produced a slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration, and both drugs reduced the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. It was concluded that the calcium antagonist amlodipine compared favourably with the ACE inhibitor enalapril in terms of antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life.", 
    "216": "It is now apparent that the incidence of inadequate compliance is greater than had previously been recognised. The pattern of poor compliance is generally characterised by underdosing rather than overdosing and will usually involve interruptions in therapy of several days. There are many potentially important consequences of this, but therapeutically the most important is associated with the period without drug action. Establishing, for a range of antihypertensive agents, that there is a clear relationship between the circulating drug concentration and blood pressure-lowering effect it is possible to demonstrate that the pharmacodynamic characteristics of a drug will be well correlated with its pharmacokinetics. Thus, compared with other agents, amlodipine with its relatively smooth concentration-time profile and long elimination half-life will be superior in maintaining blood pressure control both with perfect compliance and when dosage regimens are perturbed due to missed drug doses.",

    "236": "BACKGROUND. Exposure of pregnant women to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may have side effects on the fetus or newborn, mainly oligoamnios and impaired renal function. CASE REPORT N zero 1. A 34 year-old woman was given enalapril from the onset of her pregnancy because of hypertension from the age of 18 years. Oligoamnios was diagnosed in the fetus on gestational week 28; enalapril was then replaced by nifedipine but this drug was badly tolerated so that the woman was again given enalapril 8 days later. The baby (1700 g) was born by cesarean section at gestational week 34 because of acute distress syndrome; he developed hypotension, anuria, generalized oedema and was placed in intensive care. Treatment included ventilation, sympathomimetic agents, and diuretics. An exchange-transfusion followed by peritoneal dialysis was performed a few hours later. Renal function returned to normal between the 3rd and 5th day. Unilateral kidney hypoplasia was diagnosed at the age of 2 years. CASE N zero 2. A 24 year-old woman was given enalapril at the third trimester of a twin pregnancy. Delivery was full term at 37 weeks. The first baby, a boy weighing 2610 g, suffered from hypoglycemia and vomiting followed by hypotension and oliguria that required exchange-transfusion and repeated peritoneal dialysis. This boy has developed moderate chronic renal failure and hypertension. The second baby, a girl weighing 2,165 g, suffered from respiratory distress syndrome followed by hypotension and oliguria, but her renal function returned to normal within a few days. CONCLUSIONS. The use of angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor by pregnant women places the fetus at severe risk: treatment with this type of drug should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.", 
    "237": "Prognosis after acute myocardial infarction is strongly associated with left ventricular dysfunction. However, asynergy does not necessarily imply loss of viability and myocardial necrosis. In fact, two different patterns of contractile dysfunction, possibly coexisting, have been shown after acute myocardial infarction: Stunning and hibernation represent distinct patterns of contractile dysfunction that share the character of reversibility. It is noteworthy, then, to identify the presence of these two conditions at the bedside and to develop medical treatment to effect recovery of myocardial dysfunction. This strategy has the potential to ameliorate the outcome of patients after acute myocardial infarction by improving left ventricular function. Beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces mortality and the incidence of reinfarction after an acute myocardial infarction: These benefits result from the prevention of sudden death, the reduction of the extent of myocardial injury during the acute phase, and a further antiischemic action. Nevertheless, beta-blocker therapy increases left ventricular dilatation. Recent experimental and clinical data show that ACE inhibitors confer positive therapeutic effects after myocardial infarction by reducing the extent of left ventricular dilation, by reducing mortality, and by improving the clinical outcome. Not all patients, however, can be subjected to this therapeutical approach because of the possible detrimental effects produced by hypotension and by block of neurohormonal activation, sometimes truly compensatory in the early phase. Therefore, it would be interesting to suggest a combination therapy of a beta-blocker with a vasodilator agent (ACE inhibitor or calcium-channel blocker.", 
    "238": "Measurements of plasma neurohormones in patients with left ventricular dysfunction are generally performed for research purpose rather than for diagnostic purpose or to guide therapy. These studies have shown that in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, several neurohormonal systems were activated, even in the absence of symptoms of congestive heart failure. This suggested that the cardiovascular system was not in a steady state and pointed out potential culprits for the progression of the disease. It has also been shown that the levels of several of these markers, particularly plasma norepinephrine, had an important prognostic value. Another value of neurohormonal studies obviously is the design of new therapeutic approaches aimed at improving symptoms and prognosis. In this respect, important therapeutic successes have been obtained with agents that interfere with the actions of some of these neurohormonal systems, such as with the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, particularly captopril and enalapril, and to a lesser extent, with beta-blockers. It can therefore be expected that, in the future, most patients with severe ischemic dysfunction will be treated with an ACE inhibitor. Nonetheless, neurohormonal control is not complete with these drugs; powerful vasoconstrictor forces, such as endothelin-1, remain activated, and an escape of angiotensin II from the control of ACE inhibition may exist. Thus, morbidity (e.g., progression towards congestive heart failure and angina pectoris) and mortality remain high despite treatment with ACE inhibitors. In the search for future improvements, the new generation of long-acting dihydropyridines is worth considering. Their afterload reducing action, coupled with powerful coronary vasodilation, might hypothetically delay the progression of ischemic LV dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "239": "In patients with essential hypertension, the increased risk for atherosclerosis is related not only to the blood pressure levels per se, but also to other, unknown, factors. Recent observations have indicated that oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL are implicated in human atherosclerosis. We tested both the susceptibility of LDL, derived from hypertensive patients, to lipid peroxidation as well as its uptake by macrophages, in comparison with control LDL obtained from healthy subjects. The LDL that was derived from 25 patients with essential hypertension demonstrated increased propensity for lipid peroxidation with a 63%, 91% and 69% elevation in the content of the lipoprotein malondialdehyde, peroxides and conjugated dienes, respectively, in comparison with control LDL. Minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) (prepared by 6 months' storage of the LDL at 4 degrees C) derived from the hypertensive patients also demonstrated increased lipid peroxidation with a 94%, 130% and 96% elevation in lipoprotein malondialdehyde, peroxides and conjugated dienes, respectively, compared with the control LDL. The susceptibility of the patients' LDL to lipid peroxidation decreased by 32% and 44% (measured as malondialdehyde) after 3 weeks of therapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril, respectively, with no parallel reduction in the patients' blood pressure. The patients' LDL was shown to contain increased content of lipid peroxides and unsaturated fatty acids, which may explain its increased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. In vitro experiments revealed that LDL can bind angiotensin II, and that angiotensin II has a stimulatory effect on copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, as well as on LDL degradation by macrophages. These results were secondary to cell-mediated oxidation of the LDL and to its cellular uptake via the scavenger receptor. We conclude that LDL derived from patients with essential hypertension is more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than control LDL, and this may be secondary to angiotensin II stimulation of LDL lipid peroxidation in these patients. Furthermore, this LDL demonstrates enhanced cellular uptake by macrophages in comparison with normal LDL which can also be related to angiotensin II-mediated LDL oxidation. Both these phenomena have been shown to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, and thus suggest a new mechanism for increased atherogenecity in hypertensive patients.", 
    "240": "We have used the photochemically induced thrombosis model to study intimal thickening in the guinea-pig femoral artery. The femoral artery was occluded by a combination of rose bengal and green light which caused endothelial cell damage followed by formation of platelet rich thrombus at the site of endothelial damage. Thrombolysis was then achieved by administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Intimal thickening in the femoral arteries was histologically measured at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 weeks after the treatment. The neointimal areas gradually increased until 3 weeks and then remained unchanged up to 9 weeks. Cells in the neointima were identified as smooth muscle cells by immunohistochemical staining with an actin-specific antibody, HHF35. Cell proliferation in the media begun within 48 h after the thrombolysis and bromodeoxyuridine labeled cells appeared to migrate to the intima within 1 week after the thrombolysis. Administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 3 weeks, suppressed intimal thickening and decreased the medial area in the femoral artery. These observations suggest that in this model cell proliferation and migration characteristics of pathological intimal thickening occur and this model is useful for investigating the effect of pharmacological preparations on intimal thickening.",

The present study was undertaken to clarify the possible relationship between plasma renin activity (PRA) and tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the heart, lung, kidney cortex and kidney medulla of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In the kidney cortex particular attention was focused on renal brush-border ACE.",

As expected, the PRA were highest in the 2-K,1C and depleted-salt groups and lowest in the DOCA, DOCA-salt and high-salt groups. ACE responses were different in different types of tissue, with no relationship between PRA and plasma or tissue ACE activity. For example, DOCA treatment led to increased ACE activity in the heart and the kidney only if the rats were maintained on a high salt intake. DOCA or salt alone failed to have this effect. In the 2-K,1C model the unclipped kidneys did not show any significant variation in ACE activity, but the clipped kidneys exhibited increased ACE activity compared with sham-operated rats. This increase, coupled with increased renal renin secretion, could play a role in the acceleration of local angiotensin II formation, and could thus initiate and sustain the development of hypertension in this model.",

A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "261": "The effect of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on glucose and lipid metabolism was evaluated in 12 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and glucose intolerance. Perindopril was administered at a dosage of 2 to 8 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced throughout the treatment period. There were no significant changes in the insulinogenic index (delta plasma immunoreactive insulin/delta plasma glucose) calculated from the results of 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests performed before and after perindopril treatment. Serum levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, fructosamine, lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were also not affected. These results suggest that perindopril can be used effectively to treat hypertension in patients with glucose intolerance without affecting glucose and lipid metabolism.", 
    "262": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients whose blood pressure failed to normalize while receiving monotherapy with atenolol would experience further blood pressure lowering by adding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril hydrochloride to their treatment regimen. Seventy-four of the original 127 patients treated with atenolol met the criteria for entry into the 4-week, double-blind phase of the study, in which either benazepril 10 mg twice daily (increased after 1 week, if necessary, to 20 mg twice daily) or placebo was added to atenolol. At end point, 46% of the benazepril group had achieved an excellent or good response (ie, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 90 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg below the baseline) compared with 14% of the placebo group (P < 0.01). The mean fall in DBP at end point was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. Because six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase of blood pressure that offset the fall observed in the responders, the difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant. We conclude that adding benazepril to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled while receiving atenolol monotherapy can produce an additional decrease in blood pressure in almost half the patients.", 
    "263": "Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent albuminuria (> 300 mg/24 h), a relentless decline in glomerular filtration rate, and elevated systemic blood pressure. The prevalence of an abnormally elevated albumin excretion rate (> 30 mg/24 h) is approximately 40% in patients with both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Diabetes has become the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in the United States and Japan and it is still the second leading cause in Europe. Identification of patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy is possible by screening for microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h). Randomized controlled trials in normotensive IDDM and NIDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors diminish urinary albumin excretion rate and postpone or may even prevent progression to clinically overt diabetic nephropathy. These findings suggest that screening and intervention programs are likely to have life-saving effects and lead to considerable economic savings. High blood pressure is an early and frequent phenomenon that can accelerate the course of diabetic nephropathy. Besides ACE inhibitors, conventional antihypertensive treatment (mainly beta-blockers and diuretics) reportedly reduce albuminuria and diminish the loss of kidney function in IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy. The same beneficial effect has been demonstrated using ACE inhibition combined with diuretics in hypertensive IDDM patients with overt nephropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "264": "Over the past two decades the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction in hypertensive populations has decreased, yet the incidence of end-stage renal disease attributed to hypertension has increased. This apparent paradox has raised questions about the adequacy of blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with renal disease. Chronic renal failure is commonly associated with hypertension, and is often severe and difficult to control, particularly in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The optimal level of blood pressure control in these patients has not been established. Long-term diastolic blood pressure control to a level lower than 90 mm Hg is associated with stable or improving renal function in hypertensive nephrosclerosis and with slowing of the deterioration in renal function from other causes of renal failure. Moreover, recent studies indicate that when blood pressure control is achieved and maintained at a level of about 130/86 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic), deterioration in renal function can be halted even in black patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Therefore, in hypertensive nephrosclerosis we attempt to control diastolic blood pressure at 80 to 85 mm Hg. Newer antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors contribute to lowering blood pressure and preserving renal function. However, they have yet to be proven superior to conventional agents in double-blind randomized clinical trials in humans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Importantly, minoxidil is still relied on for aggressive control of blood pressure in many patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis.",

New information regarding the latter two agents is reviewed elsewhere in this issue of Current Opinion in Cardiology. However, despite obvious advances in our management of this important clinical syndrome and the substantial body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the prognosis for patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure remains abysmal. For this reason, new and novel agents for the pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure continue to be developed and clinically evaluated. This article reviews the results of recent clinical trials with some of these new investigational pharmacologic agents. To facilitate categorization of these new agents, they will be grouped according to their primary pharmacologic action. However, it should be noted that those pharmacologic actions may not necessarily be responsible for either the beneficial or deleterious effects associated with these agents.", 
    "275": "The processing of peptide-YY (PYY) by purified membrane peptidases and brush border membrane preparations from human kidney and jejunum has been compared. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV hydrolyzes PYY at the Pro2-Ile3 bond, producing PYY-(3-36), which is a Y2 receptor-selective ligand. Aminopeptidase-P removes the N-terminal tyrosine from PYY, but the intact peptide is not a substrate for aminopeptidase-N. Endopeptidase-24.11 (neutral endopeptidase; enkephalinase) metabolizes PYY efficiently, with a major site of hydrolysis at the Asn29-Leu30 bond, an inactivating cleavage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme does not hydrolyze PYY. In renal brush border membranes, hydrolysis of PYY is substantially (> 75%) inhibited by phosphoramidon, suggesting that endopeptidase-24.11 initiates hydrolysis of PYY in this preparation. In jejunal brush border membranes, phosphoramidon has a much smaller effect (15% inhibition), and contributions due to the actions of aminopeptidase-P and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV were evident. Few physiological substrates have yet been identified for aminopeptidase-P and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV; the pancreatic polypeptide fold family, of which PYY is a member, may well represent endogenous substrates for those cell surface ectoenzymes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV converts PYY to a metabolite PYY-(3-36), a highly selective agonist for the Y2 receptor type. Thus, the relative levels of the three membrane peptidases at different tissue locations and on different cell types may play a pivotal role in postsecretory processing and metabolism of PYY to receptor-selective agonists or inactive metabolites.", 
    "276": "Several controlled studies with the best methodology had showed that digoxin improves the symptoms of patients with chronic heart failure and sinus rhythm, whose ventricular systolic function is impaired. The Proved and Radiance studies show that in patients receiving diuretics and digoxin, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin, the withdrawal of digoxin results in clinical deterioration and worsening of exercise tolerance. In addition to an inotropic action, digitalis exerts effects in the neurocardiovascular axis, produces reduction in plasma norepinephrine, renin, aldosterone, vasopressin activity and restores a more normal sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance and baroreceptor function. ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure in class IV (Consensus I trial), in class II and III (SOLVD, treatment trial) and prevent the development of heart failure in asymptomatic patients with ejection fraction < 35% (SOLVD, prevention trial). When ACE inhibitors are administered per os, more than 3 days after acute myocardial infarction they reduce mortality, severe heart failure, re-hospitalization, and induce an unexpected reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction (SAVE trial). However, the early administration, within 2 hours after the onset of chest pain, of ACE inhibitors by intravenous infusion, does not improve survival; the hypotension may be responsible of increased mortality (Consensus II trial).",

    "279": "The experiments referred to in this article point to the fact that relatively low concentrations of Hg2+ (5-10 mM) produce damage to the internal mitochondrial membrane. This damage results in the formation of ionic channels that allow the spontaneous effusion of Ca+2 from the matrix. Together with this, the formation of channels produce the balance of the chemo-osmotic gradient, resulting in the overcoming of the transmembrane potential and the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The experiments carried out in vivo, point to the fact mercury produces acute tubular necrosis of kidney tissue. These toxic effects produced by Hg2+ in vitro with the addition of 15 microM of the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme, captopril. In vivo experiments show that intraperitoneal infection of captopril (40 mg/kg) completely protects from mitochondrial dysfunction produced by mercurial intoxication.", 
    "280": "We wished to provide comparative information regarding the direct effects of flosequinan, a novel quinolone under development for treating heart failure, on isolated human arterial, venous, and cardiac muscle. A similar assessment was made for four other agents--milrinone, ouabain, captopril and diltiazem--that have been used to treat heart failure patients, as well as for flosequinoxan, which is the primary metabolite of flosequinan. Flosequinan produced a potent and balanced relaxant effect on norepinephrine (NE)-contracted human arterial and venous smooth muscle, with IC25 values of 0.32 and 0.50 microM, respectively. At higher concentrations, flosequinan also produced a positive inotropic effect on human cardiac muscle (EC25 = 32 microM). A similar pattern of responses was observed with flosequinoxan. The pharmacologic profile obtained for the other agents examined differed from that observed with flosequinan and flosequinoxan in the following ways: Milrinone produced both vascular relaxant and positive inotropic effects, but at comparable concentrations; ouabain produced both vasoconstrictor and positive inotropic effects; diltiazem exerted a vascular relaxant effect at low concentrations and a negative inotropic effect at higher concentrations; and captopril had slight arterial relaxant and negative inotropic effects. These results demonstrate that the pharmacologic profile of flosequinan and flosequinoxan is unique as compared with that of other agents that have been used to treat patients with heart failure.",

Activity of the endogenous RAS was suppressed either by chronic treatment by a nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist (losartan) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI: enalapril), DOCA-salt pretreatment (without previous uninephrectomy), and binephrectomy (36-40 hours before experiments). We also studied the influence of chronic dietary sodium restriction. The role of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity, endothelin (ET), and eicosanoids was evaluated in rats pretreated by prazosin, phosphoramidon (a nonspecific blocker of the conversion of big ET to ET), indomethacin, and the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) prostaglandin H2 (PGH2)-receptor antagonist SQ 29548, respectively. Finally, we tested the influence of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine on the vasopressor effect of L-NAME. In nonpretreated animals, L-NAME infusion induced an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 38 +/- 4 mm Hg. Chronic suppression of the RAS by losartan, enalapril, or DOCA did not alter the response to L-NAME, but the effect of L-NAME was moderately blunted in binephrectomized rats. Moderate attenuation (approximately 25%) and to a similar extent of the pressor effect of L-NAME was afforded by the low-sodium diet, phosphoramidon, SQ 29548, and indomethacin, whereas nicardipine markedly blunted by 74% the effect of L-NAME. We conclude that the acute pressor effect of L-NAME is mediated (at least in part) by cyclooxygenase-dependent products (mainly TXA2) and ET, but not by the RAS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "282": "Blockade of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) degradation by specific neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors may be useful in treatment of hypertension because of the potential diuretic, natriuretic, and arterial pressure (AP)-lowering effects. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of chronic oral treatment with the NEP inhibitor SCH 42495 on BP, diuresis, natriuresis, plasma ANF, cyclic GMP, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in conscious unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared them with the effects induced by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril (SPIR). Four groups of adult SHR were treated orally for 4 weeks with placebo, SCH 42495 3 mg/kg twice daily (b.i.d.), SCH 42495 30 mg/kg b.i.d., and spirapril 1 mg/kg b.i.d. Systolic BP (SBP) was measured weekly, and 24-h urine was collected every week for measurement of urinary volume, sodium, potassium, and cyclic GMP excretion. Plasma ANF, cyclic GMP, renin activity (PRA), and aldosterone (ALDO) were determined from blood collected when the rats were killed. After 4-week treatment with SCH 42495, circulating levels of ANF were similar in both SCH 42495- and placebo-treated SHR; plasma cyclic GMP was higher, however, in the treated rats than in controls and urinary cyclic GMP increased only with the higher dose of SCH 42495. PRA and plasma ALDO tended to be lower in both SCH 42495-treated groups than in controls, yet BP, diuresis, and natriuresis throughout the study were not different from controls. In contrast, spirapril decreased BP; this effect was associated with significant increments in renin and decrements in ALDO and ANF, without changes in plasma and urinary cyclic GMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "283": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to determine the density and distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the atrioventricular (AV) conducting system and surrounding myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after chronic infusion of perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) for 14 days by osmotic mini-pumps. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured for a period of 4 weeks (2 weeks before and 2 weeks during perindopril infusion) in control and treated animals. Animals infused with vehicle (water) had a mean SBP of 248 mm Hg (measured on day 29); animals treated with perindopril had lower SBP (121 mm Hg, day 29). Perindopril treatment also prevented development of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR. beta-Adrenoceptor densities were measured in the AV node, His bundle, left and right bundle branches (LB, BB), interventricular and interatrial septa (IVS, IAS), mitral valve (MV), right papillary muscle, left and right ventricles (LV, RV), left and right atria (LA, RA), and apex. Perindopril produced no significant change in beta-adrenoceptors in any cardiac region examined. The results suggest that under experimental conditions in which perindopril treatment prevented cardiac hypertrophy and decreased SBP, there was no significant interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and beta-adrenoceptor system in rat heart.", 
    "284": "Three receptors for the tachykinins, NK1, NK2, and NK3, have been defined pharmacologically and have been cloned. We previously demonstrated that in Fisher 344 (F344) rats neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P (SP) cause bronchoconstriction mainly by indirect mechanisms that involve both cholinergic nerves and mast cells. Preliminary results suggested that in a less responsive strain, the BDE strain, tachykinins did not activate airway mast cells. We have now compared in F344 and BDE rats the airway effects of the tachykinins SP and NKA with those of specific NK1 and NK2 receptor agonists and have studied the effect of potent and specific nonpeptide NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonists on NKA-induced airway effects. Lung resistance (RL) and serotonin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL 5HT) were measured in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated, rats. In contrast to F344 rats, BDE rats were less sensitive to SP and NKA challenge, and no subsequent increase in BAL 5HT was observed. In F344 rats, the specific NK1 receptor agonists, [Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP and Ac[Arg6,Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP(6-11), caused a dose-dependent bronchoconstriction and increase in BAL 5HT comparable to those of NKA and SP. The NK1 receptor agonists had no effect in BDE rats. The NK2 receptor agonist [beta Ala8]NKA(4-10) caused a small, dose-dependent increase in RL in the F344 as well as in the BDE rat, but it had no effect on BAL 5HT. The NK1 receptor antagonists RP 67580 and CP 96,345 significantly reduced the increase in RL and BAL 5HT caused by NKA in the F344 rat, but they had no effect on the NKA-induced bronchoconstriction in the BDE rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "285": "Isolated rat kidneys were perfused with T-kinin (TK, Ile-Ser-BK) and bradykinin (BK). HPLC analysis of perfusate samples taken at 2-10 min during the TK perfusion (0.5 nmol/mL initial concentration) showed two peptide peaks, the first one eluting at 14.42 min, the same retention time for standard BK, and the second at 16.20 min, corresponding to that of TK. When BK (0.5 nmol/mL) was perfused, only its corresponding peak was obtained although total BK recovery was reduced quickly, as expected. Using both HPLC analysis and a kinin bioassay on the isolated guinea pig ileum, it was found that 12% of the added TK was converted to BK during the first perfusion cycle (2 min). While the BK recovered (12-14% from the initial TK concentration) was maintained at a similar proportion between the 2nd and the 10th min of perfusion, the rate of TK disappearance, as well as its full recovery from the perfusate, indicated further fragmentation of peptides during kinin perfusion. In the presence of 5 microM DL-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid (Mergetpa), an inhibitor of plasma carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.17.3), the rate of conversion of TK to BK was not affected. On the other hand, the kinase II inhibitor bradykinin potentiating peptide 9a (BPP9a) increased both the proportion of TK converted to BK and the disappearance rate of TK from the perfusate. In the presence of BPP9a, the rate of BK production increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 7.6 +/- 0.9 nmol/min. Furthermore, the recovery of BK was reduced during the first 2 min of perfusion to 7.6% and the conversion rate to 0.9 nmol/min when TK was perfused into the kidney in the presence of 10 microM bestatin, a known inhibitor of aminopeptidases. These data indicate that in the kidney TK is converted to BK, probably by aminopeptidase M, thus suggesting that BK is, in fact, an additional and functional kinin, inducing physiological and/or pathophysiological effects in the rat kidney in which TK is the main kinin released.", 
    "286": "In the treatment of cardiovascular disease, it could be of therapeutic interest to associate the hypotensive effects due to the inhibition of angiotensin II formation with the diuretic and natriuretic responses induced by the protection of the endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Investigation of this hypothesis requires an orally active compound able to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which is involved in renal ANP metabolism. Such compounds have been rationally designed by taking into account the structural characteristics of the active site of both peptidases. Among them, RB 105, N-[(2S,3R)-2-mercaptomethyl-1-oxo-3-phenylbutyl]-(S)-alanine, inhibited NEP and ACE with Ki values of 1.7 +/- 0.3 nM and 4.2 +/- 0.5 nM, respectively. Intravenous infusion of RB 105 in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats prevented the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I and potentiated the natriuretic response to ANP. Infusion of RB 105, at 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg per hr decreased blood pressure dose-dependently in conscious catheterized spontaneously hypertensive rats and increased diuresis and natriuresis. Infusion of RB 105 as a bolus of 25 mg/kg followed by 25 mg/kg per hr similarly decreased blood pressure and increased natriuresis in three different models of hypertension (renovascular, deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt, and spontaneously hypertensive rats). Mixanpril, a lipophilic prodrug of RB 105 (ED50 values when given orally to mice, 0.7 mg/kg for NEP; 7 mg/kg for ACE), elicited dose-dependent hypotensive effects of long duration in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration [-37 mmHg for 50 mg/kg twice a day (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) and is therefore the first dual NEP/ACE inhibitor potentially useful for clinical investigations.",

    "288": "Erythrocytosis (i.e., elevation in red cell mass) frequently develops after renal transplantation and is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic incidents and hypertension. Because it has been reported that enalapril may induce anemia in renal allograft recipients, we have undertaken a prospective study to estimate the efficacy and safety of enalapril therapy for erythrocytosis and to establish the mechanism by which enalapril reduces red cell mass. Seventeen (12 male and 5 female) long-term renal allograft recipients with increased hematocrit value (> 55% for male and > 50% for female) and elevated red cell mass as determined with 51Cr-labeled autologous erythrocytes were treated with enalapril. After 3 months of therapy, enalapril was withdrawn and patients were observed in order to differentiate spontaneous remission of erythrocytosis from effects of enalapril therapy. After 3 months of the treatment, mean hematocrit decreased from 51.1% (range 47-56%) to 42.9% (range 37-51%; P < 0.01). Red cell mass significantly decreased during this period (from 46.7 ml/kg, range 32.5-60.7 ml/kg, to 32.9 ml/kg, range 20.1-60.1 ml/kg; P < 0.01). Serum erythropoietin levels also changed from 12.2 mIU/ml (range 1.0-33.0 mIU/ml) at baseline to 5.4 mIU/ml (range 0.7-24.2 mIU/ml; P < 0.05). During the following 3 months without enalapril treatment, an increase in hematocrit was noted, reaching 51.7% (range 46-58%; P < 0.05). No serious side effects of enalapril were observed during the study, but there was a need to reduce other hypotensive drugs in some patients. Serum creatinine did not change significantly during enalapril therapy (1.49 mg/dl, range 0.9-2.3 mg/dl, and 1.55 mg/dl, range 1.0-2.3 mg/dl; before and after 3 months of therapy, respectively). Our study proves that enalapril can be safely and effectively used to treat posttransplant erythrocytosis. The effect of enalapril on red cell mass results from reducing erythropoietin production.", 
    "289": "In the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, it could be of therapeutic interest to associate the hypotensive effects resulting from the inhibition of angiotensin II formation, ensured by endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), with the diuretic and natriuretic responses due to the protection of the endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from inactivation by epithelial neutral endopeptidase (NEP). However, an investigation of this hypothesis requires an orally active compound able to jointly inhibit ACE and NEP. Dual inhibitors have therefore been designed by a rational approach, based on the characteristics of the active sites of both enzymes, which belong to the same family of zinc metallopeptidases, and on the structures of their most potent and selective inhibitors. As both NEP and ACE contain a large S'1-S'2 domain able to accommodate aromatic residues, the cyclic ACE inhibitor 3-(mercaptomethyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1H-1-benzazocine-1-ace tic acid was selected as a template. Various aliphatic constraints were introduced on the benzyl moiety of the potent NEP inhibitor N-[2-(mercaptomethyl)-3-phenylpropanoyl]-L-tyrosine (IC50 NEP = 2 nM, IC50 ACE = 25 nM) to improve the fit between the computed most stable conformers of these molecules and the ACE template. New dual inhibitors, of general formula, N-[2(R,S)-(mercaptomethyl)-3(R,S)-phenylbutanoyl]-L-amino acid with IC50 values in the nanomolar range for both enzymes were generated by this approach. The separation of the four stereoisomers using chiral amines and the stereoselective synthesis of the 2-(mercaptomethyl)-3-phenylbutanoyl moiety showed that inhibitors with the 2S,3R configuration are the most potent on both NEP and ACE. The \"in vivo\" potency of various prodrugs of these inhibitors to inhibit ACE activity in lung and NEP activity in kidney was measured after oral administration in mice. From this pharmacokinetical study the most potent dual inhibitor RB 105 (N-[(2S,3R)-2-(mercaptomethyl)-3-phenylbutanoyl-L-alanine (compound 44c) (KI NEP 1.7 nM, KI ACE 4.5 nM) and its most efficient in vivo prodrug mixanpril, [N-[(2S,3R)-2-[(benzoylthio)methyl]-3-phenylbutanoyl]-L-alan ine (compound 18) (ED50 NEP approximately 1 mg/kg, ED50 ACE approximately 7 mg/kg) were selected. Competition experiments with a tritiated inhibitor of ACE or NEP bound to mouse lung and kidney membranes respectively showed that mixanpril has a long duration of action (> 8 h).

In all patients a baseline right heart catheterization and simultaneous radionuclide angiogram were performed at rest and during supine exercise (maximum 100 W) as well as 2 hours after oral administration of 10 mg of quinapril. Quinapril reduced heart rate slightly and lowered mean blood pressure at rest and during maximal exercise (p < 0.05).

This transporter facilitates the oral absorption of beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors from the intestine into enterocytes lining the luminal wall. A monoclonal antibody that blocked uptake of cephalexin was used to identify and clone a gene that encodes an approximately 92-kilodalton membrane protein that was associated with the acquisition of peptide transport activity by transport-deficient cells.

An increase in AT1A receptor gene expression in ASMCs of SHRs was induced by treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) for 2 weeks and 4 weeks, but not by other types of antihypertensive drugs such as alpha-blocker (doxazosin), alpha, beta-blocker (arotinolol), Ca antagonist (nicardipine) or vascular smooth muscle relaxant (hydralazine). Since all antihypertensive drugs lowered the blood pressure of the rats almost equally, our results suggest that AT1A receptor gene expression in ASMCs of SHRs may be regulated by the vascular renin-angiotensin system.",

Eligible patients had a MI verified by elevated cardiac enzymes, electrocardiographic changes, and/or chest pain as well as reduced LV function, as shown by echocardiographic evaluation of wall motion index < or = 1.2.

During the treatment period T1, but not T0.01, limited the increase in blood pressure. However, both doses of trandolapril prevented stroke and mortality and strongly opposed (T0.01) or abolished (T1) the increases in saline intake, diuresis, and proteinuria observed in control animals. Simultaneously, trandolapril markedly prevented (T0.01) or abolished (T1) vascular fibrinoid necrosis formation in the brain, kidney, and heart. Finally, trandolapril dose-dependently reduced arterial thickening and glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions in the kidney, as well as arterial thickening, infarction, and fibrosis in the myocardium. At 8 weeks after treatment withdrawal, the antihypertensive effect of T1 had disappeared, but stroke-related mortality and fibrinoid necrosis remained completely suppressed. Further, no additional cerebral, renal, or cardiac lesions developed, and no increase in proteinuria occurred. In the T0.01 group, 17% of the animals died, fibrinoid necrosis tended to develop, organ lesions worsened, and proteinuria strongly increased. We conclude that (1) early ACE inhibition with trandolapril affords a long-lasting protection versus stroke and mortality both during and after the treatment period; and (2) that this beneficial effect is due to the suppression of fibrinoid necrosis formation and not to the drug's antihypertensive action. In contrast, both properties appear to contribute to trandolapril's renal and cardiac protective effects.",

Before treatment, the R group had a higher resting heart rate, a lower cardiac output (-16%), and a higher peripheral resistance (+22%) than the NR group (difference not significant). Moreover, the R group was also observed to have a 33% higher plasma NE level (p < 0.05) in the supine position, associated with a 52% higher NE response to standing (p < 0.05), and a 40% lower number of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes, suggesting a higher sympathetic tone and reactivity in that group.

    "301": "Cardiac hypertrophy due to a chronic mechanical overload puts into play a biologic cascade, including a trigger (the mechanical stretch), a transmitter (very likely to be the phosphoinositol pathway), and the final target (which is the DNA). The permanent changes in genetic expression resulting from the activation of this cascade allows the heart to produce normal active tension at a lower cost in terms of energy expenditure. The process is reversible, providing the treatment reduces the real load on the heart--i.e., not only the peripheral resistances but also the aortic impedance--during a period of time that has to be several times the half-life of cardiac proteins, and also that the treatment has an effect on the detrimental consequences of cardiac hypertrophy, namely, the systolic and diastolic dysfunction and the incidence of arrhythmias. In this report semisenescent spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 3 months with the converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril. The treatment had a rather modest effect on blood pressure but resulted in a pronounced reduction in cardiac hypertrophy and in cardiac fibrosis, an improved coronary reserve, and attenuated both the effects of anoxia on the left ventricular diastolic compliance and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "302": "On the basis of the available data concerning the indications for and the timing of arteriography after thrombolysis, the inevitable conclusion is that conservative instead of aggressive management is indicated for the 40% to 50% of patients at low risk who do not have spontaneous myocardial ischemia or myocardial ischemia that was provoked. Factors to be considered in treatment decisions for individual patients after thrombolytic therapy include risk factors before and after thrombolytic therapy, the results of studies assessing conservative versus aggressive post-thrombolytic management, the accuracy of risk stratification by noninvasive testing, and the relevance of the \"open artery\" hypothesis. The low-risk patient with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 40% and no ischemia during adequate stress testing has a low 3-year mortality rate. Although benefits of routine coronary arteriography exist relative to determining the severity of coronary artery disease and whether the infarct-related artery is patent, selective coronary arteriography is a more feasible and less expensive approach for appropriate patients. The low annual mortality rate with this approach is equal to that obtained when patients undergo routine coronary arteriography with myocardial revascularization based upon the result of the routine procedure. The modification of various coronary risk factors appears as valuable for patients who have undergone thrombolytic therapy as for those who did not. Specifically, the cessation of smoking, the control of hypertension, and the treatment of hypercholesterolemia are indicated for patients after thrombolysis when any of these modifiable risk factors are present. Secondary prevention with pharmacologic agents appears to be similar for those who have undergone standard or thrombolytic therapy. Long-term aspirin therapy is routine for secondary prevention; long-term beta-blocker therapy is useful for high-risk patients; and long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is indicated for patients after thrombolysis who have a low left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "303": "Patients with mild to moderate hypertension require only a simple schedule of investigations, especially if there is a history of stroke or hypertension in first degree relatives. Tests are necessary to profile other cardiovascular risk factors and to detect target organ damage with only limited screening for secondary hypertension. Careful history, physical examination, repeated blood pressure measurements over months and measurements of body mass index, random cholesterol, routine blood chemistry and urinalysis using impregnated paper strips are all that are required. More detailed investigations can be reserved for special groups such as those with peripheral vascular disease or abnormal renal function before or after treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or significant proteinuria or hypokalaemia. Patients with essential hypertension who are smokers with lipid abnormalities may go on to develop superimposed renovascular disease. Severe hypertension at any age and especially if there is a reliable negative family history also merits special consideration. Resistance to antihypertensive treatment is more often due to non-compliance or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or alcohol abuse than to underlying secondary causes.", 
    "304": "Hypertension is about twice as common in diabetics as in non-diabetics. The increased prevalence may relate to insulin resistance and its sequelae. Hypertension is a major risk factor for both large and small vessel disease, contributing to accelerated atherogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. Treating raised blood pressure in diabetics is beneficial in the context of large vessel disease and in slowing progression of overt nephropathy. There is controversy as to whether antihypertensives, and particularly ACE inhibitor drugs, will prevent progression from incipient to overt nephropathy. All the major classes of antihypertensives can be used in diabetics, but the thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers have metabolic side-effects which make them less appropriate as first line agents. The calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors have better metabolic profiles and the latter reduce insulin resistance. ACE inhibitors may also have a renal protective effect in incipient nephropathy although the studies have been fairly short-term and with small patient numbers. Although ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are suitable as first line antihypertensives in diabetics, evidence is still lacking that these drugs reduce morbidity and mortality over and above that seen with other antihypertensives.",

A study of serum and muscle angiotensin-converting enzyme was performed in 50 essential-hypertensive subjects. Muscle tissue was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle by Bergstr\u00f6m needle biopsies. The method used is a modification in Cushman's fluorometric assay for tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme. It utilized 5 mM hippuryl-histidyl-leucine as a synthetic substrate for a 60-min fixed-time incubation at 37 degrees C. The 0.25 ml incubation mixture consisted of 0.12 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.1, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 or 2 mg homogenized muscle tissue. The activity was found to have the properties previously reported for human ACE. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation of the method were 13% and 21%, respectively, for the 1 mg incubation as assessed from internal controls (n = 20). the muscle ACE activity in the hypertensive subjects was 49 +/- 14 mU g-1 (mean +/- SD) with no difference between values for men and women. No correlation was found between muscle ACE activity and age, or between muscle and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. We consider this assay a useful new tool for investigating the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension, as it can be applied to patient materials.", 
    "306": "Due to its longer halflife, the N-terminal of ANF prohormone, ANF(1-98), has plasma concentrations that exceed those of ANF itself by a factor of 10 or more. It is also less prone to rapid changes secondary to hemodynamic alterations. To evaluate the prognostic significance of ANF(1-98) plasma levels in severe heart failure (NYHA IV), the peptide was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from patients randomized to additional treatment with enalapril (n = 78) or placebo (n = 61) (CONSENSUS study). In the placebo group there was a positive relation between mortality after 6 months and baseline ANF(1-98) level. Because of a reduced mortality, especially among patients with high ANF(1-98) levels, there was no such relation in the patients treated with enalapril. For both groups there was a positive relationship between increase in ANF(1-98) after 6 weeks of treatment and mortality, while a decrease signaled a favorable prognosis. It is concluded that the magnitude and changes of plasma ANF(1-98) provide information on prognosis and therapeutic effects with respect to mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Plasma ANF(1-98) may serve as a useful clinical biochemical parameter in the treatment of heart failure.",

Mean plasma cortisol (960 +/- 89.6 nmol/l) was also raised above the reference range mean (554 +/- 28 nmol/l, P < 0.001), as was mean plasma CRH (4.97 +/- 0.5 pmol/l, reference mean 1.52 +/- 0.09 pmol/l, P < 0.001).

During the 3 days following an acute myocardial infarction, plasma CRH, AVP and cortisol fell substantially, and this pattern was not influenced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. By contrast, plasma ACTH showed a significant increase with time. This suggests that the usual relationships between CRH, AVP and ACTH, and between ACTH and cortisol are disturbed in patients admitted to hospital with myocardial infarction. Maximum levels of AVP observed in 12 patients exceeded 50 pmol/l, which may be sufficiently high to interfere with tissue perfusion. It is postulated that V1 AVP receptor antagonists may have a therapeutic application in limiting infarct size.",

To gain an insight into the mechanisms of this form of hypertension we determined the effects of a 13-day therapy with losartan (10 mg/kg) or lisinopril (20 mg/kg) on the blood pressure (BP) and plasma levels of angiotensin (ANG) peptides of mature female TG hypertensive and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The contribution of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) to the maintenance of their hypertension and the response to therapy was evaluated by systemic injection of either NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or endothelin-1. Hypertension in TG rats was associated with decreased plasma ANG I, no differences in plasma ANG II, and plasma ANG-(1-7) near the detectable level. Lisinopril lowered BP more than losartan in both TG hypertensive and normotensive controls. In both strains, the chronic fall in BP produced by lisinopril was accompanied by significant increases in plasma ANG I and ANG-(1-7), while losartan augmented plasma ANG I and ANG II in both strains and plasma ANG-(1-7) in TG rats. Inhibition of NO synthase reversed the fall in BP produced by either lisinopril or losartan in SD controls. In contrast, administration of L-NMMA to TG rats given the same therapy did not. The transient endothelium-mediated relaxing phase of the depressor response to systemic injections of endothelin-1 was attenuated by losartan and lisinopril in TG rats. These studies indicate that hypertension in female TG rats is mediated by the RAS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "314": "Cardiovascular effects of human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (hrIL-1 beta) were investigated in normotensive rats using a computerized analysis of arterial blood pressure in conscious, unrestrained animals. Intravenous injection of hrIL-1 beta induced a rapid and short-lasting rise in blood pressure associated with a first slight tachycardia followed by a second sustained and pronounced increase in heart rate. These effects occurred in a dose-related manner. Pretreatment with a converting-enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) did not modify the hrIL-1 beta-induced increase in blood pressure. Blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors (atenolol) prevented the tachycardia, but did not significantly affect the pressor response to hrIL-1 beta. On the contrary, the hrIL-1 beta-induced increase in blood pressure was inhibited by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin), whereas the tachycardia was untouched. Finally, pretreatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) completely abolished the cardiovascular response to hrIL-1 beta. These results suggest that the hrIL-1 beta-induced pressor response and associated tachycardia require the synthesis of prostaglandins and involve a sympathetic nervous system activation but do not depend on the renin-angiotensin system.",

Under conditions of constant pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure, injections of ANG I, II, and III into the pulmonary arterial perfusion circuit caused dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. Responses to ANG I, II, and III were reproducible with respect to time, and Dup 753, in a dose of 3 nM/ml injected into the perfusion circuit, decreased responses to the three peptides. Dup 753 had no significant effect on pressor responses to norepinephrine, serotonin, or BAY K 8644, and Dup 753 had no significant effect on mean baseline pulmonary arterial or airway pressure. Captopril and enalaprilat, ANG II-converting enzyme inhibitors, decreased the pressor response to ANG I while increasing the pressor response to ANG II and III. In addition, responses to ANG I, II, and III were similar when compared on a molar basis, suggesting the three peptides had similar pressor activity in the isolated perfused rat lung. Pressor responses to the angiotensin peptides were greater compared with responses to pressor agents that increase vascular resistance by various mechanisms, and Dup 753 did not significantly alter the pressor response to ventilatory hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

SHR and WKY received captopril from 4 weeks of age until the time of the experiment to prevent vascular alterations secondary to hypertension. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery, left renal artery, lower abdominal aorta and right carotid artery were monitored in anesthetized SHR and WKY during acute i.v. administration of Ang II at doses of 0, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 ng kg-1 min-1. The heart rate and cardiac output were not significantly affected but the blood pressure was increased to a similar extent in both strains during the Ang II infusion. Hindquarter (aortic) resistance was unaffected by Ang II in both strains. Carotid resistance was slightly increased by the peptide to a similar magnitude in SHR and WKY. The renal and mesenteric vasculature of both strains were highly sensitive to Ang II, with significant dose-related increases in resistance during the infusion. The magnitude of the mesenteric response was not different between SHR and WKY. However, the renal vascular response to Ang II was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. In conclusion, the enhanced responsiveness to i.v. Ang II occurred selectively in the kidney of SHR and not in the other vessels examined.",

Animals were divided into three groups. In group 1, femoral arteries were removed after cardiac perfusion. In groups 2 and 3, right femoral arteries were exposed to 0.1 mL autologous whole blood and wrapped with silastic cuff. Animals in group 3 received cilazapril (10 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. After the perfusion-fixation, femoral arteries were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and processed for morphometric analysis. Vessels from animals in group 2 showed a significant luminal narrowing and morphologic changes throughout the vessel wall, while vessels from animals treated with cilazapril appeared nearly normal. These results suggest that cilazapril may be effective in the prevention of chronic vasospasm.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enhance sodium excretion but by mechanisms still incompletely understood. To test the hypothesis that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ramipril and captopril act in part by enhancing renal 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, the effects of these agents in slices of rat renal outer medulla were examined. Conversion of 3H-corticosterone to 3H-11-dehydrocorticosterone was 58% greater in tissue from fasted rats than from fed rats (mean +/- SE 2467 +/- 146 vs. 1584 +/- 102 pmol/mg protein.h, P < 0.01). Incubation of tissue from fed rats with physiological concentrations of ramiprilat, the active form of ramipril, enhanced activity (1497 +/- 76) to fasted levels (2323 +/- 120, P < 0.02). Captopril had a similar in vitro effect (1557 +/- 92 to 2109 +/- 116, P < 0.01). Ramipril given in vivo to fed rats also increased activity to fasted levels (1716 +/- 101 to 2737 +/- 396, P < 0.05). Angiotensin II incubated with renal tissue from fasted rats suppressed activity to fed levels, but this effect was prevented by the presence of ramiprilat. Both ramipril and captopril enhance renal 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, and this effect is only partly explained by limitation of endogenous angiotensin II production.",

    "342": "Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1-blockers have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, their mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. To investigate the role of kinins in insulin sensitivity, we treated 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats with either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), an alpha 1-blocker (doxazosin), or an angiotensin II antagonist (losartan) for 3 weeks. A control group received no drugs. In addition, 18 rats treated with enalapril or doxazosin received a simultaneous administration of a kinin antagonist (Hoe 140). Glucose clamp testing was performed in each group. Enalapril (128 +/- 1 mmHg) and doxazosin (132 +/- 2 mmHg) decreased mean blood pressure compared with control levels (148 +/- 1 mmHg) (P < .01). The glucose requirement for the clamp test during the administration of enalapril (25.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per minute) or doxazosin (28.6 +/- 0.7 mg/kg per minute) was higher than that of the control group (19.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per minute) (P < .05).

In addition, losartan decreased mean blood pressure but did not affect the glucose requirement. Thus, the improvement in insulin sensitivity produced by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is mostly dependent on kinins but not on angiotensin II antagonism, and an alpha 1-blocker improves insulin sensitivity irrespective of kinins.", 
    "343": "We examined the dose-related effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin and bradykinin peptides by administering perindopril or lisinopril to rats in drinking water for 7 days. A reduction in the ratio of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang I was seen for 0.006 mg/kg per day perindopril, with an increase in plasma renin and Ang I at 0.017 mg/kg per day. Plasma Ang II levels did not decrease until 1.4 mg/kg per day perindopril, at which dose plasma Ang I levels reached a plateau of an approximate 25-fold increase. The effects of perindopril on Ang II and Ang I levels in heart, lung, aorta, and brown adipose tissue were parallel to those observed for plasma. By contrast, renal Ang I levels did not increase, and renal Ang II levels decreased by 40% at 0.017 mg/kg per day, the same threshold seen for the increase in plasma renin. Perindopril increased circulating bradykinin-(1-9) levels approximately eightfold, with a threshold dose of 0.052 mg/kg per day, and increased bradykinin-(1-9) levels in kidney, heart, and lung in parallel with the changes observed for plasma. By contrast, aortic and brown adipose tissue bradykinin-(1-9) and bradykinin-(1-7) levels increased severalfold for perindopril doses as low as 0.006 mg/kg per day. Lisinopril also increased aortic bradykinin-(1-9) and bradykinin-(1-7) levels at doses below the threshold for the decrease in the ratio of Ang II to Ang I. These data indicate that renal Ang II levels and vascular bradykinin-(1-9) levels respond to low doses of converting enzyme inhibitor and may be important mediators of the effects of these compounds. The parallel increases in bradykinin-(1-9) and bradykinin-(1-7) levels in aorta and brown adipose tissue, at inhibitor doses below the threshold for inhibition of Ang I conversion, may result from a mechanism different from inhibition of \"classic\" angiotensin-converting enzyme.",

The contribution of endogenous bradykinin potentiation to the ACE inhibitor actions was assessed by cotreatment of rats with the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (500 micrograms/kg per day SC) from 6 to 20 weeks of age. High- but not low-dose ACE inhibitor treatment prevented the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Chronic bradykinin receptor blockade did not attenuate the antihypertensive and antihypertrophic actions of ramipril. High-dose ramipril treatment improved cardiac function, as demonstrated by an increase in left ventricular pressure (29.9%), dP/dtmax (34.9%), and coronary flow (22.1%), without a change in heart rate. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase and lactate concentration in the coronary effluent were reduced by 39.3%, 55.5%, and 66.7%, respectively. Myocardial tissue concentrations of glycogen and the energy-rich phosphates ATP and creatine phosphate were increased by 31.3%, 39.9%, and 73.7%, respectively, whereas lactate was decreased by 20.8%.

    "345": "Fibronectin expression was studied in the heart of rats given a continuous infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II). Northern blot analysis showed that left ventricular fibronectin steady-state mRNA increased fivefold to eightfold in response to pressor doses of Ang II after 24 hours. Accumulation of immunodetectable fibronectin in the ventricles occurred after the mRNA levels increased. The changes in fibronectin expression were reversible when Ang II treatment was withdrawn. The Ang II-induced increase in fibronectin mRNA accompanied similar increases for collagen type I, collagen type IV, and atrial natriuretic factor steady-state mRNA. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis was identified in both ventricles of angiotensin-treated rats within 3 days. In situ hybridization identified cells associated with areas of fibrosis as the principal site of fibronectin mRNA accumulation in treated animals. By comparison, normal hearts showed fibronectin expression primarily within ventricular vascular tissue and the atrial endocardium. A dose-dependent reduction of fibronectin expression followed treatment with losartan, indicating an Ang II type 1 receptor-mediated effect. Normalization of blood pressure during Ang II infusion by either hydralazine or prazosin had different effects on the level of fibronectin steady-state mRNA, indicating that blood pressure elevation was not the principal factor responsible for fibronectin induction. Concurrent administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with Ang II attenuated the increased fibronectin expression. Our data indicate that Ang II induces an acute fibrotic response within the heart and suggests that Ang II stimulates fibronectin expression within nonmyocytic cardiac cells by a direct action.", 
    "346": "The coronary vascular effect of atrial natriuretic peptide is controversial: Coronary vasodilator as well as constrictor effects have been reported. The controversy may originate from interference of atrial natriuretic peptide with the renin-angiotensin system and/or tachyphylaxis of the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide. The effect of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide bolus application on changes of coronary flow was examined in the isolated, constant-pressure perfused rat heart. Six groups were considered: (1) control group; groups in which the renin-angiotensin system was modulated by pretreatment with continuous infusion of: (2) angiotensin II, (3) the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (4) the angiotensin II receptor blocker saralasin; and groups in which tachyphylaxis was examined by pretreatment with ANP, (5) as continuous infusion and (6) as bolus application. First, in control hearts, dose-response curves were obtained for single ANP dosages of 1-100 nmol. The effect of high dosages (40 and 100 nmol) was biphasic, with an initial vasodilator and subsequent long-lasting vasoconstrictor component. Hearts in which coronary flow was reduced by approximately 18% through continuous angiotensin II infusion showed an enhanced early vasodilator response after ANP administration, whereas the vasoconstrictor effect was no longer observable. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade reduced the vasodilator effect of ANP. In addition, saralasin nearly abolished ANP-induced vasoconstriction, whereas vasoconstriction was unaltered by pretreatment with captopril. Captopril or saralasin alone did not change coronary flow, heart rate and left ventricular developed pressure. In groups (5) and (6). ANP bolus application showed significantly reduced vasomotor activity. We conclude that in the isolated rat heart. ANP has a biphasic effect with early vasodilation and late vasoconstriction. Both effects can be modulated by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system at different levels indicating that vasomotor ANP effects result from interaction of ANP with the local renin-angiotensin system. ANP effects can be markedly reduced by tachyphylaxis.", 
    "347": "In this study, the acute haemodynamic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with intravenous enalaprilat alone or in combination with preload restoration were determined in patients with severe heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction. Ten patients with raised pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP > or = 18 mmHg) were first studied during constant conventional vasodilation with diuretic and inotropic medication, by monitoring central haemodynamics and arterial blood gases. The same variables were measured before enalaprilat infusion, after preload reduction with enalaprilat (1 mg.h-1, rate doubled every 30 min until PAWP decreased > or = 25% or up to total cumulative dose of 10 mg) and after preload restoration with fluid loading (4% albumin given 15 ml.min-1 to restore PAWP to baseline) during continuous low dose enalaprilat infusion. Enalaprilat alone (median dose 0.9 mg) reduced significantly the PAWP (from 25 to 17 mmHg; P = 0.004), the mean arterial pressure (from 87 to 83 mmHg; P = 0.008), the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and the right atrial pressure. The cardiac index, stroke volume index and systemic vascular resistance index remained unchanged. Preload restoration during continuous enalaprilat infusion (median dose of 4% albumin 230 ml, and enalaprilat 0.2 mg) did not further enhance left ventricular function; rather, there was a nearly significant decrease in myocardial perfusion pressure. Arterial oxygenation remained unchanged throughout the study. In conclusion, adding intravenous enalaprilat to conventional therapy makes it possible to relieve pulmonary congestion while maintaining the cardiac function and arterial oxygenation. Preload restoration during continuous ACE inhibition offers no further advantages, and may have adverse effects, since the myocardial perfusion pressure may fall.",

This study examines endothelial cell peptidase expression in vitro by monitoring the metabolism of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by cultured endothelial cells from sheep median eminence. Cleavage of GnRH by median eminence endothelial cell membranes generated GnRH1-5 as the primary stable product, which was then degraded to GnRH1-3 and free amino acids. Degradation of GnRH was completely inhibited by TPCK, ZnCl2 and N-ethylmaleimide, and partially inhibited by EDTA and by a specific inhibitor of the metalloendopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15, CFP-AAY-pAB. Interestingly, an increase in GnRH1-9 production was seen with the latter inhibitors, suggesting a two-step mechanism of GnRH degradation involving a primary cleavage at the Pro9-Gly10-NH2 bond, inhibitable by TPCK, ZnCl2, and NEM, followed by cleavage by EC 3.4.24.15 to generate GnRH1-5. Phosphoramidon and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (as well as other non-specific inhibitors) were without effect, indicating that endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 and angiotensin converting enzyme are not involved. Neither bovine aortic endothelial cell nor AtT-20 cell membranes exhibited this pattern of peptidase activity. Degradation of GnRH by intact median eminence endothelial cells in culture was also observed, suggesting an extracellular orientation for these enzymes; the potential role of such peptidases in the fine regulation of both pituitary function and local blood flow is currently under investigation.",

Captopril (CP) dose-dependently enhanced concanavalin A (Con A)-induced proliferation of T-lymphocytes, with the effective stimulatory concentration range between 0.02-10 mM. The mitogen-induced proliferative response was inhibited at high concentrations (> 10 mM) of CP which affected the number of viable cells. Enalapril dose-dependently inhibited Con A-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation at 0.44-20 mM. This was comparable to the ACE inhibitory peptide, which had a similar range. Enalaprilat, the active parent diacid of enalapril, also showed a weaker inhibitory effect on the Con A-induced proliferative response (4-20 mM). The bioactive peptides had little effect, except at a relatively high concentration. Angiotensin II (Ang II) at 0.05 mM inhibited the Con A-induced proliferative response while [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, a specific antagonist of Ang II, had no effect. Both bradykinin and its specific antagonist, D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7]bradykinin, had no effect on Con A-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. The ACE inhibitors and bioactive peptides had little or no cytotoxic effects, except when present at or more than 5 mM. In conclusion, the effects of ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril on Con A-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation were confirmed after a pilot study recently reported. These effects, especially with the stimulatory effect of CP, are unrelated to their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme and perturbation of the bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II and bradykinin.", 
    "354": "During heart failure, due to increased level of circulating norepinephrine, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR), both at the cardiac and the lymphocytic level, is reduced (down-regulation). Captopril, an ACE-inhibitor containing an SH group appears capable of resetting beta-AR when used in patients with heart failure. Our study was aimed at checking whether captopril exerts a direct effect upon the beta-AR, possibly through its SH group by disulphur binding with cysteine residues located at the binding sites for catecholamines.", 
    "355": "The study was carried out in vitro on human lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers: 10 males (mean age, 34 years; range, 25-45) and 10 females (mean age, 34 years; range 26-48). Lymphocytes were randomly divided in two groups of equal size. Group I were controls; in Group II cells were incubated with three different doses of captopril: 1, 10, and 100 microM. Control lymphocytes and those treated with 10 microM of captopril were exposed to 1 microM isoproterenol. The number of total and surface beta-AR, and the sequestration of beta-AR from isoproterenol under normoxic conditions and after 20 h of hypoxia were checked. Furthermore, the content of cAMP was assayed both in basal conditions and after stimulation with 10 microM and 100 microM isoproterenol and forskolin, respectively.", 
    "356": "Total beta-AR: 1082 +/- 133 (controls) vs. 1174 +/- 94 (treatment with 1 microM captopril), vs. 1237 +/- 88 (10 microM captopril), vs. 1092 +/- 105 (100 microM captopril). Surface beta-AR: 84 +/- 4.41% (controls) vs. 90.5 +/- 2.1% (10 microM captopril). Basal cAMP: 1.21 +/- 0.4 (controls) vs. 1.23 +/- 0.5 pmol/10 cells (1 microM captopril), 1.05 +/- 0.6 pmol/10 cells (10 microM captopril), 1.15 +/- 0.4 pmol/10 cells (100 microM captopril). After 10 microM isoproterenol: controls 4.10 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.30 +/- 0.9 pmol/10 cells (1 microM captopril), 4.15 +/- 0.7 pmol/10 cells (10 microM captopril), 3.50 +/- 1.0 pmol/10 cells (100 microM captopril). After 100 microM forskolin: controls 13.2 +/- 3.1 vs. 11.2 +/- 3.1 pmol/10 cells (1 microM captopril), 13.1 +/- 4.2 pmol/10 cells (10 microM captopril), 12.6 +/- 2.9 pmol/10 cells (100 microM captopril). Neither of these differences were significant. Lymphocytic beta-AR exposed to hypoxia did not show any significant difference. Exposure to captopril did not cause any further alteration on beta-AR sequestration.", 
    "357": "Captopril does not seem to exert any direct action upon lymphocyte beta-AR from healthy volunteers. Moreover, captopril does not modify cAMP storage either in basal conditions or after stimulation with isoproterenol or forskolin. Therefore our data suggest that action of captopril on beta-AR is probably due to the inhibition of both systemic and tissue ACE-system.", 
    "358": "A quality of life ancillary study was incorporated into the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial of captopril versus placebo among patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction with compromised ventricular functioning, but no overt heart failure. Assessments included patient symptoms, health perceptions, emotional, cognitive, social and sexual levels of functioning, as well as potential covariates, such as life events and social support. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the quality of life measures in the SAVE at baseline, and provide a pre-randomization profile of the SAVE patients. One hundred and eighty-four patients participated in this aspect of the trial. Reliability alpha coefficients were adequate or better for all questionnaires, except for life events and sexual activities. Consistent with prior studies, the quality of life parameters were uncorrelated with ventricular ejection fraction. Despite experiencing a recent myocardial infarction with compromised ventricular functioning, patients at baseline generally neither appeared depressed nor focused on symptoms. The baseline findings support the inclusion of the quality of life ancillary study in the overall SAVE trial because of the independent contribution likely to be achieved in terms of evaluating both disease progression and treatment efficacy.", 
    "359": "To clarify the effect of the calcium antagonist Nifedipine and the ACE inhibitor Enalapril on cardiac autonomic activity, power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (PSA) was conducted in 39 elderly patients with essential hypertension (mean age: 63: +/- 11 years) before and after treatment. Twenty patients were treated with 10-20 mg of Nifedipine (N group) and 19 with 5 mg of Enalapril (E group) for 3 months. beta-blocker (Atenolol 12.5 mg) was added to Nifedipine in 12 patients of the N group for 1 month, and the modified effect of Atenolol on cardiac autonomic activity was also evaluated. Blood pressures were significantly reduced in both N and E groups after the treatment. The low frequency component (LF) in PSA, which was considered to be a quantitative marker of cardiac sympathetic activity, increased significantly and the high frequency component (HF), which was a marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity, significantly decreased with increase of PNA levels in N group after the treatment. However, the LF decreased significantly after addition of Atenolol. On the other hand, there was little significant change in LF and PNA in E group. These results suggest that Nifedipine increased cardiac sympathetic activity and that Enalapril had little influence on the cardiac sympathetic tone, while both antihypertensive agents significantly reduced blood pressure itself.", 
    "360": "1. The influence of salt (sodium chloride; NaCl) (an additional 6% in the diet) and that of a novel sodium-reduced, potassium-, magnesium-, and L-lysine-enriched salt alternative on the cardiovascular effects of ramipril was studied in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats in a 6-week study. The intake of sodium chloride was adjusted to the same level by adding the salt alternative at a 1.75 times higher amount than regular salt. 2. Salt produced a marked rise in blood pressure and induced cardiac hypertrophy and significant mortality, while the salt alternative neither increased blood pressure nor caused any mortality and produced less cardiac hypertrophy than salt. 3. Ramipril treatment at a daily dose of 3 mg kg-1 normalized blood pressure and prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy of rats on control diet. These effects of ramipril were blocked by the addition of salt but were only slightly attenuated by the addition of the salt alternative. The mortality in the salt group was prevented by ramipril. 4. Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the study. Salt, but not the salt alternative, increased vascular contractile responses to noradrenaline. Ramipril treatment improved the arterial relaxation responses to acetylcholine and to sodium nitroprusside. The vascular relaxation enhancing effect of ramipril was blocked by salt but only slightly attenuated by the salt alternative. 5. Ramipril treatment did not significantly increase plasma renin activity in the presence or in the absence of salt supplementation. The salt alternative did not cause hyperkalaemia, either alone or in combination with ramipril treatment. 6. Both salt supplementations, irrespective of ramipril treatment, induced a six to eight fold increase in the urinary excretion of calcium. There was an expected 90 to 140% rise in the urinary excretion of magnesium and 200% rise in the urinary excretion of potassium in the salt alternative group. Salt also produced an approximately 50% increase in magnesuria.7. Our findings suggest that replacement of salt by the potassium-, magnesium- and L-lysine-enriched salt alternative improves the cardiovascular effects of ramipril. In the present study the beneficial effect was related to the increased intakes of potassium and/or magnesium and L-lysine from the salt alternative because the amount of sodium chloride was the same.", 
    "361": "The ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was recorded for 24 hours in 28 untreated hypertensive patients, and mean values of systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured over 24 hours, during the day-time (6:00 to 19:30), and during the night-time (20:00 to 5:30). M-mode echocardiography was performed and several parameters of left ventricular size were calculated. In addition, 13 men of 18 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) received long-term treatment with enalapril, and ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiographic measurement were performed in 10 of these patients 6 months after active treatment ended. In all 28 patients, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was significantly related to 24-hour, day-time and night-time SBP. Other parameters of hypertrophy were correlated with 24-hour and/or night-time BP, but not with day-time BP. In patients with LVH, night-time DBP was significantly higher and the night-time decline in DBP was significantly less than in those without LVH. The 6-month treatment with enalapril clearly decreased casual and ambulatory BP and reduced LVMI. The reduction of LVMI was strongly correlated with the decrease in night-time SBP and DBP compared with the decrease in day-time BP. These observations indicate that LVH is related to 24-hour BP (especially night-time BP) and that the regression of this condition may be related to a decline in night-time BP.", 
    "362": "Ten patients who had their blood pressure controlled with enalapril (10 mg, n = 4; 20 mg, n = 6) and 10 control subjects on perindopril (4 mg, n = 6; 8 mg, n = 4) entered a double-blind crossover study. They received placebo or the active drug 1 week apart and had their blood pressure measured at 0, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h. Then they crossed over to the other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (4 mg perindopril congruent to 10 mg enalapril) and the double-blind study was repeated. Blood pressure control 2 to 4 h after drug administration was similar with both drugs (perindopril = 150 +/- 2/80 +/- 1; enalapril = 150 +/- 2/81 +/- 1). Twenty-four h after administration of perindopril blood pressure was lower than on enalapril (perindopril = 154 +/- 3/85 +/- 2; enalapril = 159 +/- 3/89 +/- 2). Enalapril, 2 to 4 h after administration, caused a greater decrease than placebo, whereas the change with perindopril did not differ from placebo. Twenty-four hours after receiving the active drug the blood pressure of subjects on perindopril did not differ from the peak effect when corrected for placebo and circadian variation, whereas the blood pressure on enalapril was higher. This study indicates that perindopril in the doses used has a longer duration of action than enalapril and is more suited to once daily use.", 
    "363": "The impact of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women has rarely been systematically evaluated in large clinical trials using drugs from the new generations of pharmaceutic preparations. We carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309 hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation. Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women.", 
    "364": "Increased dietary intake of regular salt (sodium chloride) interferes markedly with the therapeutic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. To study further the interactions between dietary salt intake and antihypertensive drug treatment, we examined the effects of felodipine, a dihydropyridine derivative Ca2+ channel antagonist with natriuretic properties, on blood pressure and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats during different levels of sodium chloride in the diet. We also compared the influence of regular salt on the cardiovascular effects of felodipine with that of a novel K(+)-, Mg(2+)- and l-lysine-enriched and Na(+)-reduced salt alternative, which in previous studies markedly improved the therapeutic effects of enalapril and ramipril. During the 28-day experiment regular salt produced a marked rise in blood pressure and induced left ventricular hypertrophy, while the salt alternative neither induced any rise of blood pressure nor caused cardiac hypertrophy. Felodipine had an enhanced antihypertensive effect during the increased intake of sodium chloride, and lowered the blood pressure to the same normotensive level as it did during the control and the salt alternative diets. Felodipine also completely blocked the development of the sodium chloride-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The heart rate of the felodipine-treated animals was significantly increased during the first two study weeks but thereafter it did not differ from that of the controls. Hence, unlike regular salt, the novel Na(+)-reduced, K(+)-, Mg(2+)-, and l-lysine-enriched salt alternative did not raise blood pressure and produced little if any left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "365": "The effects of dialyzer membrane material and concurrent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on plasma bradykinin levels during hemodialysis were investigated. Six patients treated with an ACE inhibitor and 6 other patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor underwent three consecutive hemodialysis sessions with an AN-69 dialyzer and three sessions with a polysulfone dialyzer. The sequence of dialyzers (AN-69 followed by polysulfone or the reverse) was determined randomly. With the AN-69 membrane dialyzer, the plasma bradykinin level at the dialyzer outlet was significantly greater than that at the dialyzer inlet at 5 min but not at 10 min after initiation of dialysis, whereas no significant difference between inlet and outlet bradykinin concentrations was observed at either time with the polysulfone membrane dialyzer. The changes in plasma bradykinin level in patients with concurrent ACE inhibitor did not differ from those found in patients without ACE inhibitor. These results indicate that the AN-69 membrane stimulates bradykinin production at the initial stage of hemodialysis in patients with as well as without concurrent ACE inhibitor. Further study is necessary to clarify the exact role of ACE inhibitor in elevation of bradykinin levels during hemodialysis.", 
    "366": "The isolated vascular effects of intravenous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat were investigated. Thirty male patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. According to a randomized sequence, 0.04 mg kg-1 enalaprilat (low-dose, n = 10), 0.08 mg kg-1 (high-dose, n = 10) enalaprilat or saline solution as placebo (control group, n = 10) was given as an i.v. bolus during CPB. Changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and venous reservoir (RV) of the extracorporeal circulation were studied as indices of arterial resistance and venous capacitance. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and peripheral vascular resistance (SVR) were significantly more reduced in the high-dose enalaprilat group (MAP: -36 mm Hg after 9 min; SVR: -836 dyn s cm-5) than in the low-dose group (MAP: -13 mm Hg after 10 min). Volume of the reservoir (RV) decreased in both enalaprilat treated groups indicating additional (dose-dependent) venous pooling effects of the substance (low-dose: -300 ml; high-dose: -520 ml; control group: -100 ml). Skin capillary blood flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) increased after injection of 0.04 mg kg-1 enalaprilat, whereas it decreased significantly when MAP fell markedly in patients treated with high-dose enalaprilat. I.v. enalaprilat had dose-dependent vasodilating properties in the arterial and venous vessel system indicating reduction in pre- and afterload. Microcirculation in both enalaprilat treated groups improved as long as reduction in blood pressure was not limited.", 
    "367": "To determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on exercise tolerance and muscle blood flow (BF) to ischemic limbs, both femoral arteries of male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 325 g) were surgically stenosed. Rats were either active (treadmill run, 20 m/min (a) 15% grade, 5 d/wk for 3 wk) or sedentary (limited to cage activity), and assigned to one of three doses of zabicipril at 0.0 (zero), 0.3 (low), and 3.0 (high) mg.kg-1.d-1 administered via food intake (N = 14-15/group). After 3 weeks, the left carotid and caudal arteries were catheterized under anesthesia for BF measurement later in the day. Muscle BF was determined during exercise at two treadmill speeds (20 and 30 m/min) with 85Sr and 141Ce labeled microspheres to ensure a peak BF. Plasma ACE was inhibited 31%, 65% in the low- and high-dose sedentary rats and 75%, 74% in the low- and high-dose active animals, respectively (P < 0.001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improved exercise tolerance by 3 weeks, at a low speed (20 m/min) in the sedentary groups (P < 0.025) and in a dose-dependent manner at a higher speed (25 m/min) in the active groups (P < 0.001). Blood pressures and heart rates during running were not different among groups. However, total hindlimb BF, reduced to approximately 33% of normal by femoral stenosis, was increased by ACE inhibition and chronic activity in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.025). Blood flows to the plantar flexors were most improved (approximately 20-40%; to 124 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1) in the high-dose groups (P < 0.01). The higher run speed did not increase BF above the low speed. Training adaptation, indicated by an enhanced muscle mitochondrial content (P < 0.001), was similar for low- and high-dose active animals. Our results indicate that ACE inhibition improves BF to ischemic muscles and, together with chronic physical activity, improves exercise tolerance. The results from this study support those advocating ACE inhibition in managing appropriate patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency.",

Besides raised blood pressure, the necessary inclusion criterion was the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiogram. After a wash-out period, all patients were given placebo followed by the active drug benazepril at a dose of 10 mg once a day. For those patients who did not achieve a satisfactory control of the blood pressure (BP) 25 mg of chlorthalidone was added. All patients underwent 180 days of benazepril treatment.",

    "372": "Intravenous infusion of various doses of Ang II caused significant increases of the salt intake in S-D rats as a result of natriuretic action of the drug. The phenomenon could be abolished by administration of aldosterone but unaffected by adrenalectomy. Captopril could suppress the Ang II effect. Discrepancies with a previous work on the interpretation of the action mode of Ang II were discussed.", 
    "373": "The dynamics was analysed of changes of arterial blood pressure, plasma kininogen and prekallikrein concentrations and plasma renin activity (PRA) in 50 patients with arterial hypertension, in relation to the type of blood pressure response to captopril. It was shown that after three weeks of treatment with captopril 150 mg daily, in 23 patients (46%) normalization of systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred, and in 27 patients (54%), despite a significant reduction, blood pressure normalization was not achieved. In both groups of patients a significant decrease of plasma kininogen concentration and an increase of plasma prekallikrein level were found, indicating kininogenase activation and PRA increase. However, only in patients with arterial blood pressure normalization, a return of kininogen concentration to normal value was observed and a twofold increase of PRA in relation to the initial value was noted. Our studies indicate that in patients with arterial hypertension treated with captopril a correlation appears between the changes of plasma kinin system and PRA which determines the mode of blood pressure reaction to captopril.", 
    "374": "1. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is mediated by endogenous opioids. Naloxone was used to evaluate the effects of the latter on systolic time intervals (STI) and Valsalva manoeuvre-induced blood pressure and heart rate changes. 2. Baseline recordings were done in 12 healthy male volunteers and repeated 2 h after oral administration of 75 mg of captopril and again after naloxone 0.4 mg/kg was administered intravenously over 10 min. 3. After captopril there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.02) and mean blood pressure (P < 0.04) without any changes in heart rate. Furthermore, captopril increased the Valsalva ratio (P < 0.06) but did not influence inotropism as indicated by STI. Naloxone did not influence any of these findings. 4. The changes in the Valsalva ratio after captopril were mediated by an increase in the maximum bradycardia in nine of the 12 subjects. 5. The results indicate that endogenous opioids do not play a role in the putative sympatholytic effect of ACE inhibition.", 
    "375": "Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 and < or = 115 mmHg) and renal dysfunction entered one of two studies to assess the safety of efficacious daily doses of quinapril on renal function and blood pressure. Twenty-four patients with moderate renal impairment (MRI) (creatinine clearance > 30 and < or = 60 ml/min) entered 24 weeks of open-label quinapril treatment; 31 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) entered 16 weeks of open-label quinapril treatment. Patients with MRI initially received quinapril 5 mg once daily (qd) followed by titration to a maximum dosage of 40 mg/day (furosemide optional at 40 mg only). Patients with CRF initially received quinapril 2.5 mg qd and were titrated up to 20 mg/day (furosemide optional). Open-label quinapril treatment resulted in significant decreases in mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. The 20 patients with MRI and the 28 with CRF who completed the open-label phase were then randomly assigned to continue active drug or to receive placebo in a 4-week, double-blind, drug-withdrawal phase. During the double-blind withdrawal phase, placebo-treated patients had significant increases in mean SBP and DBP from the end of open label. Creatinine clearance was essentially unchanged following open-label quinapril treatment or quinapril withdrawal. In conclusion, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and renal dysfunction, quinapril in dosages of 5-40 mg qd for patients with MRI and 2.5 to 20 mg qd for patients with CRF significantly reduces blood pressure without adversely affecting renal function.", 
    "376": "There is increasing evidence that both neurohumoral and hemodynamic factors play a role in disease progression in chronic heart failure (CHF). To examine the influence of the oral dopamine agonist ibopamine on these factors, we studied 20 rats with chronic myocardial infarction and CHF, and compared them with 20 normal rats. After 6 weeks, rats were randomly divided between control treatment (50%) or ibopamine (50%) for 3 weeks. At the end of the study, plasma and tissue neurohumoral parameters, as well as hemodynamics, were determined. In infarcted rats, the elevated plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels were reduced by ibopamine (251 +/- 19 vs. 138 +/- 32 pg/ml; p < 0.05). Other plasma neurohormones measured (epinephrine, renin, aldosterone, and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE]) were not significantly increased in rats with myocardial infarction and were not affected by ibopamine. Cardiac (tissue) ACE was increased in infarcted rats (12.1 +/- 1.9 U/l/min) and was significantly lowered by ibopamine (9.6 +/- 1.0 U/l/min; p < 0.05); renal ACE was unaffected. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar in the two groups and were not influenced by ibopamine treatment. In conclusion, in chronic myocardial infarction and CHF in rats, ibopamine reduces the elevated levels of PNE and cardiac ACE. Further research will be needed to determine whether this effect may lead to a favorable influence on disease progression in CHF.", 
    "377": "Both the sulphated and non-sulphated forms of cholecystokinin (CCK) octapeptide are susceptible to hydrolysis by the cell-surface peptidases endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP), angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidase N (AP-N). Indirect studies have previously implicated an elastase-like serine endopeptidase in CCK metabolism in brain. We have therefore compared the hydrolysis of CCK, in both sulphated and non-sulphated forms by solubilized membrane preparations from the human astrocytoma clone D384 and the neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y. Selective peptidase inhibitors were used to elucidate the principal activities involved in CCK metabolism. In the glial cell line the hydrolysis of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), sulphated or non-sulphated, was inhibited predominantly by the NEP inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PR). In contrast, in the neuroblastoma line, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was seen to play a major role in metabolism of CCK-8 with a lesser effect attributable to NEP but with some differences between sulphated and non-sulphated forms reflecting the preference of ACE for CCK-8ns. In neither cell line was a significant effect of the serine peptidase inhibitor Dip-F seen on CCK metabolism arguing against the presence of a putative CCK-degrading serine peptidase in these cell lines. Both NEP and ACE remain as candidates for inactivation of CCK at the cell surface.", 
    "378": "A negative calcium balance has previously been described in human hypertension with low levels of plasma ionized calcium (Ca2+) and an increased urinary excretion of calcium. The cause of this disturbance in mineral metabolism is not known, nor is it known if this derangement could be abolished if blood pressure is reduced by antihypertensive treatment. In the present investigation, the effects of antihypertensive monotherapy on serum and fasting urinary electrolytes were studied. For 3 to 6 months, 319 hypertensive patients entered 17 study groups, each group using one of the following antihypertensive drugs: dilevalol, metoprolol, antenolol, pindolol, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, bendrofluomethiazide, furosemide, spironolactone, doxazocine, prazocine, diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, isradipine, captopril, or lisinopril. Treatment with different beta-blockers, as well as diuretics, reduced the fasting urinary calcium excretion (P < .001). However, while the beta-blockers increased the proportion of the ionized form of calcium in blood (Ca2+) (P < .001), Ca2+ was further decreased by diuretic treatment (P < .05). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors caused no major changes in mineral metabolism while of the calcium antagonists studied only verapamil raised the levels of Ca2+ (P < .01). No significant relationship between the changes in mineral metabolism and the reduction in blood pressure was observed in any of the treatment groups. Of the antihypertensive drugs used in the present study, beta-blockers appeared to reverse the basic abnormality with regard to calcium balance, suggesting that the activity of the sympathetic nerve system is involved in the disturbed calcium metabolism seen in hypertensive patients.", 
    "379": "The objectives of drug therapy--present and future--for the treatment of raised blood pressure are to prevent the morbid and fatal events which arise in individual patients as a consequence of poorly controlled levels of elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. The target levels of blood pressure require to be achieved without adverse effects at an affordable cost, over a prolonged period of years. The factors affecting the choice of drugs in such patients include the 'profiling' of the blood pressure to assess the severity of the hypertension, associated diseases and risk factors, concurrent therapy, inter-individual variations in response between patients and cost-effectiveness.",

Forty cases of RAS were treated exclusively by antihypertensive drugs. A good result was obtained in 82.5% of cases. Thirty three transluminal angioplasties (TLA) were performed in 23 children with 26 RAS. A good clinical result was obtained in 15 children with a total of 17 stenoses, corresponding to a success rate of 65%. Transluminal dilatation of anastomotic stenoses always failed. There were no cases of transplant thrombosis. Eleven RAS were operated, including 5 after failure of TLA. Eight patients (73%) obtained a clinical improvement. There were 2 postoperative thromboses. Antihypertensive treatment must be administered in every case. If medical treatment fails, and with the exception of anastomotic stenoses, TLA should be the first-line procedure, while surgery is reserved for failures of TLA and for anastomotic stenoses.", 
    "381": "There is ample evidence that antihypertensive therapy prevents strokes, congestive heart failure, and other blood pressure-related complications, but most trials have failed to show a reduction in coronary events and mortality. Recently, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) showed a reduction in MIs and other coronary events in older patients with moderate to severe ISH. Cardiovascular mortality was also reduced and there was a trend toward a reduction in coronary events in the Swedish STOP-Hypertension Trial and the British MRC Trial in Older Patients. These studies have in common the use of diuretics and/or beta blockers. Although there are no similar long-term data with calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, they will be the drugs of choice for many patients, based on individual responses and accompanying medical conditions.",

Most patients with uncomplicated hospital courses should undergo exercise testing and assessment of the ejection fraction. Aspirin and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents should be prescribed to most patients, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and cholesterol-lowering drugs should be administered when indicated. Psychologic issues unique to myocardial infarction must be addressed, and an appropriate exercise program should be prescribed. The goal is to help patients achieve the functional status they had before the infarction.",

One hundred forty-one subjects with class II or III heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 0.40, and background therapy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics were given an initial challenge dose of bucindolol 12.5 mg. One hundred thirty-nine subjects (99 with IDC, 40 with ISCDC) tolerated challenge and were randomized to treatment with placebo or bucindolol 12.5 mg/d (low dose), 50 mg/d (medium dose), or 200 mg/d (high dose). At the end of 12 weeks, left ventricular function and other parameters were measured and compared with baseline values. There was a dose-related improvement in left ventricular function in bucindolol-treated subjects. In the high-dose bucindolol group, radionuclide-measured LVEF improved by 7.8 EF units (%) compared with 1.8 units in the placebo group (P < .05), and compared with the placebo group, a greater percentage of subjects had an increase in LVEF by > or = 5 units. In contrast, all three bucindolol doses prevented deterioration of myocardial function as defined by an LVEF decline of > or = 5 units.",

    "386": "The renin angiotensin system is a major contributor to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. For this reason, attempts to specifically block this system have been a pharmacological goal for over 25 years. Blockade of the renin system has been attempted at 3 pivotal sites: the rate limiting angiotensinogen-renin step, conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and the active receptor sites for the terminal products of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been successfully studied and utilised in clinical cardiovascular disorders, but questions persist regarding the specificity of their action. Thus, other more specific approaches remain under evaluation. Inhibition of the action of renin on angiotensinogen was demonstrated with early inhibitory peptides and in experimental studies with specific antibodies. Most currently available renin inhibitors are nonpeptides, which nonetheless require intravenous administration. An oral renin inhibitor with clinical effects has been evaluated in early human trials. Like renin inhibitors and converting enzyme inhibitors, specific angiotensin antagonists were studied early in the course of renin system pharmacological blockade. Early angiotensin antagonists were limited, due to the requirement for intravenous administration and because of their short half-lives. They also had the potential for mixed agonist/antagonist physiological and pharmacological effects, which could result in a pressor, rather than a depressor, response. The angiotensin receptor antagonists have the appeal of blocking the specific receptor at its target tissue site, analogous to other well described systems. Newer angiotensin antagonists do not have the limitations of the precursor peptides. Losartan (DUP753) is a specific angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist. It is orally effective without agonist activity, and has high receptor binding characteristics. Early studies indicate that it is a specific probe of the renin system, and is providing newer insights into the role of the renin system in cardiovascular disorders. Emerging clinical studies indicate that it is effective for blood pressure reduction and as a vasodilator. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone have been available for decades. Spironolactone is being used in an ongoing trial to assess the impact of combined converting enzyme and aldosterone inhibition. Newer aldosterone antagonists could add to targeted blockade of aldosterone without the adverse effects of the precursor compound, and the potential for combined specific renin system blockade.", 
    "387": "The possible influence of an intracellular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on control of cell communication in heart muscle was investigated in cell pairs isolated from adult rats. Junctional conductance (gj) was measured with two separated voltage-clamp circuits. Intracellular dialysis of angiotensin I (AI 10(-8) M) caused a decrease in gj of 76% (SE +/- 3.4) (p < 0.05) in 7 min. The effect of AI appears to be due mainly to its conversion to AII because enalaprilat (10(-9) M) dialysed into the cell caused an appreciable reduction in the effect of AI. AII (10(-8) M) alone caused a decrease in gj of 60% (SE +/- 3.8) (p < 0.05) in 45 s. The effect of AII on gj was suppressed by previous inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), but enalaprilat could not alter the effect of the peptide. The results indicate that synthesis of AII inside cardiac myocytes plays an important role in modulation of gj and consequently on propagation of the electrical impulse in heart. The effect of AII on gj was blocked by DuP-753 (10(-9) M) administered intracellularly, whereas (Sar1Val5AlA8) AII also caused a slight decrease (1.97 +/- 0.07%) in gj. These findings indicate that an intracellular receptor is involved in the effect of the peptide on gj.", 
    "388": "We investigated the role of bradykinin (BK) in cardioprotection elicited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is isolated guinea pig heart performing pressure-volume work. Cardiac output (CO), coronary blood flow (CBF), and external heart work (EHW) were determined before and after ischemia and reperfusion (15 min each). Furthermore, the glutathione (GSH) content of hearts and the release of glutathione in coronary venous effluent were measured, as was lactate production. Addition of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat (RT) to the perfusate throughout the experiment improved postischemic function significantly (55% recovery of EHW for 25 microM RT vs. 30% for controls). RT was cardioprotective even if only given at onset of reperfusion (50% recovery). BK (0.1 and 1 nM) was similarly beneficial (55 and 76% recovery of EHW, respectively). The BK2-receptor antagonist HOE 140 (10 nM) inhibited the RT effect and attenuated the effect of 1 nM BK. Total CBF during reperfusion, lactate production, intracellular levels of GSH, and release of oxidized GSH (GSSG) did not differ among the groups. In contrast, release of reduced GSH during the first 5 min of reperfusion was considerably influenced by pharmacologic intervention, correlating inversely with postischemic heart function. Coapplication of Hoe 140 prevented the changes in GSH release. Our results demonstrate that BK, formed endogenously in the heart, is responsible for cardioprotection by the ACE inhibitor RT in isolated guinea pig heart and decreases GSH release during reperfusion. The exact mechanisms leading to hemodynamic improvement and metabolic changes by BK remain unclear.", 
    "389": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor perindopril on serum lipids and apolipoprotein concentrations were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 51 hyperlipidemic patients treated for mild hypertension. Perindopril was given as a single morning dose (4 mg) for 6 weeks. During the treatment period, blood pressure (BP) was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced from 159/99 to 148/90 mm Hg by verum treatment and from 158/101 to 151/95 mm Hg (NS) by placebo treatment. Neither total cholesterol and triglycerides nor high-density-lipoprotein and apolipoprotein AI and B levels were significantly altered by drug treatment as compared with placebo. Although perindopril had good antihypertensive effect in patients with mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia, it had no adverse effects on lipid metabolism in these patients. Therefore, perindopril is recommended for antihypertensive treatment, especially in hypertensive patients with concomitant hyperlipidemia.", 
    "390": "To determine whether cardiac unloading by inhibition of angiotensin I (AI) to AII conversion by captopril or blockade of the AII receptor (AT1) by losartan was more effective in prevention of the detrimental hemodynamic consequences of myocardial infarction (MI), inhibition of metabolic production of AII by captopril was compared with blockade of AT1 with losartan in Sprague-Dawley rats with large MI. Infarcts were created by surgical occlusion of the left main coronary artery and oral drug therapy initiated immediately and continued until hemodynamic evaluation seven days later. Heart weight was unchanged in untreated infarcted animals, whereas captopril reduced heart weight in control animals and losartan increased heart weight in infarcted animals. Left ventricular (LV) peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lower in treated and untreated infarcted animals. Although captopril reduced end-diastolic pressure (EDP) to a greater degree than losartan, all infarcted group showed an increase in this parameter with respect to similarly treated controls. LV peak rates of pressure increase and decay in infarcted hearts were decreased significantly more by captopril than by losartan administration. Captopril also impaired right side cardiac function more than losartan when peak rate of pressure increase was evaluated. Thus, inhibition of the effects of AII during cardiac failure improved but did not normalize cardiac pump performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "391": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is markedly induced after balloon injury in the rat aorta, where it may serve to mediate vascular repair. Because the bioavailability of IGF-I is modulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), we examined the regulation of IGFBPs by IGFs in primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Serum-deprived SMC-conditioned medium contains IGFBPs of 38 to 45 kD (only in confluent cultures), 30 kD (possibly IGFBP-2), 28 kD, and 24 kD (IGFBP-4), the latter being the most abundant. IGF-I and IGF-II but not insulin evoked a marked decrease of IGFBP-4 as early as 4 hours after treatment. IGFBP-4 mRNA abundance, however, was entirely unaffected by IGF-I for up to 48 hours. IGF-I analogues with high affinity for the IGF-I receptor and weak affinity for IGFBP paradoxically evoked a small increase in IGFBP-4, probably through a general increase in protein synthesis. IGF-I only minimally decreased IGFBP-4 content in medium of sparse cultures, whereas it completely abolished IGFBP-4 content in conditioned medium of superconfluent SMCs. IGF-I also evoked a concentration-dependent increase in the abundance of IGFBP-3 in confluent, but not sparse, SMCs without affecting IGFBP-3 mRNA. Addition of IGF-I to cell-free medium conditioned by confluent, but not by sparsely cultured, SMCs led to rapid degradation of IGFBP-4. Interestingly, IGFBP-4 mRNA was markedly induced in confluent relative to sparsely grown SMCs in an IGF-I independent fashion. Thus, both biosynthesis and IGF-dependent proteolysis of IGFBP-4 are increased in confluent SMCs. Proteolysis was maximal at 37 degrees C and was abrogated by EDTA and by benzamidine. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the plasmin inhibitor bdellin had minor inhibitory activity, whereas aprotinin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and N-ethylmaleimide were without effect. The protease does not affect the structure of IGF-I as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography of 125I-IGF-I incubated for up to 24 hours with SMC-conditioned medium containing IGFBP-4. In summary, SMCs elaborate a cation-dependent protease in a confluence-dependent fashion, which degrades bound IGFBP-4 and likely releases free structurally intact IGF-I, presumably to interact with the cell surface receptor and/or other IGFBPs.", 
    "392": "In vitro absorption of three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril and lisinopril, and their stabilities in aqueous buffer as well as their resistance to intestinal and dermal tissue homogenates were investigated. The results demonstrate that the spontaneous oxidation of captopril, enalapril and lisinopril followed first-order degradation kinetics in McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer. The degradation rates for enalapril and lisinopril were much slower than that for captopril. With the former two ACE inhibitors, the first-order rate constants of breakdown in the presence of dermal homogenate were not significantly different from the control values. Intestinal homogenate increased the decomposition of both of these inhibitors when compared to the enzyme-free control systems. On the other hand, the first-order rates of disappearance of captopril in the presence of both dermal and intestinal homogenates were lower than in the enzyme-free system. The extent of reduction was proportional to the amount of homogenate added. This suggests that tissue homogenates prevent the oxidation of captopril to its disulphide dimer. Transport experiments show that the amounts of ACE inhibitors transferred from solution on the mucosal side increased linearly with incubation time over the 2 hr of study. The rates of transfer from the mucosal side to the serosal side had the following rank order: captopril > enalapril > lisinopril roughly in the ratio 1:1.13:1.27. Addition of harmaline caused a significant reduction in the transfer rate of captopril compared to the control system, which strongly suggests that captopril is transported by a sodium-dependent carrier-mediated process across intestinal tissue.", 
    "393": "Diabetic nephropathy affects approximately 35% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and about 5% to 10% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diabetic kidney disease can be detected early by special methods that measure microalbuminuria in the range of 15 to 140 micrograms/min or 0.02 to 0.20 g/d. Specific strategies have been proved beneficial in patients with this early diabetic kidney disease, also called \"incipient nephropathy.\" Protein restriction, tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure, and specific therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown independently to reduce microalbuminuria and preserve renal function in these patients. We review the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease and discuss the effects of these treatment strategies on the renal, cardiovascular, metabolic, and other abnormalities found in early (incipient) and overt diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "394": "Many theories of memory postulate that processing of information outlasts the learning situation and involves several different physiological substrates. If such physiologically distinct mechanisms or stages of memory do in fact exist, they should be differentially affected by particular experimental manipulations. Accordingly, a selective improvement of the processes underlying short-term memory should be detectable only while the information is encoded in the short-term mode, and a selective influence on long-term memory should be detectable only from the moment when memory is based on the long-term trace. Our comparative study of the time course of the effects of the cholinergic agonist arecoline, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor antagonist CGP 36742, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the nootropic oxiracetam, four substances with completely different primary sites of action, show that the memory-enhancing effects consistently come into evidence no sooner than 16-24 h after the learning trial. On the one hand, this finding suggests that all these substances act by way of the same type of mechanism; on the other hand, it demonstrates that the substrate modulated by the compounds forms the basis of memory only after 16-24 h. From the observation that animals also show clear signs of retention during the first 16 h--i.e., before the effects of the substances are measurable--it can be inferred that retention during this time is mediated by other mechanisms that are not influenced by any of the substances.", 
    "395": "The acute circulatory effects of the combination of prazosin 1 mg, enalapril 10 mg or amlodipine 5 mg were evaluated and compared in a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind, latin-square, cross-over study in 8 normotensive healthy Nigerians. Supine and erect blood pressure were reduced by the active treatment combinations (F = 8.8, P = 0.0006, analysis of variance). In all, the onset of blood pressure fall was within 2 h, with a peak reduction at 4-6 h and persisting for at least 12 h. The combination of converting enzyme inhibitor and alpha blocker, however, caused a significantly greater hypotensive action than the other combinations (P < 0.05, analysis of variance). There was a modest reflex tachycardia in the erect position on all treatments (P = 0.008). Cardiac autonomic reflexes or left ventricular echocardiographic indices were unaffected by the drug combinations. The haemodynamic effect of enalapril plus prazosin combination, which separately cause little hypotensive effect in Africans, may reflect an important pharmacodynamic interaction between alpha 1 and angiotensin II vascular receptors. All combinations lower blood pressure and warrant further study in Nigerian hypertensives. However, the enalapril plus prazosin combination caused the greatest blood pressure fall, and caution is indicated during their concurrent use, owing to enhanced first dose hypotension.",

This article reviews the 12 years of clinical experience during which it and other ACE inhibitors have become recognized as first-line agents for treating hypertension. The benefits of ACE inhibition in diabetic patients are being defined. In recent years, beneficial effects on glucose handling, left-ventricular mass, quality of life, renal function, and myocardial protection have become recognized. For these reasons, and because of their excellent safety profile, ACE inhibitors are now widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "397": "Angio-oedema as an adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) is reported to occur in one to two of 1,000 treated patients per year. This estimate may be too low, since the swelling of face, lips, tongue and throat is very often attributed to food allergy. Furthermore, attacks of oedema may occur after months or even years of ACE-inhibitor treatment, thereby obscuring the link to the medication. This adverse effect is non-immunogenic. The oedema is explained by local enhancement of bradykinin, which under normal circumstances is broken down by angiotensin converting enzyme. The question of what makes some people vulnerable is still unsolved. The oedema can develop quickly and may lead to suffocation. In many cases, conventional antiallergic treatment in the form of steroids, antihistamines and epinephrine has inadequate effect. Intubation of the larynx may be necessary, but can be extremely difficult in the case of massive glassy oedema. Involvement of the neck can sometimes hinder tracheotomy, making early intervention essential. The authors describe two patients with moderate swellings, and discuss a potential, yet experimental, use of C1-inhibitor concentrate in the treatment of ACE-inhibitor provoked angioedema.", 
    "398": "The authors aim was to evaluate if the changes in the components of the plasma kinin system on PRA, determined during 3-weeks period of treatment with captopril in daily doses of 150 mg, depend on the stage of arterial hypertension. Investigations were carried out in 40 patients with primary hypertension; 6 patients were in I, 20 in II and 14 in III WHO stage. The control group consisted of 18 healthy persons. All the parameters were examined 3 times: before therapy, after 24 h and after 3 weeks of therapy. It was proved that captopril as monotherapy, was effective in every stage of hypertension, however the normalisation of blood pressure was observed only in I and II WHO stage. The normalisation of the prekallikrein levels appeared after 3 weeks of treatment in all periods of hypertension, while the normalisation of the kininogen levels occurred only in patients of I and II WHO stage. Since changes of kininogen level in plasma occurred along with changes in blood pressure, therefore the estimation of kininogen seems to be better criterium of effectiveness of captorpil than the determination of prekallikrein. The changes of PRA were similar in all stages of hypertension, but they were significant only in the group of patients of II WHO stage and only after 24 h. Presented studies indicate that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as kinin system, participate in the mechanism of antihypertensive effect of captopril in every stage of hypertension.", 
    "399": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in renal hypokalaemic dysfunction has been investigated by evaluating the effects of the angiotensin (AT)-converting enzyme inhibition by enalapril. Healthy women were studied either in normal potassium balance (N3, n = 6) or moderate potassium depletion (KD3, n = 6). Potassium depletion (KD) was induced by low potassium dietary intake (greater than or equal to 10 mmol per day) and natriuretic treatment associated with replacement of net NaCl and water losses; the cumulative potassium deficit achieved was 214 +/- 54 mmol. The renal function and the urinary excretions of some prostanoids (PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2) were evaluated during hypotonic polyuria (oral water load) and subsequent moderate antidiuresis (lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP) low-dose infusion). Paired studies were performed in absence (control) and presence of enalapril. Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary aldosterone excretion were determined before the water load of control studies. Renal dysfunction typical of chronic KD occurred in the KD3 group, i.e. increase in PRA, decrease in creatinine clearance, depression of the diuretic response to water load, inhibition of distal fractional chloride reabsorption, and blunted efficacy of LVP in increasing the urinary solute concentration. The urinary prostanoid excretions were reduced. Basal urinary aldosterone excretion was not changed significantly. In KD3 group enalapril decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), increased the plasma potassium concentration, improved the diuretic response to water load and corrected the impairment of the distal fractional chloride reabsorption. Despite the decrease in MAP enalapril did not affect significantly the creatinine clearance. Neither urinary prostanoid excretions nor the renal response to LVP were affected by the drug. The data suggest that in KD the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system affected the renal function both through direct effects and through effects dependent on the angiotensin-supported secretions of aldosterone and probably of vasopressin. Finally, by comparing the effects of enalapril and indomethacin in experimental groups with an equivalent degree of KD, evidence is provided in favour of the interaction between renin-angiotensin and prostanoid systems in controlling the glomerular filtration rate and the salt and water handling by renal tubules.", 
    "400": "Forty-two patients with congestive heart failure were studied in order to clarify whether the plasma level of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) rises in parallel with plasma noradrenaline (NA) during physical exercise in congestive heart failure (CHF). All patients were studied in a randomized placebo-controlled trial with the ACE-inhibitor ramipril during 12 weeks to determine whether ACE-inhibition alters the response of plasma NPY-LI to exercise. The patients were treated with diuretics and had stable congestive heart failure (NYHA classes II-III). Plasma NPY-LI was 50 +/- 5 pmol l-1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at rest and 60 +/- 6 pmol l-1 at the end of exercise at baseline (P < 0.01). The corresponding values for plasma NA were 2.8 +/- 0.2 nmol l-1 and 15.3 +/- 1.2 nmol l-1 (P < 0.001). Before ACE-inhibition, there was a correlation between high NPY-LI and NA values after exercise. After treatment with ramipril or placebo for 12 weeks, there was no difference in plasma NPY-LI and NA at rest or after exercise between the two treatment groups. The maximal exercise time was unchanged. It is concluded that plasma NPY-LI and NA were elevated at rest in CHF. The additional rise of plasma NPY-LI and NA after exercise was attenuated in CHF compared to healthy individuals. ACE-inhibition with ramipril did not alter plasma NPY-LI or NA at rest or after exercise compared to placebo.",

The mean terminal elimination half-life following a single administration of 10 mg enalapril, was 27 hours. The inhibition of ACE activity paralleled enalaprilat concentrations following both single and multiple dosing and the time of maximum inhibition of ACE activity was associated on both occasions with maximum concentration of enalaprilat. Emax modelling of enalaprilat concentration and ACE activity gave comparable values of Emax for both methods of administration. An accumulation factor of 1.7 was calculated from the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of enalaprilat within a dosing interval at steady-state and the total AUC following single administration of enalapril. There were no significant differences between males and females in the accumulation factor, half-life and AUCinf.", 
    "402": "Indicators such as lowering of blood pressure in hypertension, alleviation of chest pain in angina pectoris, improvement in rest or exertional dyspnea from congestive heart failure (CHF) and suppression of ventricular arrhythmia are widely used in the management of cardiovascular diseases. There are often strong associations between the physiological indicators and the long-term clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, sudden death and all-cause mortality. Physicians have assumed reasonably that early improvements in physiological markers will lead invariably to better long-term clinical outcomes. In recent years, a number of large clinical trials have demonstrated that short-term physiological improvements are not necessarily linked to better long-term clinical outcomes, but may be associated with less benefit than expected or even with detrimental outcomes. Management of cardiovascular diseases is complicated by the possibility that beneficial effects of a particular drug may be offset by its negative actions on the cardiovascular system. Effective antihypertensives may depress cardiac contractility; inotropes enhance left ventricular contractility in CHF, but may increase the risk of serious ventricular dysrhythmia; drugs which suppress ventricular arrhythmia may precipitate CHF or even excite pro-arrhythmic effects. Physicians must be conscious of this interplay of potentially beneficial and deleterious effects when cardiovascular drugs are prescribed. It is important in the analysis of large clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs to identify those situations in which the drug exhibits more benefit than harm and to determine, if possible, those aspects of drug action, drug dosage and population characteristics which contribute to the beneficial and detrimental actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "403": "To examine the relationships between the normal dietary intakes of protein and phosphate, blood pressure, and the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we prospectively studied 20 Type 1 diabetic subjects of mean age 43 +/- 10 years (SD) with early nephropathy (mean serum creatinine 115 +/- 43 mumol l-1) over 1 year. Three-monthly measurements of blood pressure, glycaemic control, and normal dietary intake (3-day weighed food records) and 6-monthly measurements of glomerular filtration rate (using a single injection of chromium 51-EDTA) were made. GFR changed at a median rate of -0.89 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 month-1 (range +0.85 to -2.55 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 month-1). Mean dietary protein intake (1.22 g kg-1; range 0.78 to 1.55 g kg-1) and phosphate intake (21.5 mg kg-1; range 14.1 to 30.4 mg kg-1) were not significantly related to the rate of change in GFR. Only mean systolic blood pressure was significantly related to change in GFR, and accounted for 45% of the variability in GFR decline in the 18 subjects who completed the study (r = 0.67; R2 = 0.449; F1,16 = 13.2; p < 0.005; 95% confidence interval for r: 0.336-0.867).

    "404": "The mRNA expression of renin, angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was determined in the kidneys and livers from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) during chronic treatment with captopril and following its withdrawal. Chronic captopril treatment was associated with a dramatic rise in renin mRNA in the kidney and an elevation in mRNA for ACE in the liver. The release from captopril treatment was associated with a reversal of the increase in kidney renin mRNA but no reversal of the sustained elevation of ACE mRNA in the liver. In situ hybridisation revealed a localisation of renin to the area of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys from untreated animals, but recruitment of vascular sites of renin expression in kidneys from captopril-treated animals. In kidneys from released animals, renin mRNA expression was once again confined to the juxtaglomerular apparatus. ACE mRNA was expressed in hepatocytes throughout the livers from animals in all treatment groups. The results highlight a differential effect of captopril withdrawal upon the gene expression of the components of the renin-angiotensin system in kidney and liver.", 
    "405": "Using a randomised double-blind crossover design with Latin square allocation of treatments in 20 subjects (7 male, 13 female-ages: 61-87 years) with systolic hypertension, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of once daily felodipine (extended release) 5-20 mg, enalapril 5-20 mg and their combination compared with placebo in four treatment phases each of 6 weeks duration. During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic supine systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, predose supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared with the placebo phase (decrease in supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only predose supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril phase. In combination the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared with the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in elderly subjects with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively reduces blood pressure throughout the dose interval but with vasodilator adverse effects. In contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but is less effective in reducing blood pressure throughout the whole dose interval.", 
    "406": "The existence of vasoconstrictive factors originating from the endothelium was confirmed by the description of endothelin, a 21-amino-acid peptide derived from a series of precursors, preproendothelin and a 38-amino-acid big endothelin. Three isoforms of endothelin, endothelin-1, -2 and -3, and 3 receptors (ETA, ETB and ETC) have been described and cloned. The cellular mode of action of endothelin seems to involve the modulation of intracellular calcium (through inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol and phospholipase C) and activation of calcium channels. The effects of endothelin are predominantly on the cardiovascular system. Its major effect is vasoconstriction, both systemic and pulmonary, with additional positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart. It has also been implicated in homeostatic regulation of kidney microcirculation, and has powerful mitogenic effects on fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Many additional effects have been described on the endocrine system and on other systems. However, the clinical relevance of such effects is uncertain. Increased plasma endothelin levels have been reported in many diseases, but as yet it is not certain whether they are a cause or a consequence of the pathology. Pathologies most probably related to endothelin dysfunction are the vasospastic diseases, especially vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Endothelin could be implicated to a lesser measure in diseases typical of the elderly population, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis. Drugs are being developed which act on endothelin metabolism, the most promising of which appear to be the inhibitors of endothelin converting enzyme and endothelin receptor antagonists. Some already existing drugs, such as calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, probably act at least in part by interfering with endothelin metabolism or effects.",

We hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibitors of fibroblast proliferation would suppress the development of intimal hyperplasia. We evaluated the effect of two agents known to inhibit fibroblast proliferation in vitro: enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an organic solvent. Thirty-five New Zealand white rabbits underwent standardized balloon catheter injury of the left common carotid artery. Experimental groups received daily intramuscular injections of the following: group I (n = 15), saline solution; group II (n = 10), 0.07 mg/kg enalaprilat; and group III (n = 10), 2 ml/kg of a 25% by weight DMSO solution. Injections were started 1 day prior to injury and continued 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Carotid arteries were perfusion-fixed at 12 weeks and cross-sectioned for measurement by planimetry. Intimal hyperplasia was measured as the ratio of the absolute area of intimal hyperplasia to the normalized area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina (IH/IEL) and was expressed as a percent. Mean values for IH/IEL were as follows: group I (control), 20.6 +/- 2.3%; group II (enalaprilat), 9.5 +/- 0.7%; and group III (DMSO), 17.6 +/- 2.6%. Enalaprilat-treated animals demonstrated a statistically significant suppression of intimal hyperplasia compared with controls (p < 0.01, ANOVA, Student's t test), whereas the DMSO-treated group did not. We conclude that enalaprilat is effective in suppressing the development of intimal hyperplasia in this model of arterial injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "408": "The pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its active metabolite quinaprilat were studied in 12 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after multiple oral doses of 10 mg quinapril twice daily. Six patients had an ejection fraction of < 35% and six had an ejection fraction between 35%-50%. Increases in the apparent elimination half-life and in AUC(0, 12h) values of quinaprilat were associated with smaller ejection fractions, decreased creatinine clearance, and increased patient age. Comparison with data from age-matched controls having comparable renal function suggests that creatinine clearance is the major determinant of quinaprilat clearance. CHF per se appears to have minimal effect. Dosing of quinapril in patients with CHF should be based on their renal function.", 
    "409": "1. We describe an approach involving a smaller, shorter study, leading onto a longer, larger study in which the antihypertensive effects of ascending doses of imidapril, a new ACE inhibitor, were investigated. Both studies were planned prospectively, assuming a clinically useful fall in BP to be 8 mm Hg (s.d. = 9). The studies included patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) 95-115 mm Hg). After a placebo run-in of 2-3 weeks patients received either placebo or imidapril 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg in the 2 week study (n = 91) or imidapril 5, 10, 20 or 40 mg in the 4 week study (n = 162). 2. The overall mean baseline SDBP was 103.4 mm Hg (s.d. 0.62) in the initial study and 101.5 mm Hg (s.d. 0.41) in the 4 week study. 3. Compared with placebo, imidapril 10, 20 and 40 mg significantly reduced SDBP. There was no significant difference between these doses, suggesting that 10 mg achieved maximal ACE inhibition in most patients. The 2.5 mg dose showed no significant effect. The 5 mg dose gave an intermediate effect. In both studies the overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the imidapril and placebo groups, and was not worrying.", 
    "410": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition causes specific renal effects, such as a rise in effective renal plasma flow, a fall in filtration fraction and a lowering of proteinuria. The mechanism of these renal effects is still debated. Recent animal studies suggest that non-angiotensin (Ang) II related actions of ACE inhibition, such as bradykinin accumulation, may have a role. We therefore investigated the effects of specific intervention in the renin-angiotensin system with the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan, and compared these effects to those obtained with ACE inhibition, as this comparison might resolve the question whether or not the effects of ACE inhibition are Ang II related. The effects of losartan and enalapril were studied in eleven patients with non-diabetic proteinuria and hypertension. The protocol consisted of seven periods, each lasting one month, in which patients received once daily placebo, 50 mg losartan, 100 mg losartan, placebo, 10 mg enalapril, 20 mg enalapril, and placebo, respectively. At the end of each study period proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal function were determined. On both doses of losartan and enalapril proteinuria and blood pressure fell, whereas ERPF increased and GFR remained stable. The fall in urinary protein excretion was similar for both drugs: 46.3% (28.3% to 63.1%) on 100 mg losartan versus 51.6% (37.0% to 69.2%) on 20 mg enalapril (expressed as Wilcoxon-based estimated median with 95% CI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "411": "We examined acute and chronic effects of thromboxane (TX) A2 inhibition on the renal hemodynamics at early and late stage of untreated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Two weeks and 28 weeks after the induction of diabetes, renal blood flow (RBF) under anesthesia was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter before and after TXA2 inhibition. In two-week-old diabetic rats, a specific TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046, or a specific TXA2 receptor antagonist, Sulotroban, increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) and ameliorated the hyperperfusion. The renal vasoconstrictive effect of OKY-046 was blunted by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, MK422, or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, Saralasin. On the contrary, OKY-046 ameliorated the renal hypoperfusion by decreasing RVR in 28-week-old diabetic rats. Chronic oral administration of OKY-046 ameliorated not only the renal hyperperfusion but increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at two weeks, but also the renal hypoperfusion, filtration fraction and UAE at 24 weeks. It is suggested that TXA2 might, at least in part, play important roles in the hyperperfusion by modulating activity of the renin-angiotensin system at an early stage of untreated diabetic rats and in the hypoperfusion at the late stage of untreated diabetic rats, and that TXA2 is also involved in the increase of UAE. These results support roles for TXA2 in the progression of renal injury in STZ-induced diabetic rats.",

In this trial, drug therapy was found to be safe and generally well tolerated by the elderly.

Agent selection should be based on the perceived need for urgent blood pressure control, the cause of HU, and concomitant conditions. A definite benefit from acute blood pressure lowering in HUs has yet to be demonstrated, especially in asymptomatic patients. More controlled trials with less aggressive dosing regimens and placebo controls need to be performed to assess the most appropriate treatment for HUs with the fewest adverse effects.", 
    "426": "The aim of this study was to determine whether captopril has any effect on plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration in patients with essential hypertension. Nine normotensives and eleven hypertensives were included in this study. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored before and at 60 min after captopril ingestion (25 mg). Simultaneously, blood samples for plasma ET-1 and plasma renin activity (PRA) determination were obtained. In the normotensives, captopril treatment resulted in a significant rise in PRA, but without statistical changes in blood pressure and plasma ET-1. By contrast, in the hypertensives, although PRA elevated similarly after captopril, both blood pressure and plasma ET-1 decreased significantly compared with their respective preloading level. These data suggest that the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril in essential hypertension may be at least in part, mediated by its inhibition of ET-1 production from the vascular endothelium.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of enalapril on the TERalb of diabetic patients with albuminuria and normal or mildly elevated blood pressure. Seventeen diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy, albuminuria, a diastolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg and increased TERalb participated in the study. Blood pressure and TERalb were measured before and after 14 days of therapy with enalapril, 20 mg daily for 14 days. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell from 168 +/- 6 to 155 +/- 6 (p < 0.001) and from 87 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 2 mmHg (p < 0.005) respectively. Mean arterial pressure declined from 114 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 3 mmHg (p < 0.0001). The elevated TERalb decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.2 +/- 0.5%/hr (p < 0.005). In the hypertensive subset, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly by 15, 7 and 10 mmHg (p < 0.005, p < 0.005 and p < 0.005 respectively); TERalb decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.6 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.03). In the normotensive subset, arterial pressure remained unchanged and TERalb decreased from 9.0 +/- 0.8 to 6.8 +/- 1.0%/hr (p < 0.03). Plasma fructosamine decreased from 373 +/- 23 to 347 +/- 20 (p < 0.05) in the hypertensive group and remained unchanged in the normotensive patients. No correlation could be demonstrated between variation in TERalb and changes in blood pressure.

    "428": "An enhanced risk for myocardial infarction has been observed in humans with sustained activation of the local and/or systemic renin-angiotensin system, such as a high renin-sodium profile or a heritably enhanced expression of angiotensin converting enzyme. Chronic renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduces the rate of myocardial reinfarction in patients with moderate heart failure. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that these clinical observations may be partially explained by a proatherogenic effect of an activated renin-angiotensin system, which can downregulate the expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase III. Nitric oxide exerts many potentially antiatherogenic effects on endothelium, platelets and low density lipoproteins and indirectly on monocytes and leukocytes Hypertension-induced chronic distension of elastic arteries upregulates the local renin-angiotensin system in these arteries and thereby downregulates nitric oxide synthase. Enhanced local synthesis of the trophic factor angiotensin-II and reduced releasability of the antitrophic factor nitric oxide appear to cooperate in the trophic adaptation of the distended vessel wall to the enhanced load, but with the disadvantage of enhanced susceptibility for atheroma development due to reduced availability of nitric oxide. Chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or by angiotensin receptor type-1 antagonists normalizes a reduced endothelial nitric oxide availability in several models, partially by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. This endothelial protection proved to attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis in experimental models. The antiatherogenic potential of renin-angiotensin system blockade in humans is presently under study.", 
    "429": "We have previously shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril causes a potent decrease in portal pressure gradient, but only in about one half of patients with portal hypertension and an episode of bleeding esophageal varices in patient's history. Twenty-one consecutive patients after first episode of bleeding from esophageal varices were enrolled in the trial. Patients were treated by sclerotherapy in combination with enalapril. The level of ACE in patients with portal hypertension (10.4, SD 4.5) was significantly higher than in normal population (4.5, SD 1.3 mu kat/l-1) [p < 0.001]. After 3 months treatment decreased ACE to normal or subnormal levels in all 21 patients (2.9, SD 1.5 mu kat.l-1) [p < 0.001], but simultaneously measured hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased more than 3 mm Hg only in 11 (52%). No correlation between changes of portal pressure gradient and changes of ACE concentrations were found. We conclude that patients with portal hypertension have significantly higher serum ACE level with a large decrease after enalapril, but it is not possible to predict the effect of enalapril on portal pressure by estimation of ACE level in serum in individual patient.",

Plasma endothelin immunoreactivity in the patients (10.2 +/- 34 pg/ml) was significantly higher than a control group (5.9 +/- 1.8 pg/ml). Quinapril improved symptoms and haemodynamics but did not affect plasma endothelin immunoreactivity (11.9 +/- 2.9 pg/ml at baseline and 12.3 +/- 3.4 pg/ml after 16 weeks of quinapril). Captopril also had no effect on endothelin levels (8.1 +/- 2.9 at baseline and 8.1 +/- 3.8 pg/ml after 16 weeks of captopril). The vasodilatory effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure are not mediated by, or associated with, changes in plasma endothelin immunoreactivity.", 
    "431": "The present study compared the effect on insulin sensitivity of ACE inhibitors with a sulphydryl group (captopril) or those without a sulphydryl group (delapril and enalapril) during the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp test in both animal and clinical experiments. A possible contribution of bradykinin to the improvement of insulin sensitivity by ACE-inhibition was also studied. In healthy control and depancreatized dog experiments, administration of captopril either intravenously (3.0 mmol.kg-1) or orally (5.0 mmol.kg-1) increased insulin sensitivity indices and plasma bradykinin concentrations. In comparison, intravenous administration of an active metabolite of delapril (3.0 mmol.kg-1) and oral administration of either delapril or enalapril (5.0 mmol.kg-1) showed slight, but not significant increases in insulin sensitivity indices and plasma bradykinin concentrations. Infusion of a bradykinin antagonist (N-alpha-adamantane-acetyl-D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-b bradykinin) (0.5 nmol.kg-1 x min-1) abolished the effect of captopril on insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, intravenous administration of bradykinin (0.1 nmol.kg-1 x min-1) increased insulin sensitivity indices. In clinical experiments, insulin sensitivity indices decreased in the following order: normotensive healthy subjects, hypertensive non-diabetic patients, normotensive NIDDM patients and hypertensive NIDDM patients. In these four groups, oral administration of captopril (2.0 mmol.kg-1) significantly increased insulin sensitivity indices, and a concomitant increase in plasma bradykinin concentrations was observed. By contrast, oral administration of enalapril or delapril showed slight, but not significant effects on insulin sensitivity indices and plasma bradykinin concentrations. From these studies, it is concluded that ACE inhibitors with a sulphydryl group have more potent action on the improvement in insulin sensitivity than those without a sulphydryl group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "436": "The primary objective of this study was to determine whether angiotensin II (ANG II) has direct effects on the atrium to chronically stimulate the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by actions that are independent of its vasoconstrictor and fluid-retaining effects that increase ANP secretion indirectly by raising atrial pressure. In five dogs, right atrial pressure (RAP) was controlled at approximately 5.5 mmHg above control levels for 8 days by employing an externally adjustable occluder around the pulmonary artery and a servo-control system, and plasma levels of ANG II were fixed at either normal (days 1-3 and 7-8) or high (days 4-6) physiological concentrations by chronic infusion of captopril+ANG II. When plasma ANG II was maintained at normal levels during servo-control of RAP, plasma ANP concentration increased five- to sixfold and sodium balance was achieved at a reduced arterial pressure (-14 mmHg). In contrast, despite increased plasma levels of ANP, the high rate of ANG II infusion produced marked sodium retention during the initial 24 h; however, the antinatriuresis was not sustained because the servo-control system partially deflated the pulmonary artery occluder to prevent fluid-induced increments in RAP. Moreover, in the absence of a change in RAP, high plasma levels of ANG II did not influence plasma ANP concentration. These findings indicate that the plasma levels of ANP achieved in heart failure increase renal excretory capability and allow fluid balance to be achieved at a substantial fall in mean arterial pressure as long as there is minimal involvement of the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "437": "In an attempt to determine the mechanism of pressor action of centrally administered rat joining peptide (rJP), a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide, we investigated its action on the angiotensin and adrenergic system in the brain stem. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with chronic cannulas in the cisterna magna and abdominal aorta, the pressor effect of synthetic rJP in the cisterna magna was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with losartan, an antagonist of angiotensin (ANG) II receptor specific for its AT1 subtype, and also by the nonspecific antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]ANG II but not by AT2-specific PD-123319. Pretreatment with captopril did not alter the pressor response. Adrenergic receptor antagonists, yohimbine and propranolol, did not change the pressor response. The intracisternal joining peptide administration (10 and 30 nmol) increased the concentration of immunoreactive ANG II in cerebrospinal fluid 2.4- and 5.7-fold, respectively. These results indicate that the pressor response to rJP is mediated by the release of central ANG II and AT1 receptor. This study details a biological response to rJP, the only POMC-derived peptide whose action has not been identified previously.", 
    "438": "The effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) on the age-related changes in the kidney structure and function was investigated in rodents. Normotensive male Wistar (WAG)/Rij rats were treated with perindopril from the age of 6 mo to the day of killing at 12, 24, or 30 mo. Mean blood pressure, constant from 6 to 30 mo, was reduced by 19 mmHg in treated animals. With age, the major functional modifications were a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and in renal blood flow, a rise in intrarenal vascular resistance (IVR), a reduced tubular reabsorption of salts, and a progressive increase in proteinuria. ACEI significantly reduced IVR and proteinuria. From a structural point of view, the glomeruli showed 1) an increase in size, 2) a decrease in capillary surface, 3) a diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, 4) an expansion of the mesangial matrix, and 5) an accumulation of albumin droplets in podocytes inducing 6) a dispersed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis which, at 30 mo, affected < 2% of glomeruli.

Adrenalectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to either a normal (NK) or low-K diet (LK), and they either received enalapril or vehicle for 3 wk. Na:K pump activity (pmol.mm-1.h-1) in microdissected cortical collecting (CCT) and medullary collecting tubules (MCT) was determined at 21 days after group allocations. K depletion had a minimal effect on CCT outer diameter.

After ultrafiltration, levels of renin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone fell to below control values within the first 48 hours and water metabolism was equilibrated at a new set point (less fluid intake and diuresis without weight gain). The favorable circulatory and ventilatory adjustments consequent to the reabsorption of lung water improved the functional capacity of these patients. That may also have restored the lung's ability to clear norepinephrine, thus restraining its facilitation of renin release. The improvement continued 3 months after the procedure.",

    "445": "Reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and wall thicknesses with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists occur in essential hypertension. Experimental studies have shown that reduction in LV mass is related to hemodynamic as well as nonhemodynamic factors that may influence LV and also right ventricular (RV) structure. Sixty-eight patients with essential hypertension were studied echocardiographically 4 to 8 weeks after antihypertensive therapy was initiated. LV dimensions and wall thicknesses, as well as RV free wall thickness, were measured using 2-dimensionally guided techniques. Patients were divided in 2 groups: those receiving either ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. This short-term therapeutic period produced similar hemodynamic changes and reductions in LV mass in both groups. In these 2 groups of patients, we found opposite effects in RV free wall thickness. Thus, RV wall thickness increased from 0.44 +/- 0.02 to 0.56 +/- 0.02 cm (p < 0.01) after therapy in the calcium antagonist group, whereas no change was found in the ACE inhibitor group (0.36 +/- 0.04 vs 0.34 +/- 0.04). These structural changes suggest that ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists produce dissimilar effects on cardiac cell growth and growth reversal, which may be mediated through different nonhemodynamic effects after short-term therapy.", 
    "446": "A great deal of evidence suggests that insulin resistance, via hyperinsulinemia, contributes to hyperlipoproteinemia and coronary atherosclerosis. When Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, an animal model of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), are compared with normolipidemic Japanese White (JW) rabbits, an elevated fasting plasma insulin level and a heightened plasma insulin response to an intravenous (i.v.) glucose challenge are found. To elucidate the mechanism behind this phenomenon, a two-compartment model of the glucose/insulin system was fitted to empirical time courses of glucose and insulin concentrations during an i.v. glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) by nonlinear least-square regression, and the model parameters such as the glucose utilization rate constant, insulin degradation rate constant, and pancreas sensitivity were determined. WHHL rabbits showed decreased values of glucose utilization and insulin degradation rate constants and slightly higher values of pancreas sensitivity. This suggests that insulin resistance occurs in extrapancreatic tissues, and that this may be attributable to insulin receptor and/or post-insulin receptor abnormalities. Cholesterol feeding did not significantly change glucose tolerance or insulin action in JW rabbits. The effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril, on insulin resistance were also examined in WHHL and JW rabbits. A decreased insulin response to an i.v. glucose challenge and increased glucose utilization and insulin degradation rate constants were observed in WHHL rabbits that had been treated with cilazapril, indicating that cilazapril improved insulin resistance in WHHL rabbits, possibly by increasing the number of insulin receptors. No significant differences were found in glucose tolerance and insulin action in JW rabbits before and after cilazapril administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There was considerable overlap of individual values in basal PRA between the two groups. Sixty minutes after captopril, PRA was higher in RVHT than in EHT patients (74.8 +/- 63.9 versus 15.1 +/- 11.9 ng/mL/hr, P < 0.01). With the cutoff point set at 16 ng/mL/hr, RVHT was detected with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 77%. The discriminating power was also superior to that based on blood pressure response to angiotensin II analogue under sodium depletion, rapid-sequence intravenous pyelography, or renography. These results show that captopril-stimulated peripheral PRA is an adequate screening tool for detecting RVHT in a population with high-renin hypertension.", 
    "448": "The most common chronic nephropathy seen with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by heavy proteinuria and rapid deterioration of renal function. We here report the findings in an HIV-seropositive patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and biopsy-proven HIV-associated nephropathy treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinopril. During treatment periods, the patient demonstrated a significant decrement in 24-hour urinary protein excretion without change in renal function. The patient acted as her own control. After discontinuation of the drug, the 24-hour protein excretion deteriorated to pretreatment levels. ACE inhibition has been reported to decrease proteinuria and to have a beneficial influence on the progression of renal failure in diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease. To date, there is no known therapy for HIV-associated nephropathy. Our preliminary results in this patient suggest the need for long-term studies to assess whether this form of therapy can improve proteinuria over longer periods and, at the same time, ameliorate the progressive form of nephropathy seen in selected HIV-seropositive patients.",

    "453": "The prognostic value of pretreatment pulse pressure as a predictor of myocardial infarction and the relation of pulse pressure and in-treatment diastolic blood pressure reduction to myocardial infarction were investigated in a union-sponsored systematic hypertension control program. In a prospective study, 2207 hypertensive patients with a pretreatment systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg grouped according to tertile of pulse pressure (PP1, < or = 46; PP2, 47 to 62; PP3, > or = 63 mm Hg) were further stratified by the degree of diastolic fall: large (L), > or = 18; moderate (M), 7 to 17; small (S), < or = 6 mm Hg. During an average follow-up of 5 years, 132 cardiovascular events (50 myocardial infarctions, 23 strokes) were observed. Myocardial infarction rates per 1000 person-years were positively related to pulse pressure (PP1, 3.5; PP2, 2.9; PP3, 7.5; PP3 versus PP1, P = .02). Wide pulse pressure was identified as a predictor of myocardial infarction (PP3 versus [PP1 + PP2]: relative risk [RR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-4.1), controlling for other known risk factors by Cox regression. A curvilinear relation (resembling a J shape) between diastolic fall and myocardial infarction was observed in patients with the widest pulse pressure, PP3 (L, 9.5; M, 3.9; S, 11.2; L versus M: RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.0-6.2; S versus M: RR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.1-8.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Changes in cortical and medullary blood flow were determined using a newly developed optical fiber implantation technique for laser-Doppler flowmetry. Renal medullary interstitial infusion of captopril (5 mg/kg per day) selectively increased medullary blood flow by 40% without altering renal cortical blood flow throughout the 5 days of captopril delivery. In association with the selective increase of medullary perfusion, a significant natriuresis was observed on the second day of the drug infusion, and urine osmolality was significantly reduced during the first 3 days of captopril infusion. Mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased by 20 mm Hg during 5 days of captopril infusion, and the chronic renal function curve was shifted to a lower level of arterial pressure compared with the control values when 0.9% sodium chloride saline vehicle was infused. Intravenously infused captopril at 5 mg/kg per day did not alter mean arterial pressure, excluding the possibility that the hypotensive effect of medullary captopril infusion was due to recirculation. In summary, chronic reduction of the elevated renal medullary vascular tone by medullary interstitial infusion of captopril reset the steady-state renal function curve and lowered arterial pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.",

Here we report measurements of part of the pressure profile in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, n = 7) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY, n = 7) rats before and after treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. The previously developed technique that we used, provided simultaneous measurements of the undisturbed arterial blood pressure at the base of mesenteric arcades (P(arc); diameter, approximately 100 microns) and systemic mean blood pressure (MBP). The ratio P(arc)/MBP was 63 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) in SHR and 64 +/- 3% in WKY rats.

    "456": "The purpose of this study was to determine if there are any morphologic characteristics of lesions that renarrow (that is, restenotic lesions) following successful coronary balloon angioplasty that are different from their appearance pretreatment or from the appearance of nonrestenotic lesions that might provide some new insight into the restenosis phenomenon. The study population consisted of 653 patients (778 lesions) with 6 months of angiographic follow-up (94% angiographic follow-up rate) who were participating in the Multicenter European Research trial with Cilazapril after Angioplasty to prevent Transluminal coronary Obstruction and Restenosis (MERCATOR) study. Detailed quantitative angiographic measurements, including the mean diameter of the vessel segment (in millimeters) that was subjected to balloon dilation, were performed preangioplasty, postangioplasty, and at follow-up using the cardiovascular angiographic analysis system to provide some objective measurement of the actual extent of luminal changes in the months following coronary balloon angioplasty. Two different approaches for restenosis were used: (1) static criterion of > 50% diameter stenosis at follow-up and (2) dynamic criteria of > or = 0.40 or > or = 0.72 mm change in minimal lumen diameter between postangioplasty and follow-up. Both approaches identified more severe stenosis to be a typical feature for restenotic lesions before angioplasty compared with nonrestenotic lesions. No differences were observed in lesion length, balloon-inflated vessel segment, or roughness index before angioplasty between the groups. Conflicting data were found for the amount of atherosclerotic plaque, symmetry index, and curvature index. The restenotic lesion at follow-up compared with its initial appearance gave conflicting results depending on which approach was used. The dynamic criteria illustrate that the reference diameter and the mean diameter of the entire segment dilated are reduced during follow-up. Two messages emerge from the study: (1) the restenosis process clearly involves the apparent normal vessel wall adjacent to the actual lesion, probably in response to the unavoidable injury caused by balloon dilatation and (2) the use of percentage diameter stenosis measurements depending on the assumptions of normality for a reference segment will therefore underestimate the true extent of the restenosis process and should be replaced in clinical angiographic studies by absolute luminal measurements.", 
    "457": "Isolated rat left atria or right ventricular strips were electrically stimulated at a constant frequency. The amplitude of twitch contractions, thus elicited, rose as a function of stimulation intensity because of increases in the evoked release of sympathetic catecholamines. Bradykinin had no effect on contractile force in preparations paced at a minimal intensity (threshold). By contrast, bradykinin (1 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L) markedly increased twitch contractile force when the preparations were paced at a high intensity (two to three times threshold). The EC50 for the positive inotropic action of bradykinin averaged 42 nmol/L. Ramiprilat (1 mumol/L), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme/kinase II inhibitor, shifted the EC50 for bradykinin to approximately 2 nmol/L. Ramiprilat (1 mumol/L) per se also produced a modest positive inotropic effect. The effects of bradykinin and/or ramiprilate were inhibited by HOE 140 (300 nmol/L), a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist. Propranolol (1 mumol/L), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, abolished the effects of bradykinin. After the destruction of sympathetic nerve endings by use of 6-hydroxydopamine, bradykinin no longer exerted a positive inotropic action. Cocaine (10 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of catecholamine reuptake, potentiated the effect of bradykinin. Bradykinin did not affect the positive inotropic response to tyramine (10 mumol/L), whereas cocaine blocked it. Furthermore, bradykinin did not modify the dose-response curves for added norepinephrine. omega-Conotoxin (100 nmol/L) inhibited the positive inotropic effect of intensified stimulation and bradykinin potentiation. Bradykinin is suggested to facilitate the evoked release of sympathetic catecholamines and thereby cause a positive inotropic effect.",

Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured during the following twenty-four hour period. The data indicate that enalapril induced a potent blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for at least twenty-four hour. Specifically, enalapril during low-sodium diet elicited an exaggerated increase in PRA and a diminished decrease in ACE and ANP when compared to the results of the drug during normal-sodium diet. Long term controlled studies of enalapril in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) are warranted in order to determine the duration of action and optimal dose of enalapril.",

The results showed that by using CAP, the sensitivity and specificity of renography in RVH diagnosis increased from 66% to 72% and from 33% to 100%, respectively.

Graded submaximal bicycle ergometer exercise was performed before and after temocapril treatment, and the changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were evaluated. In addition, the plasma norepinephrine (NE) level was determined both at rest and peak exercise before and after temocapril treatment. 3. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced at rest and during exercise by temocapril treatment. No significant change in the resting heart rate and CO was observed, and the exercise-induced increase of these parameters was also not affected by temocapril. In contrast, the resting SVR was significantly decreased by temocapril, although the exercise SVR was similar during both temocapril and placebo treatment. 4. Although there was no significant change in the plasma NE level with temocapril treatment, the exercise-induced increase of plasma NE was significantly suppressed by temocapril. 5.

Experimental hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were produced in mini-pigs of the G\u00f6ttingen strain by adding 11% egg yolk and 1% cholesterol to the diet for 52 weeks. The animals were divided into three groups. One group was fed the atherogenic diet alone and served as control. The second group was treated with captopril in a dose of 80 mg/kg/day added to the atherogenic diet on an individual basis. The third group was treated with fosinopril in a dose of 8 mg/kg/day. Both drugs produced a significant reduction in serum ACE activity associated with a reactive rise in plasma renin activity and a slight fall in serum aldosterone concentration. The drug treatment had only minor effects on plasma lipids. The aorta and the carotid and coronary arteries were examined for atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques developed in the abdominal aorta whereas fatty streaks were present in the thoracic aorta and the coronary arteries. Both drugs significantly reduced the percent visible atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta. Furthermore, the accumulation of cholesterol in the thoracic and abdominal aorta was significantly reduced. The effect of captopril and fosinopril on endothelium-dependent relaxation of iliac arteries was examined. After addition of 3 x 10(-7) M acetylcholine strips from basal diet fed mini pigs showed a remaining tension of 7.0% +/- 7.1 (p < 0.05 compared to cholesterol-high diet), cholesterol-high diet 36.4% +/- 10.2, captopril 16.9% +/- 4.9 (p < 0.01) and fosinopril 31.7% +/- 4.6 (n.s.).

    "475": "The octapeptide, angiotensin II (A-II), induces drinking behavior in several vertebrate species; however, relatively little is understood about A-II-induced thirst in amphibians. Scaphiopus couchii and Bufo cognatus were dehydrated to 90% of their ad libitum weight. This level of dehydration was sufficient to induce water absorption response (WR) behavior in both species. Fully hydrated toads injected intraperitoneally with A-II exhibited a significant amount of WR behavior. The minimum effective dose for inducing WR behavior was 10 micrograms/100 g-animal for S. couchii and 100 micrograms/100 g-animal for B. cognatus. When dehydrated toads were treated with the A-II receptor antagonist, Thr8-saralasin, S. couchii, exhibited a significant increase in WR behavior, while B. cognatus did not respond behaviorally. Finally, treatment of dehydrated toads with captopril, a compound that inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to A-II, did not significantly affect WR behavior in either species. These results support other findings that A-II may be involved in WR behavior in amphibians. However, the failure of Thr2-saralasin or captopril to inhibit WR behavior in dehydrated toads suggests that the receptor mechanisms involved in thirst regulation in toads may be different from those in mammals, and the renin-angiotensin system may not be the only potential mediator of WR behavior in these species.",

    "477": "A collagen network, composed largely of type I and III fibrillar collagens, is found in the extracellular space of the myocardium. This network has multiple functions which includes a preservation of tissue architecture and chamber geometry. Given its tensile strength, collagen is a major determinant of tissue stiffness. Its disproportionate accumulation, in the form of either a reactive or a reparative fibrosis, further increases stiffness. A degradation of collagen tethers, on the other hand, is an anatomic requisite for a distortion in tissue architecture and a reduction in stiffness that can lead to chamber dilatation, wall thinning, and even rupture of the myocardium. Collagen turnover in the myocardium is dynamic. When synthesis exceeds degradation, an adverse accumulation of collagen appears to distort tissue structure. This is true for either the hypertrophied and/or nonhypertrophied ventricle. Factors that contribute to the appearance of myocardial fibrosis are largely different from those that promote cardiac myocyte growth. Included amongst these fibrogenic factors are effector hormones of the reinin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Studies conducted both in intact animals (relative to dietary sodium intake) and in cultured adult cardiac fibroblasts have pointed toward the association between collagen accumulation and chronic elevations in circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone. A tissue hormonal system involving angiotensin II, endothelins and bradykinin, may likewise regulate fibrogenesis. In this regard, angiotensin converting enzyme is found in connective tissue of the normal heart, including the matrix of heart valves and the adventitia of the intramural coronary arteries, and fibrous tissue that forms following infarction or with chronic RAAS activation. The importance of ACE in the regulation of local angiotensin II and bradykinin levels and their contribution to collagen turnover is a fruitful area of research with important clinical implications. The myocardium also contains a proteolytic system, including collagenase. The characteristics and regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in various cardiovascular disease states requires further investigation.", 
    "478": "The free radical-scavenging activity of captopril and ascorbic acid was determined by assessing their ability to inhibit the peroxidation of linoleic acid in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles at 37 degrees C. The extent of peroxidation was monitored polarographically using an oxygen electrode to determine oxygen consumption rates. Ascorbic acid was observed to inhibit the peroxidation in a concentration-dependent fashion with an IC50 value of 17 microM. In contrast, the addition of captopril at concentrations up to 500 microM did not result in any detectable inhibition. Unlike ascorbic acid, no synergistic effect, as evidenced by the duration of inhibition, was observed with captopril/alpha-tocopherol mixtures. Measurements of the partitioning of captopril between SDS micelles and the aqueous phase show that 37% of the bulk captopril concentration is localized within the micellar phase; this indicates that phase separation of captopril from the lipid peroxyl radicals is not the cause of the observed lack of inhibitory activity.", 
    "479": "The angiotensin I (AI) metabolite, A(1-7), elicited a concentration-dependent dilator response (ED50 > or = 2 microM) in porcine coronary artery rings which was markedly attenuated by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine, and abolished after removal of the endothelium. This effect of the heptapeptide was not mimicked by AII, AIII or A(3-8) at comparable concentrations. The A(1-7)-induced relaxation was not affected by AT1 or AT2 receptor blockade or cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, but was attenuated by the B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, and augmented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinaprilat. These findings suggest that the relaxation to A(1-7) was mediated by the release of NO from the coronary endothelium through activation of an, as yet unidentified, AT receptor, the occupation of which also seems to stimulate the release of vasoactive kinins. Since A(1-7) accumulates during ACE inhibition, this mechanism may contribute to the coronary dilator effect of ACE inhibitors in vivo.",

After 14 weeks rabbits were placed into 6 groups, 6 rabbits per group. Groups I, II and III were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for the following 6 week experimental period, while Groups IV, V and VI received a normolipemic diet. In addition, Groups II and V rabbits received in their drinking water 0.3 mg/kg per day perindopril, and Groups III and VI 0.01 mg/kg per day. At the end of 6 weeks' treatment, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in Groups II and V decreased by about 12%, while that in Groups III and VI decreased by 13%. Plasma cholesterol levels of rabbits on a normolipemic diet (Groups IV, V, VI) averaged 1.3 mmol/l while those on a cholesterol-enriched diet (Groups I, II, III) averaged 10.5 mmol/l. Plasma perindoprilat concentrations and percentage of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in Groups II and V averaged 14 ng/ml and 92.1% respectively, while in Groups III and VI they were 5.7 ng/ml and 80.5%, respectively. The percentage luminal surface area of the thoracic aorta covered by lipid-filled plaques (as observed by en face staining with Oil-Red-O) averaged 26.3% in Group I, 4.7% in Group II and 20.0% in Group III. No lesions developed in Groups IV, V and VI. Microscopic examination of the right (manipulated) carotid arteries of Group I rabbits revealed lesions of large, lipid-filled cells radially oriented, overlying the pre-formed myointimal thickening. Both doses of perindopril in the cholesterol-fed rabbits (Groups II and III) decreased the amount of lipid-filled cells which were oriented circumferentially. More extracellular matrix was present in the lesions of Groups II and III than of Group I. No lesions were observed in the right carotid arteries of Groups IV, V and VI (normal diet) or in the unmanipulated left carotid arteries of all 6 groups.

The above condition was complicated by vasorenal (16 patients) or parenchymatous (27 patients) nephrogenic arterial hypertension. Mean arterial pressure (APm) was 143 +/- 12.4 mm Hg in mean duration of the disease 4.5 +/- 1.2 years. Mean age of the patients was 34.3 +/- 3.2 years. Dynamic renal scintigraphy determined glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using 99mTc-DTPA. Effective renal plasmic flow (ERPF) was measured with 131I-hippuran. 27 patients underwent acute captopril test with repeated renal scintigraphy. Angiography was used to evaluate plasma renin (PR) activity in renal veins. 1 year after various operations the patients were reexamined. By the value of diastolic pressure (DP), the above captopril test, changes in GFR and ERPF in the contralateral kidney and PR activity, the patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 of 13 patients had DP not higher than 90 mm Hg duration of the disease not more than 3 years. They responded to captopril test by AP decrease by 25-28%, PR activity increased 2.3 times. In the contralateral kidney GFR reduced by 7%, ERPF elevated by 15%. The renin coefficient reached 1.4-1.5. Group 2 of 22 patients had DP 95-100 mm Hg. They responded to captopril by APm 15% reduction, RP activity got 1.2-1.5 times higher, GFR in the contralateral kidney lowered by 10%, whereas ERPF rose by 10% Renin coefficient reached 1 or PR activity was higher in the contralateral kidney.

    "482": "In studies conducted in patients undergoing cardiac catheterizations, some hemodynamic changes were observed after the acute sublingual administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril. These changes consisted of an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and induction of hypoxia. The pressure changes were transitory and disappeared after 25 min. The possible mechanisms involved in these changes may relate to interactions of the ACEI with peripheral receptor systems for hormones and neurotransmitters. We have thus undertaken the task of evaluating the potential effect of ACEI on biological receptor molecules. We have begun with studies on muscarinic receptors, and the recently characterized neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors of endothelial cells. Equilibrium binding assays with 3H-QNB have been conducted for muscarinic receptors using rat brain synaptosomes, due to its expression of multiple muscarinic receptors subtypes. In addition 125BH-NPY binding assays were conducted on intact adrenal medullary endothelial cells. Enalapril and captopril, 10(-7) to 10(-3) M, were not able to produce significant inhibition of either muscarinic or NPY receptor probes. The paradoxical changes elicited by sublingual ACEI seems not to involve interaction with muscarinic or NPY receptors.",

Similar trials in mitral regurgitation (MR) have not been published, nor has the effect of medium or long term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors been examined in either of these regurgitant lesions. Such therapy, if demonstrated to be effective in reducing left ventricular end-systolic size, might be anticipated to delay the need for valve replacement in asymptomatic patients. Medium term studies of the effects of ACE inhibitors on left ventricular size in regurgitant disease would therefore be helpful in designing long term trials to assess their impact on the timing of surgery. Patients with severe isolated MR (n = 32) or isolated AR (n = 23) and mild or no symptoms received either placebo or captopril 25 mg three times daily in a randomized, double blind, six month pilot study of left ventricular size using echocardiography. Treatment was well tolerated with no reported side effects. In MR, there were no significant immediate or 6-month effects of treatment on left ventricular diameter at end-systole (mean change at six months vs. baseline = +1% vs. +3% in placebo, p = 0.58 between groups) or end-diastole (+3% vs. 0% for placebo, p = 0.33).

    "484": "Effects of central GABAergic stimulation on cardiovascular function were evaluated in 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats (RVHR). Intracerebroventricular injection (icv) of GABA (100 and 200 micrograms) reduced blood pressure (BP) to a greater degree in RVHR as compared with sham-operated controls, and the greatest response was seen in RVHR 4 wk after operation (4 wk-RVHR). In addition, a decreased sensitivity of baroreflex was observed in 4 wk-RVHR, and was improved by icv GABA. Pretreatment with icv captopril (200 micrograms) only reduced BP moderately in 4 wk-RVHR, but attenuated remarkably the depressor effect of GABA. On the contrary, pretreatment with ip captopril was less effective in attenuating the depressor effect of GABA. Our results indicated that RVHR was deficient in central GABAergic inhibition on BP control, for GABAergic stimulation reduced BP to a greater degree and improves the decreased sensitivity of baroreflex in RVHR; the depressor effect of GABA is mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting brain angiotensin system.",

Concomitant administration of Cap and Clo did not result in more lowering of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) than that by Cap alone. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were remarkable in Groups A and C, but not to the extent in that of WKY. No significant difference between these two groups was found. Cap alone resulted in a greater decrease of myocardial norepinephrine (NE) than that of Groups B and C. The wall/lumen ratio and the number of smooth muscle cell (SMC) layers of renal artery decreased in Groups A and C, but little difference was found between them. It seemed that combined blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) did not produce more significant BP reduction and reversal of cardiovascular remodeling than Cap alone did. The sympathetic inhibitory effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) was not enhanced by sympatholytic treatment.",

Thirteen subjects completed this single-dose, three-phase sequential crossover study. The drug (20 mg) was administered either as a 4-hr colonic infusion (COLON) or as a small intestinal infusion (SI) in the first two phases and as an oral bolus solution (ORAL) in the third phase, with a 2-week washout between each treatment. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected for up to 4 days after dosing. BZPH and its active metabolite benazeprilat (BZPL) were determined using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. BZPH was absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream (Tmax = 0.5 hr after ORAL). Absorption was also rapid for SI, with a postinfusion half-life (0.57 hr) nearly identical to that for ORAL (0.59 hr). The absorption rate after COLON was much slower (lower Cmax and longer Tmax) compared to that after SI, and the apparent half-life (1.7 hr) was prolonged. SI delivered 90%, whereas COLON delivered 23%, of the drug into the systematic circulation as compared to ORAL. BZPL was rapidly formed upon drug absorption. The metabolite-to-drug AUC ratios were comparable for SI and ORAL (8.9 vs 9.7), indicating that first-pass metabolism of BZPH was neither saturable nor input rate dependent. The metabolite-to-drug AUC ratio was reduced for COLON (5.0), indicating that the mechanism of absorption of BZPH in the colon may be different than that after SI and ORAL.

Following a two to four week placebo-baseline period, 460 qualifying patients with a DBP > or = 100 mmHg and < or = 115 mmHg were randomised to an eight week double-blind phase with one of 16 parallel treatments: placebo, one of three doses of quinapril monotherapy, one of three doses of HCTZ monotherapy or one of nine possible corresponding combinations of quinapril and HCTZ. Mean reductions in sitting SBP/DBP at trough with combination therapy ranged from 7.8 mmHg/7.2 mmHg to 19.6 mmHg/15.1 mmHg (n = 458). Results of the response surface analyses indicate that the effects of the two drugs were additive and that the maximum antihypertensive effect of quinapril in combination with HCTZ within the doses studied is achieved approximately at a dose of 26 mg quinapril and 25 mg HCTZ. The degree of attenuation of the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ was directly related to the dose of quinapril. At 40 mg quinapril, the HCTZ dose-related decreases of serum potassium were not apparent and overall hypokalemic effects were attenuated by quinapril. Thus, the combination of quinapril and HCTZ given once daily provided additive antihypertensive effects of predictable degrees and the addition of quinapril attenuated the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ.",

In rabbit isolated arterial segments, the contractile effects of a cyclosporin A preparation (Sandimmun; 10(-6) M) and its solvent (Cremophor-EL) were investigated. Both caused an increase in the basal tension of arterial segments after an incubation period of 1 hour. Several substances were tested to antagonize the contractile activity of the cyclosporin A preparation and its solvent. Prednisolone and quinacrine (phospholipase A2 inhibitors), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), verapamil (calcium antagonist), phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker), captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking agent) decreased the contractile responses to the cyclosporin A preparation and its solvent in a comparable manner. These findings indicate that the solvent of the cyclosporin A preparation is responsible for the contractile effect of this latter preparation and that this contractile activity cannot be explained by a single mechanism.",

Large-scale secondary preventive studies on calcium antagonists have been disappointing. In contrast, beta-blockers have an established role in cardioprotection both in primary and secondary preventive studies and there is evidence to show that the cardioprotective effect of beta-blockers is even greater in the diabetic population. Furthermore, this favourable impact of beta-blockers was achieved despite diabetic patients having a worse risk factor profile and poorer prognosis. In this review the use of beta-blockers in diabetic patients will be discussed and their impact on coronary artery disease described.", 
    "495": "Left ventricular function and neurohormonal status in patients with heart failure remaining symptomatic during therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were assessed, and the effects of dopaminergic receptor stimulation in this setting were determined. Neurohormonal and left ventricular function (radionuclide angiography) data were obtained in 19 patients with symptomatic ischemic heart failure. Measurements were repeated after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy with the dopamine agonist ibopamine (100 mg, 3 times/day) or placebo administered in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group design. At baseline, despite therapy with enalapril, the angiotensin II levels (mean 39.4 pg/ml; p < 0.01 vs controls) were significantly increased, as were plasma norepinephrine (497 +/- 240 pg/ml; p < 0.01 vs controls), endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin. Moreover, in comparison with pretreatment values, left ventricular ejection fraction had decreased substantially (-9.1%) in patients with plasma norepinephrine > or = 600 pg/ml, but not in those with lower values of norepinephrine. With ibopamine, plasma norepinephrine decreased from 516 +/- 241 to 391 +/- 208 pg/ml (n = 8; p < 0.025 vs placebo), whereas it increased with placebo. In conclusion, the neurohormonal control provided by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is reduced in a large subset of patients during prolonged therapy; ibopamine appears to be a potentially useful drug to improve neurohormonal control in this setting.",

    "497": "Untreated essential hypertension leads to cardiovascular and renal disease and stroke, but antihypertensive drug therapy effectively reduces these consequences of hypertension. Several studies indicate that hypertension can negatively impact on cognitive function, especially on learning and memory, but the ability of antihypertensive drugs to ameliorate these cognitive dysfunctions is less clear. None of the recent studies convincingly demonstrates that any of the antihypertensive drugs currently in use has a major deleterious effect on cognition in hypertensive patients, but some of the drugs more reliably benefit cognitive function in the hypertensive patient. As a class, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors most consistently lead to cognitive improvement in the overall hypertensive population, but beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockers and a subset of calcium channel blockers appear to have very similar effects. Animal studies and clinical studies in demented patients suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme in the cerebral cortex plays a role in normal learning and memory, a finding that provides a theoretic foundation to the beneficial actions of this class of drugs on cognitive function in hypertensive individuals.",

    "502": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), sympathetic neurotransmitter release is enhanced. We investigated the possibility that this is due in part to alterations in activation of either release-inhibiting alpha 2-adrenoceptors or release-enhancing angiotensin II (AII) receptors at postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings. CHF was induced in rabbits by adriamycin [1 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), twice weekly for 8 weeks] and was characterized by reduced cardiac output (CO) and enhanced norepinephrine (NE) release rate in pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits. After pithing and stimulation of the spinal sympathetic outflow, there was no difference in NE release rate between the two groups, suggesting that the enhanced NE release rate observed in adriamycin-treated anesthetized rabbits was of central origin. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor-blocking drug yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced NE release rate, which is an indication of feedback inhibition of NE release through presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In anesthetized rabbits, this effect of yohimbine was greater in adriamycin-treated than in vehicle-treated animals. However, in pithed rabbits with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow, there was no difference in the facilitative effect of yohimbine between the two groups, suggesting that inhibitory presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors are activated to a greater extent in heart failure due to the increased transmitter release. Removing inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor input has a functional consequence in that yohimbine increased heart rate (HR) in adriamycin-treated but not in vehicle-treated anesthetized rabbits. Captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased NE release rate in pithed rabbits with stimulated sympathetic outflow but had no effect on NE release rate in anesthetized rabbits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Ramipril and isradipine did not improve EDR as compared with group IIr. Regression of atherosclerosis was accompanied by an improved endothelium-dependent releasing factor (EDRF) release from the endothelium, but ramipril and isradipine did not promote this process. In addition, regression was associated with increasing sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle to EDRF that was significantly retarded by isradipine but not ramipril. Basal cyclic GMP levels were significantly reduced in aortic rings from group IIr as compared with group Ir. Ramipril, but not isradipine, restored basal cyclic GMP levels to control values.

Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), aged 8 months at time of study, were used for the hypertension-regression experiments. The aging study was based on 14- and 24-month-old Fischer-344 rats. LV chamber compliance was measured in isolated perfused hearts arrested in diastole. Length-tension curves (tissue elastic modulus) were obtained from ventricular strips, and hydroxyproline assays were used to estimate LV collagen content. Captopril and hydrochlorothizide were given for an 8-week period to both normotensive and hypertensive rats. Treatment normalized arterial pressure and caused regression of LV hypertrophy in SHR. LV diastolic compliance was less (pressure-volume curve steeper) in SHR than in WKY, but stiffness was similar in the two groups, as indicated by similar slopes when volume was adjusted for heart mass. Treatment significantly decreased ventricular stiffness in both SHR and WKY. Length-tension curves were almost identical in SHR and WKY, but treated SHR demonstrated less tension per given length. These changes occurred although collagen did not decrease in parallel to the decrease in LV mass. Aging was associated with 66 and 60% increases in collagen content and concentration, respectively, but did not alter LV chamber compliance significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "506": "Insulin resistance is generally interpreted as the physiological state under which insulin causes a reduced glucose-lowering effect. Hyperinsulinaemia is considered to be a result of insulin resistance. Many recent studies have suggested that hyperinsulinaemia and/or insulin resistance is associated with an elevated blood pressure, whereas several other studies have found a modest or no association. Many factors (e.g. adiposity, age, ethnic difference) have been suggested to confound the insulin-blood pressure relationship. Insulin is thought to raise blood pressure by a few possible mechanisms (e.g. stimulating sympathetic nervous system activity, enhancing renal tubular sodium reabsorption). On the other hand, insulin has also been reported to possess a vasodilatory property. Neither an insulin infusion within a physiological range nor continuously sustained hyperinsulinaemia in patients with insulinoma are associated with elevated blood pressure. Therefore, the relationship between insulin and blood pressure is still under discussion. Among the antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem to have marginal effects of improving insulin sensitivity, but whether this effect would lead to a better prognosis for diabetic patients remains to be proven. Lipid lowering drugs appear to show no benefit in lowering blood glucose.",

On the average, urinary albumin excretion was decreased by 38 +/- 4% by nitrendipine (p < 0.01 vs. before treatment) and by 21 +/- 8% by enalapril (p < 0.05 vs. before treatment). The excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin decreased by 35 +/- 10% and by 39 +/- 9%, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. before treatment). Creatine clearance rose by 20 +/- 30% during nitrendipine treatment (p < 0.05 vs. before treatment) but was unchanged during enalapril treatment. Total kidney volume decreased by 23 +/- 4% (p < 0.01) and by 14 +/- 6% (p < 0.05), respectively. Blood pressure fell by 8 +/- 1% systolic and by 13 +/- 1% (diastolic) in nitrendipine-treated patients (both p < 0.01) and by 10 +/- 1% and 13 +/- 1% in enalapril-treated patients (both p < 0.01). Thus, nitrendipine long-term treatment of microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic appeared to be as effective as the treatment with enalapril in preventing or postponing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

Although the placebo group had no change in the frequence of arrhythmias, enalapril-treated patients showed significant decrease in the frequency of premature ventricular complexes couplet, bigemine VPS and ventricular tachycardia. Moreover, it was observed that six cases of atrial fibrillation returned to sinus rhythm. During enalapril treatment, some patients experienced increased serum potassium levels, but there was no change in serum digoxin levels. We also observed echocardiographic improvement in left ventricular function as well as clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure. Finally we observed that there was an antiarrhythmic effect of enalapril in congestive heart failure. We thought that the antiarrhythmic effect of enalapril in congestive heart failure was probably due to hemodynamic improvement.",

In addition we examined whether these cells synthetize and release kinins that may accumulate during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. [Ca2+]i was assessed by the fluorescent dye Fura-2, NO formation by determination of intracellular cyclic GMP and PGI2 by a specific radioimmunoassay for 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. Bradykinin and the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat concentration-dependently increased the formation of cyclic GMP which was completely prevented by the stereospecific inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine. Also the specific B2-kinin receptor antagonist icatibant (Hoe 140) abolished the increase in cyclic GMP as well as the ramiprilat-induced increase in PGI2 formation. The data demonstrate the existence of B2-kinin receptors and ACE activity in PBCEC. Moreover PBCEC are capable of producing and releasing kinins in amounts that lead via stimulation of B2-kinin receptors to an enhanced [Ca2+]i as well as NO and PGI2 synthesis and release, provided that degradation of kinins is prevented by inhibition of endothelial ACE activity.", 
    "516": "Advances in the treatment of the acute phase of myocardial infarction have lead to the need for adequate secondary treatment. beta-blockers have been largely demonstrated to be effective antianginal agents, acting on three determining factors: heart rate, systemic blood pressure and myocardial contractility. Used in secondary prevent treatment, beta-blockers lead to significant improvement in global post-myocardial infarction mortality, reduced from 9.4 to 7.6% and in reinfarction rates, reduced from 7.5 to 5.6%. Prescription of beta-blockers beyond the acute phase is an essential part of secondary prevention. For calcium antagonists however, there is no evidence of improved prognosis after myocardial infarction. There is no improvement in mortality or reinfarction rates. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are not indicated as systematic treatment after myocardial infarction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce long-term mortality and late occurrence of congestive heart failure, particularly in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Among the anti-thrombotic drugs, oral anticoagulants seem to offer no clear advantage over aspirin. Large trials of anti-arrhythmic agents have failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit in asymptomatic patients with ventricular ectopic beats, and the results of secondary prevention trials using amiodarone are still awaited. Myocardial revascularization using coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty should be proposed mainly in symptomatic patients or in subsets of patients with multi-vessel disease and altered left ventricular function. Finally, rehabilitation measures should be aimed at correcting cardiovascular risk factors and improving physical fitness.",

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed as the likely cause of these signs chordal rupture of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mitral regurgitation. After treatment of the cardiac failure with frusemide (up to 500 mg daily intravenously), nitrates and captopril (25 mg daily by mouth) the diagnosis was confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography. Elective replacement of the mitral and aortic valves was performed 6 months later.

Ester cleavage of these derivatives and coupling with P1-P1' transition-state mimetics I-VII provided highly selective compounds with inhibitory potencies in the lower nanomolar range.

    "519": "Following organ transplantation, repeated measurements of blood pressure are an essential part of monitoring as they enable arterial hypertension, the most frequent complication in these patients, to be detected and treated at an early stage. De novo occurrence of arterial hypertension, directly due to the use of cyclosporin, is observed in more than two-thirds of these patients during the first post-transplantation year. This predominantly diastolic arterial hypertension is usually mild to moderate, but it has repercussions on graft function and requires a specific treatment appropriate to the severity of arterial hypertension and to its physiological mechanism depending on the organ transplanted. Arterial hypertension is caused by the nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin and by its intrarenal and peripheral vasoconstrictive activity. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system associated with stimulation of the sympathetic system and blood volume expansion play a major role in the genesis and maintenance of de novo arterial hypertension which constitutes a new model of drug-induced hypertension. Treatment of de novo arterial hypertension rests on arteriole-dilating antihypertensive drugs such as calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used as first-line therapy and sometimes combined with another drug. In case of severe and uncontrolled arterial hypertension, the other classes of antihypertensive drugs can be used as second treatment.", 
    "520": "Angiotensin converting enzyme active sites from rat plasma, lung, kidney and testis were assessed by comparative radioligand binding studies under physiological chloride conditions. Displacement of [125I]Ro 31-8472 from somatic and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors of different structure indicated two binding sites (perindoprilat: high affinity carboxyl site, KDC 18 +/- 6 pM), and a single high affinity binding site on testis angiotensin converting enzyme (KDC 20 +/- 1 pM). Displacement of [125I]351A from plasma, somatic and testis angiotensin converting enzyme occurred at a single high affinity binding site. Reduction in affinity at the amino binding site of somatic angiotensin converting enzyme was related to an increased side chain size (lung KDA (pM): Ro 31-8472 175 +/- 38, lisinopril 2205 +/- 1832, and 351A 2271 +/- 489), or hydrophobicity of the competing unlabelled angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lung KDA (pM): quinaprilat 1267 +/- 629 and perindoprilat 824 +/- 6). This trend was reversed at the carboxyl binding site of plasma, somatic and testis angiotensin converting enzyme. Bradykinin hydrolysis by lung angiotensin converting enzyme was inhibited in a similar manner by cilazaprilat or quinaprilat (F = 0.64, F-test based on the extra sum-of-squares principle; P > 0.05), indicating the angiotensin converting enzyme carboxyl active site predominates in bradykinin cleavage. The data demonstrate that the two binding sites on native plasma and somatic angiotensin converting enzyme are of potentially different functional and structural nature, suggesting they may have different substrate specificities.",

In patients with an important renal artery stenosis with a high intrarenal activity of the renin-angiotensin-system ACE-inhibition results in a change in renal haemodynamics which can be detected by renography. ACE-I-renography has a high positive and negative predictive value in diagnosing renal artery stenosis. Significant alterations in the renogram induced by ACE-inhibition in renal artery stenosis seem to have a good predictive value with regard to the effect of correction of the stenosis.

    "523": "The aim of the study was to ascertain whether induction of tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was modified by nitrosothiols. Vasodilator responses to GTN and to two nitrosothiols, namely S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylcaptopril (SNOCAP) were measured in bovine coronary artery rings constricted with the thromboxane mimetic agent U46619. Pre-exposure of vessels to SNAP (10 microM) for 1 h resulted in cross-tolerance to GTN comparable with tolerance induced by GTN (1.0 microM). Tolerance was increased after pre-exposure to both agents. SNAP alone in lower concentrations (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 microM) did not produce cross tolerance to GTN, but in combination with GTN (1.0 microM) caused a small but significant decrease in tolerance to GTN. This attenuating effect of SNAP on GTN tolerance was reproduced by SNOCAP (0.01 microM). We conclude that the nitrosothiols exert a biphasic effect on induction of tolerance to GTN.",

Several studies have now been started to compare the effect of these compounds with diuretics and betablockers with respect to long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Until the results of these studies are available, young patients (i.e. < 60-65 years) at high risk of coronary heart disease, especially patients with the insulin resistance syndrome or diabetes mellitus, should in our opinion be treated with ACE-inhibitors, alpha receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers.",

Three chelators, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (DMP), toluene-3,4-dithiol (TDT) and 8-mercaptoquinoline (8-MQ), were found to dose-dependently inhibit ECE activity, but this inhibition was much weaker compared with EDTA. In the presence of Zn2+, the inhibitory activity of all these compounds, including EDTA, was abolished. The addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ markedly attenuated the inhibitory activity of EDTA, but the other three chelators were still able to inhibit ECE. ECE, once inactivated by EDTA or 8-MQ, was reactivated by the addition of divalent cations such as Zn2+ and Mn2+. These compounds also inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in a manner similar to the inhibition exhibited towards ECE. Chelate-titration indicated that DMP, TDT and 8-MQ chelate Zn2+ but not Ca2+ and Mg2+. These results suggest that the ECE inhibition exhibited by these compounds is mainly attributable to their chelating activities.

Apomorphine-induced behaviour was observed, and recorded using a keypad linked to a microcomputer. In agreement with previous findings, low doses of apomorphine induced a syndrome of vacuous mouth movements, penile grooming, yawning and immobility whereas at higher doses the yawning syndrome disappeared to be replaced with sniffing, licking and gnawing. Two antagonism studies were carried out. In the first the effects of captopril on apomorphine-induced behaviour were compared with those of the classical neuroleptic haloperidol, and in the second dose-response curves for the effects of captopril and enalapril on apomorphine-induced behaviour were determined. Captopril had no effect on the apomorphine-induced yawning syndrome whereas this was blocked by haloperidol. In contrast, both captopril and haloperidol blocked oral stereotypy (licking and gnawing) induced by apomorphine but had no effect on sniffing induced by the dopamine agonist. Selective blockade of apomorphine-induced oral stereotypy by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was confirmed in the second study in which both captopril and enalapril were observed to antagonize apomorphine-induced gnawing. The inhibition of apomorphine-induced gnawing by enalapril correlated with inhibition of brain angiotensin converting enzyme, but not lung angiotensin converting enzyme, by the drug as assessed by ex vivo penetration studies. These data suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition modulates the expression of apomorphine-induced oral stereotypy, a response that is thought to be mediated by postsynaptic dopamine receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These results extend the findings of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), and indicate that ACE inhibition is beneficial to patients with all grades of overt congestive heart failure. In the Prevention Trial of SOLVD, and the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study (SAVE), therapy with enalapril or captopril improved prognosis among patients with, generally, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In particular, the risk of development of overt heart failure was reduced. Importantly, a marked anti-ischaemic effect of ACE inhibition was identified in both the SOLVD and SAVE trials. Clinical data amassed in nearly 9000 patients identify a substantial role for ACE inhibition in patients with all grades of symptomatic heart failure as well as in those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (such as often follows a myocardial infarction). Data support early intervention with ACE inhibitor therapy alone in asymptomatic cardiac failure and triple combination therapy (ACE inhibitor, diuretic, digoxin) in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.", 
    "548": "Congestive heart failure is associated with a considerable reduction in survival with only about 50% of patients alive within 5 years of its diagnosis. Recent trials have demonstrated that vasodilator therapy can improve survival in this condition. Agents that have been shown to be effective in well-designed double-blind clinical trials include the combination of hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (in V-HeFT) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (in SOLVD, SAVE, and CONSENSUS).", 
    "549": "Organic nitrates have been used widely in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. These drugs have been shown to have beneficial hemodynamic effects both at rest and during dynamic and isometric exercise. In combination with hydralazine, nitrates have been shown to improve exercise tolerance, enhance left ventricular ejection fraction, and prolong survival. The potential limitations of nitrate therapy are related to dose-related nitrate resistance and the development of nitrate tolerance. More information is needed regarding the usefulness of nitrate therapy without hydralazine and the additional benefits of these drugs in patients already treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "550": "This review has summarized the current role of diuretic therapy in heart failure, emphasizing those aspects most relevant to this patient population. Recommended diuretic usage is as follows: Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction--establish moderate sodium intake, Mild sodium retention--thiazide-type diuretic or low-dose loop diuretic; continue moderate sodium intake; combine with an ACE inhibitor, Moderate sodium retention--loop diuretic, adjusting for renal function, if necessary; continue moderate sodium intake; combine with an ACE inhibitor, Severe sodium retention--large-dose loop diuretic combined with a thiazide-type diuretic; continue moderate sodium intake; ACE inhibitor, unless contraindicated; consider addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic Treatment measures for refractory sodium retention--intermittent intravenous loop diuretic; short-term infusion of a loop diuretic; intensified combination oral diuretic therapy; intravenous positive inotropic therapy; ultrafiltration or dialysis. In addition, the well-known adverse effect of electrolyte depletion and guidelines for electrolyte replacement have been discussed. It is evident that the diuretic class of pharmacologic therapy has not been as well assessed as both the positive inotrope and vasodilator classes. Limitations in this regard have been summarized recently. Even relatively simple parameters or instruments, such as the sodium retention score, when applied to clinical trials will yield a greater understanding of the utility and limitations of diuretic therapy for heart failure.", 
    "551": "The medical management of patients with CHF and ventricular arrhythmias is one of the most challenging clinical situations frequently encountered by physicians on a daily basis. Reviewed and examined in this article are available data regarding the clinical relevance and prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias, their prognostic importance in patients with CHF, and the role of available therapeutic modalities and their limitations in the management of these patients.", 
    "552": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been shown to be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) should be administered to all patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Although ACE-Is are effective, there is reason to believe that further blockade of the RAAS by aldosterone antagonists and/or alternative means of blocking the RAAS by use of renin inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocking agents may have an important role in the future. The finding in the SOLVD and SAVE trials that ACE-Is are effective in reducing recurrent ischemic events in patients with left ventricular dysfunction also holds great promise for the future, not only for patients with left ventricular dysfunction but also as a possible secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease in patients without left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "553": "We investigated the roles of cyclooxygenase metabolites, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II (ANG II), as mediators of the chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance associated with left lung autotransplantation (LLA) in conscious dogs. Continuous left pulmonary vascular pressure-flow (LP-Q) plots were generated in conscious dogs 2- to 5-wk post-LLA and in sham-operated control conscious dogs. LLA resulted in a marked shift (P < 0.01) in the LP-Q relationship as reflected by an approximate doubling of the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient at each common value of left pulmonary blood flow compared with the control group. Cyclooxygenase pathway inhibition (indomethacin) and AVP V1-receptor block had no effect on the LP-Q relationship post-LLA. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (captopril) also failed to reverse the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance post-LLA. Because captopril has the dual effect of inhibiting the production of ANG II and the degradation of bradykinin, additional studies utilizing a selective ANG II receptor antagonist were performed. ANG II receptor block (saralasin) significantly altered the LP-Q relationship post-LLA to cause active pulmonary vasodilation (P < 0.01). Thus, the chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance post-LLA is not mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway or AVP V1-receptor activation. A significant component of the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance resulting from LLA is mediated by ANG II. The differential responses to captopril and saralasin may imply a pulmonary vasoregulatory role for bradykinin post-LLA.", 
    "554": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the action of trandolapril on blood glucose control and microalbuminuria in mild to moderate hypertensive in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Sixty-seven patients, aged between 33 and 79, were enrolled. After a two week placebo run-in period, treatment with trandolapril as monotherapy was given for 3 months. The dose of trandolapril was adjusted between 1 and 4 mg/day according to antihypertensive response. Patients were assessed clinically and by laboratory investigations each month. Two patients were excluded from efficacy analysis because of major protocol deviations. Mean DBP fell, under the influence of treatment, from 101 +/- 5 mmHg to 82 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and mean SBP from 171 +/- 9 mmHg tp 147 +/- 11 mmHG (p < 0.0001). At three months, 54 patients (84%) had a DBP < or = 90 mmHg. Microalbuminuria decreased significantly (p = 0.03) during treatment. Microalbuminuria returned to normal in 11 of the 13 patients in whom the baseline value was above 21 micrograms/min and increased to above normal in 2 of the 26 patients who had a normal baseline value. Blood glycosylated hemoglobin, fructosamine, glucose and creatinine, and creatinine clearance remained stable. Plasma potassium rose slightly in 7 patients. Six adverse events were reported (4 coughs, 1 peripheral edema, 1 plantar mal perforans). One patient died from pulmonary embolism. In conclusion, trandolapril is an effective antihypertensive agent in hypertensive diabetics. Trandolapril causes a significant decrease in microalbuminuria and does not interfere with blood glucose control in these patients.", 
    "555": "Rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis were given either angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (Ang IIRA), or no treatment for four weeks and were then monitored for an additional 12 weeks. In untreated PAN rats, proteinuria reached a maximum at two weeks (271 +/- 38 mg/day). Proteinuria in this early phase was markedly attenuated by ACEI (96 +/- 35 mg/day, P < 0.01), but unaffected by Ang IIRA (306 +/- 34 mg/day). Acute administration of a bradykinin antagonist substantially dampened the antiproteinuric effect of ACEI in PAN rats, resulting in an average increase in proteinuria of 41 +/- 14% in ACEI-treated rats (P < 0.05, ACEI vs. ACEI+bradykinin antagonist). Acute phase therapy for four weeks with ACEI or Ang IIRA did not attenuate subsequent glomerulosclerosis. Separate groups of PAN rats with similar degree of glomerulosclerosis, assessed at 16 weeks after PAN by renal biopsy, were then treated as follows: ACEI [50 mg/liter drinking water (DW), or 200 mg/liter DW], Ang IIRA (20 mg/liter DW, or 80 mg/liter DW) or no treatment, starting after renal biopsy. Whereas glomerulosclerosis increased from biopsy to autopsy at 28 weeks with emergence of low grade proteinuria in untreated PAN rats, proteinuria was absent and glomerulosclerosis was ameliorated or reversed in ACEI and Ang IIRA groups. The results indicate that the early phase proteinuria of PAN nephropathy is independent of Ang II, and that the antiproteinuric effect of ACEI is, at least in part, channeled through activation of bradykinin, whereas the subsequent progression of glomerulosclerosis is caused by a mechanism involving endogenous Ang II actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "556": "In experiments designed to analyze cardiovascular structure in response to antihypertensive therapy with an ACE inhibitor, we decided to start very early in life with the aim to prevent blood pressure increases and the development of vascular structural changes. In these treated groups of rats we unexpectedly observed that after they were weaned, their water consumption and urine volume, respectively, increased substantially. The present study was designed to determine if inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system produced similar effects in different strains of rats, and focused on characterizing the abnormal fluid balance occurring as a consequence to neonatal treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers. Three-day-old Wistar Kyoto (WKY), Wistar (WR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were given either saline, enalapril, captopril, losartan and the AT2 blocker, PD123319, in the same amount of volume for 20 days. Treatment was stopped and rats were examined with regard to renal morphology at 4, 14 and 30 weeks of age. In addition, water consumption, urine volume, urine electrolytes and osmolality were analyzed at 14 weeks of age, that is, 10 weeks off treatment. Early treatment with the ACE inhibitors, enalapril and captopril, and the AT1 blocker, losartan, but not the AT2 blocker, PD 123319, in the SHR and in the normotensive strains WKY and WR produced persistent, irreversible histopathological renal abnormalities in adult life, long after the rats had been taken off treatment. These abnormalities consisted of mainly cortical tubulointerstitial inflammation, various degrees of papillary atrophy and pelvic dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "557": "Chronic heart failure is a common clinical syndrome with high associated mortality and morbidity. Recent advances in therapy for the condition with vasodilators and, in particular, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have led to hopes for improvement in survival. Several large scale studies examining the role of vasodilators have reported over the last few years, and the role of vasodilators in the treatment and prevention of chronic heart failure is being delineated. There is new hope for patients with symptomatic heart failure; symptoms can be alleviated and prognosis improved. Increasingly, it appears as if there is a role for drug therapy in preventing the onset of chronic heart failure. In this paper, we examine the results of these studies and of some smaller studies in order to discuss the implications for current therapy and future research.", 
    "558": "A drug-use evaluation (DUE) of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors by both manual and computerized methods was conducted. Criteria for the use of ACE inhibitors were developed and approved. Fifty patients were randomly selected from 225 clinic outpatients who had begun taking an ACE inhibitor during a six-month period. The clinic medical records of each of the patients were reviewed by a pharmacist to determine compliance with the DUE criteria. At the same time, a computer program queried the computerized medical records of the same patients to evaluate adherence to the criteria. The manual method showed that ACE inhibitor therapy met threshold for two of the six criteria before exceptions were considered and for three criteria after exceptions were considered. Results for only two criteria met threshold when evaluated by the computer; the computer did not consider exceptions. There was good or excellent percent agreement between the manual and computerized methods for four of the six criteria. Kappa values showed that the agreement for five criteria was significant. A computerized method of evaluating drug use performed similarly to manual evaluation, but agreement was best for simply stated criteria.", 
    "559": "We have performed separate randomized prospective controlled studies on the effects of protein-restricted diet and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the rate of progression of non-diabetic renal failure. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance, reciprocal of plasma creatinine concentration and 51Cr-EDTA clearance. A protein-restricted diet (0.4 g per kg) resulted in a significantly lower rate of progression, as assessed by the slope of these parameters with time, when compared with a standard diet. ACE inhibition, when assessed by a mixed effect model, also significantly reduced the rate of progression. The many variables involved hinder trials of therapies directed against progression in non-diabetic renal failure.", 
    "560": "Ninety-four normotensive, type II diabetics with microalbuminuria and normal renal function were randomized to receive enalapril or placebo and were followed for five years. In the patients treated with enalapril, albuminuria decreased initially from 143 +/- 64 (mean +/- SD) mg/24 hours to 122 +/- 67 mg/24 hours, then a slow increase was observed to 140 +/- 134 mg/24 hours after five years. In the placebo group albuminuria increased from 123 +/- 58 mg/24 hours to 310 +/- 167 mg/24 hours after five years. The difference between the rates of change in albuminuria over time in the two groups was highly significant (P < 0.005). Kidney function, expressed as mean reciprocal creatinine, declined by 13% in the placebo group and remained stable (-1%) in the enalapril group (P < 0.05). The initial value of daily albuminuria was a good predictor of the subsequent decline in renal function (r = 0.86, P < 0.001 and r = 0.72, P < 0.001 for the enalapril and the placebo groups, respectively). Initial and subsequent mean values of cholesterol and LDL were lower in the enalapril than in the placebo group. There was a close correlation between mean cholesterol values and the decline in renal function (r = -0.58, P < 0.001). The mean blood pressure was stable in the enalapril group (initial group mean 99 +/- 2.1 mmHg, fifth year mean 100 +/- 3.2 mmHg) and increased in the placebo group from 97 +/- 3.2 mmHg to 102 +/- 3.4 mm Hg at the end of the study (P = 0.082).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "561": "The primary results of a three-year prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients show that an anti-hypertensive regimen, which includes the ACE inhibitor enalapril, preserves renal function to a greater extent than therapy with antihypertensive agents excluding ACE inhibitors (J Am Soc Nephrol 3:335, 1992). The influence of baseline urinary albumin excretion on the renal protective effects of enalapril treatment in these subjects was the objective of this further analysis. Adequate data were available in 121 patients of the 165 hypertensive NIDDM individuals studied [baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30 to 100 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of albumin (UAE), protein, urea nitrogen, creatinine and isotopically determined GFR were measured at baseline and six month intervals. Glycemic control and blood pressure regulation were assessed every three months. The rate of loss of GFR was significantly greater in patients with overt proteinuria at baseline (UAE > 300 mg/24 hr) as compared to patients with baseline sub-clinical proteinuria (UAE < or = 300 mg/24 hr). Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril preserved GFR significantly better (P < 0.01) in the patients with sub-clinical proteinuria at baseline (UAE < or = 300 mg/24 hr) than other antihypertensive treatments which excluded the ACE inhibitor. Furthermore, only 7% of the enalapril-treated group progressed to clinical albuminuria compared to 21% of control treated patients. Although the enalapril-treated group had a lower mean blood pressure during the maintenance period, no correlation between blood pressure (systolic, diastolic or mean arterial) and rate of change of GFR was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the present study, the enalapril treated patients have been studied for two additional years. In the metoprolol-treated group, only the endpoints of death or uremia have been recorded, and six of the patients have reached end-stage renal failure and three are dead, compared to three and two, respectively in the enalapril treated group. The mean fall in glomerular filtration rate in 18 enalapril-treated patients is 8.4 +/- 9.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 after four years; 7.5 +/- 9.8 ml/min/1.73 m2, occurred during the first six months treatment. The mean decline in kidney function was 1.7 +/- 2.4 ml/min/year over the whole study period and 0.3 +/- 3.9 ml/min/year after exclusion of the first six months. In this study, long-term enalapril treatment in diabetic nephropathy was associated with a low rate of decline in kidney function.", 
    "563": "Thirty-five hypertensive patients, consecutively studied between 1986 and 1991, were retrospectively reviewed, to compare Technetium-99m (99mTc) DTPA renal scanning for renal artery stenosis with angiography. Ten patients were on chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medication and 20 underwent angioplasty of their stenoses. In patients not on ACE inhibitors the renal scan specificity was 83%, sensitivity 82%, negative predictive value 89% and positive predictive value 74%. In the 10 patients on ACE inhibitors the specificity was 67% (relatively more stenoses of < 50% were reported in this group), sensitivity 100%, negative predictive value 100% and positive predictive value 60%. Low levels of function (< 10 mL/min/1.73m2) in 9 kidneys did not militate against diagnoses that correlated well with angiography. Hence, renal scanning, particularly with ACE inhibition, is efficacious in the evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis. With a mean follow-up period of 29 months after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), four patients had clinical improvement of hypertension control. Each had pre-PTA total glomerular filtration rates (GFR) of approximately 75 mL/min/1.73m2. No improvement was detected in cases with pre-PTA total GFR of < 50 mL/min/1.73m2. This may be the level of renal function below which PTA therapy or surgery will not provide benefit.",

Perindoprilat similarly caused a dose dependent increase in action potential duration, but with 100 times greater potency [EC50 = 3.1 x 10(-10) M; maximum effect = 71(11)% prolongation at 10(-5) M for APD90]. SQ 14,534, a stereoisomer of captopril with one hundredth the ACE inhibitor potency, had no significant effect on action potential duration at 10(-5) M. Angiotensin I and bradykinin caused concentration dependent prolongation of action potential, but angiotensin II (10(-6) M) had no effect. Captopril (10(-5) M) had no significant effect in the hypertrophied right ventricle from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, but significantly increased APD90 [39(4.9)%] in right ventricular preparations from rats with 4 week old anterior left ventricular infarction.",

It was previously shown that narrowing of carotid artery lumen induced by balloon injury was not influenced by treatment, even though the two ACE inhibitors used inhibited neointimal thickening. The aim of the present study was to include a calcium antagonist as well, in order to investigate whether vasospasm contributes to the persistence of lumen narrowing in ACE inhibitor treated rats after a balloon lesion.", 
    "569": "Six groups of 10 rats were subject to balloon lesion of the left carotid artery. They received spirapril (10 mg.kg-1 x d-1) or isradipine (30 or 100 mg.kg-1 x d-1) or both, given throughout the study in the food. Controls received no drug. Neointimal thickening was measured histologically two weeks after injury. The cross sectional carotid lumen area was measured in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, both before and two weeks after balloon injury, and also postmortem by histological techniques.", 
    "570": "Two weeks after injury, the lumen area of the left carotid artery was significantly reduced following balloon injury, as measured by both techniques. Treatment did not modify the stenosis process as assessed by either method for measuring lumen size. Neointimal thickening, however, was inhibited by between 4% (low dose isradipine) and 59% (combined spirapril + high dose isradipine) in the various treatment groups.", 
    "571": "Since calcium antagonist treatment was not able to influence the reduction of lumen size, it is unlikely that the narrowing is due to reversible spasm of the carotid artery in the first two weeks after inducing a balloon lesion. Alternatively, chronic vasospasm of neointimal smooth muscle might not be very sensitive to calcium antagonists.",

Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine, adenosine, and bradykinin that induced dose dependent increases in coronary blood flow and diameter were performed with and without intracoronary administration of captopril (1 mg.kg-1) and enalapril (0.4 mg.kg-1). The effects were studied of concomitant inhibition of bradykinin actions by the specific B2 kinin antagonist HOE-140 (10(-7) M), NO-synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 2 x 10(-5) M), or cyclo-oxygenase by indomethacin (10(-7) M) (all intracoronary).",

In contrast, both ACE inhibitors potentiated the agonist induced increases in coronary blood flow by bradykinin and acetylcholine (p < or = 0.01). HOE-140 strongly antagonised the effects of infused bradykinin and prevented the potentiation of acetylcholine responses by ACE inhibition. L-NAME caused hypertension and bradycardia and abolished the responses to acetylcholine and adenosine, but only partially attenuated the bradykinin induced increases in coronary blood flow. Simultaneous ACE inhibition reduced the hypertensive effect of L-NAME and partially restored the responses to bradykinin. Indomethacin reduced the responses to bradykinin but did not affect acetylcholine and adenosine induced coronary vasodilatation. The potentiation of the response to acetylcholine induced by ACE inhibition was, however, diminished by indomethacin.",

The APD90 was delayed from 510(63) ms to 540(45) ms (0.1 microM), to 583(42) ms (0.3 microM), to 702(62) ms (1.0 microM), and to 765(72) ms (3.0 microM). Higher concentrations (10-100 microM) caused early afterdepolarisations, very long action potentials, and irregular oscillations. ICaL was enhanced by up to 183%, showing a Kd of 0.2 microM; in contrast to the steady state activation (d infinity), the inactivation curve f infinity was shifted in the depolarising direction, considerably enlarging the Ca2+ window. Slow inactivation time course was unchanged, whereas the fast time constant (tau f) was accelerated. Fosinoprilate reduced the outward current during depolarising clamps from 1.7(0.2) nA to 1.41(0.11) nA with a 0.1 microM dose, and to 0.54(0.14) nA with a 1.0 microM dose; the tails were decreased from 0.39(0.03) nA to 0.27(0.03) nA with 0.1 microM and to 0.13(0.02) nA with 1.0 microM. Kinetics of IK were unaltered. Computer simulations based on these data using the OXSOFT-HEART program mimicked the results rather closely.", 
    "579": "The results suggest that fosinoprilate prolongs the plateau due to a partial block of iK and an extension of the Ca2+ window by 10 mV, causing a class III antiarrhythmic effect. High concentrations further open the Ca2+ window resulting in early afterdepolarisations and plateau oscillations and may cause an inward transport of Ca2+ ions by the Na-Ca exchange.", 
    "580": "Three major trials, in patients with chronic heart failure, have shown that treatment with an ACE inhibitor reduces mortality. However, at the time of writing this review there continue to be strong grounds for uncertainty as to the role of these drugs after acute myocardial infarction in man. This uncertainty is exemplified by the findings of two recently published mortality trials, the CONSENSUS II and the SAVE investigations. Despite virtually identical premises, though widely differing therapeutic approaches, the observations reported in these two papers contrast markedly. In this review we have sought to analyse the possible reasons why the findings of the two trials differ. In our attempt to understand this important issue we have necessarily turned to smaller clinical studies, and also to investigations performed in animals. Furthermore, we review the investigational strategies which have been employed by other, currently unreported, large scale survival studies, as these will certainly hold many of the answers to the questions which the SAVE and CONSENSUS II trials have raised.", 
    "581": "Regional alterations in left ventricular function are generally present in patients who sustain an acute myocardial infarction. Segmental wall motion abnormalities in left ventricular systolic function can be identified in the hyperacute period and generally persist in patients with myocardial infarction. Through the process of infarct expansion, the infarcted territory may thin and lengthen in the short term following a myocardial infarction. Some infarct survivors are also prone to further progressive alterations in the shape and size of the left ventricle, a process that has been termed \"postinfarction ventricular remodelling\". Although a component of left ventricular remodelling appears to represent an adaptive process serving to preserve stroke volume and cardiac output following myocardial injury, the enlargement process may have undesirable long term effects on global left ventricular function and on clinical prognosis. Fortunately, recent experimental and clinical evidence shows that ventricular remodelling and its deleterious consequences may be preventable.", 
    "582": "Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg sc) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg sc) reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and increased ingestion of water and 0.3 M NaCl within 2 h. Administration of either agent alone did not reduce MAP or cause significant fluid intakes. The increased ingestion of water and saline after furosemide plus captopril 1) was not due to increased excretion of water and sodium compared with losses after furosemide alone, 2) was abolished by the AT1-receptor blocker, losartan (10 mg/kg sc), and 3) was abolished by administration of a greater dose of captopril (100 mg/kg sc). Intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (3-4 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) prevented the reduction in MAP after furosemide plus captopril and blunted the saline intake but not water intake. Simultaneous administration of the vasodilator minoxidil and captopril also stimulated robust salt appetite in association with reduced MAP. It is concluded that the integrity of renin-angiotensin mechanisms is necessary for the rapid ingestion of water and saline after furosemide and captopril and that arterial pressure modulates the behavioral responses.", 
    "583": "The blood pressure was decreased after chronic treatment with enalapril, MK-954, and hydralazine in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt-induced malignant hypertension of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR); however, ventricular weight and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration were decreased after enalapril and MK-954 but not after hydralazine. The BNP secretory rates from the ventricle in enalapril- and MK-954-treated DOCA-salt SHR were decreased to approximately 50% of those in untreated DOCA-salt SHR. The BNP secretory rate from the ventricle was positively correlated with ventricular weight in untreated and treated DOCA-salt SHR. In contrast, acute administration of captopril or MK-954 did not decrease the BNP secretory rate from the heart. Results suggest that the decrease in plasma BNP after enalapril and MK-954 is attributed to a decline in the secretion from the ventricle but not from the atrium.

N-N-(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl-L-alanyl-N-(indan-2-yl)glycine (M-1; an active metabolite of delapril, a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor) and captopril (a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M) relaxed in a dose-dependent manner canine femoral arterial rings precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha in the presence of endothelium only. The endothelium-dependent relaxations by M-1 and captopril were completely blocked by methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase; NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis; and oxyhemoglobin, an inactivator of nitric oxide; they were partially blocked by aspirin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and were enhanced by superoxide dismutase, a radical scavenger. The inhibitory effect of L-NMMA on the relaxations by M-1 and captopril were reversed by a high dose of L-arginine. Moreover, a bradykinin antagonist partially inhibited these relaxations. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent relaxations by M-1 and captopril in canine femoral arteries are mediated through the release of both prostanoids and endothelium-derived nitric oxide via endogenous bradykinin.", 
    "585": "Experiments were performed in the in situ kidney of rats and in isolated afferent arterioles of the rabbit to study the interaction between angiotensin II and adenosine in producing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. In the intact rat kidney, we observed that 1) peritubular infusion of the adenosine1-receptor blocker 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPX, 10(-4) M) blocked the fall in stop-flow pressure (PSF) induced by angiotensin II (5 x 10(-7) M) but not that caused by vasopressin (10(-5) M) or norepinephrine (10(-5) M), 2) peritubular infusion of saralasin (5 x 10(-5) M) attenuated the fall in PSF caused by N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA, 10(-5) M) 3) the fall in PSF following luminal application of CHA (10(-5) M) was reduced in angiotensin II-depleted states (volume expansion and converting enzyme inhibition) and this could be reversed by infusion of low doses of angiotensin II, and 4) the reduction in PSF in response to luminal infusion of CHA was augmented in a greater-than-additive fashion when angiotensin was simultaneously administered at low intravenous infusion rates. In isolated afferent arterioles of the rabbit, we noted that 1) addition of 10(-5) M CPX to the bath significantly blunted the constrictor effect of angiotensin II (10(-8) M), 2) presence of the converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilate (10(-7) M) caused a right shift in the constrictor-response curve to increasing concentrations of CHA (10(-9)-10(-5) M) but 10(-5) M saralasin did not affect vasoconstriction caused by 10(-6) M adenosine, 3) simultaneous administration of submaximal constrictor doses of angiotensin II (10(-10) M) and adenosine (10(-6) M) produced vasoconstriction that was greater than additive, and 4) 10(-5) M CHA and angiotensin II (10(-7) M) constricted afferent arterioles after removal of the glomerulus, whereas either agent alone had no constrictor effect in this preparation. Our results suggest that adenosine and angiotensin cooperate in a mutually dependent and synergistic fashion in producing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction.", 
    "586": "We studied the effect of exogenous bradykinin on blood flow in the airway microcirculation of anesthetized F344 rats in vivo. We made three successive determinations of airway blood flow and cardiac output using a modification of the reference sample microsphere technique. Injection of bradykinin into the left ventricle increased airway blood flow in a dose-related manner. Pretreatment with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, completely abolished bradykinin-, but not histamine-induced vasodilation. A bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, [des-Arg9]bradykinin, did not affect airway blood flow. We also studied the effect of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (captopril) and neutral endopeptidase (phosphoramidon) on bradykinin-induced vasodilation. Pretreatment with captopril, but not phosphoramidon, potentiated the bradykinin-induced vasodilation. However, the addition of phosphoramidon further potentiated the effect of captopril. We conclude that injection of bradykinin into the left ventricle produces a dose-related vasodilation in the airway microcirculation mediated via B2 receptors, an effect that is modulated primarily by angiotensin-converting enzyme and, to a lesser extent, by neutral endopeptidase.", 
    "587": "In patients with renal insufficiency, as the number of functioning nephrons is reduced, potassium balance is maintained by an increase in potassium excretion in the remaining nephrons. This adaptive response is, in part, mediated by an increase in aldosterone production by the adrenal gland. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in these patients can result in hyperkalemia by suppressing aldosterone production by the adrenal gland. Inhibition of aldosterone production depends on the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the circulation as well as the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II formed locally in the adrenal gland. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the latter process may be important for the tonic regulation of aldosterone production. Because the various ACE inhibitors exhibit different degrees of ACE inhibition at the tissue level, it is reasonable to postulate that angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production will be inhibited to a lesser degree by agents that have low tissue specificity for the adrenal gland. This feature would be most advantageous in treating patients with chronic renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Therefore, the ideal ACE inhibitor should not suppress aldosterone secretion in such patients.",

To investigate the effect of two different antihypertensive agents, nifedipine and enalapril, on cardiovascular reactivity and lipoprotein patterns in cigarette smokers with hypertension, 92 essential hypertensive (175 +/- 11/103 +/- 8 mm Hg) subjects were studied, who had no sign of lipidosis, and subdivided into four groups in order of smoking habit and therapy. Over a 30-month follow-up period, the percentage changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were evaluated while the patients underwent a session of psychophysiologic tests to assess sympathetic reactivity. The response was calculated through the difference in cumulative percentage changes (DC%) in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HR, muscular contraction (EMG), skin conductance (SCL), and peripheral temperature (TP). The office BP was reduced significantly in all groups. In the nonsmokers, enalapril reduced (p < 0.05) the SCL-, TP-, SBP-, and DBP-DC% reactivity, lowered (p < 0.05) TR, C-tot, and LDL, and increased (p < 0.05) the HDL. However, nifedipine magnified the sympathetic responses and the atherosclerotic lipoproteins and decreased (p < 0.05) the HDL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "589": "Multiple ion transport defects have been characterized in red blood cell membranes from essential hypertensive patients. These seem to be biochemical markers of at least three different types of essential hypertension. A first type is characterized by low pump, low cotransport fluxes in erythrocytes. These hypertensive patients are apparently identical to the salt-sensitive, low-renin hypertensive patients, in whom low pump and cotransport seem to result from the presence of circulating endogenous ouabain-like and bumetanide-like factors. These hypertensive patients are sensitive to diuretic drugs and to vaso-relaxants with salidiuretic activity, as expected from a reduction in plasma volume and circulating levels of endogenous ion transport inhibitors. A second type of essential hypertension is characterized by increased red cell Na+:Li+ countertransport and [Na+, K+, Cl-] cotransport. These hypertensive patients tend to present normal or high plasma renin activity, disorders in lipid metabolism, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertensive patients belonging to this group seem to be resistant to diuretic drugs but sensitive to vasorelaxants. A third type of essential hypertension is characterized by both high membrane sodium leak and high [Na+, K+, Cl-] cotransport in erythrocytes. Hypertensive patients in this group are resistant to diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and centrally acting drugs.", 
    "590": "This study was designed to evaluate renal functional reserve (RFR) in obstructive nephropathy using amino acid loading and the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on RFR. We divided 24 rabbits into 4 groups, consisting of a control, 6-hours-bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO), 24-hour BUO and 24-hour BUO pretreated with ACE inhibitor. Following the ligation of the bilateral ureters at the vesicoureteral junction, a unilateral ureter was released after a 6-hour or 24-hour duration in the obstructive groups. We measured RFR and renal vascular resistance after releasing a unilateral ureter in BUO. The baseline GFR values in the 6-hour and 24-hour BUO groups were significantly lower than that in the control. RFR were 0.34 + 0.04 ml/min/kg (control), 0.10 + 0.03 (6-hour BUO), 0.01 + 0.03 (24-hour BUO) and 0.10 + 0.01 (ACE inhibitor), respectively. RFR in the 6-hour BUO group was well preserved compared with that in the 24-hour BUO group. Pretreatment with ACE inhibitor in the 24-hour BUO group enhanced RFR to the extent of 6-hour BUO. Our results demonstrated that angiotensin II plays an important role in decreased GFR with obstructive nephropathy. Moreover, the present data suggested that evaluation of RFR might play a key role in the recovery of the post-obstructive renal function.",

In this report, I describe the case of a patient who had no risk factors for pancreatitis and who was taking no medications known to cause pancreatitis other than lisinopril. The abruptness, severity, and fulminant course of this case of probable ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis are unprecedented in the medical literature. Possible mechanisms underlying the induction of pancreatitis by ACE inhibitors are discussed. The medical literature concerning pancreatitis and articles reviewing ACE inhibitors do not make note of the relationship between the two. Greater awareness of this association will promote a higher index of suspicion in appropriate clinical settings. Further reporting of cases and clinical research into the cause and prevention of drug-induced pancreatitis appears to be indicated.",

In anesthetized, open chest rats, U-46619 dose dependently increased MPAP whereas MSAP presented a biphasic evolution. The U-446619 (1.25 micrograms/kg)-increased MPAP (52.4 +/- 12.1%; P < .005) was dose dependently inhibited by the TxA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548 ([1S-[1 alpha,2 alpha (5z),3 alpha, 4 alpha]]-7- [3-[[2-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl)hydrazino]methyl]-7-oxabiacyclo [2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid) (10.6 +/- 2 and 2.1 +/- 1.4% at 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively; both P < .05 vs. U-46619 in control rats).

    "593": "The biochemical properties and immunohistochemical localization of leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase were investigated in human skin. The activity of LTA4 hydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of LTA4 to LTB4, the most chemotactic compound known, was detected in the 100,000 x g supernatant of homogenates of human epidermis and a transformed epidermal cell line (HSC-1). No significant LTA4 hydrolase activity was detected in human whole skin or dermis. The enzymatic properties of LTA4 hydrolase isolated from human keratinocytes and peripheral leukocytes were similar. Their activities were inhibited by bestatin and captopril, and they were completely absorbed by anti-human LTA4 hydrolase antibody. By immunoblotting analysis using this antibody, LTA4 hydrolase was detected as a 70-kDa protein in human epidermis and HSC-1 and was found to be similar to the enzyme detected in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes. In human dermis, LTA4 hydrolase was barely detected by Western blotting. On the other hand, LTA4 hydrolase was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in the epidermis, and in fibroblasts, infiltrating and endothelial cells in the dermis of normal human skin by immunohistochemical analysis using the immunoperoxidase method. These results suggest that LTB4 can be generated from LTA4 by LTA4 hydrolase in keratinocytes as well as fibroblasts, infiltrating and endothelial cells in the dermis of human skin.", 
    "594": "Maladaptive changes in the periphery largely account for the symptomatology of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). A decline in the systolic function of the left ventricle precipitates activation of neural and humoral systems to provide circulatory support. These include sympathetic release of norepinephrine, increases in angiotensin II, elevated levels of circulating arginine vasopressin, and impairment of the counterregulatory function of atrial natriuretic peptide. The resultant circulatory changes are ultimately responsible for the declining function of the peripheral vasculature and skeletal muscles of patients with CHF. In the peripheral vasculature, impaired vasodilatory capacity results from excess vessel wall stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and structural abnormalities. The skeletal muscles develop poor aerobic capacity as a result of a change in predominant fiber type and excess reliance on glycolytic metabolic pathways. Physical deconditioning induced by symptoms tends to further promote these peripheral changes. Therapeutic interventions with symptomatic and prognostic benefits have essentially been targeted at the periphery. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may act by normalizing electrolyte and water balance, improving vascular endothelial function, and reversing structural changes in peripheral vessels. Exercise training appears to exert its benefit at the level of the vascular endothelium. Advances in the therapy of CHF depend on a greater understanding of changes in the periphery.", 
    "595": "Vasodilator drugs, particularly intravenously infused nitroprusside and an orally administered combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, exert a profoundly favorable hemodynamic effect in the setting of heart failure complicating a prior myocardial infarction. Although these oral drugs also may relieve symptoms and improve exercise tolerance, the long-term benefits appear to be related to inhibition or reversal of the left ventricular dilation that results in a progressive fall in left ventricular ejection fraction. The long-term efficacy of both ACE inhibitors and hydralazine-nitrate in symptomatic heart failure makes the vasodilator combination a rational alternative to an ACE inhibitor and possibly an effective agent for cotherapy with an ACE inhibitor. Trials are needed to test the additive efficacy of this vasodilator combination and to develop other safe and effective drugs that target the progressive remodeling process in heart failure.", 
    "596": "A series of trifluoromethyl-containing analogs of captopril as well as analogs and homologs of enalaprilat were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It was found that direct substitution of trifluoromethyl for methyl produced a very potent captopril analog with an IC50 of 3 x 10(-10) M in vitro. Hydrophobicity and conformational effects of trifluoromethyl group are among the reasons accounting for this activity. Structure-activity relationship is studied based on molecular mechanics calculations using a II-SCF-molecular mechanics program (PIMM) as well as SYBYL molecular mechanics program. It was found that simultaneous incorporation of trifluoromethyl and an indoline residue unexpectedly yielded a less potent captopril analog (IC50 = 8 x 10(-8) M). Enalaprilat analogs derived from replacement of the alanine residue with trifluoronorvaline and trifluoronorleucine residues gave moderately potent compounds (IC50 = 2-6 x 10(-8) M). The structure-activity relationship for these fluoroenalaprilat analogs is discussed in comparison with known analogs.", 
    "597": "First, we had the discussion 'Are all ACE inhibitors equal?', and the debate was really in relation to heart failure. I came away with the impression that although there might be variations with renal function, hypotension and so on, most of you felt that it was ACE inhibition that was of primary importance, and that it was therefore permissible to extrapolate from one study to another. The recently published AIRE study of post-infarct patients used ramipril, with a change in mortality that gives credence to the idea that it's not just captopril, not just enalapril, but is likely to be a class effect of ACE inhibitors. I think that's the feeling I got from you. Do ACE inhibitors prolong life? I think Professor Weich made a very simple and a very good point, because it allowed us a general extrapolation. The simple point is: the sicker the patient, certainly with heart failure, the more the benefit of the ACE inhibitor. It's like the idea that in elderly hypertensives, or the diabetic hypertensive, the greater the risk factor the greater the benefit. The more we want to treat prophylactically, whether it's micro-albuminuria, or transient hypertension, or minimal left ventricular dysfunction, the longer we will have to treat, and the more patients we will have to treat to get objective evidence of any differences.

Brief treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) causes a persistent reduction in blood pressure associated with a relatively selective reduction in renal vascular resistance. 2. To study the possible role of the kidney in this long-term hypotensive effect, we transplanted kidneys from untreated SHR into SHR that had been treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) between 6 and 10 weeks of age and also transplanted kidneys from perindopril-pretreated SHR into untreated SHR. After transplantation, the remaining native kidney was removed so that only donor kidneys remained. 3. Untreated SHR that received kidneys from perindopril-pretreated SHR showed an initial fall in blood pressure followed by a rapid increase in pressure, weight loss and early death. 4. The transplantation of kidneys from control SHR into perindopril-pretreated SHR resulted in a rise in blood pressure that obviated the long-term reduction seen normally in these animals. 5. Kidneys from perindopril-pretreated SHR may be susceptible to the high blood pressure in untreated SHR. 6. The blood pressure increase in perindopril-pretreated SHR that accompanies substitution of the native kidneys by kidneys from untreated SHR further supports the hypothesis that the kidney is responsible for the long-term pressure effects following ACE inhibition in young SHR.",

Following treatment the systolic blood pressure of SHR treated with perindopril remained consistently lower than control SHR until about 82 weeks of age. After this age the blood pressure of control SHR fell spontaneously so that smaller differences were observed between the two groups in the last 4 months of the study. 4. Rats that received perindopril lived on average 1 month longer than control rats, but this difference was not statistically significant. 5.

Imidapril reduced the mortality rate more significantly than enalapril did. In the second experiment where imidapril, enalapril and captopril were administered to the mice at 5 mg/kg/day, p.o., both imidapril and captopril significantly reduced the mortality, but enalapril did not. Blood pressure was slightly reduced by these ACE inhibitors. These data suggest that imidapril and captopril are efficacious for the treatment of myocardial infarction and blood pressure reduction hardly contributes to its mechanism of action.",

Samples were taken at rest and immediately after maximal bicycle exercise, before and after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril or placebo. There was a strong correlation between the plasma levels of each hormone before and after exercise. An inverse correlation existed at baseline between exercise duration and angiotensin II levels after maximal exercise (r = -0.30, P = 0.03), but not at rest. Plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and noradrenaline were increased after maximal exercise compared to rest. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity and ANP were reduced by ramipril compared to placebo, both at rest and after exercise, but levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone and nordrenaline were not significantly affected.

In a multicentre study, 85 patients from 10 centres performed a total of 331 bicycle maximal tests (ramp protocols, 10 watts.min-1) with respiratory gas analysis by different systems. A central committee reviewed all the tests. Percentages of AT determination ranged from 34% to 71% depending on the method used. Apart from the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) method, which yielded the lowest rate of determination: 34%, and the crossing point (when RER = 1), which yielded the highest rate, 71%, other methods of determination, such as carbon dioxide (42%), minute ventilation (52%) or ventilatory equivalents plotted vs time (57%), did not differ in the rate of AT determination. Thus, even among trained physicians, AT determination was not reliable. The crossing point may nevertheless be a valuable index from a pragmatic standpoint, although it occurs after the actual AT. Peak oxygen uptake should remain the main end-point in assessment of exercise capacity.", 
    "620": "Methods of effective renal plasma flow measurement by 125I-orthoiodohippurate elimination and para-aminohippurate clearance were compared with and without captopril pretreatment in 10 chronic heart failure patients and in 20 patients after transmural myocardial infarction. In the chronic heart failure group measurements of effective renal plasma flow by the two techniques were strongly correlated (r = 0.92, P < 0.00001), as was the captopril-mediated change in effective renal plasma flow by the two methods (r = 0.85, P = 0.002). However, in absolute terms para-aminohippurate clearance significantly exceeded 125I-orthoiodohippurate clearance by a mean (+/- SD) of 24.8 +/- 43.7 ml.min-1 (P < 0.05) so that only using the former technique was a significant increment in renal perfusion observed in response to converting enzyme inhibition. In the post-myocardial infarction group, correlations between the two methods were variable and much poorer than in the chronic heart failure group (r = 0.54, P = 0.01 and r = 0.74, P = 0.002 on consecutive days). Furthermore, captopril-mediated increments in effective renal plasma flow by the two techniques were unrelated (r = -0.19, P = 0.59). In this group 125I-orthoiodohippurate elimination significantly exceeded para-aminohippurate clearance (P < 0.05). This reversed association and the weaker relationships between methods in post-infarction as compared to chronic heart failure patients may be related to interference by thrombolytic or aspirin treatments.", 
    "621": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of fish oil in proteinuric patients with IgA nephropathy is being conducted by the Mayo Nephrology Collaborative Group. We completed enrollment of 106 patients into the trial in December 1991. The treatment period is for two years. Hypertension is being managed in all patients with enalapril maleate (Vasotec). We evaluated the associations between a variety of clinical and renal morphologic features and renal function at the entry of all enrolled patients. Among 78 males and 28 females [age(mean +/- SD) 36 +/- 14 years], older age at treatment randomization, hypertension, at disease discovery as well as at study entry, increased fractional excretion of albumin, increased serum triglyceride levels, and more severe tubulointerstitial, vascular, and combined glomerular and tubulointerstitial histologic lesions were all univariately associated (p < or = 0.01) with poorer renal function measured by reciprocal serum creatinine and creatinine clearance levels. In a multiple regression analysis used to predict baseline reciprocal creatinine, the best final model (R2 = 0.48) included male sex (p < .001), hypertension at treatment randomization (p = .001), decreased peripheral blood erythrocytes (p = .001), increased tubulointerstitial score (p = .004), and increased fractional excretion of albumin (p = .025) as independent predictors of decreased kidney function. These associations are similar to those seen in the high-risk subset of patients with IgA nephropathy who develop end-stage renal disease. In the eventual outcome analysis of the clinical trial, we will examine the effects of treatment on the two potentially modifiable risk factors, hypertension and proteinuria, on renal function.", 
    "622": "1. We investigated possible structural correlates of the beneficial effect of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) with lisinopril on the aortic distensibility of normotensive rats. 2. Experiments were performed in young (4-month old), normotensive, Wistar rats which received lisinopril in their drinking water (0.9 or 9 mg kg-1 day-1) for 9 months. 3. Following ACEI treatment, rats were pithed and aortic pulse wave velocity was measured during the progressive rise in mean arterial blood pressure produced by i.v. infusion of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine. The slope of the regression line relating aortic pulse wave velocity to mean arterial blood pressure was taken as an index of aortic distensibility. Following this, the aorta was fixed in situ at a normotensive pressure level and histomorphometry was performed. We also measured the calcium content of the aortic wall by atomic absorption. 4. The lower dose of lisinopril failed to lower systolic arterial blood pressure (unanaesthetized rat) or mean arterial blood pressure (pithed rat). Chronic ACEI with the higher dose of lisinopril lowered both systolic arterial blood pressure (104 +/- 6 mmHg, controls 133 +/- 4 mmHg, unanaesthetized), and mean arterial blood pressure (27 +/- 1 mmHg, controls 34 +/- 2 mmHg, pithed). 5. Although the lower dose of lisinopril did not lower blood pressure, it did improve aortic distensibility as revealed by a fall in the slope relating aortic pulse wave velocity (Y) to mean arterial blood pressure (X). Values were 5.7 +/- 0.7, 3.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.7 +/- 0.3 in controls, and in low and high ACEI groups, respectively. 6. Lisinopril treatment did not modify the calcium content, the internal and external diameters or the medial thickness of the aorta. Chronic ACEI did, however, increase the thickness of the medial elastic fibres (controls 3.55 +/- 0.05 microm, low dose ACEI 4.05 +/- 0.15 gm (P<0.05), and high dose ACEI4.18 +/- 0.15 microm (P<0.05)).7. In conclusion, we would suggest that ACEI treatment with a low dose of lisinopril can decrease aortic stiffness via a pressure-independent mechanism which possibly involves an effect of ACEI on elastic fibres.", 
    "623": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors constitute a major treatment modality for cardiovascular diseases, including congestive heart failure and hypertension. In addition to their beneficial hemodynamic effects, they offer other advantages, such as a relative lack of adverse effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. When used judiciously, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may also contribute to improved renal function. These agents induce vasodilation of both efferent and afferent renal vessels, which may facilitate improved renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in individuals whose renal insufficiency results from hyperadrenergic activity. Improvements in renal function may also be observed when angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are employed in other clinical conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy or proteinuric renal disease. Although the renal protective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are well recognized, their use in certain circumstances may actually contribute to renal dysfunction. The factors which may predispose an individual to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal dysfunction must be recognized by the clinician and appropriate interventions taken to prevent this potentially deleterious effect. This article reviews those factors which increase risk for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal dysfunction and provides recommendations for prevention.", 
    "624": "Comparative in vitro dissolution studies were performed on several tablet batches of zofenopril calcium, an ACE inhibitor, to determine if they could be differentiated on the basis of their release rates. The samples included six batches produced at Site 1 and one batch produced at Site 2. Using regular dissolution conditions (USP paddle method at a 50-rpm agitation speed in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 degrees C), release rates of all the tablet batches were similar. By independently altering one of the dissolution test parameters, either a lower pH or a slower agitation rate, discrimination between the Site 1 and Site 2 tablets was enhanced. Discrimination was only slightly enhanced when a lower dissolution medium temperature was used. Tablets made from different polymorphs of zofenopril calcium could not be differentiated by their dissolution profiles, even with the more discriminating conditions. The dissolution profiles of certain other zofenopril calcium tablets (including film-coated vs uncoated tablets, and tablets made with micronized vs unmicronized drug particles) were indistinguishable using a 50-rpm agitation rate, but they could be clearly differentiated using a 40-rpm agitation rate.", 
    "625": "The link between alcohol and hypertension is well established, yet the mechanism through which alcohol raises blood pressure remains elusive. Possible mechanisms include an imbalance of the central nervous system, impairment of the baroreceptors, an increase of sympathetic activity, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, an increase in cortisol levels, an increase of intracellular calcium levels with a subsequent increase in vascular reactivity, stimulation of the endothelium to release endothelin or inhibition of endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production, and chronic subclinical withdrawal. For control of hypertension, cessation or at least reduction of alcohol intake is the first step. Pharmacologic treatment should be withheld until after 2 to 4 weeks of abstinence from alcohol. Alcoholism can result in autonomic neuropathy and cardiomyopathy that can lead to a fall in blood pressure. We believe that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment.", 
    "626": "The therapeutic approach to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) still remains nonspecific and symptomatic, since no specific etiology is identified. Nevertheless, the recent introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers greatly improved the treatment of DCM. The poor prognosis of patients with DCM encourages maximal aggressive attempts to prevent progression of ventricular dysfunction rather than to wait for treatable symptoms. To achieve this goal, vasodilators, particularly ACE inhibitors, now appear to be essential for the treatment of DCM. Digitalis is added unless contraindicated by adverse effects. Diuretics should be used only to relieve congestive symptoms. In the presence of sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias, beta-blockers are the next choice in our practice. When congestive symptoms or low output state are not controlled with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis, inotropic agents are indicated, with or without mechanical assist devices. For severely ill patients unresponsive to maximal medical management, heart transplantation is needed.", 
    "627": "ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are revolutionizing the management of heart failure and are now earning themselves a place in the early treatment of post myocardial infarction (MI) patients who have evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or, more modestly, evidence of infarct expansion. The aims of ACE inhibitor therapy are to control symptoms, if any, and to improve prognosis. For these indications, they are impressive. Nonetheless, they are not a panacea. Post MI patients face a variety of threats, not least from progression of their underlying ischemic disease, and they should not be denied prognostically advantageous interventions, such as beta-blockers and aspirin. Moreover, ACE inhibitor monotherapy may not be the best management for heart failure itself. The role of other additive agents should not be dismissed.", 
    "628": "We established the cartography of 11 exo- and endopeptidases in the frontal and parietal cortices and in the cerebellum of brains of patients diagnosed with a senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Comparison with those of four subjects who had died without known neurologic or psychiatric illness indicated that there existed a region-specific alteration of the peptidase contents in the disease. In the frontal area of SDAT brains, postproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase M activities were significantly reduced. In the parietal cortex of SDAT brain, activities of three additional endopeptidases--angiotensin-converting enzyme, proline endopeptidase, and endopeptidase 24.15--were also drastically reduced. In contrast, the cerebellum displayed a set of proteolytic activities that remained unaffected in SDAT brain. The putative influence of the disease on the catabolic fates of neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin(1-14) was investigated. Neurotensin was catabolized at identical rates in the frontal and parietal cortices in nondemented and SDAT brains. In contrast, neuropeptide Y metabolism was slowed down in SDAT brains in the frontal but not in the parietal cortex. Finally, the degradation velocities of somatostatin(1-14) were lowered in both cortical areas of SDAT brains. It is interesting that, by means of specific peptidase inhibitors, we demonstrated that endopeptidase 24.15 participated in somatostatin(1-14) inactivation in the parietal but not in the frontal cortex. It is suggested that the lowering of the rate of somatostatin(1-14) inactivation in the parietal cortex of SDAT brains likely results from the depletion of endopeptidase 24.15 in this brain region."
