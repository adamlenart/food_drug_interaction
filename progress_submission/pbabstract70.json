    "0": "Acute myocardial infarction occurs with increasing frequency with advancing age, and older patients with acute MI are at increased risk of a variety of complications including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, myocardial rupture, cardiogenic shock, and death. Older patients thus comprise a high-risk subgroup of the MI population who consequently may derive substantial benefit from appropriately selected therapeutic interventions. At the same time, many interventions are associated with increased risks in the elderly, so that individualization of treatment is essential in all patients. Optimal therapy is thus based on a careful risk-benefit assessment of the available treatment options in conjunction with information on patient preferences and other relevant factors. Though many therapeutic trials of patients with acute MI have either excluded elderly patients or enrolled too few older subjects to permit definitive conclusions, sufficient data are available to make specific recommendations in several areas. As shown in Table 6, therapies of proven value in the acute-phase treatment of elderly patients with MI include aspirin and thrombolysis. Intravenous beta blockers are likely to be of benefit as well, and long-term oral beta blockade after MI is clearly beneficial. ACE inhibitors are of proven value in the long-term management of patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), but initiation of an ACE inhibitor should probably be delayed for 48 to 72 hours in most cases. The role of other agents including nitrates, magnesium, diltiazem, and verapamil requires further clarification, but anti-arrhythmic drugs and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should generally be avoided in the absence of specific indications for their use. Finally, though the role of catheterization and revascularization in elderly patients with acute MI requires additional study, current data indicate that age alone should not be considered a contraindication to these procedures. As the age of the population continues to rise, the number of older patients at risk of acute MI also increases. Though progressively more sophisticated interventions may ultimately result in sizable reductions in post-MI morbidity and mortality, given the high risk of adverse outcomes in this population the best treatment is prevention. Thus, the greatest potential for the future, as well as the greatest challenge, is to develop more effective strategies for preventing atherosclerosis and for conquering the epidemic of coronary heart disease.", 
    "1": "The beneficial effect of long-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on urinary microalbumin excretion (UAE) and renal function was investigated in a 4 year, randomized prospective study in normotensive patients with non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus. Sixty-two normotensive patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria but normal renal function were randomized to receive either enalapril 5 mg day-1 or no treatment. In the enalapril-treated patients, UAE was reduced from 115.4 +/- 80.1 to 95.6 +/- 61.7 mg 24 h-1 after 12 months (p < 0.05) and to 75.3 +/- 44.8 mg 24 h-1 after 48 months (p < 0.001). In the untreated group, UAE increased slowly from 93.9 +/- 69.9 to 150.0 +/- 144.5 mg 24 h-1 after 48 months. No changes in creatinine clearance, blood pressure or HbA1C were seen in either group during the 4-year period. In normotensive Type 2 diabetic patients with early stage of diabetic microalbuminuria. This effect is long-lasting and probably independent of the antihypertensive action of the drug.", 
    "2": "Experimental diabetes is associated with renal enlargement and glomerular hyperfiltration. Possible mechanisms for these changes could be the direct effects of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and angiotensin II. We investigated whether treatment with trandolapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, prevented renal enlargement in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Seven groups of male Wistar rats were studied: C (control + placebo); CL (control + low-dose trandolapril, 0.01 mg.kg-1.day-1); CH (control + high-dose trandolapril, 0.5 mg.kg-1.day-1; DP (diabetic + placebo); DI (diabetic, insulin-treated); DL (diabetic + low-dose trandolapril); DH (diabetic + high-dose trandolapril) and DI (diabetic + insulin). From day 2 glucose concentrations and body weight were similar in the non-diabetic and diabetic animals treated with insulin. Diabetic animals treated with placebo and low-dose trandolapril weighed significantly less compared to the control group. The diabetic groups, not treated with insulin, showed marked hyperglycaemia throughout the study. Kidney weight was greater in the diabetic, non insulin-treated groups compared with the control and insulin-treated groups. After 24 h of diabetes, kidney insulin-like growth factor-1 content was significantly increased from baseline levels in groups DP, DL and DH but by 48 h these levels had returned to normal. Renal tissue angiotensin converting enzyme activity was similar in groups C and DI but significantly reduced in all trandolapril-treated animals. Despite inhibiting renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity renal enlargement with increased tissue insulin-like growth factor-1 still occurred. This suggests that neither angiotensin II nor glomerular hyperfiltration, with raised intraglomerular pressure, play a role in the initial renal enlargement seen in experimental diabetes. Renal accumulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 appears to be an important factor in early renal hypertrophy and its effects are not modulated by angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensin II.", 
    "3": "Simultaneous inhibition of neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by equimolar doses (100 mumol/kg i.v.) of SQ 28603 (N-[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3- phenylpropyl]-beta-alanine) and captopril increased sodium excretion by 888 +/- 377 microEq/3 hr and significantly lowered blood pressure by -6 +/- 2 mm Hg in conscious cynomolgus monkeys. This rate of sodium excretion was not significantly different from that elicited by 100 mumol/kg i.v. of SQ 28603 alone (1453 +/- 315 microEq/3 hr). In addition, the natriuretic response to captopril plus SQ 28603 was potentiated by infusion of 10 pmol/kg/min of human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP 99-126) despite a reduction in renal perfusion pressure from 100 +/- 2 to 86 +/- 2 mm Hg. Lower doses (0.3 to 3 mumol/kg i.v.) of SQ 28603 that had no effect on blood pressure or renal function potentiated the natriuretic, urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate and atrial natriuretic peptide responses without affecting the depressor activity of 0.3 nmol/kg i.v. of hANP 99-126. The potentiation of the natriuretic activity of 0.3 nmol/kg of hANP 99-126 by 1 or 3 mumol/kg of SQ 28603 was not significantly affected by the addition of equimolar doses of captopril. These results confirmed that the renal responses to the combined inhibitors resulted from NEP inhibition. In contrast, the depressor activity of the combined inhibitors was dependent on the level of ACE inhibition and was not significantly affected by either infusion of hANP 99-126 or prior sodium loading. Therefore, the vascular responses to combined NEP and ACE inhibitors did not necessarily depend upon increases in circulating atrial natriuretic peptide or reductions in angiotensin II levels. The unique profile of renal and vascular responses to combined NEP and ACE inhibition suggested that dual NEP/ACE inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "4": "Pharmacologic agents that attenuate the influence of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are known to reduce systemic arterial blood pressure through vasodilatory action and enhanced renal clearance of sodium and water. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are known to antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through their ability to inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. A new class of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, has recently been developed. These agents specifically block the receptor for angiotensin II, thereby limiting angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion. These effects result in a reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure through reduced vascular tone and enhanced sodium and water clearance. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these agents in reducing blood pressure. These new antihypertensive agents also have uricosuric actions and are well tolerated, with a low incidence of cough and angioedema, side effects that are seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical trials are underway to see if these drugs will be useful in the treatment of diseases other than hypertension, such as congestive heart failure and chronic renal disease.", 
    "5": "We have studied the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with lisinopril on acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV).", 
    "6": "Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in ten healthy volunteers. Subjects received four daily doses of lisinopril or matched placebo before attending the laboratory 5 h after taking the final dose. After reaching a resting hemodynamic state, subjects were made hypoxemic (SaO2, 75 to 80%) for 30 min.", 
    "7": "Pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic parameters were measured noninvasively at baseline and after 30 min of hypoxemia.", 
    "8": "Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR) were similar at baseline on both study days. The increase in MPAP induced by hypoxemia was significantly blunted by pretreatment with lisinopril (means and 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference) 13.4 mm Hg vs placebo 19.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 2.5, 9.9). Likewise, the TPR response to hypoxemia was significantly blunted by lisinopril: 124 dyne.s.cm-5 vs placebo 179 dyne.s.cm-5 (95% CI, 11, 99). Lisinopril had no confounding systemic effects on mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, or systemic vascular resistance at baseline or in response to hypoxemia.", 
    "9": "Lisinopril therefore significantly attenuated the pulmonary pressor response to hypoxemia without decreasing baseline MPAP or TPR. This suggests that angiotensin II might play a modulatory role during HPV in man and that ACE inhibition may be a useful adjunctive treatment in hypoxemic pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "10": "We evaluated the genotypes of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in 101 subjects with and 109 subjects without a history of ischemic stroke. All were attending a metabolic ward. The two groups were compared for major risk factors for ischemic events. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. Deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene (DD genotype) was shown to be more common in subjects with a history of stroke than in those without (relative risk, 1.76; confidence intervals, 1.02 to 3.05). A positive family history for ischemic complications of atherosclerosis was also more common in subjects with documented events (relative risk, 1.99; confidence intervals, 1.10 to 3.59). DD genotype and a positive family history were strong independent discriminators of cerebral ischemia. Plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 help identify subjects with a history of cerebral ischemic episodes. When such fibrinolytic variables were included in the analysis, the DD genotype still strongly and independently discriminated subjects with a stroke history and significantly interacted with TPA levels > 10 ng/mL in such identification. We conclude that in subjects attending a metabolic ward, homozygosity for a deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene consistently discriminates subjects with a stroke history. Interaction with TPA improves such identification.", 
    "11": "The authors encountered 22 patients in whom a skin biopsy showed atypical lymphoid hyperplasia and in whom a subsequent drug history showed indigestion of one or more agents before lesional onset. In 13 patients, the biopsy had been performed to rule out a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, whereas the other nine the clinical impression was that of a drug eruption. Among the more frequently prescribed agents were calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antidepressants, antihistamines, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and lipid-lowering agents, all of which are either known to perturb lymphocyte function or have been implicated as a cause of pseudolymphomata. Twelve of the patients were on two or more of these drugs. The effect of drug modulation on the clinical course was assessed. The clinical presentations were as one or more erythematous plaques or multiple infiltrative papules, or as solitary nodules. The patient had been on one or more of the aforementioned drugs from 2 weeks to 5 years before developing the lesions. Resolution of the eruptions occurred in 17 patients within 1 to 32 weeks (mean, 7 weeks) of discontinuing the medication. Five additional patients had complete excision of solitary lesions without recurrence. A history of atopy, autoimmune disease, or previous carcinoma was elicited in five patients. All biopsy specimens showed atypical lymphoid infiltrates, which assumed one or more of the following patterns: mycosis fungoides (MF)-like, a lymphomatoid vascular reaction, lymphocytoma cutis and follicular mucinosis. Based on the histopathology of the biopsied lesions and the clinical course being one of lesional resolution after cessation of drug therapy or excision of a solitary lesion without subsequent recurrence, a diagnosis of drug-associated lymphomatoid hypersensitivity was established in all specimens. A diagnosis of drug-associated pseudolymphoma should be excluded before a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma is rendered, and should be considered if the patient is on a drug known to alter lymphocyte function, particularly in the setting of systemic immune dysregulation or multidrug therapy where agent may act synergistically or cumulatively to alter lymphoid function. The authors postulate that the drug may promote an aberrant immune response to an antigen that may be the drug itself or some other stimulus. A skin biopsy may be particularly helpful, as the lesions of drug-associated pseudolymphoma have a morphology distinctive from malignant lymphoma.", 
    "12": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has two homologous active NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and displays activity toward a broad range of substrates. The tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) has been shown to be hydrolyzed in vitro by ACE and to be a preferential substrate for its NH2-terminal active site. This peptide is a regulatory factor of hematopoiesis which reversibly stem cells and normal early progenitors into S-phase. We found that a single oral dose of 50 mg of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, when administered to eight healthy subjects in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, massively increased the plasma level of Ac-SDKP. ACE inhibition by captopril induced a 90-99% inhibition of in vitro [3H]Ac-SDKP hydrolysis and a long-lasting 5.5-fold (range: 4-8.5-fold) increase in the plasma levels of Ac-SDKP. These results demonstrate that Ac-SDKP is the first natural peptide hydrolyzed by the NH2-terminal domain of ACE not only in vitro but also in vivo, confirming that both catalytic sites of ACE are physiologically active. Our data suggest that ACE may also be implicated in the process of hematopoietic stem cell regulation, by permanently degrading this natural circulating inhibitor of cell entry into S-phase.", 
    "13": "The effect of quinapril or metoprolol on heart rate variability (HRV) indexes was studied in patients who had recovered from acute myocardial infarction. Patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal volunteers were used as controls. Sixty patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction (aged 32 to 74 years [mean 56.7]) were randomized to quinapril (n = 25), metoprolol (n = 25), and placebo (n = 10). HRV was assessed 5 days (baseline) and 35 days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. After the baseline studies, the post-myocardial infarction patients were treated with metoprolol (50 to 100 mg/day), quinapril (5 to 10 mg/day), or placebo. Twenty patients with stable coronary artery disease and 20 healthy volunteers, age- and sex-matched to myocardial infarction patients, were used as controls. Compared with placebo, quinapril and metoprolol increased HRV indexes significantly 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. HRV indexes were not statistically different between the 2 treatment groups. At baseline and after therapy, HRV was similar in patients with anterior or inferior wall myocardial infarction. HRV 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction was not different from HRV in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but was decreased when compared with that in normal volunteers. Data suggest that quinapril has the same beneficial effect on HRV indexes as metoprolol in patients who have recovered from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction.",

Treatment strategies were outlined with a particular emphasis on how antihypertensive agents may affect the brain.", 
    "18": "Cerebral autoregulation typically occurs over a range of cerebral perfusion pressures between 50 and 150 mm Hg. Chronic hypertension results in adaptive changes that allow cerebral autoregulation to occur over a high range of pressures. Acute hypertension (rapid increase in perfusion pressure above the autoregulatory limit) may result in cerebral edema, persistent vasodilation, and brain injury. Treatment of a hypertensive emergency must be undertaken conservatively since the chronically hypertensive patient is at risk for ischemic brain injury when perfusion pressure is rapidly decreased beyond autoregulatory limits. In the patient with head injury or primary neurologic injury, acute antihypertensive intervention can result in further brain injury. Selection of appropriate antihypertensive therapy necessitates the careful consideration of agent-specific effects on cerebral blood flow, autoregulation, and intracranial pressure. For example, some vasodilators treat hypertension but also dilate the cerebral vasculature, and increase cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure while decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure. Pharmacologic blockade of alpha 1- or beta 1-adrenergic receptors can reduce arterial blood pressure with little or no effect on intracranial pressure within the autoregulatory range. Like the direct peripheral vasodilators, calcium-channel antagonists are limited by cerebral vasodilation and increased intracranial pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can also be used for mild to moderate hypertension but have the potential to further increase intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial hypertension. Barbiturates offer an alternative antihypertensive therapy since they decrease blood pressure as well as cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism.", 
    "19": "The treatment of acute hypertension in the patient with intracranial ischemic or space-occupying pathology requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension and determinants of cerebral perfusion pressure. Individual agents should be selected based on their ability to promptly and reliably decrease blood pressure, while considering effects on cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure.",

    "26": "The contributions of hypertension and diabetes to microvascular dysfunction in the kidney and eye were investigated. Two indices of microvascular dysfunction, urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) and albumin vascular clearance (AVC) in the eye, were studied in control and streptozocin diabetic Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "27": "Studies were performed on four groups of untreated rats--nondiabetic and diabetic WKY and nondiabetic and diabetic SHR--and on three groups of diabetic SHR treated with a converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril), a calcium-channel blocker (lacidipine), or triple therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine, and hydralazine). In all rats, AER and AVC were measured at 16 weeks.", 
    "28": "There was a progressive increase in both parameters in the order WKY, diabetic WKY, SHR, and diabetic SHR. When compared with nondiabetic WKY, diabetic SHR showed an approximately 30-fold increase in AER and an approximately threefold increase in AVC. Treatment of diabetic SHR with perindopril or triple therapy normalized AER compared to an equihypotensive dose of lacidipine, which had no effect. By contrast, the three antihypertensive regimens showed a different order of efficacy in preventing increases in ocular AVC. In diabetic SHR, the increase in retinal AVC was prevented largely by lacidipine, whereas the other two antihypertensive regimens showed lesser effects [AVC expressed as percentage nondiabetic WKY: untreated diabetic SHR 278% +/- 47%, lacidipine 93% +/- 10% (P < 0.001), triple therapy 132% +/- 37% (P < 0.05), and perindopril 167% +/- 9% (P < 0.05)]. Lacidipine also prevented the increase in AVC of the anterior and posterior uvea. By contrast, increases in AVC observed in the diabetic SHR were not prevented by perindopril in the posterior uvea or by triple therapy in the anterior uvea. Thus, hypertension and diabetes increased ocular AVC and AER, and effective antihypertensive therapy substantially prevented changes in both parameters. However, despite equivalent levels of blood pressure control for each regimen, discordant effects were noted on AVC and AER. Perindopril was associated with significantly lower AER than lacidipine, whereas lacidipine was more potent in preventing increases in ocular AVC.", 
    "29": "Results of this study suggest that different antihypertensive regimens in the diabetic rat may exert organ-specific effects on the retina and kidney despite equivalent effects on systemic blood pressure. These data also raise the possibility that retinal microvascular dysfunction in diabetes is ameliorated more readily by calcium-channel blockade than by converting-enzyme inhibition, whereas the reverse applies to renal microvascular dysfunction, as reflected by albuminuria.", 
    "30": "In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD), enalapril or placebo was administered in a double-blind fashion to 6797 participants with ejection fraction < or = 0.35. During 40 months' average follow-up, 28.1% of participants randomized to enalapril reported side effects compared with 16.0% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Enalapril use was associated with a higher rate of symptoms related to hypotension (14.8% vs 7.1%, p < 0.0001), azotemia (3.8% vs 1.6%, p < 0.0001), cough (5.0% vs 2.0%, p < 0.0001), fatigue (5.8% vs 3.5%, p < 0.0001), hyperkalemia (1.2% vs 0.4%, p = 0.0002), and angioedema (0.4% vs 0.1%, p < 0.05). Side effects resulted in discontinuation of blinded therapy in 15.2% of the enalapril group compared with 8.6% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Thus enalapril is well tolerated by patients with LVD; however, hypotension, azotemia, cough, fatigue, and other side effects result in discontinuation of therapy in a significant minority of patients.", 
    "31": "We investigated whether captopril is able to potentiate vasodilation and prevent tolerance to a 48-hour infusion of nitroglycerin (NTG). Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to a 7-day regimen of captopril (50 mg/day) or placebo. The hemodynamic response to a 0.8 mg sublingual NTG dose was assessed by measuring mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure (RAP), and cardiac output (CO), and calculating systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR). The parameters were obtained serially at baseline and 1 to 10 minutes after the sublingual NTG application (day 1). Then intravenous NTG was started and maintained for 48 hours (1.5 micrograms/kg/min), and the hemodynamic study was repeated (day 3). There was no difference between the captopril and the placebo groups at day 1 (baseline values and response to sublingual NTG). After the 48-hour infusion, there was a complete loss of the NTG effects in the placebo group (day 1 vs day 3: PAP, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg vs 21 +/- 8 mm Hg; MAP, 86 +/- 11 mm Hg vs 90 +/- 9 mm Hg; SVR, 1295 +/- 330 mm Hg vs 1380 +/- 465 dyne.sec.cm-5) whereas there was still evidence of a persistent vasodilation in the captopril group (day 1 vs day 3: PAP, 19 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 13 +/- 4 mm Hg; MAP, 84 +/- 9 mm Hg vs 74 +/- 10 mm Hg; SVR, 1265 +/- 280 mm Hg vs 1140 +/- 425 dyne.sec.cm-5). The response to sublingual NTG on day 3 was markedly attenuated in the placebo group only. We conclude that captopril does not increase the vasodilatory response to nitroglycerin but is able to prevent developing nitrate tolerance in arterial and venous circulation.", 
    "32": "Long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has beneficial effects in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation by reducing left ventricular volumes and regurgitant fraction. Velocity-encoded cine magnetic resonance imaging can directly measure antegrade (forward stroke volume) and retrograde blood flow (regurgitant volume) in the ascending aorta. Velocity-encoded cine magnetic resonance imaging was used in 9 patients with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 49% +/- 17%) to measure regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, and forward stroke volume at baseline and 3 months after therapy with enalapril (mean dose 29 +/- 13 mg). Ten additional patients with aortic regurgitation without any drug therapy served as a control group. In the treatment group, systolic blood pressure slightly decreased from 132 +/- 20 mm Hg to 121 +/- 14 mm Hg (p = not significant), whereas diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (beats per minute) remained unchanged. Regurgitant fraction decreased in 6 patients (responders) from 49% +/- 19% to 39% +/- 20% (percentage change 24% +/- 14%, p = 0.002) and was unchanged in 3 patients (nonresponder, 49% +/- 19% vs 51% +/- 16%; p = not significant). In the responder group, forward stroke volume increased from 128 +/- 32 ml to 148 +/- 57 ml, whereas regurgitant volume remained unchanged (67 +/- 40 ml vs 65 +/- 51 ml). At baseline, the responder group had a significant higher total vascular resistance than the nonresponder group (998 +/- 538 dyne.sec.cm-5 vs 625 +/- 214 dyne.sec.cm-5; p < 0.05). With enalapril treatment, total vascular resistance in the responder group tended to decrease (891 +/- 576 dyne.sec.cm-5), but slightly increased in the nonresponder group (679 +/- 276 dyne.sec.cm-5). The control group showed no changes in regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, forward stroke volume, and total vascular resistance at follow-up.", 
    "33": "The present study was designed to determine the developmental changes in intrarenal angiotensin (Ang) peptides in the rat. Kidney Ang I and II levels were threefold and sixfold higher in newborn than adult kidneys, respectively (Ang I, 678 +/- 180 versus 243 +/- 38 fmol/g, P < .01; Ang II, 667 +/- 75 versus 103 +/- 6 fmol/g, P < .001). Intrarenal Ang II levels correlated positively with the temporal changes in renin gene expression (r = .93, P < .001). However, no correlation was found between renal Ang II content and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression during development, which prompted us to evaluate whether renal enzymes, other than renin and ACE, contribute to Ang II formation in the developing kidney. Angiotensin peptide levels were measured in newborn and adult kidney homogenates incubated with human angiotensinogen (a poor rat renin substrate) for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. Inhibitors of aspartyl proteases and metalloproteases were ineffective in preventing the formation of Ang II in either newborn or adult kidneys. However, addition of the serine protease inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited Ang II generation in the newborn kidneys only. In contrast, Ang I generation was not affected by inhibition of serine proteases in either newborn or adult kidneys. We conclude that Ang I and II synthesis is activated in the developing rat kidney. In addition to renin and ACE, the newborn rat kidney expresses serine protease activity that is capable of generating Ang II directly from angiotensinogen. This putative enzyme is induced in the newborn kidney and may cooperate with renin in the activation of Ang II synthesis during early development.", 
    "34": "This study examined the role of endogenous kinins in the alteration of renal hemodynamics induced by low-dose converting enzyme inhibition in hydropenic normotensive rats and in the nonclipped kidney of hydropenic two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Infusion of a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (D-Arg0,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin, 1 or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) did not alter renal function of normotensive rats. In a second series of experiments, infusion of enalaprilat at 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 increased renal blood flow (P < .01) and decreased renal vascular resistance (P < .01). The superimposition of the kinin antagonist at 1 micrograms.kg.min-1 during the enalaprilat infusion decreased renal blood flow to a value similar to the preenalaprilat baseline and significantly different from the mean of the two enalaprilat periods before and after the addition of the kinin antagonist--the \"mean effect of enalaprilat.\" The decrease in renal blood flow induced by the kinin antagonist was associated with an increase in renal vascular resistance above the mean effect of enalaprilat (P < .025). In two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, systemic infusion of enalaprilat augmented the hemodynamics of the nonclipped kidney by a degree similar to that in normotensive rats. In contrast to normotensive rats, superimposition of the kinin antagonist did not alter the enalaprilat-induced change in blood flow or vascular resistance of the nonclipped kidney. The results of this study suggest that endogenous kinins contribute to the increased renal function induced by low-dose converting enzyme inhibition in hydropenic normotensive rats but appear to contribute less to the enalaprilat-induced alterations of renal function in the nonclipped kidney of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats.", 
    "35": "Along with arterial blood pressure reduction, maintenance of the integrity of baroreceptor reflex function contributes to preserving end-organ function in the treatment of hypertensive patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents (trichlormethiazide, atenolol, nicardipine, and enalapril) on baroreceptor reflex function by comparing early and late starts of treatment. We administered each agent to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as early-start groups from 10 to 36 weeks of age and as late-start groups from 28 to 36 weeks of age. We evaluated the gain of the reflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate using ramp infusions of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin in untreated SHR at 10, 28, or 36 weeks of age and in treated SHR at 36 weeks of age. In 28- and 36-week-old untreated SHR, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was not altered and the heart rate gain was decreased (from -2.3 +/- 0.3 to -1.3 +/- 0.3 and -1.2 +/- 0.3 beats per minute [bm]/mm Hg, P < .05, respectively) compared with 10-week-old SHR. Early and late start of therapy produced arterial pressure reductions (-18 +/- 4 and -12 +/- 5 mm Hg, P < .05, respectively). In the early-start groups, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was improved markedly in nicardipine- and enalapril-treated SHR (-4.2 +/- 0.2% and -4.9 +/- 0.2% of control/mm Hg, P < .01, respectively), and the heart rate gain was improved markedly in atenolol- and enalapril-treated SHR (-4.1 +/- 0.2 and -4.4 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg, P < .01, respectively). In the late-start groups, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was improved moderately in nicardipine- and enalapril-treated SHR (-3.8 +/- 0.2% and -2.9 +/- 0.2% of control/mm Hg, P < .05, respectively). The heart rate gain was improved slightly only in nicardipine-treated SHR (-1.9 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg, P < .05). These results demonstrate that an early start of antihypertensive treatment improves baroreceptor reflex function markedly compared with a late start of treatment. This supports the hypothesis that a possible critical phase sensitive to intervention with antihypertensive treatment exists during the development of hypertension and indicates that the early start of antihypertensive treatment would be required in clinical practice.", 
    "36": "Chronic nitric oxide inhibition exacerbates hypertension and nephrosclerosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In this study, we determined whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition could prevent or reverse the systemic, renal, and glomerular hemodynamic alterations and the pathological changes of nephrosclerosis. Four groups of 20-week-old SHRs were studied: group 1, untreated controls; group 2, treated with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/L for 3 weeks); group 3, L-NAME cotreated with quinapril (3 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 3 weeks); and group 4, L-NAME for 3 weeks followed by quinapril for 3 weeks (same doses). The results of this study demonstrated that both cotreatment (group 3) and posttreatment (group 4) with quinapril reduced mean arterial pressure (186 +/- 9 and 192 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively, compared with group 2 SHRs, 221 +/- 5 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance index associated with significant reductions in afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances; nephrosclerosis pathological scores; and urinary protein excretion (all at least P < .01). ACE inhibition also significantly increased stroke index, single-nephron glomerular filtration rate, and ultrafiltration coefficient compared with the L-NAME SHRs. Most notable were the findings that cotreatment with quinapril completely prevented the renal glomerular hemodynamic alterations with reduced glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and efferent arteriolar resistance compared with both the untreated and the L-NAME-treated SHRs (all at least P < .01). Posttreatment with quinapril also reversed the glomerular injury (subcapsular, -83%; juxtamedullary, -56%) and arteriolar (-87%) injury scores obtained from renal biopsy specimens (P < .005 and P < .0001, respectively). These changes were associated with decreased periarteriolar fibronectin and increased afferent arteriolar alpha-smooth muscle actin deposition (immunohistochemistry). These data, therefore, demonstrate that ACE inhibition not only prevents but also reverses L-NAME-exacerbated severe nephrosclerosis in SHRs, as indicated by improved systemic, renal, and glomerular hemodynamic changes, proteinuria, and histological alterations.",

However, the effects on coronary vascular and myocardial function of very early ACE inhibitor therapy for acute myocardial infarction remain unresolved.", 
    "38": "Hemodynamics, segmental shortening, coronary blood flow, and in vitro coronary microvascular relaxation responses were studied in noninstrumented control pigs (n = 8) and pigs subjected to 30 minutes of left anterior descending ischemia followed by administration of 30 mL IV normal saline (IR-saline, n = 8), 5 mg/kg IV captopril (IR-captopril, n = 6), or 1.5 mg/kg IV enalaprilat (IR-enalaprilat, n = 6) before 1 hour of reperfusion. Hemodynamics were similar at baseline, end of ischemia, and end of reperfusion. However, coronary blood flow immediately on reperfusion was significantly enhanced in the IR-enalaprilat cohort (59 +/- 10 mL/min) compared with the IR-saline group (32 +/- 3 mL/min, P < .05). Segmental shortening in the dyskinetic ischemic region improved only minimally at the end of reperfusion to 1 +/- 2%, -7 +/- 3%, and -2 +/- 6% for the IR-saline, IR-captopril, and IR-enalaprilat groups, respectively (P < .05, IR-captopril versus IR-saline). Arteriolar microvascular endothelium-dependent responses to ADP (P < .01) and calcium ionophore A23187 (P < .01) were impaired after ischemia-reperfusion, whereas bradykinin responses were preserved (P = .95). Endothelium-dependent venular responses to ADP and serotonin were maintained despite ischemia-reperfusion. Endothelium-independent responses to sodium nitroprusside were unaltered in arterioles and venules. Either captopril or enalaprilat restored ADP and A23187 arteriolar responses to control levels and increased bradykinin responses above control levels.", 
    "39": "Brief ischemia followed by reperfusion induces arteriolar microvascular endothelial dysfunction, while venular endothelial function is preserved in this porcine model. ACE inhibition enhances coronary blood flow at the time of reperfusion and can prevent impairment of endothelium-dependent arteriolar responses. However, ACE inhibition does not enhance ventricular segmental shortening acutely despite improved microvascular endothelial function and augmented postischemic coronary blood flow in this model of ischemia-reperfusion.", 
    "40": "To examine the mechanisms of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, cough responses to aerosols of capsaicin and citric acid were examined in four groups of female guinea pigs treated orally with danazol (D) (an agent decreasing plasma estrogen levels), cilazapril (C) (an inhibitor of ACE), both danazol and cilazapril (C+D), or without either drug (control group) for 4 to 5 wk. Capsaicin caused dose-dependent increases in the number of coughs in all four groups. C or D alone shifted dose-response curves to capsaicin (from 10(-7) M to 10(-3) M) to lower concentrations compared with the control, and C+D further shifted them. Likewise, the number of coughs induced by citric acid (3 x 10(-1) M; 2 min) was highest in animals treated with C+D and significantly higher in animals treated with C or D than in the control group. Aerosols of a selective substance P (SP) receptor antagonist FK 888 (10(-5) M; 2 min) inhibited capsaicin-induced cough in all four groups, and dose-response curves to capsaicin did not differ significantly at any concentrations among the four groups in the presence of FK 888 (p > 0.10). D decreased cyclic AMP levels in the trachea, irrespective of the combination of C. A beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, which is thought to inhibit SP release by elevation of cyclic AMP in sensory nerves, dose-dependently inhibited the number of coughs induced by capsaicin (10(-3) M) in animals treated with D. The present study suggests that SP is a common mechanism mediating increases in the sensitivity of cough reflex induced by both ACE inhibition and a decrease in plasma estrogen levels, and the additive effects of the two events may explain the high incidence of cough during ACE inhibitor therapy in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.",

    "42": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Their efficacy appears to be related importantly to antiadrenergic effects, the mechanism for which has not been determined. Because baroreflexes tonically inhibit sympathetic outflow, and baroreflexes are blunted in heart failure, we hypothesized that these agents reduce sympathetic activity by augmenting baroreflexes.", 
    "43": "We assessed baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in patients with congestive heart failure and in control subjects before and after enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg body weight intravenously). Arterial baroreflexes were perturbed by bolus administration of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Cardiopulmonary baroreflexes were perturbed by lower body negative pressure and head-down tilt. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded by microneurography.", 
    "44": "Enalaprilat decreased systolic blood pressure in patients with heart failure and control subjects. Sympathetic nerve activity increased in control subjects but decreased in patients with heart failure after enalaprilat despite reductions in central venous pressure in this group. Baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was unchanged by enalaprilat in control subjects. In patients with heart failure, both arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was enhanced by enalaprilat. Baroreflex control of heart rate was unchanged by enalaprilat in either group.", 
    "45": "Enalaprilat augments both arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic activity in heart failure. These augmented inhibitory influences are associated with a reduction in sympathetic outflow and may contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure.",

    "50": "Although the systematic administration of glyceryl trinitrate started early and continued for 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction does not yield evidence of benefit, early treatment with lisinopril appears to improve prognosis. This effect seems to carry over the first 6 months from randomization, even after treatment withdrawal.", 
    "51": "Contrasting information has been reported concerning the course of renal function in NIDDM with hypertension alone or in association with renal damage. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the course of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in hypertensive NIDDM patients during antihypertensive therapy. Furthermore, we compared the effects of ACE inhibitors (cilazapril, Inibace, Roche, Milan, Italy) and Ca(2+)-channel blockers (amlodipine, Norvasc, Pfizer, Rome, Italy). Of the hypertensive NIDDM patients attending the outpatient's clinic of the internal medicine departments of the University of Padova and Sassari, 44 participated in the present study. Of these patients, 26 were normoalbuminuric and 18 microalbuminuric. They were randomly treated with either cilazapril or amlodipine. The target of antihypertensive treatment was a value < 140 mmHg for systolic and 85 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (BP). Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin excretion rate (AER) between 20 and 200 micrograms/min. GFR was measured by plasma clearance of 51Cr-labeled EDTA at baseline and every 6-12 months during a 3-year follow-up interval. A significant decrease was observed in the values of GFR, AER, and systolic and diastolic BP in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients during antihypertensive therapy. The GFR fall in the overall population of NIDDM patients was significantly and inversely related to the decrease of mean BP (diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001) but not to that of HbA1c, triglycerides, and BMI. The GFR decline (mean +/- SE) per year in the normoalbuminuric patient was 2.03 +/- 0.66 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.92-3.17) during cilazapril and 2.01 +/- 0.71 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.82-3.11) during amlodipine therapy. The GFR decline per year in the microalbuminuric patient was 2.15 +/- 0.69 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.86-3.89) during cilazapril and 2.33 +/- 0.83 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 per year (95% CI 1.03-3.67) during amlodipine therapy. Cilazapril and amlodipine lowered AER to a similar extent in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients. No significant changes were observed concerning other clinical and biochemical features between the two antihypertensive therapies and particularly HbA1c, BMI, triglycerides, and cholesterol plasma values. These results support the tenet that arterial hypertension plays a pivotal role in contributing to renal damage in NIDDM, even when AER is normal. However, the degree of BP control, with both cilazapril and amlodipine, can successfully delay the slope of GFR decline in hypertensive NIDDM patients with or without incipient nephropathy.",

Two of the most potent compounds, monocyclic azepinone 2n and bicyclic azepinone 3q, demonstrated a high level of activity versus ACE and NEP both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "54": "The development of a relational database from Tennessee Medicaid files for the purpose of retrospective drug-use review (DUR) and application of the database for DUR of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are described. Computer queries were designed to create profiles of physicians' or pharmacies' experiences from claims data and other Medicaid data. Outlying patients (patients for whom at least one DUR criterion was unmet) were grouped according to their physicians or pharmacies. Thresholds for defining outlying physicians and pharmacies (i.e., those with more than a specified number of outlying patients) were based on the provider population instead of the patient population as a whole; aggregating patient outliers by provider allowed trends of inappropriate practices to be detected. As the threshold for outlying providers rose, the number of such providers fell, as did the number of outlying patients with whom they were associated. Stratification of the outliers by provider for specific drug-drug interactions and drug-disease complications afforded the option to set individual thresholds for outlying providers based on individual subsets; for example, for ACEIs, a threshold of greater than five patient outliers could be set for the criterion of no concurrent potassium supplements and a threshold of greater than three, for the criterion of no unmonitored concurrent lithium therapy. Tennessee patients formerly covered by Medicaid are now enrolled in managed care plans, and the flexibility of the database has allowed it to be modified accordingly. The relational database allows flexibility in the analysis of certain patterns of drug use. Such a database may be useful to other Medicaid programs that are converting to managed care models.", 
    "55": "Despite the current progress in immunosuppressive regimens, the incidence of graft coronary artery disease (CAD) after cardiac transplantation has not decreased. Recent study has revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition decreases CAD in rats; however, it is not clear whether this beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is due to a decrease in production of angiotensin II (Ang II) or inhibition of bradykinin degradation. To determine whether Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blockade has an inhibitory effect on CAD, we evaluated the effects of TCV-116, an AT1-R antagonist, in a murine model of cardiac transplantation.",

Recipients were treated orally with TCV-116 (10 mg/kg per day), captopril (100 mg/kg per day), or vehicle only. Graft status, as assessed by palpation and inspection at laparotomy 70 days after transplantation, was preserved better in the TCV-116-treated group (P < .005) and in the captopril-treated group (P < .05) than in the vehicle-treated group. Intimal area in the graft coronary arterial wall decreased to 31% in the TCV-116-treated group (P < .001 versus vehicle-treated group) and to 34% (P < .005) in the captopril-treated group but was 45% in the vehicle-treated group. Fibrotic lesions of the left ventricle were less prominent in the TCV-116-treated (31%; P < .01 versus vehicle-treated group) and captopril-treated groups (33%; P < .05) than in the vehicle-treated group (54%).",

Rats were pretreated with captopril, and the effects of exogenous angiotensin II (200 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 7-14 days sc) on renal hemodynamics and renal vascular structure were examined. Angiotensin II induced significant reductions of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration and increases of renal vascular resistance in SHR but not WKY. Furthermore, angiotensin II induced an increase of the media/lumen ratio in the interlobular arteries (0.33 +/- 0.02 to 0.56 +/- 0.02) and arcuate arteries (0.27 +/- 0.02 to 0.53 +/- 0.07) of SHR without significantly altering the media/lumen ratio in the interlobular arteries (0.34 +/- 0.03 to 0.34 +/- 0.02) and arcuate arteries (0.30 +/- 0.02 to 0.36 +/- 0.05) of WKY (two-factor analysis of variance, strain x treatment; P = 0.0002 for interlobular arteries and P = 0.0319 for arcuate arteries).

However, although the newer antihypertensives induce effective control of blood pressure and regression of hypertensive organ damage, it has not been proven whether they reduce mortality. Ongoing clinical trials such as STOP II, CAPPP, NORDIL, INSIGHT, ALLHAT and LIFE test whether antihypertensive regimens with ACE-inhibitor, calcium-blocker, alpha-blocker and Angiotensin II-antagonist are equally good or possibly even better than diuretics and beta-blockers in preventing cardiovascular complications. The HOT trial clarifies how much the diastolic blood pressure should be lowered, and whether a small dose of aspirin has a protective effect when combined with optimal control of blood pressure. These studies should give better guidelines for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "64": "This study sought to evaluate the changes in direct medical costs and life-years gained or lost by adding enalapril to conventional treatment (digoxin and diuretics) for heart failure (HF). The published results of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Treatment Trial, and a decision analytical model developed by the University of Pennsylvania, were used in combination with New Zealand data to undertake the evaluation. All costs were measured in 1993 New Zealand dollars ($NZ) [$NZ1 = $US0.5509, September 1993]. Potential net cost savings per patient treated over a 4-year period were $NZ652 together with an additional 2 months of life gained. If these individual potential cost savings are extended to the New Zealand population who have HF (but are at present not receiving an ACE inhibitor) then $NZ6 517 000 in discounted health sector costs could be avoided. The model was sensitive to changes in the price of enalapril, to estimates of the population with HF, the percentage of the population with HF treated with enalapril, and to hospital unit costs for nonfatal cases of HF. The study demonstrated that the addition of enalapril to the conventional treatment of HF was cost effective when compared with conventional medical therapy alone.", 
    "65": "We previously demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor normalizes the up-regulated gene expression of vascular natriuretic peptide type A (NP-A) receptor in hypertensive rats. To elucidate the mechanism, we examined the effect of angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonist (TCV-116) and bradykinin receptor (B2) antagonist (Hoe 140) on the NP-A receptor mRNA level in the aorta of genetically hypertensive rats (SHR-SP/Izm) using ribonuclease protection assay. The effect of ACE inhibitor on the NP-A receptor mRNA level was completely abolished by a concomitant administration of Hoe 140, while TCV-116 did not show any significant effect on the NP-A receptor mRNA level. These results suggest that bradykinin plays an important role in the regulation of the vascular NP-A receptor gene expression.", 
    "66": "The prevalence of electrocardiographic anomalies has been assessed in a selected group of centenarians recruited in Western Sicily (49 subjects, 15 males and 34 females) with an average age of 101.5 years (range 100-109); the findings were analyzed in correlation with the state of health of the subjects, the drugs used and the presence of specific heart diseases and immobility. These subjects have rare signs of heart diseases, they do not show any electrolytic disorder, in spite of using many drugs sometimes in an inconsistent way. Particularly interesting is to note the moderate prevalence of sinus rhythm and the extremely low number of subjects with sinus respiratory arrhythmia as compared to the known literary data for the over-sixties. There occur, however, frequent, but almost asymptomatic troubles of the intraventricular conduction, especially left anterior hemiblock and ectopic beats. Atrial fibrillation and bradyarrhythmias are rare, while left axis deviation with scarce signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and alterations of the repolarization phase are frequent. The most used drugs are digitalis and vasodilators, especially angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The observed data prove that heart functions of the centenarians are in good conditions; the alterations of them are less serious than those of the somewhat younger old age classes, where the electrocardiographic anomalies are of higher extent and severity.", 
    "67": "The great prevalence and incidence of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypertension in the elderly represent several therapeutic problems. Due to aged-related changes in glucose handling and cardiovascular functions which occur with advancing age, it is necessary to treat aged diabetic hypertensive patients with drugs lowering arterial blood pressure but without side effects on glucose metabolism. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological protocols can be taken into account. With regard to the non-pharmacological therapy, a decline in body fatness, an increase in body fitness and an appropriate dietary assumption of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are the most important approach. As far as the therapeutic approach, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors seem to be particularly useful in the treatment of aged diabetic hypertensive patients. Calcium channel blockers have no effects on glucose tolerance while they are very effective on heart beating and arterial blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors lowers arterial blood pressure, delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy to the renal failure and, have null or beneficial effects on glucose handling. In conclusion, in aged diabetic hypertensive patients non-pharmacological therapy should be combined to administration of calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors.",

Greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions (-18.2% and -18.1%) were observed in renovascular hypertensive patients after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty. Blood pressure fell by about 10% during the night and the fall was similar in renovascular and in essential hypertensive patients.

    "81": "The effects of enalpril (Ena, 6 mg.kg-1) and taurine (Tau, 30 mg.kg-1) on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and ventricular arrhythmia were studied in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats (RHR). From the 9th week after operation, Ena and Tau were given per oral daily for 9 weeks. These drugs significantly decreased the systolic arterial pressure and the weight of the left ventricle. Combination of both drugs was found to reduce the blood pressure further than either drug used alone. Arrhythmias induced by trains of electrical stimuli were more frequent in working hearts isolated from RHR than that from normotensive rats. Ena and Tau could decrease the incidence of this arrhythmias in RHR. The calcium content in the myocardial mitochondria in RHR was increased compared with that in normotensive rats. Treatment with Ena and Tau reduced this increase significantly. These results suggest that chronic therapy with Ena and Tau can induce an attenuation of systemic arterial pressure and reduce the propensity of RHR heart to arrhythmogenesis by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and calcium overload of the myocardium.", 
    "82": "There is recent interest in the possibility that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may reduce the damage inflicted on the arterial wall by common cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and ageing. The efficacy of these drugs in blood pressure reduction is accepted, but whether there is an excess benefit on arterial structure and function, conferred by use of ACE inhibitors over more traditional antihypertensives, is still under debate. There is also evidence in animal models to suggest that ACE inhibition is effective in reduction of arterial damage due to experimental hyperlipidaemia. ACE inhibitors not only reduce the conversion of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, which can interact with the sympathetic nervous system, but also prevent the degradation of bradykinin. This means that ACE inhibitors have several potential mechanisms through which they could suppress intimal hypertrophy and prevent endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to precede arteriosclerosis in man. Although much further work is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects on the arterial wall of this group of drugs, they do appear to have significant potential in the effort to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially in high risk groups.", 
    "83": "Although post exercise proteinuria has long been known, its exact pathophysiology is unclear. Our objective was to determine whether long-term angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by different ACE inhibitors had an influence on post exercise proteinuria. We studied 14 patients who also had mild, chronic proteinuria caused by diabetes mellitus or chronic glomerulonephritis. We compared changes both in chronic (baseline) and post exercise proteinuria, during and after treatment with three different ACE inhibitors, with appropriate washout periods for the three drugs to all 14 patients. Proteinuria (mg/24 hours +/- SD), prior to the treatment was 682 +/- 92. Proteinuria after treatment for 30 days with benazepril was 464.4 +/- 82.6 (p < 0.001), with enalapril: 477.1 +/- 105.5 (p < 0.001), and captopril: 504.7 +/- 100.1 (p < 0.001). Proteinuria three days after discontinuing the treatment with benazepril was 532.4 +/- 113.5, (p < 0.01), with enalapril: 561.3 +/- 128.5, (p < 0.01), and with captopril: 620.8 +/- 101.8, p = n.s. Post exercise proteinuria prior to treatment (mg/min. +/- SD) was: 1.38 +/- 0.32, vs. after a 30-day treatment period with benazepril: 0.81 +/- 0.19 (p < 0.001), enalapril: 0.95 +/- 0.24, (p < 0.001), captopril: 1.09 +/- 0.27 (p < 0.02). Post exercise proteinuria three days after discontinuing the treatment was (blood pressure already back to baseline): in case of benazepril: 1.26 +/- 0.36 (p = n.s.), of enalapril: 1.17 +/- 0.46 (p = n.s.), and of captopril: 1.34 +/- 0.41 (p = n.s.). We conclude that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of post exercise proteinuria; the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition in exercise-induced proteinuria seems to be associated chiefly with the hemodynamic changes due to these drugs, whereas in chronic proteinuria the antiproteinuric and antihypertensive effects are, at least partially, dissociated.", 
    "84": "Hypotensive effect of renitek (enalapril maleate) was assessed by activity of some neuroregulation systems and electrolyte balance in 16 patients with essential hypertension (EH). Maximal time of treatment for the assessment was 14 days. Renitek in a single dose 20-40 mg/day produced a response in 80% of EH stage II patients with low activity of plasma renin (PR). A hypotensive effect of the drug proved more essential in patients with higher baseline urinary excretion of aldosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline and sodium. This effect is associated with stimulation of PR activity, urinary excretion of sodium, reduction in plasma and 24-h urine of aldosterone, adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations. Renitek nonresponders exhibited high aldosterone concentration in plasma and its normal excretion with urine, diminished sodium excretion with urine. After 2 weeks of treatment blood and urine hormones were close to the initial levels while sodium excretion with urine went down.", 
    "85": "This multicenter trial included 205 males aged 30-60 years with stable mild and moderate hypertension. 140 patients were from Moscow (140 patients), St. Petersburg, Kursk, Rostov (Russia); Kharkov, Donetsk (Ukraine); Baku (Azerbaijan). Group 1 patients received captopril, group 2 nifedipine, group 3 hydrochlorothiazide, group 4 propranolol.", 
    "86": "The purpose of this study was to detect any improvement in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients 1 month after cilazapril therapy. Twenty-three patients, 5 men and 18 women (mean age, 53.52 +/- 9.10 years), with mild or moderate hypertension (160 +/- 13/98 +/- 10 mm Hg), and free of other cardiac or systemic diseases, were studied using ultrasonic automated boundary detection (ABD) and pulsed Doppler echocardiography, before and 1 month after a daily dose of 2.5 mg of cilazapril. The following new ABD diastolic indices were determined: the time rate of area change in early diastole (dA/dt)E, that in late diastole (dA/dt)A, and their ratio (dA/dt)E/(dA/dt)A, while Doppler transmitral flow measurements of left ventricular diastolic filling were also simultaneously recorded. The ABD results showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in 9 of 23 patients (39%) compared with the ABD values of 12 normal volunteers. Neither method revealed any significant difference before and after treatment in the patient group as a whole. However, in the group of 9 patients with diastolic dysfunction, the ABD ratio (dA/dt)E/(dA/dt)A was significantly improved after cilazapril therapy (1.20 +/- 0.21 versus 1.41 +/- 0.17; P < 0.05). We concluded that a large percentage (39%) of patients with mild or moderate hypertension had reduced diastolic performance of the left ventricle at a stage of the disease when systolic dysfunction and/or hypertrophy were not evident. Significant improvement of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients could be detected by the proposed ABD new diastolic indices 1 month after cilazapril therapy. In conclusion, automatic boundary detection should be a useful non-invasive modality for the early diagnosis of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, as well as early recognition of its improvement.", 
    "87": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Traditional antihypertensive therapy is not fully effective in prevention of cardiovascular abnormalities of hypertension. Two classes of hypotensive drugs, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, reduce atherosclerosis in several experimental models in animals. Anti-atherosclerotic effects of calcium antagonists include attenuation of endothelial dysfunction, prevention of LDL modification, stimulation of LDL receptor activity, inhibition of superoxide radical generation and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration. In large angiographic trials calcium antagonists reduced the development of new atherosclerotic plaques. ACE inhibitors also lead to the lower incidence of atherosclerosis in experimental animals. They inhibit migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, reduce macrophage-derived foam cell accumulation, preserve protective endothelium function, reduce LDL modification and increase fibrinolytic activity. It depends on reduced angiotensin II synthesis, increased concentration of kinins, substance P and angiotensin-(1-7), inhibition of leukotriene B4 formation and improvement of insulin action. In some studies they also reduce plasma lipids concentration, including lipoprotein (a). ACE inhibitors were found to be ineffective in prevention of restenosis after PTCA in human but data derived from large, multicenter trials indicate that they are effective in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.", 
    "88": "Recent laboratory findings strongly suggest that renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in regulation of haemostasis and fibrinolysis. In our previous study we showed that captopril exerts antithrombotic effect in venous thrombosis in rats. In this study we demonstrated that this effect is not a result of changes in platelet count, fibrinogen level alterations in blood coagulation pathways and fibrinolytic activity of the plasma. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of antithrombotic action of captopril.", 
    "89": "We studied the effect of a Converting Enzyme Inhibitor, Captopril, on renal function of conscious, chronically instrumented uninephrectomized rats three weeks after surgery and normal two kidney rats. Captopril increased glomerular filtration rate from 9.28 +/- 0.50 to 14.23 +/- 1.07 ml/min.kg and effective renal plasma flow from 31.6 +/- 2.4 to 45.8 +/- 3.7 ml/min.kg in two kidney rats. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow of uninephrectomized rats did not change after acute converting enzyme inhibition (from 6.96 +/- 0.61 to 7.16 +/- 0.39 and 24.5 +/- 2.2 to 27.9 +/- 1.5 ml/min.kg respectively). Plasma renin activity was lower in uninephrectomized rats (0.72 +/- 0.15 ng AngI/ml.h) than in intact rats (1.41 +/- 0.20 ng AngI/ml.h). Acute converting enzyme inhibition increased urinary sodium excretion, fractional sodium excretion and plasma renin activity in both, two kidney and uninephrectomized rats without changes of mean arterial pressure. Present data suggest that the Angiotensin II does not participate in the control of glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow of uninephrectomized rats but it is implicated in the control of Na homeostasis.", 
    "90": "Aim of the study was to reveal the possible factors regulating plasma endothelin (ET) levels in vivo in patients with essential hypertension (EH) by the simultaneous determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (ALD). In addition, the possible relationship between ET and circulating endothelial cells as a marker of endothelial damage was also investigated. The postural test revealed a significant increase of ET levels (26.7 +/- 9 vs 11.5 +/- 3 fmol/ml, p < 0.05) in the upright position. Captopril administration did not change plasma ET levels. No significant correlation was found between ET and PRA or ALD. Although a tendency to a positive correlation between ET and circulating endothelial cells (as the marker of endothelial perturbation) was found, it did not attain statistical significance. Our data do not support the suggestion that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a major role in the regulation of ET secretion in vivo in EH. Postural stimulation of ET secretion may be caused by other factors than renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "91": "The effect of chronic administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension was studied in rats. Male Wistar rats were-exposed for 3 weeks to isobaric hypoxia (10% O2) and treated with 10 mg/kg b.w. of Ramipril daily. The haemodynamic properties of the pulmonary vasculature were then measured in isolated blood-perfused lung preparation. Ramipril administration during the sojourn in hypoxia resulted in lower baseline perfusion pressure and lower slope of perfusion pressure-flow relationship compared to non-treated hypoxic rats. Partitioning of the distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance across the vascular bed by the occlusion technique showed that it was mainly due to a decrease of arterial and venous vascular resistances to blood flow. It is suggested that Ramipril attenuates the process of morphological reconstruction of pulmonary vasculature by chronic hypoxia rather than the level of vascular smooth muscle tone.", 
    "92": "The objective of a paper was to assess in the observational study the early determinants of outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI)) in one province of Poland (Tarnobrzeg Voivodship). The studied group were 1858 hospitalized men and women registered in POL-MONICA Krak\u00f3w study with clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction or acute coronary heart disease, who fulfilled the criteria for definite or possible myocardial infarction according to The WHO MONICA Project. The main out-come measure was death before the end of 28th day after the onset. Patients with shock were at the highest risk to die-relative risk (RR) = 21.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.86-35.83. The other characteristics, which increased risk independently were: left ventricular failure (LVF) (RR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.54-4.10) and age (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.05) per one year. Male sex and diabetes were not related to the risk of death. After adjustment to age, sex, shock, LVF and diabetes, lower risk was found in patients treated with antiplatelet agents (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.29-0.59), with beta-blockers (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.31-0.75) and with nitrates (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.39-0.98), which were used in 66.2%, 33.1% and 97% of events respectively. Higher risk was found in patients treated with diuretics.", 
    "93": "There has been a large amount of progress in the methods of prevention and treatment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), but the effect of these changes on mortality due to IHD has not been assessed. This paper presents the complex analysis of 10-year trends of incidence, case fatality and mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) and changes in medical care in the acute phase of MI in residents of one province of Poland-Tarnobrzeg Voivodship, which was the target population of the POL-MONICA Krak\u00f3w Project (over 280,000 men and women at age 25-64 years). In men, the incidence of MI, which was 335/100,000 in 1984, increased in 1986 to 463/1,000,000 and then was stable until 1993 when it felt to 362/100,000. Mortality from MI, which was 149/100,000 in 1984, increased to 212/100,000 in 1986 and then was stable until 1992, before falling to 173/100,000 in 1993. There were large fluctuations in the incidence and mortality from MI in women i.e. from 58/100,000 to 116/100,000 and from 21/100,000 to 55/100,000 respectively. In 1993 the incidence was 82/100,000 and mortality was 32/100,000. After adding sudden deaths and other fatal events attributed to IHD the mortality figures increased over the ten years of observation by an average of 29% in men and by 28% in women. The average total MI case fatality was 47% in men and 40% in women, with 86% of all deaths due to MI occurring out of hospital. Case-fatality of MI managed in hospital was 11% on average.", 
    "94": "We recently reported that some diuretics affect capillary permeability in the normotensive rat. In the present study, we explore the effect of selected antihypertensive drugs administered orally during 10 days, on Evans blue (EB) extravasation within the wall of the thoracic (TA) and abdominal aorta (AA) obtained from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Description of the EB method has been previously reported. Daily doses (mg/kg) of captopril (CAP: 3.0), perindopril (PER: 0.3), nifedipine (NIF: 1.0), clentiazem (CLE: 0.1), hydralazine (HYD: 0.5), furosemide (FUR: 0.5), cicletanine (CIC: 2.0), hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ: 0.5), and indapamide (IND: 0.04) resulted in comparable blood pressure reduction. Percent changes in EB tissue concentration (measured in ug/g dry tissue) was increased by 24% in both the TA and AA in the untreated SHR. CAP reduced by half EB leakage in the TA, while PER decreased EB extravasation 16% below baseline values. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors failed to normalize EB leakage in the AA. The calcium channel blockers also normalized EB extravasation in the two segments of the aorta, except that CLE was without effect in the AA. HYD normalized EB leakage in the TA, but not in the AA. All diuretics tested reduced EB extravasation by 48 to 58% below baseline values in the TA, whereas CIC only normalized EB leakage. None of the diuretics affected EB extravasation in the AA of the SHR.", 
    "95": "1-the two segments of the aorta were similarly affected in the SHR; 2-despite comparable effect on blood pressure, treatment of the SHR was associated with different responses in the TA and AA; 3-within a given class of drugs, different effects are observed on EB.", 
    "96": "In a user-observation study (\"Anwendungsbeobachtung\") it could be demonstrated that Renitec and Co-Renitec lowered elevated blood pressure but not sufficiently according to the WHO-criteria. It seems that the necessary dose titrations are not carried out in a daily routine. Furthermore it has to be stated that even widespread observation studies are not able to differentiate the properties of a drug. It remains to be considered whether more requirements on observation studies are necessary (regarding exact criteria for their design and increased monitoring) and should be implemented to improve the quality of data, although this would mean more time for the physician. Only under such conditions statements about rare side effects, influences of concomitant diseases and their treatments will be possible.", 
    "97": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy. It has been suggested that ACE inhibitors containing the sulfhydryl group (SH) have an additional effect on KATP channels. To prove this hypothesis, we studied the effects of the SH-containing ACE inhibitors, captopril and zofenopril, on KATP channel opening of bovine coronary arteries and guinea pig thoracic aortas. Bovine coronary arteries were precontracted with the thromboxane A2 analogue, U46619, and guinea pig thoracic aortas were precontracted with phenylephrine and then relaxed with either captopril or zofenopril (n = 8). Inhibition of KATP channel opening with glibenclamide moderately attenuated the zofenopril-induced relaxation of guinea pig thoracic aorta. However, in the bovine coronary arteries, the relaxing effect of both captopril and zofenopril remained uneffected by glibenclamide. In experiments with enalapril (a non SH-containing ACE inhibitor; n = 6) on guinea pig thoracic aortas, no effect on KATP channels could be seen. From our experiments, we conclude that the postulated opening of KATP channels by SH-group-containing ACE inhibitors contributes little to the vasodilation of guinea pig thoracic aortas caused by ACE inhibitors, and that SH groups have no influence upon KATP channels of bovine coronary arteries.", 
    "98": "Using aortic rings from male Wistar rats, we studied the influence of nitric oxide (NO) on the vascular reactivity to angiotensins. The inhibition of NO-synthesis by L-NAME produced on both intact and desendothelised rings an augmentation of vascular reactivity to angiotensins. NO inhibition did not affect the blocking effects of Saralasin to angiotensins vasoconstriction, suggesting that NO cannot act directly on angiotensin II receptor. Nifedipin inhibited the stimulatory effect of L-NAME on angiotensins vasoconstriction. The results of our study provide functional evidence that NO production can interfere with vascular RAS at two levels: 1. by modulating the activity of Ang II-forming enzymes; 2. at intracellular level, by modulating the concentration of calcium. Also, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway on Ang II formation, that become more evident with removal of endothelium.", 
    "99": "The aim of the study was to investigate the potential antithrombotic action of enalapril in comparison with captopril after their acute and chronic administration in an experimental model of venous thrombosis in rats. Chronic treatment with captopril but not enalapril significantly reduced the incidence of venous thrombosis (67% vs 11%; p < 0.05). Both drugs markedly reduced the weight of thrombus. At the same time the platelet aggregation was reduced in rats acutely treated with both captopril and enalapril to 50 +/- 13% and 53 +/- 18%, respectively. The mean blood pressure dropped only after acute ACE-Is administration. No changes were observed in \"transection\" bleeding time. In conclusion, captopril and enalapril were able to inhibit the growth of thrombus in rats. Their antithrombotic effect seems to be independent from hypotensive action and influence on platelet aggregation.", 
    "100": "The aim of this study was to compare the potential antithrombotic action of captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and losartan (a selective AT1 receptor antagonist) after their chronic administration in a model of venous thrombosis in rats. Captopril significantly reduced the incidence of venous thrombosis (67% vs 14%; p < 0.05) and both drugs markedly reduced the weight of thrombus. At the same time the platelet aggregation was reduced only in rats treated with losartan (100 +/- 7% vs 52 +/- 11%; p < 0.001). The mean blood pressure dropped only after losartan administration. We observed no changes in \"transection\" bleeding time after both drugs administration. In conclusion, captopril and losartan exerted an antithrombotic effect in venous thrombosis model in rats. The precise mechanism of this action should be established.", 
    "101": "The effects of captopril on morphologic changes and clinical course of adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined. After ADR infections rats were divided into two groups: ADR-C group (n = 20) given captopril (60 mg/kg per day) and ADR group (n = 19) receiving no antihypertensive treatment. SHR were examined every 6 weeks. Captopril normalized systemic blood pressure, but failed to prevent proteinuria. It slowed down renal function deterioration in the early stage of ADR nephropathy (weeks 6 and 12), but at the end of the study both groups had the same degree of renal failure irrespectively of whether blood pressure was well controlled with captopril or hypertension persisted. Captopril slowed down mesangial expansion in the early stages of ADR nephropathy, but at the end of the study there was no statistically significant difference between these two groups. Treatment with captopril also reduced the development of glomerular sclerosis.", 
    "102": "The aim of the study was to assess whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril prevents the development of hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy and affects nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in rats. Animals were divided into five groups: control, two groups receiving NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 20 or 40 mg/kg/day, a group receiving captopril 100 mg/kg/day and a group concomitantly treated with 40 mg/kg/day L-NAME plus 100 mg/kg/day captopril. After four weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly increased in both L-NAME groups by 30% and 34%, respectively. In the captopril group, SBP significantly decreased by 30% and in the captopril plus L-NAME group SBP was not changed as compared to the control. Although left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio in both L-NAME groups was significantly elevated by 19% and 29%, respectively, no alterations in LVW/BW ratio were found in the captopril group and captopril plus L-NAME group. In both groups receiving L-NAME, NOS activity significantly decreased by 17% and 69% in the heart, by 14% and 26% in the aorta, by 60% and 73% in the brain and by 13% and 30% in the kidney, respectively. Captopril did not influence NO synthase activity in any of the studied tissues. We conclude that captopril prevents the development of hypertension and LV hypertrophy without affecting NO formation.", 
    "103": "Recently, several randomised controlled studies have demonstrated improvement in survival of patients with non ischemic cardiomyopathy (Bisoprolol, Metoprolol, Carvedilol) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (Carvedilol). It is not quite clear, whether the observed difference in mortality after beta-blockade on top of diuretics, digitalis and ACE-inhibitors is due to some as yet unknown pathophysiological changes. Certainly, beta-blocking agents have an established efficacy in arrhythmia. Irrespective of the acknowledged benefit in survival, one should note, that the risk reduction in mortality by 65% by Carvedilol has to be viewed critically-as the risk reductions in several other large scale trials. If the mortality in the group receiving digitalis, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was 7.8%, the mortality after addition of Carvedilol was 3.2%. This means a difference of 4.6%. If however, percent from percent is calculated, than the risk reduction amounts to 65%. One can easily understand, why this larger latter, number usually is being published.", 
    "104": "20 patients with essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) type II were given Capoten (100-125 mg/day for 6 weeks) followed in a 2-week interval after its course termination by ramipril (10.0-12.5 mg/day). 50% of patients were sensitive to Capoten, 50% were resistance: 35 and 40% to ramipril, respectively. Ramipril was discontinued because of toxicity in 25% of patients. Hypotensive effects of ramipril were weaker than Capoten, though the former drug appeared more potent in lowering of peripheral vascular resistance at rest and at reactive hyperemia. Vasodilatation did not differ much.", 
    "105": "The endothelium plays a crucial role in the regulation of coronary artery vasomotor tone by conducting stimuli from the blood into changes of vascular smooth muscle tone. Disturbance of this endothelial function might inadequately reduce myocardial oxygen supply, and, therefore, contribute to myocardial ischemia. Different risk factors for coronary artery disease are accompanied by a reduced bioactivity of vasorelaxing nitric oxide (NO), produced by the endothelium. In hypercholesterolemia, oxidized LDL and vascular wall macrophages induce an oxidative stress with increased production of superoxide anions, capable to inactivate NO. Therefore, NO-mediated vasorelaxation is blunted in epicardial arteries as well as in the microcirculation. In case of sympathetic stimulation, e.g. by physical exercise or cold exposure, the direct vasoconstrictor action of catecholamines on the vascular smooth muscle cells might dominate due to reduced bioactivity of NO. Especially, in the presence of coronary stenoses, myocardial ischemia might be aggravated. Although \"exogenous\" NO, derived from nitrates, also relaxes coronary vessels, these drugs are not able to simulate the physiological, demand-adjusted endothelial production of \"endogenous\" NO. In contrast, following a 6 months therapy with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation could be improved. In addition, ACE-inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate endothelium-mediated coronary vasodilator function. However, whether improved endothelium-dependent vasodilator function due to ACE-inhibitor or HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor therapy relate to the improved coronary mortality observed with these drugs, remains to be determined.", 
    "106": "Coronary artery disease is the underlying cause in most of our patients with heart failure nowadays. The arguments put forward for treating these patients with ACE-inhibitors would be reinforced when convincing data are reported demonstrating 1) a reduction of malignant arrhythmias, 2) a reduction in reinfarction rate and 3) a reduction of progressive deterioration in left ventricular function. 1) ACE-inhibitors and malignant arrhythmias. The prolongation of life in heart failure patients treated with ACE-inhibitors might either derive from retarding the progression of heart failure (CONCENSUS I) or from reducing sudden cardiac death (VHeFT II-trial). However, it remains to be established whether the advantage for ACE-inhibitors in reducing sudden death only exists in comparison to a group of patients treated with the combination of hydralazine plus ISDN or whether this is true also in comparison to a placebo group. 2) ACE-inhibitors and reinfarction. Retrospective analysis of data from studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) and from the survival and ventricular enlargement (SAVE) study suggested that ACE-inhibitors may reduce the reinfarction rate by about 20%. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood but could in part be mediated by improving endothelial function and/or attenuating the inhibition of PAI-1 through the administration of ACE-inhibitors. 3) ACE-inhibitors and progressive left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors are effective means in retarding the remodeling process after myocardial infarction. This is not only true for the progressive increase in left ventricular dimension, but also for the progressive loss of contractile function in the primarily unaffected myocardium. Both, clinical and experimental studies suggest that the observed reduction in mortality is particularly related to the attenuation of the remodeling process by ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "107": "The existence of a cardiac renin-angiotensin-system is confirmed. An influence of AII on growth and mitosis of various cells contributing to cardiac hypertrophy has been shown. Prove for a clinical role would be prevention of hypertrophy and of its complications in patients by specific AII-receptor antagonists in a state of a not-activated systemic renin-angiotensin-system and in absence of mechanical effects. This prove is difficult to obtain.", 
    "108": "Kinins are autacoids affecting B2-receptors of many organs. They are involved in autocrine and paracrine mechanisms which are crucial in organ protection. Because of rapid degradation their effects are only short acting. Therefore, inhibition of degradation by ACE-inhibitors increases their pharmacological effects, and is of significant importance for therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Blood pressure lowering and cardioprotective effects are most important and can be explained by actions on the endothelium. The participation of kinins in blood pressure decrease during ACE inhibitor treatment can be estimated from animal experiments at about 50%. With respect to regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy or increase in insulin sensitivity their participation might be even more significant. The role of kinins in cardiovascular diseases as a pathophysiologic correlate has to be elucidated in further investigations.", 
    "109": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system reduces the development of the atherosclerotic process after vascular injury and in hyperlipidemic animals. ACE-inhibitors inhibit vascular smooth muscle cells migration and proliferation, macrophage-foam cell accumulation and preserve the antiaggregatory and antithrombotic function of the endothelium in atherosclerotic vessels. In addition to the inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis, reduced degradation of kinins and improvement of insulin action after ACE-inhibition may be responsible for observed actions. ACE-inhibitors may have also influence on lipids metabolism, including low density lipoprotein oxidation. Despite this, ACE-inhibitors failed to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty in humans. One reason for the lack of ACE-inhibitors effect in human restenosis might depend on the activation of the alternative angiotensin II-generating system in human arteries after vascular injury.", 
    "110": "The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of anaphylactoid reactions (AR) in patients dialysed with cellulose or synthetic membranes and the possible link with ACE inhibitors. Survey was conducted for six months (Jan, 1 to July, 1 1993). Thirty dialysis units treating 1573 patients (899 M and 674 F) were participating to the study. At the end of the period under study, only 1536 patients were included in the analysis. Prevalence of AR was calculated from 122 694 hemodialysis sessions. Thirty-three AR in 21 patients (1.3%) (8 M, 13 F), of which 8 severe AR in 5 patients (0.25%) were observed. Annual incidence of AR was 0.17 per 1000 sessions with cellulose membranes and 4.2 per 1000 sessions with synthetic membranes. Relative risk of the occurrence of AR was 10 to 20 times higher with synthetic membranes than cellulose membranes, and 3 to 4 times higher in patient treated with ACE inhibitors than in those no treated. Prevalence of AR with AN69 membrane (3.2%) was not significatively different from that with other synthetic membranes (1.6%). However, treatment with ACE inhibitors increased strongly the risk of AR in AN69 patients (7.2%) in comparison to patients treated with other synthetic membranes (1.6%) ( < 0.1). Prevalence of severe AR was 0.25% in total dialysed population, 0.5% in patient treated with synthetic membranes, 1.1% in AN69 patient and 4.9% in AN69 patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Relative risk of AR is at least 20 times higher in dialysed patients with ACE inhibitors (1.7%) than other dialysed patients without ACE inhibitors (0%). Seventy-two percent of AR occurred in 2/30 dialysis units, thus demonstrating the role of a \"un effect\". That suggest the role of a \"third factor\" in the occurrence of AR.", 
    "111": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. An increasing number of patients with chronic renal failure is treated with ACE inhibitors because of their antiproteinuric effect. In patients with diabetic nephropathy ACE inhibitors also slow the progression of renal failure. Direct drug related nephrotoxic effects, like the induction of proteinuria, glucosuria or an interstitial nephritis are rare events. The often observed reduction of the glomerular filtration rate after the induction of an ACE inhibitor therapy is due to the specific intrarenal action of these agents and therefore not an adverse drug reaction.", 
    "112": "Treatment with ACE inhibitors results in kidney protection due to reduction of systemic blood pressure, intraglomerular pressure, an antiproliferative effect, reduction of proteinuria and a lipid-lowering effect in proteinuric patients (secondary due to reduction of protein excretion). Elderly patients with diabetes melitus, coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular occlusion are at risk for deterioration of kidney function due to a high frequency of renal artery stenosis in these patients. In patients with renal insufficiency dose reduction of ACE inhibitors is necessary (exception: fosinopril) but more important is the risk for development of hyperkalemia. Patients at risk for renal artery stenosis and patients pretreated with diuretics should receive a low ACE inhibitor dosage initially (\"start low - go slow\"). For compliance reasons once daily ACE inhibitor dosage is recommended.", 
    "113": "During the last decade medical treatment of congestive heart failure has made impressive strides. Several studies have proven that ACE-inhibitors improve symptoms and decrease mortality in patients with severe heart failure. ACE-inhibitors have also been demonstrated to improve prognosis in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure as well as left ventricular dysfunction. However, long-term medical treatment of severe heart failure is only palliative. Despite treatment with high doses of ACE-inhibitors, 1-year mortality of patients with severe heart failure is as high as 36%. Therefore, at present, cardiac transplantation remains the only alternative treatment for patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.",

As shown by ventricular diastolic function and systolic flow in the pulmonary artery with estimation of mean pressure in the pulmonary artery according to Kitabatake, enalapril (renitek) affects positively cardiohemodynamics of EMF patients: improvement of ventricular diastolic function occurred in line with a significant fall in the pulmonary artery pressure.

After a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly allocated to once-daily felodipine extended release (ER; 2.5 mg), ramipril (2.5 mg) or felodipine ER/ramipril (2.5/2.5 mg) for 12 weeks. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean DBP decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) after felodipine ER, ramipril and the combination (-9.1, -9.8 and -11.4 mm Hg, respectively). The decrease was significantly greater with the combination than with felodipine ER monotherapy (p = 0.02). The number of responding patients (final DBP < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg) was also higher with the combination than with felodipine ER or ramipril monotherapy (65.1%, 53.1%, 55.7%, respectively). There were no differences between the three groups with respect to the incidence of adverse events overall or those considered treatment-related. There were fewer cases of peripheral oedema with combination therapy than with felodipine ER monotherapy. Thirty-three patients (5.1%) withdrew from the study because of adverse events, but there was no clear pattern with regard to the specific events leading to withdrawal. There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory or clinical safety variables. Ramipril/felodipine ER 2.5/2.5 mg is an appropriate starting dosage when initiating combination antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "120": "Chronic renal diseases evolve to terminal renal failure by a process leading to progressive parenchymal damage which appears relatively independent of the initial insult. When glomerular permselectivity is lost, proteins filtered through the glomerular capillary, via proximal tubular cell activation and upregulation of genes of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators, may give rise to an inflammatory reaction that in the long-term can contribute to renal scarring. If this interpretation is correct, the best approach to try to retard the progression of several renal diseases would be to limit the excessive traffic of macromolecules throughout the glomerular capillary by molecules such as the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which may help restore permselective properties to normal. Thus, the present review addresses the mechanism(s) of the renal protective effect of ACE inhibitors and analyzes the evidence so far available of their salutary effect in human nephropathies, with particular focus on diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "121": "In chronic renal disease, the severity of proteinuria is associated with the rate of renal function loss. Proteinuria, therefore, was postulated to play a role in the final common pathway of chronic renal function loss. If so, reduction of proteinuria would improve long-term renal outcome. Improvement of long-term renal function outcome has been obtained in several intervention trials; in these studies; regimens providing better renoprotection were associated with more effective reduction of poteinuria than control regimens. As the reduction of proteinuria is mostly associated with a fall in blood pressure, however, it is difficult to delineate the respective roles of the lowering of blood pressure and of proteinuria. Interestingly, the initial reduction of proteinuria (but not of blood pressure) by antihypertensive treatment appears to predict long-term renal outcome in man as well as in experimental renal disease. This suggests that an intervention strategy aimed not only at the normalization of blood pressure, but also specifically at elimination of proteinuria, might be able to improve long-term renal outcome in proteinuric patients. If so, this would provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that proteinuria is causally involved in the progression of long-term renal function loss.", 
    "122": "The evaluation of a new drug in normotensive volunteers can provide important information, as long as the compound has a specific mechanism of action which can be evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in patients. The purpose of the present paper is to review the renal effects of new specific angiotensin II receptor antagonists observed in normotensive subjects and to compare them to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists induces an expected increase in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I levels. Plasma angiotensin II levels decrease with ACE inhibitors, whereas they increase with angiotensin II receptor blockade. So far, the expected decrease in plasma aldosterone levels has been difficult to demonstrate with most angiotensin II antagonists. In normotensive subjects, ACE inhibitors, as well as angiotensin II antagonists, cause no change in glomerular filtration rate and either no modification or an increase in renal blood flow. Both approaches to block the renin-angiotensin system are natriuretic, and the natriuresis is more pronounced in salt-depleted subjects. Finally, in contrast to ACE inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan markedly increases uric acid excretion and lowers plasma uric acid levels. This unique property of losartan is due to a direct interference of losartan with the uric acid transport system in the proximal tubule. The data obtained in normal subjects therefore suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists have comparable renal properties. Whether this is also true in hypertensive patients and in patients with proteinuria and chronic renal failure remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "123": "The most promising therapeutic intervention to slow the progression of renal diseases is the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, either using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists. In this article, we review the experimental evidences that are available on the effects of these treatments on glomerular capillary wall (GCW) function. Besides the well-known hemodynamic effects, Ang II antagonism exert specific actions on glomerular permeability to water and macromolecules, consisting in the elevation of hydraulic permeability and amelioration of membrane-sieving function. Experimental investigations of functional and structural properties of the glomerular membrane have been performed to discover the mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of these treatments. On the basis of these observations, we illustrate how Ang II antagonism interfere with the complex nature of the glomerular capillary affecting its hemodynamics, modulate its cellular components and result in the preservation of GCW function.", 
    "124": "Since the discovery of renin, almost 100 years ago, all the components of the renin-angiotensin system have been characterized on a molecular level. Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors can be grouped in two classes: AT1 and AT2 receptors. In addition to these receptor subtypes, several other Ang-II-binding sites with different properties have been identified. The majority of Ang II receptors in the kidney comprises the AT1 type, whereas AT2 receptors are only expressed by distinct structures such as the renal capsule and the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The vast majority of physiological functions of angiotensin II in the kidney are mediated through AT1 receptors. Important exceptions may be the pressure-induced natriuresis and chemotaxis for macrophages/ monocytes, as well as growth-suppressive effects which may be mediated by AT2 receptors.", 
    "125": "Captopril was investigated for its effects on the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the rat blood serum, pituitary, hypothalamus, and striatum, as well as for those on the animals, behavior in the open-field test. During its single administration the agent was found to lower the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme in all the examined brain regions and serum. During chronic administration captopril decreased the mobility of the animals in the open-field test, diminished, the activity of the enzyme in the hypothalamus and striatum and enhanced it in the pituitary and serum. It is suggested that the effect of captopril might be due to imbalance in the changes of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in various brain regions of the rats.", 
    "126": "1. The availability of orally active specific angiotensin receptor antagonists (AT1 antagonists) has opened new therapeutic choices and provided probes to test the specific role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. 2. The data available so far suggest that the antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin receptor antagonists is comparable to that of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This provides further evidence that this latter class of drugs exerts its effect mainly through blockade of the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. As expected, the association of a diuretic exerts an equally strong additive effect to the antihypertensive efficacy of both classes of drugs. 3. The most common side effect of ACE inhibitors, dry cough, does not occur with AT1 antagonists, which confirms the long-held view that this untoward effect of the ACE inhibitors is due to renin-angiotensin-independent mechanisms. 4. Long-term studies with morbidity/mortality outcome results are needed, before a definite position can be assigned to this newcomer in the orchestra of modern antihypertensive drugs. Notwithstanding, this new class of agents already represents an exciting new addition to our therapeutic armamentarium.", 
    "127": "1. Modification of endogenous angiotensin II (AngII)-mediated processes by inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antagonists of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor is dependent upon both the levels of each agent in the plasma and tissues and on the concomitant changes in plasma and tissue AngII levels. 2. Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists increase renin secretion and angiotensin peptide formation in plasma and extrarenal tissues. Clinical doses of ACE inhibitors produce incomplete inhibition of ACE and the increased AngI levels act to restore AngII towards basal levels. Clinical doses of AT1 receptor antagonists produce incomplete blockade of AT1 receptors and the increased AngII levels in plasma and extrarenal tissues counteract (to an unknown degree) the effects of the antagonist. 3. The effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists on AngII levels show tissue specificity. Angiotensin II-mediated processes in the kidney are most sensitive to inhibition by these agents. ACE inhibitors reduce renal AngII levels at doses much less than those required to reduce AngII levels in plasma and other tissues. Moreover, in contrast to increased AngII levels in plasma and extrarenal tissues, renal AngII levels do not increase in response to AT1 receptor antagonists. The inhibition of AngII-mediated processes in the kidney may, therefore, play a primary role in mediating the effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists on blood pressure and other aspects of cardiovascular function and structure. 4. Combination of an ACE inhibitor with an AT1 receptor antagonist prevents the rise in plasma AngII levels that occurs with AT1 receptor antagonism alone. This combination would, therefore, be predicted to produce more effective inhibition of endogenous AngII-mediated processes than either agent alone. We must await further studies to determine whether the combination of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor antagonism results in superior clinical outcomes.", 
    "128": "1. This brief review examines the evidence that angiotensin II (AngII) is essential for kidney development. 2. Several components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are detected in the foetal kidney early in development. 3. Angiotensin II is essential for normal foetal and neonatal renal function. 4. Angiotensin II receptors transduce important signals leading to growth and development. 5. Angiotensin receptor subtypes show spatial and temporal specificity of localization throughout renal development. 6. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or AngII receptor blockade (specifically AT1 subtype blockade) results in functional and structural abnormalities of the developing kidney in both experimental and clinical situations. 7. While chronic postnatal RAS blockade in rats is associated with structural damage to tubules and blood vessels of the kidney, reports differ on whether treatment also affects glomerular induction and growth. 8. In metanephric organ culture, glomerular induction proceeds despite AngII receptor blockade. 9. In summary, the evidence suggests that AngII is not essential for nephron induction and glomerular development in the rat kidney. However, AngII is essential for normal growth and development of renal tubules and vasculature.", 
    "129": "1. The development of the transgenic technology for the rat allowed the evaluation of gene functions in the cardiovascular system in vivo. New insights have been gained particularly in the functions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as most transgenic rat models established so far carry genes of this system. 2. TGR(mREN2)27 is a rat harbouring the mouse Ren-2 gene and exhibiting fulminant hypertension. The plasma RAS in this animal is down-regulated; however, the tissue-specific production of angiotensin II is activated (e.g. in the adrenal gland, the brain and the vessel wall). The physiological consequences of this activation, which finally leads to hypertension, can be studied in TGR(mREN2)27, rendering it a valuable tool in the functional analysis of tissue RAS. 3. TGR(hREN) and TGR(hAOGEN) carry the human genes for renin and angiotensinogen, respectively. In these animals the species-specific interaction of the two proteins and the expression pattern of the genes can be studied. Furthermore, these animals can be used to test renin-inhibitory drugs for use in antihypertensive therapy. 4. Further refinement of transgenic methodology (e.g. by the development of gene targeting in rats), should enhance our understanding of the functions of the RAS in cardiovascular regulation.", 
    "130": "Studies of pulsatile arterial hemodynamics have emphasized that the pulsatile component of pulse pressure has two important characteristics: (i) it increases from central to peripheral arteries for a similar value of mean arterial pressure, and (ii) it is dominantly influenced by the amplitude and timing of the backward pressure wave. Although these important aspects of wave reflections have been poorly investigated in the field of hypertension, they may be easily studied noninvasively in humans on the basis of the analysis of the pulse wave contour of carotid and aortic blood pressure. Increased wave reflections returning toward the thoracic aorta during systole may have deleterious consequences on the structure and function of the heart. Some (but not all) antihypertensive drugs may contribute to decrease and/or to delay wave reflections in association with blood pressure reduction.", 
    "131": "Arterial hypertension is associated with increased capillary permeability, a possible contributor to the vascular remodeling process which could be involved in certain pathological conditions arising from elevated blood pressure. This study evaluated the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on capillary permeability in the normal rat, using Evan's blue dye (EB) as a marker of albumin extravasation. The results reveal that acute injection of certain diuretics (furosemide, indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide) increase while others (amiloride, cicletanine) decrease capillary permeability via stimulation of the cyclooxygenase pathway. 10 day gavage with indapamide, amiloride and cicletanine, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril and calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil decreases capillary permeability, whereas furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, ACE inhibitor captopril and calcium channel blocker clentiazem do not modify or increase EB extravasation. Hence, selected antihypertensive agents reduce capillary permeability and could therefore have a supplemental protective vascular effect, in addition to their lowering arterial pressure.", 
    "132": "This study highlights our experience with 53 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who had monotherapy with Enalapril, one of the newer Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors. Enalapril was found to be effective in controlling blood pressure in 41 patients (77%). In 12 patients (23%) addition of one more drug was necessary for control of hypertension. Side effects were noted in 9 patients (17%). In two patients the adverse reactions were severe enough to warrant withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "133": "A controlled, double-blind trial, carried out by Lewis and al., has shown that in 409 patients presenting with insulin-dependent diabetes, proteinuria in excess of 500 mg/day and plasma creatinine of less than 221 mumol/l, captopril treatment was able to reduce the risk of combined events (mortality, renal dialysis and transplantation) by 50% (p = 0.006) and that of doubling plasma creatinine by 48% (p = 0.007). We evaluated the cost/benefit ratio of this treatment on the basis of the medical outcome of this study and economic data for the French health-care system. The cost of the treatment by captopril is totally offset by the reduction in costs obtained by postponing dialysis and kidney transplantation, concomitant antihypertensive treatment and hospitalisation. In this study, the health expenditure savings in the captopril group amounted to 6 million French Francs. Spending 100.-Francs on captopril to treat diabetic nephropathy yielded savings of 575.-Francs. This economic advantage, plus a reduction of 6 in the number of deaths, corresponding to 131 life-years saved, demonstrates the favorable cost-benefit ratio of this treatment strategy.",

    "136": "As far as renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are concerned in experimental animals and in men, manidipine, a long-lasting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, demonstrated its action not only on the afferent arteriole, as other dihydropyridines, but also on the efferent one. This action, which avoids producing any increase in intra-glomerular pressure and renal damage, would be similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The direct natriuretic effect of manidipine, observed also with other dihydropyridines, has been demonstrated by two studies performed in both spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats, indicating a direct renal tubular effect. In 5/6 nephrectomized rats treated with manidipine, blood pressure, proteinuria, serum creatinine and glomerular lesions, observed after histological examination, were significantly reduced with respect to control untreated 5/6 nephrectomized rats. Calcium antagonists have demonstrated a clear beneficial effect on renal vasoconstriction induced by cyclosporine therapy in renal transplant patients and in the prevention of acute renal failure secondary to the administration of radiocontrast agents, amphotoricin B, cisplatin and aminoglycosides.", 
    "137": "Calcium antagonists are effective drugs for controlling blood pressure and for inducing renal vasodilatation. Manidipine hydrochloride increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate with vasodilation of afferent as well as efferent arterioles, reducing intraglomerular pressure. According to experimental and human studies on renal haemodynamics, manidipine could be used in diabetic nephropathy, glomerular lesions, microalbuminuria and proteinuria.", 
    "138": "We have already proved that the mitochondrial membrane-phospholipid (MMP) injury changes of peripheral lymphocytes in patients with heart failure can be used as an injury indicator of myocardia, and are related to the long-term prognosis. In the present study, MMP localization of the peripheral lymphocytes was performed by modified Demer's tricomplex flocculation method, and we compared the changes, after classification, between the pre-treatment and the 12-week post-treatment, of coenzyme Q10 (Co.Q10) and captopril in 61 hospitalized patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). They were followed up for 16.1 +/- 7.8 months (mean). The results showed that compared with the placebo, Co.Q10 and captopril could significantly protect against and repair MMP injury and improve the heart function of patients with DCM after 12 weeks, and the 2-year survival rate rose significantly by 72.7% for Co.Q10, and 64.0% for captopril, vs 24.7% for placebo. As for Longrank test, X2 equals 4.660 and 6.318, respectively, with both p < 0.05. The aforementioned results indicate that MMP injury of peripheral lymphocytes can predict the prognosis of the patients with DCM, thus the protection and repairment of MMP injury can improve the life-quality and prolong the life-span of the patients.", 
    "139": "ACE-inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension, and ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and diabetic nephropathy. The effect of the ACE inhibitors is mainly due to the inhibition of the angiotensin converting-enzyme, but they also potentiate the effect of bradykinine. Sargent et al. have indicated, that SH-containing ACE-inhibitors show an effect on KATP-channel open probability in vascular smooth muscle. In our experiments, we used isolated bovine coronary arteries and guinea pig aortas, which were cut transversally and brought into Normal-Tyrode-solution. The vessels were precontracted with phenylephrine or U 46619, and after that a cumulative dose of the SH-containing ACE-inhibitors Captopril or Zofenopril was added to obtain a relaxation curve. In a second series we blocked the KATP-channels with glibenclamide to see if the relaxation could be attenuated. In bovine coronary arteries the relaxing effect of Captopril could not be attenuated by glibenclamide, a specific blocker of KATP-channels of vascular smooth muscle. In the guinea pig aorta, the relaxing effect of Zofenopril was also not effected by glibenclamide. The concentrations of Zofenopril were between 10(-7) and 10(-4) mol/l; the maximal effect could be seen at a concentration of 10(-5) mol/l. Experiments with the non SH-containing ACE-inhibitor Enalapril did also not show any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups of series. We conclude, that, in contrast to Sargent's conclusions, there is little or no effect on KATP-channels due to the presence of SH-groups.", 
    "140": "The mechanism of the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction is not clear. Recent in vitro data indicate that angiotensin II (AII) stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules and thus activates leukocyte endothelial interactions. In eight healthy volunteers we investigated the influence of exogenous AII on circulating adhesion molecules and on the blood leukocyte count. A systemically effective and a systemically ineffective dose of AII were administered intravenously over 4 h in a single blind crossover design. Examination of the time course of circulating intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules and E-selectin (cICAM-1, cVCAM-1, cE-selectin-1) in response to the AII infusion revealed increases of up to 11% (especially in cVCAM-1 levels) at single time points, but no significant sustained elevation or trend that can be interpreted as a drug-induced effect. The systemically effective dose, which induced an increase in mean arterial blood pressure from 80 to 108 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa), resulted in a significant increase in blood leukocytes, from 4.8 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.3 g/L (p < 0.05); the systemically ineffective AII dose did not alter blood leukocyte count significantly. Although we did not find an influence of AII on circulating adhesion molecules in vivo, we observed an increase in the blood leukocyte count; thus it may be intriguing to assess whether renin-angiotensin system modulating drugs might exert their favorable effect in ischemic diseases at least in part via an influence on leukocytes.", 
    "141": "A 7.5-kg, 10-year-old, spayed female, mixed-breed dog was evaluated for sudden onset of weakness, tachypnea, and an irregular cardiac rhythm. Congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve regurgitation had been diagnosed six weeks earlier. The dog was stable on furosemide, enalapril, and hydralazine. Complex ventricular tachycardia, altered QRS conformation of sinus complexes, echocardiographic evidence of a hypokinetic left-ventricular free wall, and elevated creatine kinase suggested a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the dog developed ventricular fibrillation and died 36 hours after admission. Postmortem examination confirmed the myocardial infarction. Although a rare diagnosis in the veterinary patient, myocardial infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis for sudden onset of weakness, tachypnea, and ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "142": "Raynaud's syndrome affects 20% to 25% of the population in cool, damp climates. Although its etiology and pathophysiology are poorly understood, treatment options do exist. For mild cases, the wearing of gloves, cold avoidance, tobacco cessation, and assurance that this is a nuisance condition that will not lead to finger amputation are often all that is required. Patients who fail this protocol are treated with extended-release nifedipine, 30 mg, at bedtime. In our experience, 70% to 80% respond with a decrease in severity and frequency of attacks, but 20% to 50% develop intolerable side effects. If nifedipine fails, we consider another calcium-channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor, or Dibenzyline. Biofeedback is offered to patients, but in our experience few are interested. Patients with digital ulceration are treated with nifedipine, pentoxifylline, and antibiotics as needed. We recommend soap-and-water washes and either a damp dressing or Silvadene cream. If there is chronic non-healing or intractable pain, we have on occasion performed a fingertip amputation. Although these do not tend to heal promptly, they generally do heal with time and provide excellent pain relief. We have not performed upper extremity sympathectomy for nonhealing finger ulcers in more than 20 years.", 
    "143": "ACE inhibitors have been proven to be effective in the reduction of ischemia/reperfusion damage after myocardial ischemia. In an attempt to investigate this effect in a model of syngeneic liver transplantation in the rat, we compared a control group with an ACE inhibitor treatment group, in which enalapril was given i.v. before and during reperfusion. By means of in vivo microscopy, sinusoidal perfusion rate, permanent leukocyte sticking in sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules, and leukocyte rolling in postsinusoidal venules were assessed. Liver function was evaluated by measuring bile output. The sinusoidal perfusion rate was significantly improved by enalapril treatment. Leukocyte sticking in both sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules was found to be remarkably reduced in enalapril-treated animals; the fraction of rolling leukocytes remained unchanged. Bile output was increased in enalapril-treated animals. These results demonstrated, in a model of rat liver transplantation, that ACE inhibition by enalapril is effective in reducing hepatic ischemia/reperfusion damage as assessed by the leukocyte-endothelium interaction using in vivo microscopy and postreperfusion bile production.", 
    "144": "The peptide hormone angiotensin II is the main effector of the renin angiotensin system and may be involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular disease such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. Drugs developed to inhibit angiotensin II effects such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or receptor antagonists helped to detect the cardiovascular and cellular mechanisms of angiotensin II effects. ACE inhibitor effects are complex and include indirect as well as direct mechanisms. Indirect effects are mediated by unloading the heart via prevention of aldosterone release and modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity. Direct actions include the inhibition of cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis as well as hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. Recent work has focused on uncovering the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of angiotensin II induced cell growth.", 
    "145": "In this paper, we review the hypothesis that activated tissue renin-angiotensin systems play a detrimental role in heart failure. The main arguments for this idea are discussed: a) tissue renin-angiotensin systems behave functionally distinct from the circulating renin-angiotensin system; b) tissue renin-angiotensin systems are activated in heart failure; c) activated tissue renin-angiotensin systems induce cardiovascular dysfunction. Finally, this hypothesis predicts that optimal treatment in heart failure requires the inhibition of tissue renin-angiotensin systems. However, studies pertaining to this prediction are still lacking, particularly in human subjects.", 
    "146": "The risk to suffer from cardiovascular events may be modulated, in part, by neurohormonal systems. Neurohormones such as angiotensin II or aldosterone may be activated secondary to congestive heart failure or in the course of an acute myocardial infarction. These systems, if activated, will subject the failing heart to increased hemodynamic load and, thus, further compromise cardiac function. In addition, structural changes of the heart and vessels occurring with pressure or volume overload may be amplified by the growth promoting effects of these agents. Taken together, the interaction of underlying cardiovascular disease and activated neurohormones may often determine clinical symptoms and prognosis. More recently, growing evidence suggests that the basal, genetically determined, activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system may relate to the development of cardiovascular disease as well. In particular, variants of the angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme genes have been associated with essential hypertension, myocardial infarction, or left ventricular hypertrophy. In this regard, the data suggest that the renin angiotensin aldosterone system may be one of the primary causes, rather than only a secondary co-factor, in the pathogenesis of these most important cardiovascular disorders. In light of the various options of pharmacological intervention, it seems important that ongoing clinical and molecular-genetic research will further define the role of the renin angiotensin system in clinical conditions or genetic risk profiles.", 
    "147": "We have studied serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels during 6 years after kidney transplantation in 16 patients. There was a serum EPO peak around 50 mU/ml after 5 weeks. After 3 months the serum EPO level stabilized at around 30 mU/ml. Patients with good transplant function had significantly higher serum EPO levels and normalized their hemoglobin (Hb) after a mean of 3 months. If transplant function was good, Hb was normalized even if the serum EPO was only slightly elevated. Patients with poor transplant function had lower serum EPO and Hb levels. We concluded that a good transplant function is the key to a normal erythropoiesis and that small amounts of EPO are needed to improve Hb.", 
    "148": "The loss of intercellular cohesion among keratinocytes (acantholysis) may be considered the histologic marker of pemphigus. Many drugs, especially thiol drugs, proved to be able to provoke in vitro acantholysis by biochemical mechanisms interfering with the disulfide and thiol group balance. As to nonthiol drugs, the pathomechanism of acantholysis is still unexplained.", 
    "149": "To explain the molecular mechanism of enalapril-induced acantholysis a potential link between transglutaminase (TGase) activity and the effects of this drug was investigated.", 
    "150": "TGase activity in extracts from human breast skin cultured in the presence of thiopronine, captopril and enalapril were evaluated in vitro. The acantholytic potential of cystamine, a known TGase inhibitor, was also investigated.", 
    "151": "Enalapril, the most powerful acantholytic drug in vitro, was found to inhibit both the purified enzyme and the TGase activity in the extracts from cultured human breast skin explants. Kinetic studies showed that enalapril inhibition was competitive with respect to the amino acceptor substrate and uncompetitive with respect to the amino donor substrate. Moreover, an acantholytic effect of cystamine on explants of normal human skin was shown.", 
    "152": "These results suggest that acantholysis and the inhibition of TGase activity could be two related phenomena.", 
    "153": "Fifty-two patients with postrenal transplant erythrocytosis were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril or enalapril) for a median of 13 months (range 0-44). A significant fall in haemoglobin of 1.8 +/- 1.6 g dl-1 (range - 0.8 to 6.6) occurred over the first 3 months (p < 0.0001). The haemoglobin then remained stable for as long as 3 years. Both enalapril and lisinopril were equally effective. Therapy was withdrawn in 16 patients (31%) because of decline in renal function (6), anaemia (5), hypotension (3), hyperkalaemia (1) or erectile impotence (1) - complications which were all reversible. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in low dose are a safe and effective long-term therapy for postrenal transplant erythrocytosis.", 
    "154": "Potential involvement of brain endogenous angiotensin II in the nociception was investigated in mice by using ACE inhibitors and an angiotensin II antagonist. The mice were allocated to the groups which were orally treated with spirapril (5 mg/kg), trandolapril (5 mg/kg), enalapril (30 mg/kg), losartan (10 mg/kg), or vehicle for 1 day (single dose groups) and 7 days (repeated doses groups). Significantly longer jump latencies were obtained for the groups repeatedly treated with spirapril, trandolapril and losartan, while the group with enalapril gained no effect. In contrast, the single dosing of all agents failed to show antinociceptive effect. The brain ACE activity was determined ex vivo immediately after the hot-plate test, and showed to be suppressed for the groups repeatedly treated with spirapril or trandolapril. In the group repeatedly treated with losartan, ex vivo autoradiography depicted the marked decrease in angiotensin II-binding capacity to the sites containing exclusively AT1 receptors within the blood-brain barrier. The antinociceptive effects of repeated doses of spirapril and losartan were reversed by naloxone. These results suggest that brain endogenous angiotensin II is likely to be involved in central nociceptive mechanisms by its antagonistic interaction with endogenous opioid system.", 
    "155": "Dosage reduction of procainamide has been recommended in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). However, these recommendations are based primarily on studies with unmatched control groups, suboptimal blood sampling, and in patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These agents increase renal blood flow, which theoretically may offset alterations in drug disposition in patients with CHF. The pharmacokinetics of procainamide in patients with chronic CHF and in matched controls were compared. A single intravenous dose of 750 mg of procainamide was administered to 9 patients with chronic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF (mean +/- SD left ventricular ejection fraction 22 +/- 9%) receiving medical therapy and 7 control subjects matched for age and gender. Blood and urine samples were collected at intervals over a period of 48 and 72 hours, respectively. Patients with CHF and control subjects were demographically similar, with the exception of concomitant medications, including ACE inhibitors (8/9 versus 1/7, respectively). There were no significant differences between patients with CHF and control subjects in mean +/- SD peak serum concentrations (Cmax), area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity), total clearance, renal clearance, half-life (t1/2), or volume of distribution (Vd) of procainamide. Similarly, there were no significant differences between patients with CHF and control subjects in the mean +/- SD Cmax, AUC0-infinity, renal clearance, or t1/2 of N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA). Procainamide dosage reduction may not be necessary in patients with chronic stable CHF who are receiving medical therapy.", 
    "156": "Angiotensin receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Reduction of blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension requires increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Losartan, the first orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin antagonist, specifically competes with angiotensin II (Ang II) for the AT1 receptor and reversibly alters the receptor. Maximum blood pressure reductions occur after doses of approximately 50 mg, although some patients will require 100 mg; the parent compound and a metabolite are responsible for a smooth 24-hour effect on blood pressure. Once-daily dosing with losartan has been documented to be safe. The drug's safety has been evaluated in 4,058 patients; of these patients, more than 1,200 were treated for longer than 6 months and more than 800 were treated for longer than 1 year with doses of 10 mg to 150 mg. Overall, no hypertensive patients were withdrawn from treatment because of elevated serum creatinine or potassium levels, and there were no reports of angioedema. In addition, some reductions in plasma uric acid levels were noted. Cough occurred significantly less often in patients treated with losartan than in those treated with hydrochlorothiazide or lisinopril. In contrast to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, losartan does not activate bradykinin-nitric oxide-prostanoid vasodilation.", 
    "157": "Renal diseases as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, interstitial nephritis (e.g. analgetic nephropathy) or systemic disease with renal involvement are responsible for renal hypertension. High blood pressure remains the most important factor for progression of chronic renal failure. On the other hand, effective anti-hypertensive therapy results in inhibition of progression. Clinical and experimental studies show a renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors due to lowering of systemic blood pressure, reduction of glomerular capillary pressure, reduction of proteinuria and antiproliferative effects.", 
    "158": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and fluid homeostasis in people with and without hypertension. The ACE-inhibitors were the first of the RAS blocking agents to have a wide clinical acceptance. Several trials demonstrated their usefulness in the treatment of essential hypertension, congestive heart failure, post myocardial infarction and diabetic renal disease. The recent development of selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor II blockers offers the compelling concept of interfering on the receptor level without disruption of the prostaglandin and bradykinin biosystems. Losartan, the prototype of orally active angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, has been shown to be safe and effective in control of elevated blood pressure and improvement of the abnormal hemodynamics in the patient with congestive heart failure. These early encouraging results have to be confirmed by studies translating the circulatory benefits into augmented end-organ protection and prolongation of life.", 
    "159": "For treatment of hypertension drugs are desirable which exert a 24 hours lasting blood pressure control. Among the ACE-inhibitors some drugs exist which have this action. The elimination pathway plays a minor role in this respect. Not only the inhibition of Angiotensin II generation but also the decreased inhibition of bradykinin-degeneration plays a crucial role with regard to several endothelial functions controlling the so called remodeling of the cardiovascular system.", 
    "160": "From a cardiologist's view there are several established indications for the use of ACE-inhibitors like hypertension, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. In other forms of coronary artery disease like stable and unstable angina and prevention of arteriosclerotic complications. ACE-inhibitors are under discussion. As antihypertensives ACE-inhibitors are about equally effective as calcium blockers, betablockers and diuretics without the negative effects on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Vascular and cardial remodelling are prevented with ACE-inhibitors at least to a certain degree. In heart failure ACE-inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality, if left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced. In acute myocardial infarction ACE-inhibitors are indicated in overt heart failure, depressed left ventricular function and high-risk-patients. In silent ischaemia and secondary prevention ACE-inhibitors are under discussion.", 
    "161": "Iatrogenic respiratory disorders include bronchic manifestations (asthma, bronchospasm, cough) and bronchiolar manifestations (constrictive or proliferative bronchiolitis). Many pharmacologic agents can induce a bronchospasm. The bronchospasm induced by acetylsalicylic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, often severe, is mediated by the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme; it can be prevented by eviction of the drug or desensitization. Leukotriene receptor antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may also be useful. Beta-blockers including cardioselective beta-blockers, cholinergic agonists, inhaled agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), vindesine, histamine liberators, etc..., can also induce a bronchospasm. Most of the same agents can also induce an isolated cough, particularly beta-blockers, inhaled agents, and ACE, which cause 75% of the reported cases of iatrogenic cough. ACE-induced cough usually disappears within 1 to 4 days after withdrawal of the treatment, confirming the diagnosis; ACE-induced cough may be prevented by sodium cromoglycate. The risk of obliterans bronchiolitis with expiratory airflow impairment during rheumatoid arthritis is increased by D-penicillamine. Many drugs can be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, which presents with various clinical and radiological aspects. The physician has to keep in mind that bronchospasm, cough, or bronchiolitis of unknown origin, may have a iatrogenic cause.", 
    "162": "Arterial hypertension is the most frequent cardiovascular complication of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus-type-1 occurs in about 30% of patients and it is connected to development of diabetic nephropathy, while type-2 occurs in as much as 70% of cases, having fast atherosclerosis as a base in its etiopathogenesis. The therapy of arterial hypertension in diabetic patients is specific and in some ways different depending on the type of diabetes mellitus as well as other complications characteristic for diabetes. Apart from drug therapy, it includes: body weight reduction in obese patients, restriction of sodium chloride, proteins and alcohol drinking, as well as other risk factors (smoking, for example). Drug therapy means application of different groups of antihypertensive agents (selective beta-blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists and postsynaptic alpha-1 blockers). Some of them have adverse effects on metabolism of lipids, while some have other adverse effects which must be taken into account when determining therapy. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists are the most preferred today as the most effective and with least adverse effects.", 
    "163": "The effect of the blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) on thermoregulatory, cardiovascular and renal function during moderate exercise in a hot [mean (SEM) 34.4 (0.1) degrees C] environment was evaluated. Six men and three women cycled at 60% peak oxygen uptake for 45 min following acute administration of a placebo (PLAC) or enalapril (ENAL), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I). Resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by ENAL, but the pressor response to exercise was unaffected [delta MAP = 7.8 (1.4)mmHg for both trials (P > 0.05)]. Peak esophageal temperature [T(es) = 38.7 (1.0) degrees C (PLAC) vs 38.4 (0.2) degrees C (ENAL)] and mean skin temperatures [Tsk = 36.5 (0.1) degrees C (PLAC) vs 36.6 (0.1) degrees C (ENAL)] were similar for both drug treatments during the exercise. Both aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased five fold above resting values during exercise; however, only the PRA response [16.7 (3.2) ng angiotensin I (Ang I).ml-1.h-1 (ENAL) vs 7.4 (1.2)ng Ang I.ml-1.h-1 (PLAC)] was significantly altered by ENAL treatment (P < 0.05). Urine flow, sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rates, determined from creatinine clearance, were similarly reduced following exercise for both ENAL and PLAC treatments. These results suggest acute administration (5 mg) of ACE-I does not impair thermoregulatory, cardiovascular or renal responses during moderate exercise in the heat.", 
    "164": "An opaque screen moving overhead provokes an escape response in the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus that habituates after a few presentations of the eliciting stimulus. Fifteen trials with a 180-s intertrial interval or 30 trials with a 90-s interval (strong training protocol) ensures long-term habituation (LTH) of the response for 24 h, whereas 10 trials (weak training protocol) fail to induce it. However, robust LTH is obtained when crabs are injected with human angiotensin (All; 50 pmol) immediately after a weak training protocol. This memory-enhancing effect of All is dose-dependent, reversible by saralasin (5 pmol), and vanishes either when the weak training protocol is reduced to only five trials, or when the peptide is given before training or 1 h after. LTH is impaired by saralasin (5 pmol) administered before or after the strong training protocol, but no amnestic effect is disclosed when the antagonist is given 1 h after. On the other hand, both All-like immunoreactivity and angiotensin-converting enzyme-like activity are described in diverse tissues of Chasmagnathus, namely, in gills and in both thoracic and supraesophageal ganglia. Results support the view that some components of the renin-angiotensin system and their influence on memory might have emerged early in evolution.", 
    "165": "Phase I human studies can be used to differentiate a novel agent from existing drugs that influence the same pathway (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors). Human forearm vasculature provides a useful experimental model for such studies because antagonism of local effects of agonists on resistance vasculature can be quantified, unconfounded by reflex cardiovascular responses to systemically applied agonists. In this model, inhibition of ACE with enalapril (given orally) or its active metabolite enalaprilat (given into the brachial artery) influences responses to some, but not all, vasoactive peptides that are substrates of ACE in vitro. Vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin I (A I) are antagonized, while vasodilator responses to bradykinin are potentiated. Responses to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P (SP), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are unaltered by ACE inhibition. Vasodilator responses to bradykinin are antagonized by the B2-receptor icatibant and are blunted (but not abolished) by inhibition of the L-arginine/NO pathway with L-NG-monomethyl arginine. In contrast to inhibition of ACE with enalapril, blockade of the AT1 receptor with losartan results in similar inhibition of vasoconstrictor responses to both A I and angiotensin II but has no significant effect on the vasodilator action of bradykinin. The implication is that losartan provides more specific blockade of the renin-angiotensin pathway than does inhibition of ACE. The in vivo methods described in the study confirm the mechanistically relevant differentiation between AT1-receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition in humans.", 
    "166": "The discovery of orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II (A II)-receptor antagonists has initiated a growing understanding of the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of A II. Losartan is the first of the new class of antagonists that block all the well-known effects of A II, including vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, renin release (negative feedback), and the stimulation of thirst. A II-receptor subtypes have been described, with losartan antagonism defining the AT1 subtype and with PD123319 antagonism defining the AT2 subtype. The AT1 receptor is G-protein-coupled, involving PLC, PLA2, PLD, or adenylate cyclase and the release of intracellular calcium. The receptor-response coupling of the AT2 site remains elusive but may involve protein tyrosine phosphatase and subserve an antiproliferative role. Losartan as the prototype of an AT1-selective antagonist: i) inhibits A II binding, ii) antagonizes effects of A II in vivo and in vitro, and iii) lowers blood pressure in models of A II-dependent hypertension A II stimulates growth in vitro (DNA and protein synthesis) and in vivo (cardiac and vascular hypertrophy), and these effects are blocked by losartan. Losartan, like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has significant renal, cardiac, and cerebral protective effects in models of renal failure, cardiac failure, and stroke, confirming the pathologic role of A II in these models. The pioneering studies in experimental animals are being confirmed by a growing number of other AT1-selective blockers and provide the basis of use of losartan for hypertension and its clinical trial in other disease states.", 
    "167": "The biologic action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) includes conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin II (A II) and degradation of bradykinin. Thus, pharmacologic blockade of ACE is expected to augment endogenous bradykinin activity. A study using a specific bradykinin inhibitor revealed that the activation of bradykinin by an ACE inhibitor has the potential to affect the function of the kidney in several ways. It has been shown in vitro that bradykinin is a highly selective efferent (vs. afferent) arteriolar dilator. An in vivo study using both ACE inhibitors and bradykinin antagonists demonstrated that, through this efferent-arteriolar dilating effect, the bradykinin activated by ACE inhibition causes a profound reduction in glomerular pressure. In contrast, the latter phenomenon is absent during administration of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonist, a finding consistent with the notion that AT1 antagonists are devoid of kininase inhibitory action. Due to this difference, AT1 antagonists appear to be inherently better A II inhibitors than ACE inhibitors where glomerular filtration is concerned. This speculation was verified in an acute experimental setting. It is conceivable, however, that the relatively high glomerular pressure maintained during AT1-antagonist administration may have different effects on the kidney in the long term, because the salutary effect of ACE inhibition to protect kidneys from progressive damage in chronic renal disease is attributed in part to its potent glomerular-pressure-lowering effect. The long-term effects of losartan in the kidney will need to be examined in human studies.", 
    "168": "Abnormal growth of vascular smooth-muscle cells is a characteristic of many cardiovascular diseases. This abnormal growth occurs during hypertension-induced vascular hypertrophy, during the development of an atherosclerotic lesion, and during the development of a restenotic lesion following angioplasty. It is becoming increasingly apparent that among the many factors that may influence vascular structure, angiotensin may play a major role. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease hypertension-induced vascular hypertrophy, and, in many animal models, these inhibitors block the development of atherosclerosis and the development of an injury-induced neointimal lesion. Evidence suggests that the local production of angiotensin via tissue-converting enzyme may play an important role in these growth effects. We have demonstrated in animal models that injured vessels express high levels of ACE. Moreover, we have shown that the ability of an ACE inhibitor to block neointimal development correlates better with its ability to inhibit tissue ACE than with its ability to block circulating ACE. The role of angiotensin in human atherosclerosis is not clear. In an immunohistochemical study of human coronary arteries, we have obtained evidence that ACE is present within the atherosclerotic plaque, associated with regions of macrophage clustering. Moreover, in cell culture, monocytes induced to differentiate into macrophages express high levels of ACE. Treatment of these cells with acetylated low density lipoproteins results in a further increase in ACE expression. These results support the hypothesis that ACE may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Further studies, however, are required to precisely define this role.",

They suggest that this observed beneficial effect is independent of any change in large artery distensibility and that in the presence of ACE inhibitors, this improvement may be independent of any vasodilating action of flosequinan. Although this study confirms the beneficial symptomatic effects of flosequinan in chronic cardiac failure, clinical trials have subsequently demonstrated an overall increase in mortality in patients treated with 100 mg flosequinan daily.

    "183": "Differences among angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in scavenging reactive oxygen species were described and mainly attributed to the presence or absence of a thiol group. Plasma constituents and red cells are known targets for oxidative damage. Transition metals, like copper, are well known catalizers of free radical generation. In the present study we compared the abilities of captopril (a thiol ACEI), enalaprilat, and lisinopril (two nonthiol ACEI) for inhibiting copper-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation and fluorescence generation in whole human plasma and low-density lipoprotein. The effects of those ACEI on copper/hydrogen peroxide-induced fluorescence development and electrophoretic mobility modification in albumin and on copper-induced TBARS formation and hemolysis in human red cells were also compared. Captopril was more effective than the two nonthiol ACEI in inhibiting plasma and LDL lipid peroxidation, but it was ineffective in inhibiting the albumin oxidative modification that was moderately inhibited by enalaprilat and lisinopril. On the contrary, the inhibitory effects of the three ACEI on copper-induced lipid peroxidation and hemolysis in red cell suspensions were more uniform. This as yet unreported red cell protective effect may deserve pharmacological evaluation. Our results show that captopril is a more effective antioxidant than the nonthiol ACEI in some systems. However, the nonthiol ACEI also have the ability to partially protect some targets against oxidative damage. These observations suggest that the presence of a thiol group in the ACEI structure is not the only determinant for the antioxidant properties.", 
    "184": "The reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and the vascular endothelial factors such as endothelins (ETs) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) were found to be mediators of the reperfusion component of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Captopril (CPT), a sulfydryl (-SH) group containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been shown to reverse I/R injury by its ROM scavenging effect. In this experimental study, the effects of CPT and BM 13.177 (a TxA2 receptor antagonist) were assessed on liver I/R injury in rats. Four groups of Wistar albino rats were either sham-operated, control, CPT or BM 13.177-treated. The middle and left lateral hepatic arteries and portal veins were occluded in each group but the sham and the corresponding agents were given to the animals prior to I/R injury. After I/R injury, blood was drawn from the suprahepatic inferior vena cava for ET-1-like activity assay and liver tissue samples were obtained for the determination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and histopathologic examination. PGE2 and ET-1 levels were increased significantly in the control group compared with the sham-operated group. In the CPT group, LTC4, PGE2 and ET-1 levels were significantly increased compared with the control group, while only ET-1 levels were not different from those of the control group in the BM 13.177-treated group. It is concluded that ET-1 release increases in response to I/R injury in rat liver and CPT further increases this release. It also appears that CPT has a stimulatory effect on arachidonic acid metabolism in addition to its free radical scavenging effect.", 
    "185": "The increase in renin secretion and the induction of the converting enzyme (ACE) observed during treatment by ACE inhibitors (CEIs) could result in increased angiotensin II (ang II) synthesis when the treatment is stopped. The object of this study was to compare changes in the components of the renin-angiotensin system with changes in arterial pressure in hypertensives, following the cessation of long-term ramipril treatment. Twenty hypertensives, treated for at least three months with ramipril, in monotherapy for the last three weeks, were randomly allocated to two parallel groups and received for fifteen days, on a double-bind basis, either a placebo (withdrawal group W, n = 12) or ramipril at the previous doses (treated group T, n = 8). Blood pressure was measured using four different techniques. The active renin (AR), angiotensinogen, angiotensin I (ang I), angiotensin II (ang II) and aldosterone plasma concentrations were measured, as was plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro (colorimetric and fluorimetric method) and in vivo (the ang II/ang I ratio). The biological effects of cessation of long-term ramipril treatment in hypertensives were a decline in AR and angiotensin I concentrations, an increase in ACE activity and no significant changes in angiotensinogen, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Fifteen days after withdrawal, the different parameters of the renin-angiotensin system appear to have returned to basal value. A slow rise in blood pressure was also observed but no rebound increase was noted during the 15 days neither in angiotensin II levels nor in blood pressure. Following the cessation of prolonged ramipril treatment, in vivo converting enzyme inhibition disappears slowly, probably on account of the slow tight binding inhibitor properties of ramiprilat, the active metabolite of this CEI. The gradual decline in AF, plasma levels, together with the prolonged ACE inhibition as measured in vivo by the ang II/ang I ratio, explains the absence of a rise in ang II synthesis.",

To this end, BK-like immunoreactivity (BK-LI) and des[Arg9]BK-LI were measured with highly sensitive and specific chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays. Because pentobarbital significantly reduced the carrageenan-induced edema between 3 and 8 h, experiments were conducted in conscious rats. Icatibant (32.5 nmol/paw; intraplantar) significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema between 3 and 8 h in captopril-untreated rats and at 1 and 3 h in captopril-treated rats (0.2 mg/kg x 5 days, per os). The paw content of BK-LI was increased 10-fold in captopril-untreated and 29-fold in captopril-treated rats 1 h after carrageenan injection. In parallel, des[Arg9]BK-LI was increased 8-fold in captopril-untreated and 24-fold in captopril-treated rats. Icatibant prevented the maximal increases in BK-LI and des[Arg9]BK-LI induced by carrageenan. It is concluded that inhibition of ACE by captopril enhanced the early production of endogenous BK and the edema formation induced by carrageenan through a B2 receptor-mediated mechanism. However, the B2 receptor does not appear to be involved in the late phase of the inflammatory response (from 5 to 24 h) to carrageenan in rats pretreated with ACEI. Although the concentrations of des[Arg9]BK were greater than those of BK, it is unlikely that B1 receptors play a significant role in this model of carrageenan-induced edema.", 
    "187": "The endothelin (ET) family of peptides have potent vascular, cardiac and renal actions which may be of pathophysiological importance in congestive heart failure (CHF). In vivo studies with selective and non-selective ET receptor antagonists are required to clarify the role of ET in the pathophysiology of CHF and determine whether anti-ET drugs may be therapeutically useful in CHF. The impact of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the management of CHF has been such that for any new treatment to be of value it will probably have to offer hemodynamic benefit over and above that already obtained with an ACE inhibitor; anti-ET agents seem to have this potential. The recent formal cloning and characterization of endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) should hasten the development of specific and selective ECE inhibitors and thus provide an alternative investigative, and perhaps therapeutic, tool. Morbidity and mortality from CHF remain unacceptably high even in patients receiving maximal medical therapy, including an ACE inhibitor. Blockade of either the generation (through ECE inhibition) or actions (through receptor blockade) of ET warrant further investigation as potential new therapeutic strategies.", 
    "188": "Numerous hormonal and neuroendocrine changes have been described in patients with chronic cardiac failure. These affect the balance of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor factors in favour of the latter, to the detriment of the circulation. Whether this is a reaction to central cardiac (haemodynamic) abnormalities, or is an integral part of the syndrome of heart failure, remains to be determined. Catecholamine levels are increased, especially in severe heart failure, and contribute to the vasoconstriction and probably also to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is also activated, causing fluid retention and further vasoconstriction. In the earlier stages, some of this increase may be iatrogenic due to the use of loop diuretics or inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, but there is evidence for independent RAAS activation in more severe grades of heart failure. The role of vasoconstrictor peptides such as neuropeptide Y and endothelin is briefly considered. Counterbalancing these are vasodilator peptides, in particular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The possibility of therapeutic interventions to increase circulating natriuretic hormone levels is discussed.", 
    "189": "To ensure a high degree of patient compliance, and thus, therapeutic safety also, an antihypertensive agent should lower blood pressure for 24 h when taken once a day. A placebo-controlled investigation was carried out in 22 patients with essential arterial hypertension, to ascertain whether this was the case with once daily administration of ramipril. Blood pressure was measured at rest, during exercise, and under outpatient conditions (ambulant blood pressure measurement-ABPM). In our study, ramipril had an excellent 24-h effect and was found to be suitable for administration once a day. ABPM represents the most comprehensive and reliable means of monitoring antihypertensive treatment, particularly since it also provides data about nocturnal blood pressure behavior and additionally enables the most distinctive determination of the trough to peak-ratio.", 
    "190": "Whereas mean arterial pressure remains practically unmodified along the arterial tree, pulse pressure increases markedly from central to peripheral arteries, principally due to an increase in systolic blood pressure and a small lowering of diastolic blood pressure. This hemodynamic pattern, due to the progressive increase in arterial stiffness and to the summation between the incident and the backward pressure wave along the arterial tree, has several implications, in that: i) the pulse pressure amplification increases with the effective length of the arterial tree (and therefore with the body height of subjects), but decreases with aging, due to a significant age-induced increase in aortic wave reflections and pulse pressure, ii) the magnitude of the pulse pressure amplification is strongly influenced by the status of the autonomic nervous system, so that carotid pulse pressure decreases more than brachial pulse pressure following sympathetic stimulation using lower body negative pressure, and iii) the pulse pressure amplification may be restored following administration of pharmacological agents as converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry-blockers but not dihydralazine. These particularities of pressure wave transmission may have fundamental consequences for: the diagnosis of hypertension, whether in humans or in animal; the evaluation of cardiac afterload and the effectiveness of antihypertensive agents; and finally, the interpretation of cardiovascular epidemiology. Indeed increased brachial pulse pressure is known to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor, particularly for myocardial infarction, but not for cerebrovascular complications.",

Orlistat was given in doses of 50 mg 3 times daily mid-meal for 7 (nifedipine and captopril) or 8 days (atenolol and furosemide). The four antihypertensive drugs (atenolol 100-mg tablet, furosemide 40-mg tablet, captopril 50-mg tablet and nifedipine 20-mg slow-release tablet) were administered in single doses twice, once before and once together, with orlistat at the end of the orlistat treatment period.", 
    "193": "The plasma concentration time profiles and the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for these drugs were in the expected range, except for furosemide, whose bioavailability was lower than reported in the literature. This was probably due to the fact that furosemide was given during a meal. There were minor, but statistically significant, differences in one of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide and nifedipine (no difference for captopril and atenolol) when these drugs were given alone and in combination with orlistat: the half-life of furosemide was slightly longer, the time to peak plasma concentrations of nifedipine was slightly longer. None of these are considered to be clinically significant changes.",

The hypotensive action appeared within 0.5 h and led to a fall in BP to 175/120 mmHg, and the peak action occurred at 4 h, when the BP was 138/99 mmHg, and it persisted upto 24 h (160/101 mmHg). Despite the significant fall in blood pressure, no reflex tachycardia was observed. Transient dizziness was seen in 2 patients, but otherwise all claimed improvement in clinical status and a clearer sensorium.",

    "199": "To test the potential for vasoactive neuropeptide receptors to affect capillary resistance, we have begun to study the plausibility that pericytes might be equipped to respond to a representative peptide vasoconstrictor and a representative peptide vasodilator. Pericytes cultured from the bovine retinal vasculature specifically bind the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist saralasin (1 nM125I-saralasin bound at 2.2 +/- 0.41 fmol/mg protein) and 125I-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; Kd of 0.5 nM with a population of 30 fmol/mg protein). Incubation with 100 microM Ang II induced minimal cAMP synthesis, while VIP (1 microM, 10 microM) did not induce any change in cAMP concentration. Ang II (10 microM and 100 microM) caused contraction of pericytes cultured on an elastic silicone surface. Circulating or locally produced vasoactive neuropeptides might affect pericyte contractile tone via several intracellular pathways, moderated by indirect effects of these peptides through endothelial stimulation, with the net effect on local blood flow resulting from the effects on arteries and veins as well as capillaries.", 
    "200": "Acute unilateral obstruction (UUO) of the pig kidney is associated with an increased secretion of intrarenally generated angiotensin II (ANG II). In order to clarify the importance of this intrarenal ANG II generation during acute UUO, ipsilateral and contralateral renal blood flow and renal secretion rate of ANG II were determined in pigs during continuous infusion of an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Pigs were operatively equipped with electromagnetic flow probes and catheters in the renal veins and aorta. Intravenous administration of the ACE inhibitor SQ14225 (captopril), 1 mg/kg per hour, resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow in the contralateral kidney from 340 +/- 28 ml/min to 435 +/- 36 ml/min (P < 0.01), whereas renal blood flow in the ipsilateral kidney was significantly reduced from 388 +/- 23 ml/min to 248 +/- 24 ml/min, similar to the reduction in controls. Captopril reduced mean aortic blood pressure, renal vascular resistance consistently on both sides, and plasma concentrations of ANG II and aldosterone from all sample sites. Renal secretion rate of ANG II showed a clear tendency to be reduced from the ipsilateral kidney. The results suggest that in UUO a compensatory increase in renal blood flow may be inhibited in part due to an enhanced secretion of ANG II in the ipsilateral kidney. However, a captopril-mediated inhibition of bradykinin breakdown may also explain some of the observed changes.", 
    "201": "Two boys, 11 and 10 years of age, respectively, having renovascular hypertension are reported. Diagnostically, captopril test and renal scintigraphy were useful as pharmacologic probes of the renal arterial stenosis and to determine its laterality, as well for examination of the operative outcome. Both children were rendered normotensive after renal revascularization, one by renal autotransplantation and the other by aortorenal bypass procedure. Renovascular hypertension in children is also discussed.", 
    "202": "Stimulation of the imidazoline I1-receptor represents a new mode of antihypertensive action, inhibiting peripheral alpha-adrenergic tone by a central mechanism. Moxonidine is an imidazoline I1-receptor modulator. Acute hemodynamic studies indicate that moxonidine results in an acute fall of both blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, whereas heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and pulmonary artery pressures are not affected. The ejection fraction is not significantly affected. Left ventricular end-systolic and -diastolic volumes are reduced. There is regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after 6 months of treatment. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and renin levels are all reduced, a finding consistent with central inhibition of sympathetic tone. After oral administration Tmax is about 1 h and bioavailability approaches 90%. Moxonidine is mostly excreted unchanged; biotransformation is unimportant. The T1/2 is 2.5 h, prolonged by renal insufficiency. The antihypertensive effect lasts longer than would be expected from the half-life, suggesting possible retention in the CNS. Open studies with moxonidine have revealed decreases on the order of 20-30 mm Hg systolic and 10-20 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. Most patients are controlled by 0.2-0.4 mg daily. Moxonidine has been compared with representatives from each important class of antihypertensive drugs, with diuretics, clonidine, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and both alpha- and beta- blocking drugs. Blood pressure control has been similar with moxonidine and these other agents. The overall incidence of side effects was similar, although moxonidine has a lower incidence of side effects than clonidine. Meta-analysis of controlled studies with moxonidine indicates that moxonidine causes similar decreases in blood pressure in both male and female subjects, in those below 50 years, those 50-60 years, and those over 60 years old, regardless of body weight. As with some other drugs, higher systolic blood pressure are associated with larger falls of systolic blood pressure, and the same is true for diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "203": "Although renal abnormalities may be present in patients with untreated, newly diagnosed essential hypertension, predictors of the development of progressive renal failure are of great concern. In addition, unanswered questions are the final arterial pressure achieved during treatment as well as the ideal renal- and cardiovascular-protective drug therapy. Most antihypertensive agents given for periods of several months in monotherapy have no consistent effect on renal function and hemodynamics. However, they may differ with regard to their influence on other factors considered to be markers of significant impact of hypertension on the kidney, such as albuminuria. Studies of very long-term therapy on the evolution of renal function and using reliable indicators of the variation of glomerular filtration rate are needed.", 
    "204": "The aim of this review is to comment the results described in the literature concerning the possible pharmacodynamic mechanisms involved in the improvement of quality of life of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors that is just a working hypothesis. These drugs, widely used in the treatment of hypertension, prevent the formation of angiotensin II and the generation of free radicals, as well as the hydrolysis of bradykinin, enkephalins and endorphins. Different mechanisms have been implicated on quality of life: 1) increase of bradykinin levels in the central nervous system that would trigger the release of nitric oxide (NO), noradrenaline, acetylcholine, excitatory amino acids and vasopressin which are involved in memory and cognition; 2) increase of brain blood supply by enhanced NO synthesis; 3) interference with cholinergic mechanisms in the central nervous system by angiotensin II inhibition of acetylcholine release; 4) decrease of endorphin metabolism; and 5) interaction with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that releases ACTH and vasopressin.", 
    "205": "The purpose of the study was to elucidate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the hemodynamics in elderly hypertensive patients. Forty-two elderly hypertensives (mean 72 +/- 5 years) were given either ACE inhibitors (A group: perindopril in 10 and captopril in 4 cases), beta blockers (B group: arotinolol in 15 cases) or calcium antagonists (C group: nifedipine in 3 and nitrendipine in 10 cases) for 8-12 weeks. The responses to handgrip and mental arithmetic stress and cardiac functional changes were determined by echocardiography before and after the medications. The decrease in blood pressure at rest and on the stress tests was similar among the three groups, though the hemodynamic responses to the stress tests showed some differences. In the A group, no hemodynamic changes were seen either at rest or on the stress tests after the medication. In the B group, the heart rate and the cardiac output were decreased at rest, and the increase of them on the stress tests were diminished after the medication. On the contrary, the heart rate and the cardiac output were increased, and showed exaggerated responses on the stress tests in the C group. In conclusion, in antihypertensive treatment of elderly hypertensive patients it is important to consider the effects of the antihypertensive drugs on the hemodynamics, although the comparable decrease in blood pressure is expected.", 
    "206": "The synthesis of a series of proline derivatives (1a-e and 2a-b) as pure isomers is described. These compounds were evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and compared to the potency of captopril taken as a reference drug. They showed only a weak ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "207": "The interaction between moderate salt depletion and urinary excretions of prostanoids (PGE2,6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2), as well as the effective role of the activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS), in the control of renal function and urinary prostanoid excretions have been investigated in healthy women. Salt depletion (SD, n = 8) was induced by low sodium chloride dietary intake (< or = 60 mmol per day) and combined treatment with natriuretic and potassium sparing drugs. The cumulative sodium deficit was 381 +/- 55 mmol. The renal function and urinary excretion of prostanoids were evaluated during hypotonic polyuria (oral water load) and subsequent moderate antidiuresis (lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP) low-dose infusion). Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary aldosterone excretion were determined, before the water load, in both the SD group and control studies in normal balance of sodium and potassium (N, n = 20). Paired studies were performed in the absence and in the presence of enalapril in the same SD group, as well as in a subgroup, with normal sodium and potassium balance, previously studied (N3, n = 6). In the SD vs. N group, significantly higher values of PRA and urinary aldosterone excretion were found. The renal antinatriuretic mechanism was activated and the diuretic response to water load depressed. During polyuria, the urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2 excretions were significantly higher, probably reflecting an increase in the renal synthesis of their precursors. During the late LVP infusion, the urinary PGE2 excretion was also significantly increased, in absence of significant differences in urinary flow rate. In both SD and N3 groups, enalapril decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Despite the decrease in MAP, not significantly different in SD vs. N3 group, the drug did not significantly affect the creatinine clearance. Also, the urinary prostanoid excretions were not significantly affected by enalapril. However, in the SD group, but not in the N3 group, the drug was effective in significantly decreasing the absolute and fractional excretions of sodium and chloride. Moreover, the plasma potassium concentration significantly decreased, despite the concurrent decrease in urinary potassium excretion. The data suggest that: (1) in salt depletion, the prostanoid release from the renal cortical structures was stimulated; (2) the renal prostanoid synthesis, either activated (sodium depletion) or not (normal sodium and potassium balance), was not affected by the RAS pharmacological blockade in the short-term; (3) in salt depletion, the RAS blockade recruited a homeostatic mechanism responsible for the improved renal salt conservation, as well as for the redistribution of potassium between the extra- and intra-cellular compartments.", 
    "208": "Effective antihypertensive agents may differ in their capacity to reduce cardiovascular risk because they induce potentially atherogenic alterations in lipoprotein composition.", 
    "209": "To assess this possibility, the effects of five months' treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAPT) on lipoprotein lipid composition were compared in thirty normolipidaemic patients with essential hypertension (EH).", 
    "210": "The sixteen patients treated with HCTZ showed the expected directional alterations in plasma TG (+31%), HDL2-C (-16%), and CHOL (+7.6%); in contrast TG and CHOL were unchanged after captopril in fourteen patients and their HDL2-C declined (-16%). Neither drug altered lipoprotein core lipid composition, but small increases were observed in the HDL2 sphingomyelin/lecithin ratio after both agents. The plasma free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) lecithin (L) ratio, a new index of cardiovascular risk, was abnormally increased before treatment and was not altered by either drug.", 
    "211": "These findings indicate that HCTZ and CAPT treatment have small, but demonstrable effects on lipoprotein surface lipid composition in patients with EH that are confined to the HDL2 subfraction.", 
    "212": "The pharmacological manipulation by vasodilators of peritoneal solutes and fluid kinetics was investigated. Rats were dialyzed for 240 minutes with 30 mL 4.25% glucose dialysate containing dextran 70. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), three calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem, and verapamil), and an +/-blocker (maxisylite) were administered intraperitoneally at various concentrations. Membrane permeability to urea, glucose, and protein, actual net ultrafiltration rate (UFR), transcapillary ultrafiltration rate (TCUFR), and peritoneal net fluid absorption rate (PNFAR) were measured. All three vasodilators caused a decrease in blood pressure, which, except for moxisylite, was associated with a decrease in net UFR. Captopril and the three calcium antagonists increased PNFAR dose dependently. Captopril increased membrane permeability to small and large molecular solutes, with a consequent decrease in TCUFR. Nicardipine and verapamil increased permeability to urea and glucose but not to protein. Only the latter decreased TCUFR. Diltiazem caused no change in permeability. In conclusion, various vasodilators administered intraperitoneally affect peritoneal solute and fluid transport differently. This should, perhaps, be taken into consideration when working with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients to whom antihypertensive drugs are administered in large doses.", 
    "213": "Effectiveness of enalapril was studied in hypertensive patients with or without diabetes-mellitus. All the patients received enalapril, 5-20 mg per day for 9 months. Enalapril effectively controlled the blood pressure and favourably altered the lipid levels and did not affect the glucose level in diabetics as well as non-diabetics. Enalapril may be considered as a better therapeutic option for the treatment of hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus.",

    "215": "The acute and chronic effects of oral cilazapril (CLZ) treatment, an ACE-inhibitor with prolonged duration on haemodynamic measures (PCWP, PAP, RAP, CI and SVR) and clinical parameters (Quality-of-Life and NYHA class) were investigated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in CHF. One hundred and thirty five patients (112 completing) in NYHA Classes II-III, on digitalis and diuretic treatment, were randomised after 2 weeks of placebo run-in, to receive either placebo or CLZ 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.5 mg daily for 12 weeks, followed by 2 week placebo wash-out. Haemodynamic studies, including exercise tests before and 3 h after medication, were performed on the first and last days of treatment. Measurements were performed at rest and at the maximum exercise level.", 
    "216": "In ACEI-naive patients oral CLZ 0.5 and 1 mg/d caused a dose dependent decrease in PCWP and diastolic PAP, and a significant reduction of SVR mg. A slight increase in CI was observed in all groups. The maximum effect was observed 3-5 h post dose. After 12 weeks of oral treatment, the acute response was similar but was attenuated relative to the first dose. Exercise tolerance improved in a dose dependent manner. The NYHA classification remained unchanged or improved in the majority of patients. Entry into the 2.5 mg group had to be terminated at an early stage due to severe adverse events observed after the first dose.",

    "218": "Physical exercise causes transient albuminuria. The mechanisms of postexercise albuminuria are not fully clarified but stimulation of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) probably plays a major role through intrarenal haemodynamic changes causing an elevated filtration pressure. In a randomised, double-blind, crossover study we compared the effects on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A) therapy, i.e. we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of the RAS or inhibition of beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects of the sympathetic nervous system differed with regard to changes in UAE. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standardised bicycle ergometer exercise tests were performed, before and after each active treatment period. UAE 30 min postexercise, determined by radioimmunoassay, was significantly lowered by both treatments: -278 mu g center dot min-1 (L) and -199 mu g center dot min-1 (A). The reduction of postexercise UAE achieved by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved by the beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker treatment. Blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise were equally reduced by both drugs. In conclusion, this study showed that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective in reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a beta1-selective adrenoceptor-blocking agent with a similar degree of BP reduction in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. This suggests that the RAS plays a major role in postexercise albuminuria in hypertensive subjects. The clinical significance of this finding, however, remains to be clarified.", 
    "219": "The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the development of proteinuria in the borderline hypertensive rat (BHR) is influenced by the Y chromosome and to determine if the onset of proteinuria in the BHR is delayed when blood pressure is lowered with enalapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor. Male F1, rats were the first-generation offspring of the mating of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) females and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) males and the mating of SHR males and WKY females. At 20 weeks of age, enalapril (125 mg/l) was added to the drinking water. Untreated BHR and enalapril-treated BHR (BHRE) were followed to 90-100 weeks of age. Urine was collected every 10-20 weeks for determination of protein, albumin, and nitric oxide (NO2/NO3) metabolite excretion. Indirect blood pressure in BHR from both crosses was approximately 175 mm Hg from 20 to 90-100 weeks of age. Enalapril lowered blood pressure by about 30 mm Hg, but was ineffective in reducing urinary protein or albumin excretion rates at any age. Urinary excretion of nitric oxide metabolites was similar in all groups at all time periods. There were significant differences in the percent of glomerulosclerosis between the two matings. Based on these results, renal injury in the BHR is not associated with the Y chromosome and can be dissociated from hypertension. Further studies using congenic and transgenic technology will be necessary to identify functions of genes and associations with hypertension in order to understand the kidney disease in this model of hypertension.", 
    "220": "In the present study we investigated the effect of a selective alpha 1-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril), and a calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine) on renal function in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. 30 NIDD hypertensive patients (age = 50 +/- 3 years; BMI = 30 +/- 1 kg/m2) (mean +/- SEM) were studied before and after a 12-week period of antihypertensive treatment. Ten patients were treated with doxazosin (Cardura) (2-8 mg once daily or 8 mg b.i.d.), 9 with captopril (Capoten) (25-50 mg b.i.d.), and 11 with nifedipine (Procardia-XL) (30-60 mg once daily). Blood pressure, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, fasting plasma glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured before and after drug treatment. Fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were similar in all three groups prior to the start of antihypertensive therapy and did not change significantly from baseline in any treatment groups. In the doxazosin group creatinine clearance rose from 99 +/- 8 to 122 +/- 8 ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01), while 24-hour urinary protein excretion declined from 2.66 +/- 0.05 to 1.76 +/- 0.02 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01). In diabetics treated with captopril creatinine clearance rose from 93 +/- 6 to 109 +/- 9 ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.05), while the 24-hour urinary protein excretion fell from 2.70 +/- 0.05 to 2.03 +/- 0.04 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.05). In patients treated with nifedipine creatinine clearance did not change (97 +/- 6 vs. 94 +/- 7 ml/1.73 m2.min), while 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased from 2.84 +/- 0.04 to 1.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar in doxazosin (150 +/- 3/95 +/- 2 mm Hg), captopril (153 +/- 3/93 +/- 1), and nifedipine (155 +/- 4/93 +/- 1) groups prior to the start of antihypertensive therapy and declined to 143 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 (doxazosin), 139 +/- 3/82 +/- 3 (captopril), and 141 +/- 3/84 +/- 1 (nifedipine) mm Hg (all p < 0.01 vs. pretreatment). In summary, both doxazosin and captopril treatment were associated with significant rises in GFR, while all three antihypertensive agents caused a significant decline in proteinuria. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel antagonists can safely and effectively be used in the clinical management of non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "221": "A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was investigated for the determination of imidapril and its active metabolite, imidaprilat, in human plasma and urine. Imidapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an oral prodrug of imidaprilat. Imidapril was determined after conversion to imidaprilat with esterase. Antiserum was raised in rabbits against the p-amino derivative of imidaprilat conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Radioligand was prepared by iodination (125I) of the p-hydroxybenzoylamino derivative of imidaprilat. Cross-reactivities of anti-imidaprilat antiserum for imidapril, its metabolites and several cardiovascular drugs were low. The calibration range was 0.1-100 ng ml-1 using a 100 microliters of human plasma of urine. Intra- and inter-day variations of imidaprilat assay in plasma were 2.0-7.9 and 4.1-6.2%, respectively, and intra- and inter-day variations of imidapril assay in plasma were 5.4-10.7 and 7.9-18.1%, respectively. The variations of the assay in urine were a little smaller than those in plasma. The recovery of imidaprilat and imidapril spiked in plasma or urine samples was approximately 100%. A good correlation between RIA and high-performance liquid chromatograpy was observed for both plasma and urine samples. Furthermore, this method was applied to the determination of imidaprilat and imidapril in human plasma and urine samples, for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of imidapril in humans. From the results, it was demonstrated that the developed RIA was useful for the determination of imidaprilat and imidapril in human plasma and urine, and was applicable to pharmacokinetic studies in humans.", 
    "222": "In stenosis of a renal artery, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) can induce a decrease in ipsilateral glomerular filtration. Dynamic MR imaging with gadolinium chelate enhancement was tested to detect this glomerular filtration reduction in experimental renovascular hypertension in the rat. Thirteen rats, with surgically induced left renal artery stenosis, developed hypertension and were studied before and after intravenous injection of ACEI with sequential Gd-DOTA-enhanced MR imaging. The time to onset of the tubular phase, the time of the maximal drop of signal, and the medullary signal-time curves of both kidneys were compared. Before ACEI, tubular phases were symmetric in 11 rats and slightly asymmetric in 2. Twelve rats showed ACEI-induced changes (positive test): absence of tubular phase on the left side (n = 8) or delay (n = 4) with significant differences (P < .01). Tubular phases remained symmetric in one (negative test). Dynamic MR imaging can identify ACEI-induced Gd-DOTA tubular transit asymmetry, indicative of functionally significant renal artery stenoses, in rats.",

Further aims were to evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on cocaine-treated endothelial cells, to assess their potential for inhibition of ET-1-stimulated release.", 
    "224": "Endothelin-1 release into the media was evaluated by radioimmunoassay under basal conditions and after 24 h treatment of endothelial cells with cocaine hydrochloride (HCl), or cocaine HCl and ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril. The effect of serum and plasma under these conditions was also investigated.", 
    "225": "Cocaine HCl stimulated ET-1 release in a dose response fashion that was independent of plasma or serum factors. Furthermore, cocaine-stimulated ET-1 release was inhibited by administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and lisinopril.", 
    "226": "These findings suggest that cocaine can directly stimulate endothelial cells to release ET-1 and that the observed increase is independent of serum or plasma factors. Furthermore, cocaine-stimulated endothelin-1 release appears to be mediated at least in part by the angiotensin system. These observations provide a framework for understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in cocaine-induced vasoconstriction.", 
    "227": "The activation of the renin-angiotensin system has been proposed as a very important step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptors antagonists showed their ability to reduce the atherosclerotic process in animals. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system reduces the development of atherosclerotic lesion either in cholesterol-fed animals and in animals after vascular injury. The precise mechanism for this action may depend on the inhibition of other than hypertensive property of angiotensin II.", 
    "228": "This article reports the evidence and the biochemical properties of an angiotensin-converting (ACE)-like enzyme from head parts of the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. After solubilization from membranes with Triton X-114, the ACE-like enzyme was purified from the detergent-poor fraction. Four steps of purification including gel permeation and anion exchange chromatographies followed by a reversed-phase HPLC were needed. This poor glycosylated peptidyl dipeptidase (of ca. 120 kDa) hydrolyzes, at pH 8.4 and at 37 degrees C, the Phe8-His9 bond of angiotensin I with a high catalytic activity (i.e., K(m): 830 microM and Kcat/K(m): 153 s-1 mM-1). The hydrolysis of angiotensin I is inhibitable at 80% by captopril (IC50 = 175 nM) and lisinopril (IC50 = 35 nM). This activity is strictly dependent on the presence of NaCl and is increased by Zn2+. This zinc metallopeptidase also attacks peptides that have in their sequence either Gly-His, Gly-Phe, or Phe-His bond [e.g., enkephalins (Kcat/K(m): 12 s-1 mM-1) or bradykinin (Kcat/K(m): 2200 s-1 mM-1]. Taken together, these arguments are consistent with an ACE-like activity implicated in metabolism of angiotensins and bradykinin in leeches.", 
    "229": "Two different conventional release enalapril maleate tablet formulations were evaluated for their relative bioavailability (Eupressin tablets 10 mg, Biosint\u00e9tica as the test formulation vs Renitec tablets 10 mg Merck Sharp & Dhome, as the reference formulation). A single 20 mg oral dose of each preparation was administered to 18 healthy male adult volunteers and their bioequivalence was assessed by comparing the serum enalaprilat and total enalapril (enalaprilat plus enalapril maleate) concentration-time curves. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was also quantified in each serum sample.", 
    "230": "The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for each formation were the area under the time-concentration curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC[0-24]), maximum concentration Cmax and the time at which it occurred (tmax). When serum enalaprilat concentration-time curves were employed to assess bioequivalence, the formulations were bioequivalent in the extent but not in the rate of absorption. However, no difference in either the extent or the rate of absorption were observed when serum total enalapril vs time curves were analysed. ACE activity-time curves were similar for both formulations and showed that ACE was 90% inhibited for 3-5 h after enalapril administration, and till approximately 50% after 24 h. At that time, circulating enalaprilat and total enalapril levels were less than the tenth of Cmax.", 
    "231": "The results show that complete bioequivalence of the two formulations can be concluded from serum total enalapril concentration data, and that serum ACE activity is not a suitable pharmacodynamic variable for assessing bioequivalence.", 
    "232": "The plasmid pMK16 containing-SV40 replicated origin defective gene was efficiently introduced into early-passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using positively charged liposomes. The resulting cell line acquired an almost infinite lifespan, was morphologically unchanged, expressed SV40-antigen, and coexpressed von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), and endothelin converting enzyme (ECE). In addition, these are the first immortalized human endothelial cells, to our knowledge, that biosynthesized and secreted interleukins (IL-1 beta and IL-6) in both a constitutive and regulated fashion and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the most potent vasoactive peptide, which has been suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Interestingly enough, both of the immortalized cells and the early-passage HUVEC from which the immortalized cells were obtained biosynthesized and secreted the same levels of ET-1 suggesting full maintenance of its biosynthetic pathway including the presence of active ECE, which cleaves big endothelin-1 (big-ET-1) to ET-1 and regulation factors. Moreover, the immortalized cells retained the ability to express the functional specific amino acid Na(+)-independent system Y+ transporter, which mediates L-arginine transport into endothelial cells from which endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF, nitric oxide) is formed via the action of nitric oxide-synthase. Obtaining these immortalized human endothelial cells without alteration of the differentiated characteristics constitutes a useful model: (a) to study ET-1 secretion, gene regulation, and human ECE, which may be an important therapeutic target in disease conditions in which ET-1 is to be implicated; (b) to study L-arginine transport, which is a key step in the formation of EDRF; (c) to study IL-1 beta and IL-6 secretions, and gene regulations; (d) to substitute large quantities of HUVEC; and, finally, (e) to reproduce, starting with different primary endothelial cells both from human and animal origin.", 
    "233": "Further reduction in the morbidity and mortality from diseases associated with heart failure is to be expected by the early introduction of strategies aimed at preventing cardiac damage. In the future, ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and type III antiarrhythmic agents, as well as pacemakers, will be used judiciously and in combination following better risk profiling using non-invasive techniques. Cardiac transplantation could be a more widely used treatment for end-stage cardiac disease. Ongoing randomized studies are revealing the usefulness of various pharmaceutical products as well as implanted defibrillators. In the more distant future, anti-endothelin therapy, cardiac autoantibody immunotherapy, cardiac-specific inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and/or normalization of autonomic parasympathetic activity by parasympathomimetic agents may prove to be additional tools for reducing the complications from cardiac disease.", 
    "234": "A series of elegant experimental studies and careful clinical observation over a decade or more have led to the concept of 'infarct expansion' and 'remodelling' of the heart, culminating in a number of major mortality studies indicating the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). But has this concept been too narrow in predicting which patients might benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors? Measurable infarct-expansion with progressive dilatation probably occurs in less than 20% of patients, whereas increase in volume and hypertrophy of the heart as responses to compromised function are likely wherever significant myocardial damage has occurred. Irrespective of infarct expansion, cumulative extensive damage can lead to an inevitable downward spiral with gross ventricular dilatation and death in heart failure. But in the majority of patients after MI a 'new equilibrium' is established in which initial dilatation and subsequently hypertrophy restore adequate function. Is it possible to distinguish patients in whom the cost and inconvenience of long-term therapy with an ACE inhibitor justify the likely benefit from treatment after an MI? The SAVE, AIRE and recent TRACE studies allow a rational approach for the clinician, indicating the effectiveness of these drugs in patients with evidence of impaired ventricular function. However, the prospect that ACE inhibitors prescribed long term might also prevent myocardial reinfarction could justify wider use. Post-MI patients are an easily identifiable high-risk group for a cost-effective programme of secondary prevention. Reinfarction in an already damaged ventricle carries a particularly poor prognosis and its prevention by ACE inhibitors could make a major contribution to the undoubted benefit from these agents. The recently completed TRACE study with its long-term follow-up may help resolve this issue, which is also being investigated in a number of long-term prospective studies in populations at high risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "235": "Large scale placebo-controlled trials with clinical end-points are not possible when other compounds with proven efficacy are already available. Hence, the question arises whether the available experience from placebo-controlled phase III trials can be analysed jointly to assess whether an effect on clinical end-points exists. This question was answered for the new ACE inhibitor ramipril, with which five exercise capacity trials were done in similar patients with heart failure. Meta-analysis showed that ramipril reduced the occurrence of the combined event death or hospitalisation by 32% (P = 0.05), based on the customary 'intention-to-treat' comparison for large scale trials. From this analysis, the lesson has been learnt that a drug development programme must be carefully planned to allow for this type of meta-analysis.", 
    "236": "Heart failure is a progressive disease and once the process has started it continues with further deterioration of cardiac function or ends in sudden death. In many patients changes within the heart start to develop long before clinical symptoms occur. The left ventricle goes through a number of adaptions-remodelling-to compensate for increased pressure or volume load or subsequent myocardial infarction. Several of these compensatory changes have prognostic implications and indicate increased risk of clinical heart failure or cardiac events. Thus, increased left ventricular dimensions, volume and mass together with reduced systolic function are all markers of poor prognosis. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors before the onset of clinical heart failure has been shown to improve prognosis. Identification of individuals at high risk is difficult since signs and symptoms of heart failure are often lacking. A strategy to find these patients must use objective methods to characterise the state of the left ventricle. It is likely that not only patients with significant reduction of systolic function but also other signs of impaired left ventricular dysfunction will benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors. Only by preventive treatment may we be able to decrease the number of patients with new onset of clinical heart failure.", 
    "237": "Cardiac failure is a lethal end-stage of cardiovascular disease. Survival, once the heart has used up all its reserve and compensatory mechanisms, is little better than for cancer. Once overt failure ensues median survival is only 1.7 years for men and 3.2 years for women, and sudden death is a common mode of exitus. Recent declines in death rates from cardiac disease have not been accompanied by a reduced prevalence or incidence of cardiac failure. A substantial reduction in cardiac failure incidence and mortality requires the detection and correction of presymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and the risk factors which predispose to its occurrence. Major contributors to the development of cardiac failure have been delineated and quantified. Methods for efficiently identifying presymptomatic candidates for cardiac failure for preventive measures have been developed. High-risk candidates can now be cost-effectively targeted for treatment to delay failure. Independent predictors of heart failure have been identified by epidemiologic research which enable construction of multivariable risk profiles that efficiently predict congestive heart failure (CHF). The conditional probability of an event can be estimated over a wide range using a logistic function including the variables of age, systolic blood pressure, vital capacity, heart rate, ECG-LVH, X-ray cardiac enlargement, glucose intolerance, and coronary heart disease or valvular deformity. In this way it is possible to identify high-risk candidates for CHF. Some 80% of CHF events occur in persons in the upper quintile of multivariate risk. These persons at high risk yield a high prevalence of persons with echocardiographic evidence of impaired cardiac function likely to benefit from vigorous preventive management including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "238": "Short-acting formulations of nifedipine-like 1,4-dihydropyridines cause clearly less regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than anticipated from their antihypertensive effect. Moreover, these compounds increase the risk of cardiac death and myocardial reinfarction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) not on concomitant beta-blocker therapy. Increased sympathetic activity is one of the non-pressure-related risk factors for LVH and atherosclerosis in hypertensives. In addition, increased sympathetic tone may precipitate clinical events in subclinical or stable CAD. Intermittent increases in sympathetic activity persist during chronic treatment with those 1,4-dihydropyridines that have a poor peak/trough ratio with a rapid fall of BP and deactivation of the arterial baroreflex. On the other hand, these intermittent increases in sympathetic activity do not occur for formulations and compounds with a gradual and sustained antihypertensive effect over the dosing interval. Such long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines cause regression of LVH as anticipated from their antihypertensive effect, and are similar to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast to short-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines, long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines appear not to be detrimental for patients with stable CAD. However, the evidence is still missing for patients with unstable CAD. Neither is there evidence that they will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CAD when used for the chronic treatment of hypertension.", 
    "239": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with losartan, an AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and enalaprilat, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the presynaptic modulation of [3H]-norepinephrine release from isolated atria of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their respective control, the Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The rats received either losartan (5 mg/kg/day) or enalaprilat (1 mg/kg/day) for 12 days by means of osmotic minipumps. The atria were isolated and incubated with [3H]-norepinephrine and the release of radioactivity was used as an index of norepinephrine release. The experimental protocol consisted of two electrical stimulations and the drugs were administered 20 min before the second stimulation. The modulatory action of angiotensin II (0.01 and 1 mumol/L), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, oxymetazoline (1 mumol/L), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 mumol/L) and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol (1 mumol/L) were tested. The results show that losartan or enalaprilat both similarly reduced the blood pressure in SHR. However, only the chronic losartan treatment, and not enalaprilat, abolished the facilitatory effect of exogenously administered angiotensin II on the release of radioactivity. The prejunctional alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptor modulatory mechanisms were not altered by either chronic treatments. Similarly, the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II was blocked by acute administration of losartan but not by enalaprilat. Finally, the facilitatory action of bradykinin on the release of radioactivity was unchanged by chronic enalaprilat treatment. These results confirm the presence of facilitatory AT1 angiotensin II receptors on sympathetic nerve terminals of rat atria. These results also confirm that sympathetic nerve terminal blockade by losartan or the blockade of endogenous angiotensin II formation by enalaprilat are likely to participate in the antihypertensive action of AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "240": "Salt intake, and the sensitivity of blood pressure (BP) to excessive salt intake is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension in some patients. This study was designed to ascertain whether salt sensitivity of BP is a determinant of BP and renal vascular responsiveness to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In 24 patients with essential hypertension, ranging in age from 30 to 68 years, renin status, renal hemodynamics, and sensitivity of BP to steady state changes in salt intake were assessed. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was employed to measure baseline BP and BP response to 4 weeks' treatment with benazepril at 20 or 40 mg/day. Benazepril induced a highly-significant reduction in BP (P < .001) and increase in renal plasma flow (530 +/- 17 to 580 +/- 19 mL/min/1.73 m2; P < .001). Systolic BP fell from 143 +/- 2 to 129 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .001), and diastolic BP fell from 91 +/- 1.6 to 80 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .001). The magnitude of the BP and renal vascular response to ACE inhibition was not influenced by the sensitivity of BP to salt intake. In a multivariate analysis neither body mass index nor age influenced the BP response to ACE inhibition or the relationships between salt intake and a BP response to ACE inhibition. We conclude that the factors that influence sensitivity of BP to salt intake do not influence the systemic or renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition.", 
    "241": "To define the clinical characteristics of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and determine the clinical usefulness of captopril stimulated peripheral renin and postcaptopril renography in blacks at risk for RVH, 79 clinically selected hypertensive blacks were evaluated. Unstimulated (U-PRA), captopril stimulated (S-PRA) peripheral renin, and postcaptopril renography (PC-RENO) were obtained. All subjects underwent conventional renal arteriography. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) was present in 14 of 79 (18%) patients. Renovascular hypertension (RVH) was found in 7 of 79 (9%) patients. S-PRA had a sensitivity and specificity of 38% and 86% respectively to detect RAS; and a sensitivity and a specificity of 17% and 85% respectively to detect RVH. PC-RENO had a sensitivity and a specificity of 64% and 58% respectively to detect RAS; and a sensitivity and a specificity of 67% and 58% respectively to detect RVH. This study suggests that RAS occurs in 18% of clinically selected hypertensive blacks. RVH was present in 9% of this population. Captopril stimulated peripheral renin and postcaptopril renography are not useful as screening tools for the diagnosis of renovascular disease in blacks. Blacks at high risk should be evaluated with angiography.", 
    "242": "Detailed knowledge is becoming available on the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. This paper briefly describes some recent developments on the intrarenal formation and compartmentalization of components of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, renal responses to angiotensin II are reviewed with respect to intraluminal angiotensin II concentrations, and interactions with nitric oxide on the afferent arteriole and the tubuloglomerular feedback system. A main issue is whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can block the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system to the same extent as in other tissues. This is particularly interesting in view of the recently discovered polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene, which accounts for substantial variation in plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. AT1 receptor antagonists are now available for clinical use. Although the AT1 receptor has been reported to mediate most, if not all, of the renal actions of angiotensin II, these compounds differ from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Firstly, AT1 receptor blockers lack the prostaglandin- and kinin-potentiating effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, they increase angiotensin II, which can activate non-AT1 receptors. Finally, the pharmacodynamics of AT1 receptors may evoke different responses from the sympathetic nervous system than those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Currently, it is unclear whether renin inhibitors will have advantages over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists. From the recent research, it is clear that the classical concept of the renin-angiotensin system cannot be pursued, and is being replaced by detailed schemes in which the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system has an important place.", 
    "243": "N-g-nitro-L-arginine increased the mean arterial pressure in intact alert rats against the background of phenoxybenzamine and captopryl, as well as benzohexonium. The findings suggest that systems of short-term blood-pressure control are limited by the sympatho-adrenal vasopressin and renin-angiotensin systems.", 
    "244": "1. We have studied the conversion of big endothelin-1 (big ET-1), big endothelin-2 (big ET-2) and big endothelin-3 (big ET-3) and characterized the enzyme involved in the conversion of the three peptides in guinea-pig lung parenchyma (GPLP). 2. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-2 (ET-2) and endothelin-3 (ET-3) (10 nM to 100 nM) caused similar concentration-dependent contractions of strips of GPLP. 3. Big ET-1 and big ET-2 also elicited concentration-dependent contractions of GPLP strips. In contrast, big ET-3, up to a concentration of 100 nM, failed to induce a contraction of the GPLP. 4. Incubation of strips of GPLP with the dual endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (10 microM), as well as two other NEP inhibitors thiorphan (10 microM) or SQ 28,603 (10 microM) decreased by 43% (P < 0.05), 42% (P < 0.05) and 40% (P < 0.05) the contractions induced by 30 nM of big ET-1 respectively. Captopril (10 microM), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, had no effect on the contractions induced by big ET-1. 5. The incubation of strips of GPLP with phosphoramidon (10 microM), thiorphan (10 microM) or SQ 28,603 (10 microM) also decreased by 74% (P < 0.05), 34% and 50% (P < 0.05) the contractions induced by 30 nM big ET-2 respectively. As for the contractions induced by big ET-1, captopril (10 microM) had no effect on the concentration-dependent contractions induced by big ET-2. 6. Phosphoramidon (10 microM), thiorphan (10 microM) and SQ 28,603 (10 microM) significantly potentiated the contractions of strips of GPLP induced by both ET-1 (30 nM) and ET-3 (30 nM). However, the enzymatic inhibitors did not significantly affect the contractions induced by ET-2 (30 nM) in this tissue. 7. These results suggest that the effects of big ET-1 and big ET-2 result from the conversion to ET-1 and ET-2 by at least one enzyme sensitive to phosphoramidon, thiorphan and SQ 28,603. This enzyme corresponds possibly to EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP 24.11) and could also be responsible for the degradation of ETs in the GPLP.", 
    "245": "Diltiazem (DTZ), a calcium channel blocker, and enalapril (EN), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, are being developed as combination therapy for cardiovascular disease. A toxicokinetic evaluation of EN and DTZ drug levels during a 27-week toxicity study used an enzyme assay to measure EN and an HPLC assay to measure DTZ, deacetylated DTZ (DAD), and desmethyl DTZ (DMD). EN exposure during drug week 7 was proportional to dose and without dispositional gender differences. However, gender differences in DTZ and metabolite plasma profiles were dramatic. For example, female DTZ Cmax values were roughly 15-20% of males; DAD plasma Cmax values were roughly 3- to 10-fold greater; and the desmethyl metabolite, DMD, was roughly 2- to 10-fold lower. Sodium fluoride added to samples taken during drug week 26 to inhibit plasma esterase activity did not alter DTZ plasma profiles, suggesting that gender differences in DTZ and metabolite plasma levels were not caused by sample degradation. Liver esterase activity in treated rats was significantly greater (p > 0.05) than controls, whereas plasma activity was not affected. Female plasma and liver esterase activities were roughly 3- and 5-fold greater than males (p < 0.002), respectively, which may explain the low DTZ and high DAD plasma levels we measured. These results indicate that liver and plasma esterase activity is much greater in female rats and may be responsible for the differences in drug and metabolite plasma profiles relative to males. In addition, chronic coadministration of EN/DTZ may modestly increase liver esterase activity.", 
    "246": "1. The effects of a first dose and of chronic treatment with spirapril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on short-term blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations were assessed by fast Fourier spectral analysis. The effects on systemic haemodynamics in supine and standing position were also studied. We treated 11 patients with 3 mg and 13 patients with 12 mg spirapril for 8 weeks. 2. Overall blood pressure variability was not changed by spirapril. By spectral analysis the changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability in various frequency bands can be assessed, which may be related to changes in activity of the autonomic nervous system. The relative power in the mid-frequency band (0.08-0.12 Hz) of supine systolic pressure was 23 +/- 10% during placebo and decreased during treatment with 12 mg to 11 +/- 4% (P < 0.01 vs placebo, first dose) and to 13 +/- 6% (P < 0.01, chronic treatment). Standing systolic mid-frequency power was 38 +/- 12% during placebo and decreased to 27 +/- 9% (P < 0.01 vs placebo) after the first dose of 12 mg, but it did not decrease after chronic treatment (29 +/- 13%). Treatment with 3 mg induced no changes in mid-frequency blood pressure variability. A decrease in power of the mid-frequency band may point to a decrease in sympathetic vascular drive. The power in the high-frequency band (0.15-0.40 Hz) of heart rate did not change after treatment, suggesting that there is no change in the vagal cardiac drive. 3. Supine blood pressure decreased by a decrease in vascular resistance by 16 +/- 23% (3 mg) and 14 +/- 19% (12 mg) after 8 weeks treatment. Heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output did not change. No orthostatic hypotension occurred after the first dose. In the 12 mg group the orthostatic induced rise in heart rate (compared with supine) increased from + 9 +/- 5 beats min-1 (placebo) to + 14 +/- 4 beats min-1 (P < 0.05) after the first dose. No changes in the orthostatic heart rate increase occurred in the 3 mg group. The orthostatic changes in stroke volume, cardiac output and vascular resistance were not influenced by spirapril. 4. In conclusion, the decrease in mid-frequency blood pressure variability may suggest an inhibitory effect of acute and chronic ACE inhibition upon sympathetic vasomotor control. Vagal activity was not influenced as high-frequency heart rate variability did not change. Acute and chronic ACE inhibition did not blunt important cardiovascular reflexes, as the haemodynamic response to orthostasis remained intact.",

It is possible that this peptide directly affects BAECs, protecting them from activated leukocytes.", 
    "248": "Sufficient radiation will cause kidney injury with hypertension, azotemia, and death from renal failure. There is early endothelial injury after radiation, which could lead to a deficit of constitutive nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, with capillary thrombosis and hypertension, both of which are seen in radiation nephropathy. In a rat radiation nephropathy model, the serial evolution of urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a marker of kidney NO, was studied and a deficit in urinary cGMP was found. This radiation-induced cGMP deficit was prevented by high-dose Captopril treatment. Low-dose Captopril treatment protected against radiation nephropathy without preventing the decrease in urinary cGMP. An inhibitor of NO synthesis, L-N-arginine-methylester, did not blunt the beneficial effect of Captopril treatment. We conclude that there is a deficit in urinary cGMP in radiation nephropathy, but that prevention of this deficit is not essential in the prevention of radiation nephropathy by Captopril.", 
    "249": "The main objective of the Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Treatment of Hypertension (APTH) trial is to test the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment based on ambulatory monitoring may be more beneficial than treatment guided by conventional sphygmomanometry. After a 2-month run-in period on single-blind placebo, hypertensive patients were randomized to two groups, one in which the target pressure was a sitting diastolic pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg on conventional sphygmomanometry (conventional blood pressure [CBP] group), and one in which a daytime (from 10 to 20 h) diastolic pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg had to be achieved (ambulatory blood pressure [ABP] group). After randomization all patients were started on lisinopril 10 mg/day. One month later lisinopril could be continued at 10 or 20 mg/day or discontinued depending on the attained blood pressure level. This article is an interim report on 207 patients followed for two months into the trial. At one month lisinopril was discontinued more frequently in the ABP than the CBP group (24 vs 9 patients, p = 0.004). Nevertheless at two months, blood pressure control was not significantly different in the two treatment groups. The baseline-adjusted differences in systolic pressure between the two treatment arms of the trial (ABP-CBP group) were +2.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]): -2.9, +8.3) for the conventional pressure, +0.4 mm Hg (CI: -4.3, +5.1) for the 24 h pressure, -0.1 mm Hg (CI: -5.1, +4.8) for the daytime pressure and -0.7 mm Hg (CI: -6.7, +5.4) for the night-time pressure. The corresponding differences in diastolic pressure were -1.3 mm Hg (CI: -4, +1.4), +0.1 mm Hg (CI: -3, +3.1), -1.1 mmgH (CI: -4.4, +2.1) and +0.3 mm Hg (CI: -3.7, +4.3), respectively. Thus, the present findings do not refute the APTH research hypothesis. In terms of blood pressure control and the number of patients remaining on antihypertensive drugs, treatment based on ambulatory recordings may be preferable to treatment guided by conventional sphygmomanometry.", 
    "250": "Nitric oxide (NO), derived from the vascular endothelium or other cells of the cardiovascular system, has an important role in physiological regulation of blood flow and has pathophysiological functions in cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NO and biological actions of NO, including vasodilatation, cytotoxicity and inflammation, are briefly reviewed. These reactions involving NO cause pathological disturbances of arterial function, coronary blood flow regulation, and may contribute to cardiac myocyte dysfunction. NO and prostacyclin (PGI2), which is also released from the endothelium, act synergistically to inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion, and in some arteries these mediators also synergise in terms of vasodilatation. In addition, NO is capable of hyperpolarizing vascular smooth muscle, but activation of the endothelium may cause hyperpolarization and may thus promote vasodilatation by an additional mechanism. After myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, production of NO and superoxide radicals represent important mechanisms of cytotoxicity, causing injury to the coronary endothelium and myocytes and compromising ventricular contractile function. Moreover, upon reperfusion endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is impaired and the coronary arteries constrict, leading to irregular myocardial perfusion. This is a consequence of the accumulation of activated leucocytes that we found to generate endogenous inhibitors of NO. These factors have yet to be fully characterised, but clearly they may have a role in irregularities of myocardial reperfusion and cellular injury. Chronic heart failure is associated both with impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and with excess production of NO via the inducible NO synthase (iNOS), although it is unclear whether the latter assists or compromises ventricular contractile performance under these conditions. Disturbances in the activity of isoforms of NO synthase in the artery wall also accompany the development of atherosclerosis, providing conditions propitious for vasospasm and thrombosis, and perhaps contributing to cell proliferation. Reversing these NO defects with therapeutic agents including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors offers promise in protecting against some manifestations of vascular disease.",

The decrease in blood pressure was not related to baseline ACE activity, serum sodium or serum creatinine concentration.",

    "260": "The intestinal oligopeptide transporter (OPT) mediates the absorption of di-/tripeptides, beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and renin inhibitors. This suggests that the targeting of molecules to this transporter could result in orally-absorbed drugs. Results from a recent study with renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) suggested that an alpha-NH2 group is required for interaction with the renal OPT. In general, structural requirements for interaction with the renal and intestinal OPT are similar. However, these recent findings do not agree with earlier studies, which showed that an alpha-NH2 group is not essential for interaction with the intestinal OPT. Thus, it appears that the renal and intestinal OPT may differ in their recognition of compounds containing an alpha-NH2 group. In this study, molecular modeling was used to determine the tridimensional structures of various cephalosporins for which Ki values had been determined using renal BBMV. All cephalosporins which interact with the OPT have two, energetically equivalent, conformations. Most compounds which do not interact with the OPT cannot adopt the two conformations. A key factor which influences the conformation seems to be the substituent group at the alpha position; an electron drawing group at that position alters the common conformations. For the OPT substrates, the distances between the -NH2 and -COOH groups are comparable to those of the tripeptide, GlyGlyGly; and the distances between -NH2 and carbonyl group in the beta-lactam ring are close to the distance between N-terminal and C-terminal in the dipeptide, GlyGly. The corresponding distances in cephamycin C (in which a -NH2 group is located in a different position) and the tetrapeptide, GlyGlyGlyGly, are longer than those in alpha-NH2 cephalosporins and GlyGlyGly. Cephamycin C and the tetrapeptide have low affinity for the renal OPT, suggesting that the distances between functional groups are critical for affinity. The alpha-NH2 group had no effect on the conformations of the molecules. We concluded that the alpha-NH2 group may interact directly with the renal oligopeptide transporter. Whether this is unique to the renal transporter or could be applied to the intestinal transporter will require further investigation.",

The difference in RIs (delta RI), the smaller RI (SRI), the difference in lengths (delta L), and the shorter length (SL) of the patient's two kidneys were determined. The accuracy of each of these parameters was calculated using captopril renography (n = 39) and arteriography (n = 9) as the gold standards.", 
    "263": "There was a significant difference in the delta RI (P < .05), SRI (p < .001), and delta L (p < .05) in patients with a positive captopril renogram for a significant RAS. Captopril increased delta RI (p = .052) in patients with a positive captopril renogram (n = 6). Use of an SRI threshold of less than .55 resulted in ultrasound being as accurate as captopril renography in predicting an angiographically documented stenosis of greater than or equal to 50%.", 
    "264": "The RI and renal length are useful in detecting a significant RAS. In this preliminary study, captopril was shown to increase delta RI in patients with a significant RAS, but larger prospective studies are necessary to further assess the value of captopril sonography in detecting a significant RAS.", 
    "265": "We examined the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of hypertension of the rat with congenital hydronephrosis having no urinary tract obstruction. The congenital hydronephrosis rat (HNR) had a significantly higher systolic blood pressure (181 +/- 9.5 mm Hg in the male bilateral hydronephrosis rat, BHN, at 13 weeks of age, n = 10) than control Wistar-Imamichi rats (126 +/- 5.8 mm Hg). The plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin-II concentration of BHN were decreased to 20.1 and 24.6% of those of control rats, respectively. There was a negative correlation between plasma angiotensin-II concentration and blood pressure. In addition, the effect of captopril and indomethacin on the high blood pressure of BHNs was similar to that of human low-renin essential hypertension. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system activity was markedly lowered and that the involvement of the system in the maintenance of hypertension in HNRs is small.", 
    "266": "The mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in experimental nephropathies is not yet clear. Experimental evidence is available that the effect of ACE inhibitors on the glomerular function depends on the inhibition of angiotensin II generation, but it is possible that inhibition of the bradykinin breakdown also plays a relevant role. To establish the mediators of the effects of ACE inhibitors in glomerular injury, we compared the effects of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with those of a specific angiotensin receptor (AT1) antagonist (ZD7155) on the renal function in male MWF/Ztm rats. After 4 months (end of the study), the untreated animals developed hypertension and proteinuria (160 +/- 10 mm Hg and 214 +/- 92 mg/24 h, respectively). In the lisinopril- and in the ZD7155-treated rats, a comparable systolic pressure control was achieved (121 +/- 12 and 118 +/- 14 mm Hg, respectively), and proteinuria was significantly prevented (averaging only 38 +/- 23 and 30 +/- 8 mg/24h, respectively) at the end of the study. The glomerular filtration rate was comparable in control and lisinopril-treated rats and significantly increased in ZD7155-treated rats. Both treatments significantly reduced the glomerular capillary pressure and significantly increased the ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) as compared with untreated animals. In ZD7155-treated rats the Kf was also significantly higher than in untreated animals glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitital damage developed. Structural changes were absent in lisinopril- and ZD7155-treated animals. These results show that the antihypertensive and renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors are shared by the angiotensin receptor antagonist. Thus, angiotensin II is the likely mediator of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis which develop spontaneously with age in this model.", 
    "267": "When there is no correctable cause, cardiac failure continues to progress and outcome is poor. However several controlled clinical trials have shown that several therapeutic agents relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and, for some, reduce mortality. Patients in NYHA functional class II, III and IV, whose systolic function is impaired should be treated by digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. These therapeutic agents are complementary and each of them are required. Moreover a study has shown that the impairment of patients in NYHA functional class I (who are still asymptomatic but with a ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) could be slowed by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. In each case, it is of paramount importance to exclude treatable causes of heart failure because the best the symptomatic treatment can do is slow the inevitable worsening of the disease.", 
    "268": "Endothelin (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid, vasoconstrictive peptide originally isolated from endothelial cells. It is one member of a class of potent, purportedly paracrine substances that act at receptors in multiple target organs. Antagonists to the receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, have been designed around the hydrophobic carboxy-terminus of ET-1. The resulting hexapeptides possess low nanomolar receptor affinity, but face formidable challenges to oral delivery, given their peptidic nature. Hence, it was important to discriminate between analogs, as well as to optimize structural features combining binding potency with stability in intestinal fluids and permeability across biological membranes. PD 142893 (Ac-DDip16-Leu-Asp-Ile-Trp21) and PD 145065 (Ac-DBhg16-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp21), as well as the N-methyl-isoleucine20 analogs were studies, where DDip = 3,3diphenylalanine and DBhg = 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene glycine. Analyses were conducted with specific HPLC methods. Permeabilities across CACO-2 cell monolayers ranged from 2.0x10(-4) to 6.3x10(-4)cm/min. The results suggested that these compounds can be absorbed in vivo, based on comparison of permeabilities with those obtained with reference compounds. Much greater differences were observed between the analogs when stability half-lives were compared after incubation in rat intestinal perfusate. The parent peptides, PD 142893 and PD 145065, were unstable, with half-lives less than 20 min. N-Methylation of Ile20 resulted in large increases in stability half-lives to greater 500 min. Enzyme inhibition studies demonstrated the involvement of carboxypeptidase A in production of the primary metabolite, the des-Trp derivative. Identification of the primary metabolite of the parent peptide was made by differential UV scanning at 214/280 nm and mass spectral analyses.", 
    "269": "Experimental studies have indicated that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have multiple actions on the kidney and blood vessels which include both haemodynamic and antitrophic effects. Inhibition of angiotensin II and potentiation of bradykinin have both been postulated to be major mechanisms in mediating the effects of ACE inhibitors. Clinical studies have indicated that these agents postpone end-stage renal failure in macroproteinuric patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Indeed, these drugs are useful in both hypertensive and normotensive diabetic patients with macroproteinuria. In IDDM patients with microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease albuminuria and to retard the development of overt renal disease. The role of these agents in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and early or overt renal disease remains to be clearly delineated. However, preliminary studies suggest a similar beneficial renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in NIDDM. It should be appreciated that the presence of micro- or macroproteinuria in NIDDM is a predictor of cardiovascular rather than renal morbidity and mortality. The possibility of cardiovascular protection, in addition to renal protection, being conferred by these drugs needs to be considered in both IDDM and NIDDM, although this issue has not been evaluated in detail.", 
    "270": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of antihypertensive and vasodilatatory agents of first choice in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart failure, post-anterior myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of microangiopathy will also benefit from continuous ACE inhibition. The long term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with remarkable preservation of vital organ perfusion and infrequent adverse effects. Used as monotherapy, the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, there are advantages for using them in combination with other drugs, notably thiazide diuretics, nitrates and calcium antagonists. Renal function is thus preserved and left heart hypertrophy is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors, and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.", 
    "271": "Prolonged angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been consistently demonstrated to increase life expectancy in symptomatic patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and decrease morbidity in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. However, prolonged ACE inhibition has not been shown to consistently improve the quality of life of patients with symptomatic CHF. The failure of ACE inhibition to improve quality of life cannot be readily explained, but several factors may contribute to this apparent lack of effect. First, endpoints such as death or hospitalisation are clearly easier to quantify and monitor than a patient's perception of how much CHF affects his/her life. Secondly, while ACE inhibition delays the progression of LV systolic dysfunction, which is the primary determinant of prognosis, it may not reverse the alterations in skeletal muscle vasculature, metabolism and mass, which are primarily responsible for exercise intolerance in patients with CHF. Lastly, patients with CHF, and particularly older patients, are also often incapacitated by other disease processes such as arthritis, loss of balance, pulmonary disorders and anaemia, which, to a large extent, affect the quality of their life more than LV systolic dysfunction and/or CHF.", 
    "272": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. LVH is associated with coronary events, and there is an association between cerebrovascular disease and increased left ventricular mass (LVM). Experimental studies have elucidated the importance of non-myocytic cells inducing increased perivascular and interstitial fibrosis along with thickening of the media of intramyocardial coronary arteries in hypertensive LVH. M-mode echocardiography is the most accepted standard for the diagnosis and quantification of LVH, but some controversies exist regarding the ideal methodology for serial assessment of LVM. It is still a matter of debate whether 2-dimensional echo measurements represent a more accurate method. Hopefully, both the introduction of 3-dimensional echo and new Doppler techniques can provide more accurate measurements of LVM and additional information on changes in myocardial fibrosis and stiffness. Experimental studies have shown that normalization of hypertensive myocardial and coronary artery remodelling take place with drugs like angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and calcium antagonists. Two meta-analyses suggest that ACE-inhibitors may be the most efficient drugs in reducing LVM, but a clinical correlate to this assumption is at present not available. There are some indications that regression or progression of LVH assessed by ECG and echocardiography may in fact be related to the incidence of cardiovascular events. But large-scale controlled studies of various treatment regimens are still needed to establish whether drug induced regression can improve the prognosis of hypertensive LVH independent of the antihypertensive effect.",

Diastolic BP after 5 months in the maintenance period was similar on C and E, respectively. For most items, QL was not affected by the treatments.

    "277": "Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that is important in the control of systemic blood pressure. All the hemodynamic effects of angiotensin II result from the AT1 receptor which has the structural features of a seven transmembrane receptor. Both in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells and rat glomerular mesangial cells, angiotensin II stimulates the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block this phosphorylation also block the angiotensin II-mediated production of 1,4,5 inositol trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) and the intracellular release of Ca2+. The cellular tyrosine kinase c-src appears to play a critical role in the angiotensin II-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 and the generation of 1,4,5-IP3. We have also found that angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the JAK family of intracellular kinases. This in turn activates the STAT family of transcription factors. Angiotensin II, working through the AT1 receptor, uses tyrosine phosphorylation as a mechanism to convey signals from the cell surface to the cell nucleus.", 
    "278": "Hematocrit increase with recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) has been associated with increased progression of renal insufficiency in experimental models of renal mass reduction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of therapy with rEPO and various antihypertensives on the progression of chronic renal insufficiency and on arterial hypertension in an experimental model of renal mass reduction. Rats subjected to a two-thirds nephrectomy were randomly assigned to an untreated control group or to therapy with rEPO (subcutaneously, at an initial dose of 40 U/kg thrice weekly), rEPO plus verapamil (subcutaneously, 0.5 mg/kg/day), or rEPO plus enalapril (orally, 50 mg/l in the drinking water). Combining enalapril and rEPO therapy controlled systemic blood pressure (BP) and the increase in proteinuria. Glomerular injury, as assessed 16 weeks after renal ablation, was more marked in the animals treated with rEPO with or without either antihypertensive. The morphometric analyses showed greater glomerular tuft areas in the three groups receiving rEPO than in the controls. The glomerular tuft area was directly correlated with the rate of glomerulosclerosis. In about 11% of the rEPO-treated hypertensive rats, the lesions showed severe hypertensive vasculopathy; in the animals treated with rEPO plus enalapril, the lesions were less severe. We conclude that therapy with rEPO was associated to renal damage which could not be attenuated by enalapril despite controlling BP and proteinuria, and may have a nonhemodynamic cause. Therapy with rEPO might trigger lesions usually associated with severe arterial hypertension; concomitant therapy with enalapril attenuates hypertensive vasculopathy.",

Good response was noted in corinfar-retard combination with Cordanum in patients with moderate hemodynamic changes, hypertonicity of sympathoadrenal system, tachycardia. In patients with impaired myocardial contractility, elevated total peripheral vascular resistance, noticeable hypotensive effects was registered in combination with triampur.

    "292": "Several observations question the role of blood pressure and renal hemodynamic changes in the long-term antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition. To differentiate blood pressure and renal effects in the initial antiproteinuric response, the placebo-controlled acute effects of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (10 mg i.v.) on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and proteinuria were compared with those of nitroprusside in nine patient with non-diabetic proteinuria. In addition, we studied whether an exogenous angiotensin II infusion reverse the initial enalaprilat-induced antiproteinuric response. Enalaprilat and nitroprusside reduced MAP by -11.3 +/- 2.4% and -14.1 +/- 2.3%, respectively, whereas only enalaprilat showed renal hemodynamic effects, reflected by an increase in ERPF of 18.4 +/- 5.4% and a decrease in FF of -17.1 +/- 2.6%. Despite the contrasting renal hemodynamic profiles, enalaprilat (-10.6 +/- 4.8%) and nitroprusside (-12.8 +/- 5.1% equally decreased proteinuria. Exogenous infusion of angiotensin II completely reversed the blood pressure reduction and renal efferent vasodilatation induced by enalaprilat. proteinuria also increased by 13.1 +/- 7.8% to placebo level, albeit statistically non-significant. We conclude that the initial antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition appears to be mediated by blood pressure reduction and does not require its specific renal hemodynamic effect. Further studies should clarify whether the renal efferent vasodilatation during ACE inhibition is required to gradually induce renal structural changes that prevent the abundant passage of proteins.", 
    "293": "Loin pain-hematuria (LPH) syndrome is a poorly understood disorder in which the patients, mainly young women, experience unexplained severe chronic unilateral or bilateral flank pain associated with gross and/or microscopic hematuria. By contrast, thin glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is generally thought to be a benign disorder, affecting males and females equally, in which the major manifestation is asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Herein we describe seven patients (6 females, 1 male) in whom thin GBM appeared to be the cause of the LPH syndrome. The gross hematuria in these patients could be attributed to thin GBM disease because the renal biopsy demonstrated red cells in renal tubules (indicating glomerular hematuria) and the only glomerular abnormality present with thin GBM. In addition, the other causes of gross hematuria were excluded by appropriate testing. The flank pain in these patients might also have been the result of their thin GBM disease. This is suggested by renal biopsy findings of multiple renal tubules filled with red cells, apparently occluding the tubules. We suggest that occlusion of a relatively small fraction of renal tubules could cause renal pain if back-leak of glomerular filtrate occurred that was of sufficient magnitude to expand renal parenchymal volume and stretch the renal capsule. Preliminary observations suggest that treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril importantly reduces the frequency and severity of the episodes of gross hematuria and flank pain in most patients. ACE inhibition might decrease glomerular hemorrhage in patients with think GBM by decreasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We conclude that (1) Thin GBM disease can be the cause of gross hematuria, apparently as a result of rupture of thin GBM. (2) Rupture of thin GBM resulting in hemorrhage into renal tubules may be the cause of the flank pain and gross hematuria in some patients with the LPH syndrome.",

Rats had stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN and into the left lateral ventricle. Bilateral LPBN pretreatment with the serotonergic 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide (4 micrograms/200 nl each site) increased 0.3 M NaCl and water intakes induced by intracerebroventricular ANG II (50 ng/microliter) and 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap. Pretreatment with bilateral LPBN injections of a serotonergic 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist DOI (5 micrograms/200 nl) significantly reduced 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap. Pretreatment with methysergide or DOI into the LPBN produced no significant changes in the water intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap.

    "295": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury. A role for nitric oxide (NO) has been suggested in this effect. Because recent data suggest that NO may modulate some features of endothelial cells and because endothelial cells are involved in the control of intimal hyperplasia, we investigated the role of NO synthesis in the effect of an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, on neoendothelial dysfunction and intimal hyperplasia in a rabbit model of unilateral iliac balloon injury. New Zealand White male rabbits received placebo, perindopril, or cotreatment with perindopril and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and were evaluated 4 wk after the injury. Fifteen rabbits (5 in each group) were used to assess in vitro vasoreactivity and twenty-four (8 in each group) for morphometric analysis. In injured vessels, neoendothelium-dependent relaxation in ACE inhibitor-treated animals was improved compared with placebo (P < 0.05) and restored to the level of noninjured vessels (NS). The improvement observed with ACE inhibitor was abolished by cotreatment with L-NAME (P < 0.05). In the same vessels, no effect was observed on neoendothelium-independent vasoreactivity. The improved neoendothelial dysfunction with ACE inhibitor was associated with a 66% reduction in intimal thickening (P < 0.01). The effect was also reversed by cotreatment with L-NAME (P < 0.01). In noninjured vessels, treatment did not alter vasoreactivity or morphology of the vessel wall. These results suggest that NO synthesis may play a key role in the improvement of vascular function seen with ACE inhibitor in balloon-injured vessels.",

In this study, we examined the effects of early monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibor, enalapril, and the beta-blocker, metoprolol, on SM fiber type composition in 18 dogs with moderate HF produced by intracoronary microembolizations. HF dogs were randomized to 3 mo therapy with enalapril (10 mg twice daily), metoprolol (25 mg twice daily), or no treatment. Triceps muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, before randomization, and at the end of 30 mo of therapy. Type I and type II SM fibers were differentiated by myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (pH 9.4). In untreated dogs, the proportion of type I fibers was 27 +/- 1% before randomization and decreased to 23 +/- 1% (P < 0.05) at the end of 3 mo of follow up. In dogs treated with enalapril or metoprolol, the proportion of type I fibers was 30 +/- 4 and 28 +/- 2% before randomization and 33 +/- 4 and 33 +/- 1%, respectively, after 3 mo of therapy. In conclusion, in dogs with moderate HF, early therapy with enalapril or metoprolol prevents the progressive decline in the proportion of type I SM fibers.", 
    "297": "Many hormonal treatments have been tried in idiopathic oligospermia because of the physiologic roles of the hormones FSH and testosterone in regulation of spermatogenesis, the possibility of increasing spermatogenesis in normal monkeys by increasing their serum FSH up to supraphysiologic levels, and of several hormone abnormalities reported in this condition (abnormal pulsatile release of LH and thus probably of LHRH, abnormal bioactivity of FSH, compensated hyperestrogenism). None of these treatments proved to be effective until now, though a modest beneficial effect cannot be totally excluded for some of them, because of the poor discriminating power of most of the trials. Many methodological difficulties do indeed hamper the objective assessment of male infertility treatments. Pulsatile administration of LHRH, human menopausal gonadotropins, androgens, bromocriptine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are definitely uneffective or without practical interest. A beneficial effect of the anti-estrogens clomifene and tamoxifene cannot be excluded. It would be modest, increasing the annual pregnancy rate from 18 to 30%, only in case of normogonadotropic oligospermia. The possibility of increasing the vitro fertilization success rate by treating the oligospermic males with purified FSH needs confirmation. Whatever the benefit, it would not reach the success rate of intracytoplasmic injection of spermatozoa.", 
    "298": "To test if calcium antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors can act similarly on urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with hypertension, a 24 week, double-blind, randomized, parallel multicentre study was performed in 111 such patients allocated to nicardipine 50 mg slow release form (n = 57) or to captopril 25 mg (n = 54) twice daily. The efficacy of both drugs was similar on urinary albumin excretion (Westlake test p = 0.19). However, blood pressure was lower on nicardipine than on captopril (p < 0.05), and the antialbuminuric effect of nicardipine was related to its hypotensive effect, while this was not the case for captopril. The two drugs were tolerated equally. Thus, nicardipine and captopril for 24 weeks can be equally effective on urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with hypertension, but the mechanisms of their anti-albuminuric effects may be different.",

Two hundred and forty four hypertensive patients not controlled (DPB > 95 mmHg) by a single dose of enalapril 20 mg/24 h, received for 4 weeks, one of these two combined therapies in a randomized double-blind trial. The efficacy was of same amplitude in the two groups (DBP: -10.8 mmHg enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide vs-10.3 mmHg enalapril-nifedipine). The side effects were less frequent in the enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide group (14 per cent vs 24 per cent, p = 0.04).", 
    "300": "The aim of this study was to analyse the respective values of clinic and ambulatory blood pressure measurements in patients with treated hypertension. Twenty-eight patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied (clinic blood pressure > or = 160/95 mmHg), treated with benazepril alone (n = 7) or combined with hydrochlorothiazide (n = 21). A 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurement was performed before (d0) and after 8 weeks of treatment (d56). The treatment was effective on the ambulatory blood pressure in 19 patients (Staessen criteria) and effective on clinic measurements in 20 patients (WHO criteria). The results were concordant in 25 of the 28 patients. The decrease of the ambulatory blood pressure values during the day between d0 and d56 was not significantly related to the decrease of the clinic values. The comparison of the ambulatory blood pressure values at each hour between d0 and d56 showed that the treatment was effective during 24 h. The 'white coat' effect has been evaluated at d0 and d56 by the difference between mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure and clinic values. Clinic values were higher than mean daytime ambulatory values in benazepril (14 +/- 12 mmHg and 7 +/- 7 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic pressure) and benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (12 +/- 12 mmHg and 0.2 +/- 9 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic pressure). This 'white coat' effect was not modified during the treatment. Previous studies have emphasized a better assessment of the cardiovascular risk with ambulatory than with clinic measurements. The differences in the assessment of the efficiency of the treatment between clinic and ambulatory measurements shown in our study prompt us to use ambulatory measurements in patients with apparently uncontrolled hypertension.",

Numerous discrepancies were found between the two methods of blood pressure measurement with respect to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as pulse pressure (PP). Clinic blood pressure measurement did not show any significant differences between the effects of ACEI and those of CA, whereas ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) showed that in patients with normal ambulatory blood pressure (so-called 'white coat' hypertensive patients), ACEI only (but not CA) significantly lowered SBP, DBP and PP. Accordingly, a threshold of efficacy was sought: it appeared to be lower for ACEI than for CA (120/80 vs 140/85 mmHg). Furthermore, for a given degree of DBP lowering, SBP and PP were more lowered by ACEI than by CA, indicating a greater effect of ACEI on arterial compliance. Likewise, for a given level of mean blood pressure, SBP and PP were lower and DBP slightly higher in patients on ACEI than in those on CA. Our data are consistent with some recent papers, emphasizing a heightened activity of the renin-angiotensin system in 'white coat' hypertensive patients.",

Current therapy for CHF can maintain function, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and digoxin remain in standards of therapy. Diuretics remains an important component of the symptomatic management of patients with CHF, but severely II patients may require additional agents. One option frequently used in patients who exhibit resistance to loop diuretics is infusion of low-dose dopamine. Combination diuretics may effectively increase urine output, with the addition of thiazide or spironolactone. Documentation of the clinical benefit of ACE inhibitors represents the most important advance in therapeutics for CHF in the last decade. ACE inhibitors improves left ventricular function, and survival and unless contraindicated, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive high dose ACE inhibitor with diuretic if there is peripheral oedema. For patients who cannot take an ACE inhibitor the combination of hydralazine and nitrates may offer some prognostic benefit. Digoxin has been the traditional first drug of choice for CHF, but with protracted controversy about its efficacy and safety. It is hope that new agents as vesnarione, and ibopamine may improve contractility without having adverse consequences. Acceptance of beta-blockade as a potentially beneficial therapeutic intervention increase in the past year. This year, improved diastolic function and afterload reduction were reported with beta-blockade. Amiodarone unlike other antiarrhythmic drugs does not seem depress left ventricular function, and may be the best drug in patients with CHF and symptomatic arrhythmias. The correct role of anticoagulation in patients with CHF remains controversial. Although the benefits of anticoagulation for the treatment of most patients with atrial fibrillation are increasingly accepted, it has not been shown to improve outcome in patients with CHF in normal sinus rhythm.",

Reduced kinin-kallikrein generation in hypertensive subjects may also be associated with genetic and environmental defects. 4.

    "308": "Overt congestive heart failure (CHF) has a prevalence of 1% of the population. The predominant symptoms of patients with CHF are fatigue and dyspnoea. Fatigue is thought to result from changes in peripheral muscle metabolism secondary to decrease vasodilative capacity and physical inactivity. An increase of peripheral perfusion by vasodilator therapy and physical activity are therefore recommended. Beside overt decompensation, where dyspnoea results from acute pulmonary congestion due to backward failure, increased physiological dead space ventilation caused by pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch accounts, to a large degree, for dyspnoea, and can be improved by vasodilator therapy. According to the pathophysiology of CHF, normalisation of loading conditions and myocardial inotropy are the parameters addressed by various pharmacological agents in order to alleviate symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Diuretics are rapidly acting and effective agents to improve congestion and decrease filling pressures. Digitalis improves haemodynamics and symptomatology by increasing inotropy and slowing resting heart rate in atrial fibrillation; however, prognostic effects have yet to be proved. The introduction of vasodilators has significantly improved the prognosis of the disease, and the administration of ACE inhibitors in particular has been shown to slow progression of CHF. This results in a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. The present article appraises the role of the currently used drugs in the treatment of CHF, considering effects on pathophysiology and clinical outcome and provides an approach to a differential drug regimen.", 
    "309": "Renin inhibitors may offer an exciting new therapeutic means of blocking the action of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These compounds interfere with the first, rate-limiting step in the synthesis of angiotensin II by binding directly to the highly specific enzyme, renin. This approach may represent a more focused alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy with an improved side-effect profile. Renin inhibitors given parenterally safely lower blood pressure in patients with essential heart failure. Under conditions of salt limitation, normal subjects show increases in renal plasma flow during infusion of renin inhibitors. The systemic and renal hemodynamic responses to renin inhibition are accompanied by suppression of plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone levels. Recent scientific advances in discovering how to address the limitations of the low oral bioavailability of peptide-based compounds have made it possible to invent orally active renin inhibitors. Orally active renin inhibitors are presently being evaluated in clinical trials. The availability of intravenous and oral delivery of renin inhibitors broadens the potential of these agents to treat a wide variety of acute and chronic cardiorenal disorders.",

Plasma was sampled for assay of the active metabolite, cilazaprilat, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, angiotensin I (AI) and ACE-activity. Plasma concentrations of the active drug were measured by radioimmunoassay. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at regular intervals.",

However, the weight-adjusted plasma clearance was significantly higher in the Chinese group, which is compatible with their lower body weight. The effects on plasma hormones were also comparable, although there was a somewhat greater rise in PRA and greater fall in aldosterone levels in Chinese than in Caucasians. The effect of cilazapril on blood pressure and heart rate was greater than was previously reported in healthy volunteers. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were significantly reduced in both groups, but there was a more prolonged reduction in DBP in Caucasians. In addition, heart rate (HR) was significantly increased from baseline from 5 h onwards in Chinese subjects and significantly higher in comparison with Caucasians at most time points from 1.5 h onwards. The pharmacokinetic parameters of cilazapril were essentially the same in healthy, normotensive Chinese and Caucasians. Cilazapril reduced blood pressure acutely in both groups, with good tolerance. The inhibition of ACE in relationship to time and the plasma concentrations of cilazaprilat were similar in the two groups, although the changes in PRA and aldosterone suggest an ethnic difference in the responses of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "312": "Acetazolamide (ACTZ), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, causes a fall in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration (GFR). It is generally believed that the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism is responsible. This study examined whether, in patients with diabetes mellitus, the renal hemodynamic response to ACTZ is intact and whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, which would be expected to block TGF, attenuates this response to ACTZ. Six men with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus lived in a clinical research center for 8 weeks and received enalapril 5-15 mg/day from the third through sixth week. At 2, 6 and 8 weeks p-aminohippurate (PAH) and inulin clearances were performed over eleven 30-min periods. ACTZ (150 mg) was given intravenously after 180 min. In both the pre- and postenalapril studies, PAH clearance fell after ACTZ administration (-60 +/- 15 and -66 +/- 20 ml/min/l1.73 m2, respectively, p < 0.05 for each study). In contrast, with enalapril treatment PAH clearance after ACTZ tended to rise (29 +/- 12 ml/ min/1.73 m2, p = 0.07). GFR after ACTZ fell during the pre- and postenalapril studies (-19 +/- 3 and -13 +/- 1 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p < 0.05 for each study) but not with enalapril treatment (-6 +/- 3 ml/min/1.73 m2). After ACTZ was administered, estimated renal vascular resistance rose during both the pre- and postenalapril studies (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) and fell with enalapril treatment (p < 0.05). These data indicate that enalapril alters the renal hemodynamic effects of ACTZ in patients with diabetes mellitus, possibly by inhibiting tubuloglomerular feedback.", 
    "313": "The effects of a single oral dose (6 mg) of the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor, spirapril, on systemic, pulmonary and regional (brachial, renal, hepato-splanchnic) hemodynamics as well as on biological parameters investigating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems were studied over a 24-hour period in eight patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). As compared to pretreatment values, spirapril significantly decreased mean arterial (-19%, peak effect), right atrial (-42%), mean pulmonary arterial (-38%) and pulmonary capillary wedge (-46%) pressures. Spirapril significantly decreased heart rate (-14%) and increased stroke volume index (+43%) thus resulting in a slight increase in cardiac index. All these effects were maximal between 2.5 and 4 h. Brachial artery diameter (+12%) and brachial (+41%) and renal (+36%) blood flows increased significantly whereas brachial (-41%) and renal (-36%) vascular resistances decreased significantly. All these effects were usually maximal between 1 and 2.5 h. Hepato-splanchnic hemodynamics were not drug-affected. Spirapril significantly inhibited plasma converting enzyme activity (-96% at 4 h), increased plasma renin activity (+505% at 4 h), and decreased plasma aldosterone (-46% at 24 h), norepinephrine (-31% at 24 h) and atrial natriuretic factor (-33% at 7 h). Thus, in severe CHF, acute administration of spirapril, 6 mg orally, exerts both arterial and venous vasodilating properties and improves both the systemic and regional hemodynamics and the biological status of the patients.",

    "318": "The sustained increase in peripheral vascular resistance is the hemodynamic alteration characteristic of the established adult hypertension. This is the result of a vascular tone increase and/or structural changes which imply hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia of the vascular smooth muscle fibers, hypertrophy of the cardiac cells and an increase in the constituent synthesis of the extracellular matrix. Angiotensin II and noradrenalin exert major trophic effects which accelerate the progression of cardiovascular hypertrophy being the cardiovascular system very sensitive to the trophic actions of renin-angiotensin. Angiotensin II induces the expression of the A-chain of the growth factor of platelet origin, of the baseline fibroblastic growth factor and of the B-transformer factor and, moreover, stimulates type I and type III collagen synthesis and favors trophic factors release. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in growth regulation and myocyte remodelation and in the cardiovascular extracellular matrix which is mediated through specific receptors, since it can be inhibited by ATI receptor antagonists for angiotensin II and ACE. Cilazapril is an ACE long duration agent which produces a reduction of both blood pressure and cardiovascular hypertrophy. This is a multiple action mechanism exerting a vasodilator action, inhibiting the sympathetic tone or increasing kinine levels and inhibiting the cardiac and vascular renin-angiotensin system.",

The inhibition of LADH activity correlated with Cu(II), H2O2 and CA concentrations. Similar inhibitions were obtained with the assayed CAs and o-diphenols. CAs enhanced HO. radical production by Cu(II)/H2O2, as demonstrated by benzoate hydroxylation and deoxyribose oxidation; LADH counteracted the pro-oxidant effect of CAs by scavenging hydroxyl radicals. Captopril, dihydrolipoamide, dihydrolipoic acid, DL-dithiothreitol, GSSG, trypanothione and histidine effectively preserved LADH from oxidative damage, whereas N-acetylcysteine, N-(2-mercaptopropionylglycine) and lipoamide were less effective protectors. Catalase (though neither bovine serum albumin nor superoxide dismutase) protected LADH against the Cu(II)/H2O2/CAs systems. Denatured catalase protected less than the native enzyme, its action possibly depending on Cu-binding. LADH increased and Captopril inhibited epinephrine oxidation by Cu(II)/H2O2 and Cu(II). The summarized evidence supports the following steps for LADH inactivation: (1) reduction of LADH linked-Cu(II) to Cu(I) by CAs; (2) production of HO. from H2O2 by LADH-linked Cu(I) (Haber-Weiss reaction) and (3) oxidation of aminoacid residues at the enzyme active site by site-specifically generated HO. radicals. Hydrogen peroxide formation from CAs autoxidation may contribute to LADH inactivation.", 
    "320": "The effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on blood pressure and the progression of renal dysfunction were compared in hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Twenty-six patients with PKD and hypertension who had been treated with other antihypertensive agents, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, or alpha-methyldopa, were followed up for two years, during which their blood pressure and renal function were monitored. Patients were divided into two groups classified according to the type of antihypertensive agents given. Group 1 (n = 14) received CCBs, while group 2 (n = 12) received ACE inhibitors. No significant differences were found in their blood pressure control and serum creatinine levels throughout the study. The creatinine clearances were decreased in both groups. However, the decreases in creatinine clearance were smaller (p < 0.05) in the group treated with CCBs. In addition, two patients in group 2 showed rapid increases in serum creatinine. Our data suggest that CCBs reduced blood pressure effectively and preserved renal function in PKD patients at least as well as ACE inhibitors.", 
    "321": "Angiotensin II can raise blood pressure rapidly by inducing direct vasoconstriction and by activating the sympathetic nervous system via central and peripheral mechanisms. In addition, this peptide may act as a growth factor to cause vascular and cardiac hypertrophy (CVH). The structural changes caused by hypertension can therefore be amplified by angiotensin II. Blockade of angiotensin II generation with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appears to be particularly effective in preventing the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy. This beneficial effect might be related to some extent to local accumulation of bradykinin. ACE is one of the enzymes physiologically involved in bradykinin degradation. Treatment of hypertensive rats with a selective bradykinin antagonist can attenuate the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibition and render less effective the prevention of intimal thickening after endothelial removal from the rat carotid artery. Bradykinin is a vasodilator that acts by increasing the release of endothelium-derived factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which may have antiproliferative activity. However, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin II subtype 1-receptor antagonist is also effective in preventing cardiac hypertrophy and neointimal proliferation after endothelial injury. Therefore, the exact contribution of bradykinin to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on cardiovascular hypertrophy remains to be further explored.",

A recent trial of both cilazapril and captopril vs. placebo employed the Sickness Impact Profile and supports the concept that ACE inhibitors have a small (and in this trial nonsignificant) beneficial effect on mobility. Other vasodilators and inotropes may also have small benefits on quality of life, such that comparisons of an ACE inhibitor with vasodilators, as was done in the V-HeFT II trial, fail to reveal any different effects on quality of life.", 
    "323": "A total of 35 patients in sinus rhythm and with mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA II-III) aged 53 (+/- 3) years were examined before therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Of these patients, 16 were reexamined after therapy with ACE inhibitors for 17 +/- 3 days. The relation of hemodynamic alterations to vagal tone was assessed and the influence of parasympathetic (baroreflex activation) tone on survival was evaluated. Only hemodynamic responders to ACE inhibition showed a significant increase of vagal tone from 1.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.2 ms/mm Hg (p < 0.01). The magnitude of increase of vagal tone was dependent on the baseline level. All 35 patients were discharged on ACE inhibitors and were followed for 56 months or longer. We compared patients whose hearts survived (20 patients) with those whose hearts did not (15 patients). Twelve patients died and three underwent cardiac transplantation. The two groups differed (p < 0.05) in terms of mean arterial blood pressure (98 +/- 3 vs. 90 +/- 3 mm Hg), heart rate (82 +/- 2 vs. 93 +/- 4 beats/min), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (24 +/- 3 vs. 35 +/- 2 mm Hg). Cardiac index, stroke volume index, and right atrial pressures were not different. Heart survivors had lower (p < 0.05) renin values (3.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.0 +/- 3.6 Ang-I/ml/h) but norepinephrine values at baseline were not different. Baroreflex sensitivity was lower (p < 0.02) in survivors than in nonsurvivors (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.3 ms/mm Hg). We then calculated the mortality risk in relation to baroreflex sensitivity at the median BS of 1.6 ms/mm Hg. Survival was different (p < 0.004) between the resulting two groups: 2 of 15 subjects (13%) with high baroreflex sensitivity died, and 13 of 20 patients (65%) whose baroreflex sensitivity was less than 1.6 ms/mm Hg died. When systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, stroke volume index, plasma norepinephrine concentrations, and baroreflex sensitivity were entered into a Cox proportional hazards regression, only systolic blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine values predicted survival (p < 0.001). We concluded that high vagal tone is correlated with a good prognosis in patients with CHF. ACE inhibitor therapy can increase the vagal tone significantly. This may alter the incidence of sudden cardiac death and thereby improve prognosis.", 
    "324": "The ideal therapy for patients with chronic heart failure should reduce symptoms related to pulmonary congestion or low perfusion, prevent the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and, ultimately, should reduce mortality. Extensive studies in humans have investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on these goals of therapy. As an example, the ACE inhibitor cilazapril significantly improved exercise tolerance, as borne out by a meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled, randomized 3-month trials. Comparison of the effects of cilazapril and captopril vs. placebo in one of the trials documented similar improvement in exercise tolerance (14 vs. 17%). Results from other randomized comparative trials suggest that the improvement in symptoms represents a class effect of ACE inhibitors. A beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of left ventricular dysfunction has also been demonstrated in the SOLVD trial, and a reduction of mortality has been amply documented in several mortality trials (CONSENSUS I, SOLVD, V-HeFT-II, SAVE, AIRE, SMILE) in patients with or without preceding myocardial infarction. Reports that ACE inhibitors also reduce the incidence of reinfarction after myocardial infarction have not been confirmed in all studies but raise the interesting concept that ACE inhibition may interact, in a beneficial but thus far not well-understood way, with key processes in the development of atherosclerosis, thereby preventing plaque rupture, thrombus formation, and myocardial infarction. Taken together, a large database convincingly demonstrates that ACE inhibitors are effective not only in improving symptoms but also in the prevention of progression of left ventricular dysfunction, in the reduction of mortality, and possibly in stabilizing the atherosclerotic disease process.", 
    "325": "Angiotensin II may contribute to the altered structure and function of small arteries. We proposed that angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment could induce a regression of vascular remodeling. A double-blind trial was performed comparing effects of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril with the beta-blocker atenolol on small arteries obtained from biopsy specimens of subcutaneous gluteal fat. Nine patients with essential hypertension were randomized to cilazapril and eight to atenolol. Blood pressure was below 140/95 mm Hg under treatment for the duration of the study in all patients. Media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries of the patients, which before treatment was significantly higher than in normotensive subjects, was corrected after 1 year of treatment in the cilazapril group. There was no change in the increased media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries in the atenolol group, even after 2 years of treatment. Attenuated constrictor responses to endothelin-1 returned to normal only in the patients treated with cilazapril. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine were slightly depressed in hypertensive patients and improved in the cilazapril-treated group, but remained blunted in the arteries of the atenolol-treated patients. Treatment with cilazapril corrects small artery remodeling and endothelium-related functional abnormalities of gluteal subcutaneous small arteries in hypertensive patients. It remains to be demonstrated whether these apparently beneficial effects translate into reduced morbidity and mortality in hypertension.",

The neurohumoral mechanisms involved in these alterations have the paradoxical role of serving simultaneously as adaptive, compensatory changes and as major contributing elements in the progression of CHF. This review discusses some of the clinical and experimental data that describe the time course of these neurohumoral mechanisms, with an emphasis on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The central role of the RAS in the pathophysiology of heart failure is discussed in relation to its interaction with other neurohumoral systems, its role in the peripheral vascular alterations, and its role in the myocardial alterations in CHF. In addition, these effects are discussed in the context of both the circulating and local RAS and the ability of pharmacologic interventions that modulate the RAS to modify the course of CHF favorably, especially the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. An understanding of the intricate interactions of these neurohumoral mechanisms in CHF has already led to the development of therapies that reduce morbidity and mortality and provides the basis for continuing advances in the treatment of CHF.", 
    "327": "There is growing interest in the evaluation of drugs (prescription only medicines and over-the-counter medicines) as antioxidant prophylactics. Although free radical mechanism in human degenerative diseases is now generally recognised, the mechanisms of tissue injury in humans are very complex and it may not be possible to clearly identify the role played by free radicals in the process. This review examines the current evidence to support the notion that drugs for a particular therapeutic category might possess useful antioxidant capacity hence minimising tissue injury due to free radicals.", 
    "328": "Approximately 15% of end-stage renal disease is attributable to chronic ischemic nephropathy from renovascular disease, representing significant patient morbidity and sizable medical costs. Although the pathophysiology of both ischemic acute renal failure and renovascular hypertension are under intense study, there have been little data obtained on the pathophysiology of chronic ischemic injury to the kidney. Data from studies of renovascular hypertension demonstrate the primary dependence of the stenotic kidney on angiotensin II in maintenance of glomerular filtration rate, although other vascular regulators, such as endothelium-derived nitric oxide and endothelin, may also play a role. Clues to the pathophysiology of cellular injury in chronic ischemic nephropathy can be found in acute models of ischemic injury to the tubules, toxic models of chronic decreased blood flow such as cyclosporine, and from recent pathological studies showing immunologic alterations. Because there are very little data on the cellular mechanisms of chronic ischemic injury to the kidney, this is an important area for laboratory investigation, particularly because the techniques developed both in studies of acute renal ischemia and chronic renovascular hypertension are readily available. Further understanding of the cellular mechanisms of chronic renal ischemia may eventually lead to medical interventions for patients with ischemic nephropathy too ill to undergo major abdominal surgery.", 
    "329": "Ischemic renal disease is defined as a clinically significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate in patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. The most common etiology for this is atherosclerotic renal artery disease. The three major clinical settings in which one must suspect ischemic renal disease include acute renal failure precipitated by the treatment of hypertension particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; progressive azotemia in a patient with known renal vascular hypertension treated medically; and unexplained progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with refractory hypertension and other evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Prevalence of ischemic renal disease secondary to atherosclerosis can be estimated from the incidence of atherosclerotic renal artery lesions leading to renal vascular hypertension and the natural history of these lesions. Autopsy series, arteriography studies, and review of populations of patients in end-stage renal disease programs all suggest that ischemic renal disease has a high and increasing prevalence in our aging population.", 
    "330": "To investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) potentially alleviates hyperdipsia, the effect of cilazapril on dialysis-associated excessive thirst was studied by evaluating various dipsogenic parameters in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) who manifest an excessive interdialysis body weight gain of more than 5%, and show simultaneous severe-to-moderate hyperdipsia. An initial single dose of 1 mg of cilazapril given at the end of the HD session produced a marked improvement in the interdialysis thirst scores and a simultaneous reduction in plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration due to the inhibition of ACE activity. The interdialysis body weight gain in the cilazapril treatment period was significantly smaller than that in the nontreatment period. None of the other parameters including blood pressure, plasma osmolarity, and serum Na and K concentration were different in the treatment vs. the nontreatment period. The present data help to explain the potential pharmacological action of AII in the physiology of thirst and suggest that cilazapril may effectively alleviate dialysis-associated hyperdipsia at least on some occasions. The mechanism by which ACE-I exerts an antidipsogenic action may, in part, be accounted for by the reduction in plasma concentration of AII, as a result of the ACE inhibition.",

The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-blockade on collagen in the heart and on plasma catecholamines and tissue angiotensin (Ang) I and II were examined in Bio 14.6 Syrian hamsters. Male hamsters (76-79 days old) were given low-dose enalapril (3 mg/kg per day), high-dose enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), atenolol (50 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 65 days. Age and sex matched healthy F1b hamsters were used as controls. Collagen concentration was determined by measuring hydroxyproline content and the relative proportion of type I, III, and V collagens was obtained by non-interrupted sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Per cent collagen area (PCA) was measured by pixel counting in myocardial tissue by a personal computer. 2. Although heartweight (HW) and bodyweight (BW) in F1b controls were significantly higher compared with drug-treated groups and vehicles, the HW/BW ratio in cardiomyopathic Bio 14.6 hamsters tended to be high compared with F1b controls and was decreased by each drug treatment. 3. Collagen concentration, total collagen content and PCA in the heart of Bio 14.6 hamsters were significantly higher than F1b controls. Collagen concentration and total collagen content were significantly decreased in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. 4. The proportion of type I collagen tended to decrease while that of type III collagen tended to increase in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. Type V collagen in vehicle-treated group was significantly higher than in F1b controls, while it tended to decrease in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. 5. Plasma concentrations of catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) were decreased significantly by atenolol and high-dose enalapril, but not by low-dose enalapril. Tissue AngI remained unaltered in any of the drug-treated hamsters. Tissue AngII was decreased by the high-dose enalapril and beta-blockade, and tended to be decreased by low-dose enalapril treatment. 6. These results reveal that enalapril and atenolol produced similar beneficial effects on collagen remodelling in Bio 14.6 hamsters by decreasing the total amount of collagen, and also by changing collagen phenotypes through the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Both drugs also improved myocardial morphological integrity.",

Particular attention was paid to the study of enalapril because the drug was monitored before the causal relationship between cough and ACE-inhibitors had been widely accepted. RESULTS. Several factors which had obscured the causal relationship in the individual cases were found to be also an obstacle in PEM. For example, cough was a common and non-serious event and was under-reported in the PEM study of enalapril and the rate was not strikingly different from that recorded for other drugs. Cough induced by ACE-inhibitors has several characteristics which reduce the chance of a recognisable \"signal'. The original questionnaires returned from doctors in the PEM study of enalapril have been reexamined. The observation that the rate of cough diminished after enalapril had been stopped rather than increased after starting, provided the best evidence of causality, because this was not affected by many biases such as the publicity that had occurred prior to doctors participating in PEM completed later reports.", 
    "351": "We report findings on the outpatient management of diabetes mellitus in Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in five Arizona Medicare-managed care plans. These findings are the baseline of an ongoing collaboration between the Health Services Advisory Group, Inc., Arizona's Peer Review Organization (PRO), and the five plans whose object is improved care of diabetes patients. The purpose of the study was to determine congruity between quality indicators identified by the five plans and the care actually received by diabetes patients enrolled in the five plans. The five plans agreed on a common set of quality indicators, including 10 services and 10 measures of patient status. Each plan has identified its diabetic population, 75 of whom are randomly selected each quarter by the PRO for chart review and inclusion in the study. The findings in this report cover two quarters of data. Data from chart review were examined to determine the extent to which actual practice reflected the indicators. The mean patient age was 71.8, and for most patients onset occurred between 55 and 69 years of age. About 25% had a positive family history, and we estimate the annual incidence of diabetes in this population to be about 1.1%. Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.9 +/- 2.1%; 46% were hypertensive; 42% continued to smoke cigarettes; 36% had retinopathy; 20% had proteinuria; and only 22% were on some kind of exercise program. Thirty-two percent were hospitalized during the 1-year baseline period, and the average number of outpatient visits per patient was 11.1 +/- 7.4. When care provided to diabetes patients enrolled in the plans was compared with the 10 quality standards identified by the plans themselves, only two of these standards was attained in more than 60% of patients: blood pressure, 98.7%; and foot examination, 62.7%. Two standards were achieved less than one-third of the time: urine dipstick, 10.4%, and appropriate use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 31.25%. The others were all between 40 and 55%. Of the 10 service standards, about one-third received 1-4, one-third received 5-6, and one-third received 7-10. Only 5% of patients received 9 or 10 services. Outpatient management of diabetes patients in managed-care plans is similar to that in fee-for-service. When compared with fee-for-service or another HMO, a higher proportion of Arizona-managed care patients had HbA1c, and a much lower proportion had a dipstick test for urine protein. Values for other variables were usually within 10 percentage points of each other. Regardless of payment scheme, diabetes care is characterized by inconsistencies, omissions, and a lower than desirable level of services. Although few patients received most of the indicator services, diabetes patients are nevertheless high utilizers of medical care, both in and out of the hospital. The hospitalization rate is twice that of Arizona Medicare beneficiaries as a whole, and the number of office visits is three or four times that reported in other studies. Further, it seems that many visits are required to achieve even these modest service levels. Had the average number of visits been six or less, HbA1c rates, for example, would have fallen to less than one-third in three of the five plans. We believe that these data are conservative because it is likely that some and perhaps most of these indicators are underreported. It should be emphasized that these are baseline data whose purpose is to provide a basis against which subsequent improvements many be measured.", 
    "352": "1. This study was designed to examine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on resistance artery structure and endothelium-dependent relaxation in Goldblatt two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Four weeks after clipping, hypertensive and sham rats were treated with either perindopril (1 mg day-1 kg-1) or quinapril (3 or 30 mg day-1 kg-1). After 6 weeks mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph for measurements of vascular structure. The endothelium-dependent relaxation response to acetylcholine and bradykinin and the response to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside were recorded. 2. All treatment regimes lowered the blood pressure and reversed both cardiac and resistance artery hypertrophy. Two-kidney, one-clip rats treated with quinapril showed a dose-dependent reduction in media cross-sectional area and media to lumen ratio. 3. Hypertension of 10 weeks' duration was associated with an impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation response to acetylcholine and bradykinin. Treatment with perindopril and either dose of quinapril prevented the development of impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation but had no effect on the response to sodium nitroprusside. Treatment had no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation in sham rats. 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment is effective in normalizing blood pressure and cardiovascular structural changes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment prevented the development of impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to both acetylcholine and bradykinin. The ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to reverse cardiovascular structural changes and prevent the development of abnormal endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the overall effect of this type of antihypertensive drug.",

Hypertension induces progressive atheromatous changes in cerebral arteries, and often causes steno-occlusive lesions of cerebral arteries. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril is one of the antihypertensive drugs. It was reported that cilazapril improved resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CRC) in experimental studies. In this clinical study, the authors investigated whether long-term treatment with cilazapril could improve CBF and CRC in patients with steno-occlusive lesions of the major cerebral arterial trunk, measured by stable xenon computerized tomography (Xe-CT) with acetazolamide challenge. On the other hand, CBF and CRC in the calcium blocker-treated patients were measured in the same way. CBF did not change after long-term treatment with both cilazapril and calcium blocker. In the cilazapril-treated group, CRC was increased significantly (p < 0.05). However, CRC did not change in the calcium blocker-treated group. It was recognized that long-term treatment with cilazapril did not decrease CBF and improved CRC in patients with occlusive lesions of the major cerebral arterial trunk.", 
    "355": "The inability to separate irreversible lesions of tubular epithelia from reversible tubular atrophy constitutes a major problem in histopathology and in decisions for revascularization of shrunken kidneys with renal artery stenosis. In order to characterize reversible tubular atrophy ('kidney hibernation') we studied the physiological and biochemical parameters and morphology including histochemistry in rat kidneys made atrophic by renal artery stenosis and treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. Renal artery stenosis was induced by a 0.2-mm clip around the left renal artery. Following 7 weeks of clipping and 2 concomitant weeks of enalapril treatment, the kidney length decreased from 17.8 +/- 0.3 to 13.7 +/- 0.7 mm (mean +/- SEM). Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased to 39 +/- 3% and to approximately 3% of control values, respectively. The activities of the intracellular proteolytic enzymes cathepsin B and L and of Na-K-ATPase in microdissected proximal tubular segments decreased to values below 50 and 10%, respectively. All changes were significant (p < 0.05). Histochemical staining for ATPase activity in the distal tubule segments remained unchanged. Tubular cells were atrophic but not necrotic. Histochemical staining of alkaline phosphatase in the tubular brush border and of acid phosphatase and peroxidase in lysosomes was greatly reduced. All observed changes were reversible within 2-3 weeks following removal of the clip and withdrawal of enalapril either with or without contralateral nephrectomy. Thus, a form of kidney hibernation with readily reversible tubular atrophy has been described. Based on this description it may be possible in consecutive experiments to differentiate between reversible and irreversible tubular atrophy.",

    "360": "There is a wealth of evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve symptoms, morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. In this context the use of ACE inhibitors could be considered a tool with which to assess the effect of trial design and methodology on the ability to detect improvement in symptoms and exercise performance. Thirty-five published, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trials, involving a total of 3411 patients, which compared the effect of ACE inhibitors and placebo on exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure were identified. Studies were examined in relation to whether they used cross-over or parallel group study design, study size, use of treadmill vs bicycle exercise test, year of publication, patient entry criteria, duration of follow-up and the particular ACE inhibitor used. Exercise duration improved in 23 of the studies, while symptoms improved in 25 of the 33 studies which evaluated this. In the majority of the trials (27 of 33) there was concordance between the effect on symptoms and on exercise capacity. There were six trials which showed discrepant results. Study size, duration of follow-up and method of exercise testing used were found to be major factors affecting the outcome. Trials using treadmill exercise tests were more likely to be positive than those using bicycle ergometry. All nine trials with study size more than 50, follow-up of 3-6 months and using treadmill exercise tests showed improved exercise capacity as well as symptoms. These findings may be useful in designing future trials for evaluating treatment for heart failure.", 
    "361": "Heart failure is a huge healthcare issue not only for clinicians but for healthcare managers also, with increasing pressure to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of therapies especially for common chronic conditions. The cost-effectiveness of heart failure treatments relate to their effects on the progression of the disease, the associated quality of life for the patient, and the actual cost of the disease management. Direct costs are usually associated with hospitalization. Indirect costs, such as the loss of production through absence from work, are more difficult to determine. Studies such as CONSENSUS, SOLVD, SAVE and the Munich Heart Failure trial have all shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offer effective therapy in all these aspects. Non-pharmacological strategies that have also been shown to favorably influence both the costs and benefit include the addition of a nurse practitioner to assist in patient management.", 
    "362": "Numerous studies have shown that it is very difficult to diagnose mild heart failure accurately on clinical grounds alone. Routine echocardiography would help to solve this problem but studies have shown that this technique is greatly underused. Providing open access echocardiography, and/or targeting this resource to the most deserving cases by measuring plasma natriuretic peptides may help to optimize the use of this technique while improving the diagnosis of heart failure patients. Studies have also demonstrated the value, but apparent underuse, of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Further questions for the management of heart failure patients have been presented by these investigations. Uncertainty remains over the appropriate timing of ACE inhibitor therapy and whether low or high doses are more effective. The ongoing ATLAS study aims to answer these questions and promotes an improvement in the treatment of heart failure patients.", 
    "363": "Although the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on symptoms, morbidity and mortality have been proven beyond any doubt, some controversies remain. First, surveys have shown that a minority of patients in whom ACE inhibition is indicated, actually receive ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the majority of patients on ACE inhibitors use doses that are far lower than the target dose used in the large trials. These lower doses may be less effective. There is limited evidence to show that low-dose ACE inhibition is as effective as high-dose ACE inhibition. However, two ongoing trials--ATLAS and NETWORK--will determine the relative efficacy of high- and low-dose ACE inhibition. Second, the large ACE inhibitor trials have shown major variations in mortality, suggesting that differences between the efficacy of ACE inhibitors exist. However, the major differences in mortality are related mainly to the variations in inclusion criteria, suggesting a class effect of ACE inhibition. A study, assessing the relative efficacy of various ACE inhibitors seems unrealistic at this time. Third, mortality data on asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction are conflicting, suggesting that initial treatment can wait until symptoms of heart failure appear. However, studies are consistent in showing reduction of events. Thus, early treatment in asymptomatic dysfunction may be warranted. Finally, it has been demonstrated that ACE inhibitors act favorably on volume and pressure overload, electrolytes and autonomic function. Nevertheless, the ACE inhibitor trials have failed to demonstrate that reduction of mortality is related to reduction of malignant ventricular arrhythmias/sudden death. This issue needs further study as specific antiarrhythmic strategies may be appropriate for arrhythmias.", 
    "364": "Ventricular remodeling is a repair process. It can follow myocardial infarction, mechanical overload (for example, in hypertension or valvular heart disease), and also occurs in inflammation and dilated cardiomyopathy. Remodeling can be an (early) adaptive process followed by a maladaptive (late) phase and involves all cells that are present in the myocardium - the myocyte, the interstitial cells, the vascular endothelium, and the immune cells. Despite the varying etiopathology that these different aspects of heart disease share, a similar sequence of molecular, biochemical and mechanical events that can lead to heart failure, myocyte hypertrophy, extensive extracellular matrix production and fibrosis, even in patients who were previously unaffected by the original disease process (for example, inflammation or infarction). Heart failure can be influenced by treatment of the underlying disease and by modification of the remodeling process, for example, by ACE inhibitors (cardioreparation). In experimental animals it has been clearly demonstrated that ACE inhibitors may even prevent a genetically predetermined left ventricular hypertrophy (cardioprevention).", 
    "365": "Recent trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce mortality and the occurrence of severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) when started within the first day after acute myocardial infarction and continued for 4-6 weeks thereafter. When started within this time window, ACE inhibitors are safe in relatively unselected myocardial infarction (MI) patients provided they are clinically and hemodynamically stable. GISSI-3, ISIS-4 and CCS-1 studies show that more than half of the lives are saved by ACE inhibitor treatment within the first week of therapy. Although the benefit from ACE inhibitors is larger in patients presenting with congestive heart failure (Killip class > 1), the number of lives saved in patients at low risk, who represent the majority of the population, is relevant. This supports the approach of treating all hemodynamically stable MI patients. Treatment could be stopped after about 1 month in patients without evidence of LVD while those with LVD should follow a long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "366": "Our options for the medical management of heart failure are aimed at preventing the development of the condition, relieving symptoms, modifying the underlying pathophysiology, and delaying or preventing disease progression. The principal symptoms of heart failure are edema, dyspnea and fatigue. Diuretics are effective in relieving edema, and dyspnea resulting from pulmonary edema. Once pulmonary edema has been treated relatively few agents are effective against residual exercise-induced dyspnea, possibly because of the numerous possible causes of this symptom. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have, however, been shown to improve dyspnoea by mechanisms that are not related to hemodynamic actions. These agents also improve skeletal muscle blood flow and function, thereby relieving fatigue in heart failure patients. Treatment strategies aimed at modifying the underlying pathophysiology or preventing disease progression have, with the exception of the ACE inhibitors, met with limited success. Large-scale trials have shown, however, that ACE inhibitors improve survival in patients with moderate or severe heart failure, and prevent the development of heart failure in asymptomatic patients. These agents, therefore, represent an important advance in the management of heart failure, and it is anticipated that new insights into their optimal use will follow as the mechanisms by which they exert their beneficial effects become clear.", 
    "367": "To determine whether the increase in proteinuria resulting from high dietary protein intake could be prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI), we performed paired studies on 8 nephrotic patients with normal GFR. They were fed sequential diets with a protein content of 0.8 (LPD) and 1.6 g/kg BW (HPD) each for 8 weeks. Patients on HPD received enalapril (ENAL) 10 mg/day. Despite the significant difference in protein intake, urinary protein excretion, at the end of the two dietary periods, was not statistically different. However, total serum protein and serum albumin increased significantly with HPD + ENAL treatment. The capability of ACEI to prevent the increase in proteinuria induced by HPD may be due to changes in glomerular hemodynamics, possibly mediated by changes in the activity of angiotensin II. Our study indicates that protein metabolism in nephrotic patients is better maintained with HPD + ENAL than with LPD alone.",

    "369": "The regional SI metabolism and permeability of captopril, didanosine (ddI), mannitol, ofloxacin and zidovudine (ZDV) were investigated in rats using a Single Pass Perfusion (SPIP) procedure or intestinal homogenates.", 
    "370": "ddI was metabolized to a greater extent in the upper SI whereas captopril was metabolized to a greater extent in the lower SI. Relatively low homogenate concentrations resulted in significant degradation of captopril in the upper and lower SI. All other compounds were stable and changes in the buffer system or the initial concentration did not affect the results. The SI permeabilities of all compounds, with the exception of mannitol, decreased linearly with respect to SI location and the slopes of the corresponding normalized regression lines were not significantly different.", 
    "371": "It has been reported that captopril and ddI demonstrate regional intestinal bioavailability in several species including humans. The current results suggest that the reported reduction in the lower SI bioavailability of captopril may be a result of a reduction in permeability and an increase in intestinal metabolism whereas for ddI, the reduction in the lower SI bioavailability appears to be attributable to a reduction in intestinal permeability. Other factors such as luminal metabolism may also significantly effect regional differences in the intestinal bioavailability of ddI or captopril. Based on these results, a strong possibility exists that ofloxacin and ZDV may also demonstrate regional differences in intestinal bioavailability.", 
    "372": "We assessed the effects of 6 months of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (cilazapril) or a beta 1-adrenergic blocker (atenolol) on aortic stiffness in essential hypertension. Forty patients (16 women) aged 47 +/- 9 years (mean +/- SD) with baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 162 +/- 15 and 105 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, were entered into a double-blind, parallel-group study with cilazapril, 5 mg once daily, or atenolol, 100 mg once daily. The treatment period was preceded by a 4-week placebo washout phase. Aortic elastic modulus (Ep) was determined by cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and indirect brachial artery blood pressure measurements prior to and after 3 weeks and 6 months of therapy. The reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline to 6 months averaged -17 +/- 13 and -10 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, with cilazapril and -23 +/- 16 and -14 +/- 6 mm Hg with atenolol. Concomitantly, Ep of the ascending aorta decreased with cilazapril from a median of 2,234 10(3)dyn/cm2 (interquartile range, 866-3,740) to 868 10(3)dyn/cm2 (515-1,486) and with atenolol from a median of 1,611 10(3)dyn/cm2 (895-2,790) to 1,054 10(3)dyn/cm2 (616-1,860). In repeated-measurements analysis of variance, the change in Ep with time was statistically significant (p < 0.001) but the group x time interaction was not. We conclude that 6 months of treatment with either cilazapril or atenolol reduces the stiffness of the ascending aorta in essential hypertension. No statistically significant differences between the effects of the two drugs were observed. The mechanisms and clinical significance of improved aortic distensibility with antihypertensive therapy deserve further study.", 
    "373": "An open, randomised, cross-over study was performed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat, administered as 20 mg enalapril both as monotherapy and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ 12.5 mg). Three groups of 6 hypertensive patients were enrolled [untreated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-115 mm Hg]; normal renal function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 81 ml min-1 1.73 m-2], mild renal impairment (GFR 51-80 ml min-1 1.73 m-2), and moderate renal impairment (GFR 31-50 ml min-1 1.73 m-2). The pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat and enalaprilat plus HCTZ correlated predictably with renal impairment with increased plasma concentrations and decreased urinary elimination at lower values of GFR. The coadministration of HCTZ had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat in any group. We conclude that although the pharmacokinetics of both enalaprilat and HCTZ are related to renal function, HCTZ has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat and that dosage adjustment for both regimens should be based on renal function.", 
    "374": "We examined the influence of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) fosinopril on function and perfusion of the diabetic rat heart. Streptozotocin-diabetic rats (60 mg/kg body weight) were treated with fosinopril (10 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 months. Cardiac performance was analyzed in the isolated heart perfused at constant volume. Epicardial perfusion was determined by measuring epicardial fluorescence changes after injection of FITC-dextrane (3 kDa) as described previously. As compared with controls, fosinopril prevented or diminished the increase in end-diastolic pressure (EDP), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), and vascular resistance in diabetes. The intravascular volume strongly reduced in diabetes was increased, and the epicardial perfusion rate was accelerated in hearts of diabetic rats treated with fosinopril. The vascular exchange diminished in hearts of untreated diabetic rats was enhanced, and the transcapillary permeability was slightly accelerated at low flow rates. These data indicate that treatment of streptozotocin-diabetic rats with fosinopril prevents severe disturbances of coronary autoregulation and at least partly the impairment of cardiac perfusion generally observed in diabetic rats. Together with previously published morphological data demonstrating an inhibition of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in hearts of diabetic rats with fosinopril, our observations suggest that ACE inhibition by fosinopril is cardioprotective in diabetes.", 
    "375": "To investigate the role of endogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) in the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), we examined the effect of the novel nonpeptide Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist CV-11974 on basal and stimulated-growth of VSMC from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). CV-11974 inhibited basal DNA synthesis by VSMC from SHR, but not from WKY, in the absence of serum. In the presence of 10% calf serum, DNA synthesis was significantly higher in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY, and the inhibitory effect of CV-11974 was attenuated. Ang II dose-dependently stimulated DNA synthesis by VSMC from both rat strains, and this effect was abolished by CV-11974. CV-11974 slightly but significantly suppressed proliferation of VSMC from both rat strains. CV-11974 competitively inhibited the specific binding of 125I-labeled Ang II to VSMC from both rat strains. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) delapril also reduced basal DNA synthesis by VSMC from SHR, but did not affect proliferation of VSMC from either rat strain. These findings suggest that VSMC from SHR may synthesize Ang II which promotes their basal growth in an autocrine/paracrine manner through the AT1 receptor, and that this system may be associated with the exaggerated growth of VSMC from SHR.", 
    "376": "We compared the cardiac effects of the selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)-receptor blockade, FK-739, with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on left ventricular (LV) distensibility and collagen metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We treated 14-week-old SHRs with FK-739 (30 mg/kg/day) or enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Both FK-739 and enalapril induced a significant decrease in blood pressure (p < 0.001) and regression of LV hypertrophy (p < 0.001) compared with vehicle, with no differences between the treated groups. Furthermore, FK-739 caused a greater decrease in LV collagen content than did enalapril (FK-739-treated group, 3.06 +/- 0.11 mg/g; enalapril-treated group, 3.47 +/- 0.05 mg/g; p = 0.015) with no change in collagen phenotypes. Hearts taken from rats treated with FK-739 also showed greater LV distensibility than those taken from enalapril-treated rats (FK-739-treated group vs. enalapril-treated group at > or = 15 mm Hg, p < 0.001). These results suggest that, compared with ACE inhibition, AT1-receptor blockade may have additional effects on LV distensibility and collagen metabolism in the regression of LV hypertrophy induced by pressure overload.", 
    "377": "Converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) ameliorates progressive loss of function in non-immune-mediated renal diseases and experimental hypertension. Little, however, is known on the potential role of CEI in established experimental chronic glomerular immune injury. We therefore studied the effect of the CEI ramipril on renal function and morphology in a model of immune mediated glomerular injury.", 
    "378": "The immune complex glomerulonephritis was induced in uninephrectomized rats by intrarenal perfusion with the cationized antigen followed by an intravenous application of the antibody. This disease is characterized by the development of progressive albuminuria and a nephrotic syndrome (albuminuria: immune complex glomerulonephritis 342 +/- 58, control 76 +/- 18 mg/24h; P < 0.001). The CEI by ramipril, dissolved in the drinking water, was given 28 weeks after induction of the disease and treatment was continued for 12 weeks.", 
    "379": "In these experiments ramipril significantly reduced albumin excretion (immune complex glomerulonephritis + CEI 109 +/- 16 mg/24h; P < 0.01) when compared with untreated nephritic rats. Ramipril, however, did not significantly change inulin clearances (immune complex glomerulonephritis 224 +/- 67, immune complex glomerulonephritis + CEI 278 +/- 48 microliters/min/100 g bw). Glomerular structural damage expressed as glomerular damage index was significantly greater in rats with immune complex glomerulonephritis when compared with controls (immune complex glomerulonephritis 0.91 +/- 0.13; control 0.60 +/- 0.08; P < 0.05), but was uneffected by the treatment with the CEI (immune complex) glomerulonephritis + CEI 1.02 +/- 0.26; control + CEI 0.63 +/- 0.11).", 
    "380": "These data demonstrate that ramipril reduced albuminuria in a model of immune complex glomerulonephritis; however, it failed to alter GFR and glomerular damage index. The study suggests that ramipril ameliorates proteinuria independently of obvious glomerular histological changes. The reduction of proteinuria is, however, associated with a significant decrease in filtration fraction and therefore is at least partially haemodynamically mediated.", 
    "381": "The hereditary cardiomyopathic strain of Syrian hamster has been extensively studied as a model of cardiomyopathy of heart failure. We attempted to determine whether an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents the increase in extracellular collagen matrix which connects the myocytes in cardiomyopathy. Enalapril was administered at an average dosage of 10 mg/kg per day to 10- to 20-week-old hamsters with hypertrophic (Bio 14.6) and dilated (Bio 53.58) cardiomyopathy, as well as to control Syrian hamsters (F1 beta). Collagen concentration estimated by hydroxyproline concentration and the collagen type III:I ratio significantly increased in the hearts of the Bio 14.6 and Bio 53.58 strains at 20 and 40 weeks of age as, compared with those in age-matched F1 beta hamsters. When Bio 14.6 hamsters were given enalapril for 10 weeks from 10 to 20 weeks of age, the collagen concentration, the collagen type III:I ratio and type III collagen mRNA expression were significantly decreased, compared with those in untreated animals of the same strain. After the administration of enalapril, scanning electron microscopic examination also revealed a decrease in fibrillar collagen accumulation in the interstitium and the network surrounding the cardiac myocytes. These prophylactic effects were not observed in the Bio 53.58 strain. These results indicate that the administration of ACE inhibitor prevents type III collagen production in the Bio 14.6 strain but not in the Bio 53.58 strain of Syrian hamster.", 
    "382": "The aim of this double-blind randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of trandolapril and nitrendipine in the elderly. After a 2-week placebo period, patients received either trandolapril 0.5 mg or nitrendipine 10 mg, once daily for 15 days. At the end of this period, according to a forced titration, the dose was increased to 2 mg of trandolapril or 20 mg of nitrendipine once daily for 2 months. Seventy-three hypertensive patients, aged 65 and over, entered the study. Demographic data and initial blood pressure (BP) level were comparable in the two groups. The antihypertensive effect, measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer, was assessed in 64 patients: SBP decreased by 18.6 +/- 12.1 mm Hg in the trandolapril (P < 0.001) and by 21.0 +/- 13.7 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001); DBP decreased by 13.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg in the trandolapril group (P < 0.001) and by 15.4 +/-8.2 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was seen between the two treatment groups. A sub-group of 42 patients were evaluated by 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring. Mean 24 h ambulatory SBP/DBP decreases were 6.6 +/- 18.0/8.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg in the trandolapril group (P < 0.001) and 5.7 +/- 11.1/7.2 +/-9.6 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001). The differences between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant. The antihypertensive action of trandolapril was sustained throughout the 24 h period with a trough-to-peak ratio of 70.2% for SBP and 70.9% for DBP. Nitrendipine exerted its action mainly during the day, with a very modest antihypertensive effect during the night and early morning; its trough/peak ratio was 25.9% for SBP and 28% for DBP. The tolerance of both treatments were good; seven patients were withdrawn from the trial for adverse events (four in the nitrendipine group, three in the trandolapril group).", 
    "383": "Protacyclin biosynthesis was investigated in 133 untreated newly diagnosed patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Urinary excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and of 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha, stable breakdown products of prostacyclin, was measured following a 1 month run-in period. To determine whether lowering blood pressure (BP) influenced prostacyclin biosynthesis, 106 consenting patients with diastolic pressure 90-120 mm Hg were allocated randomly to treatment with bendrofluazide, metoprolol, quinapril or amlodipine in an open parallel group design. Dose was increased to reduce diastolic arterial pressure to <90 mm Hg. Terazosin was added if this target BP was not achieved, and its dose increased if necessary. Urinary excretion rates of prostaglandins were measured after 1 year in patients in whom the target diastolic pressure was achieved. Mean arterial pressure varied from 106-168 mm Hg in untreated patients and excretion of both prostacyclin-derived products varied from <5 to >350 ng/g creatinine. Arterial pressure and prostaglandin excretion were not significantly correlated. In 57 patients in whom target pressure was achieved, BP before treatment was 166 +/- 2/100 +/- 1 at baseline and 144 +/- 2/86 +/- 1 mm Hg at 1 year. Excretion rates of each prostacyclin-derived product were similar before treatment and at 1 year, with no significant differences between the drugs. These findings do not support the hypothesis that deficient prostacyclin biosynthesis contributes to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, or that increased prostacyclin biosynthesis plays a part in the response to treatment with antihypertensive medication.", 
    "384": "Hamster cheek pouch vascular tissues contain an angiotensin II-forming enzyme which is inhibited by chymostatin but not by any angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by gel filtration and heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The molecular mass estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 28 kDa and the optimum pH was between 7.5 and 9.0. The angiotensin II-forming activity was inhibited by chymostatin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but not by aprotinin. The N-terminal sequence showed high homology with chymases from various species. Thus, the angiotensin II-generating enzyme obtained from hamster cheek pouch vessels is a chymase.", 
    "385": "Data on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril were obtained in a multicenter observational study carried out in a general practice setting. A total of 33,841 hypertensive patients were prescribed cilazapril 2.5-5.0 mg per day and followed for an average of 109 days. 28,792 patients (85.1%) had a baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 95 mm Hg. 24,649 patients received cilazapril alone. during the observation period the mean blood pressure of these patients fell from 177/105 to 148/87 mm Hg (an average drop delta of 29/18 mm Hg). The response rate (diastolic BP < or = 90 mm Hg and delta > or = 10 mm Hg) in these patients was 78.9%. Adverse events were reported by 7.3% of all patients. In all, 3.7% of patients discontinued cilazapril treatment because of side effects. The most frequently reported side effect (1.5% of cases) was the dry cough typical of ACE inhibitors. The doctors judged the efficacy of cilazapril as very good or good in 89.8% of cases and its tolerability as very good or good in 94.6%. This reflects the good compliance (regular tablet intake) of more than 90% of patients.", 
    "386": "Long-term treatment of survivors of an acute myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has a beneficial impact on their long-term outcome. We tested the hypothesis that captopril could reductively cleave the lipoprotein(a) molecule and in addition act as a scavenger of oxygen free radicals. In a double-blind trial, 20 patients were randomized to receive either captopril 50 mg daily or corresponding placebo. patients were followed for a period of 30 days. Blood samples were drawn prior to randomization and after 30 days of treatment. Plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) and malondialdehyde were evaluated. Captopril treatment produced a significant reduction in plasma content of lipoprotein(a) ( < 0.05) and at day 30 the plasma content of lipoprotein(a) was also significantly lower than that in the placebo group (p < 0.05). furthermore, on day 30 plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde, an indicator of oxidative damage, were significantly lower in the captopril group when compared to baseline values and corresponding placebo group values (p < 0.05). The observed effect of captopril treatment on lipoprotein(a) and malondialdehyde might be ascribed to the sulfhydryl group in the captopril molecule.", 
    "387": "Recently in the world literature with increasing frequency reports are found on clinical studies investigating the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. The authors present a review of the problem comprising pathophysiological mechanisms at a receptor level up to investigations of the effect of beta-blockers on haemodynamics, the functional state of the left ventricle and survival. Although this promising and frequently controversial treatment is not accepted universally so far, partial data in the mentioned investigations indicate that when a more accurate dosage pattern is established and indications are specified in more detail, the use of beta-blockers is one way how to approach - in addition to the use of diuretics, cardiotonics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - a comprehensive therapeutic control of chronic heart failure.", 
    "388": "On the basis of evidence suggesting the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in steroid-induced hypertension, we considered the possibility that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril would lower the arterial blood pressure in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats through kininase II inhibition. In conscious DOCA-salt hypertensive rats with intact kidneys (n = 6) or uninephrectomized rats (n = 5), the short-term administration of captopril (8 mg/kg IV) decreased mean blood pressure from 141 +/- 3 to 118 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < .05) and from 176 +/- 12 to 158 +/- 15 mm Hg (P < .05), respectively. The maximal effect of captopril was manifested between 40 and 50 minutes after its administration, and blood pressure remained depressed for at least 2 hours. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (500 micrograms/kg IV) abolished the antihypertensive effect of captopril in the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, indicating kinin involvement. Losartan, an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist, had no effect on blood pressure in another group of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (n = 9) and did not significantly change the response to captopril. No effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was seen in normotensive control rats (n = 5), indicating the absence of a nonspecific hypotensive action of the drug. Plasma renin activity was lower in the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (0.7 +/- 0.2 ng angiotensin I/mL per hour, n = 4) than in normotensive control rats (8.8 +/- 1.7, n = 4). The involvement of kinins in the antihypertensive effect of captopril in DOCA-salt hypertension supports the contention that the kallikrein-kinin system contributes to blood pressure regulation in this hypertension model.", 
    "389": "The contribution of endogenous kinins to impairment in renal adaptation to a 6-day period of dietary sodium withdrawal associated with treatment with ramipril (5 mg/kg per day) and losartan (30 mg/kg per day) was evaluated by use of concomitant chronic administration of the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (150 or 300 micrograms/kg per day via subcutaneous osmotic pump). A similar level of higher cumulative sodium excretion was observed in ramipril- and losartan-treated rats compared with untreated animals, and the effect of ramipril was not affected by Hoe 140. Similarly, the fall in arterial pressure and the renal vasodilatation associated with ramipril and losartan were not modified by Hoe 140. Glomerular filtration rate (785 +/- 73 microL/min per g KW in untreated sodium-depleted rats) decreased to a larger extent in ramipril-treated rats compared with losartan-treated rats (371 +/- 78 and 550 +/- 55 microL/min per g KW, respectively). Hoe 140 markedly prevented the alteration in glomerular filtration rate associated with ramipril, thus resulting in a final glomerular filtration rate (543 +/- 41 microL/min per g KW) similar to that observed with losartan. These findings demonstrate that despite a lack of influence on arterial pressure and sodium balance, accumulation of kinins markedly contributes to deterioration of the glomerular filtration rate induced by ramipril in sodium-depleted rats.", 
    "390": "After transient episodes of ischemia, benefits of thrombolytic or angioplastic therapy may be limited by reperfusion injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury, an effect mediated by kinins. We examined whether the protective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion is due to kinin stimulation of prostaglandin and/or nitric oxide release. The left anterior descending coronary artery of Lewis inbred rats was occluded for 30 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Immediately before reperfusion rats were treated with vehicle, ramiprilat, or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan. We tested whether pretreatment with the kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin blocked the effect of ramiprilat on infarct size and reperfusion arrhythmias. In controls, infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was 79 +/- 3%; ramiprilat reduced this to 49 +/- 4% (P < .001), but losartan had little effect (74 +/- 6%, P = NS). Pretreatment with Hoe 140, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, or indomethacin abolished the beneficial effect of ramiprilat. Compared with the 30-minute ischemia/120-minute reperfusion group, nonreperfused hearts with 30 minutes of ischemia had significantly smaller infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk, whereas in the 150-minute ischemia group it was significantly larger. This suggests that reperfusion caused a significant part of the myocardial injury, but it also suggests that compared with prolonged ischemia, reperfusion salvaged some of the myocardium. Ventricular arrhythmias mirrored the changes in infarct size. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors protect the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion injury and arrhythmias; these beneficial effects are mediated primarily by a kinin-prostaglandin-nitric oxide pathway, not inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "391": "The objective of this study was to examine the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on blood pressure and vascular responses of resistance arteries during prolonged inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis. Four groups of 6-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with either placebo as controls or N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) alone or in combination with verapamil or with trandolapril. Drugs were given orally for 6 weeks or short-term in vitro to vessels obtained from untreated rats. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations as well as contractions were studied in isolated perfused mesenteric and renal arteries with an arteriograph. Kidney nitric oxide synthase activity was also evaluated. Verapamil and trandolapril prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure and the blunted acetylcholine-induced relaxations that occurred with L-NAME treatment without improving the nitric oxide synthase activity. Both antihypertensive regimens also normalized sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside, which was enhanced by L-NAME. In contrast, short-term in vitro preincubation with verapamil or trandolaprilat in the presence of L-NAME did not improve the impaired relaxations to acetylcholine. Long-term but not short-term therapy with a calcium antagonist or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improved the blunted endothelium-dependent relaxations in nitric oxide-deficient hypertension. These findings strongly suggest that the role of other vasodilator systems, which normally do not regulate vascular tone, is enhanced with long-term but not short-term treatment with these drugs. These observations emphasize the potential importance of these treatments in the management of hypertension in which nitric oxide production is diminished.", 
    "392": "We investigated the contribution of nitric oxide to the short-term blood pressure reduction caused by interruption of the renin-angiotensin system in angiotensin-dependent hypertension. The blood pressure of rats made hypertensive by coarctation of the aorta between the renal arteries at their origin fell after administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat (2 mg/kg IV; -75 +/- 5 mm Hg) or the angiotensin II antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg IV; -79 +/- 6 mm Hg). But the antihypertensive effect of these agents was attenuated in rats pretreated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mg/kg IV) to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis (ramiprilat, -23 +/- 7 mm Hg; losartan, -37 +/- 5 mm Hg). In rats made hypertensive by long-term infusion of angiotensin II (60 ng/min IV, 6 to 7 days), the vasodepressor response to discontinuation of the angiotensin II infusion also was attenuated by pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor (-52 +/- 7 versus -31 +/- 7 mm Hg); this attenuation was not demonstrable in rats receiving sodium nitroprusside (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 IV) to replace the loss of endogenous nitric oxide (-72 +/- 9 mm Hg). Pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not interfere with the vasodepressor effect of sodium nitroprusside or prazosin in rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension or with the blood pressure reduction caused by discontinuation of an infusion of phenylephrine in rats made hypertensive by long-term administration of this drug. These data suggest a contribution of nitric oxide to the blood pressure reduction caused by interruption of the renin-angiotensin system in models of established angiotensin-dependent hypertension.", 
    "393": "Angioneurotic oedema secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is a rare condition, but it is a side effect which is likely to be seen more frequently because of the increased use of these drugs in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension. We report two cases which illustrate problems in the diagnosis and management of this life-threatening condition, and also demonstrate that angioedema re-occurs if the ACE inhibitor is not discontinued. If angioedema is suspected, therapy with any angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor should be discontinued promptly, respiratory distress should be treated appropriately, and subsequent therapy should be initiated with an agent from an alternative class of drugs.", 
    "394": "ACEIs are widely prescribed antihypertensives and have become the mainstay of therapy for severe CHF. Nevertheless, a focused AII-receptor blockade has compelling intellectual appeal and substantial clinical advantages over the ACEIs (no disruption of the prostaglandin and bradykinin biosystems). Identification and careful characterization of the AII receptors and the recent discovery of their antagonists has led to the extensive clinical investigation of selective AII-receptor blockers in both hypertension and severe CHF. Studies with the first orally active AII-receptor blocker, losartan, have demonstrated safe and effective control of elevated blood pressure and improvement of the abnormal hemodynamics typical of pronounced CHF. Several other oral AII-receptor blockers are currently being evaluated, and early results with these agents are encouraging.", 
    "395": "Measures of heart rate variability in the frequency domain quantify autonomic activity. However, the relation of these measures to the severity of ventricular dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure remains uncertain. We applied spectral analysis of heart rate variability to 24-hour Holter monitor recordings obtained from 20 patients with congestive heart failure who were not treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to determine whether significant changes in parameters of heart rate variability reflect the progression of symptoms in patients with ventricular failure. Both total and low-frequency heart rate spectral power were seen to decrease with worsening New Heart Associate (NYHA) functional class. A significant (p = 0.04) higher total power was noted in NYHA class II than in class III patients (3.0 x 10(-3) +/- 3.6 10(-4) and 2.5 x 10(-3) +/- 5.9 x 19(-4) [beats/min]2, respectively). Similarly, low-frequency heart rate spectral power was significantly (p = 0.008) higher in class II than in class III patients (1.7 x 10(-3) +/- 4.6 x 10(-4) and 1.1 x 10(-3) +/- 3.5 x 10(-4) [beats/min]2, respectively). Only the low-frequency component of the spectrum was directly correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.40) with a trend toward statistical significance (p = 0.07). Measures of heart rate variability and the changes in autonomic tone that they reflect may therefore serve as markers of the extent of disease progression in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "396": "We have reported that overnight fasting stimulates bicarbonate reabsorption (JtCo2) in rat distal tubules. The present in vivo microperfusion studies evaluated the hypothesis that endogenous angiotensin II (AII) mediates this response. Rat late distal (LD) tubules were perfused at 8 nl/min in vivo with a hypotonic solution containing 28 mM bicarbonate. In overnight-fasted rats, LD JtCO2 was significantly higher than in normally fed rats (50 +/- 4 vs. 16 +/- 6 pmol/min.mm, P < 0.05). When overnight-fasted rats were salt-loaded, JtCO2 fell significantly (38 +/- 3 pmol/min.mm, P < 0.05). Conversely, in fed rats ingesting a zero-salt diet, JtCO2 increased three-fold (45 +/- 5 pmol/min.mm, P < 0.05). Enalaprilat infusion (0.25 micrograms/kg body wt, intravenously), in these zero-salt and overnight-fasted rats, reduced LD JtCO2 values to normal. Further, infusion of losartan (5 mg/kg body wt, intravenously), the specific AII AT1 receptor blocker, reduced JtCO2 in overnight-fasted rats by two-thirds (16 +/- 4 pmol/min.mm, P < 0.05). Finally, we perfused 10(-11) M AII intraluminally with and without 10(-6) M losartan: AII increased JtCO2 to 45 +/- 6 pmol/min.mm, equal to the zero-salt flux. This was completely abrogated by simultaneous losartan perfusion. Therefore, these results suggest that AII is an in vivo stimulator of late distal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption.", 
    "397": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was designed to differentiate the pharmacodynamic effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan from the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Effects of placebo, enalapril (10 mg), and losartan (20 and 100 mg) on local venous and systemic pressor responses to angiotensin I and II were compared in eight healthy male subjects. Treatments were administered orally approximately 4 hours before agonist infusions into a dorsal hand vein. Local changes in hand vein diameter and systemic blood pressure were monitored during the infusions. The 100 mg dose of losartan attenuated local venoconstrictor and systemic pressor responses to angiotensin I and II. In contrast, enalapril blocked only responses to angiotensin I. Both losartan and enalapril increased plasma renin concentration compared with placebo. These results are consistent with direct antagonism of angiotensin II receptors by losartan and with indirect effects of enalapril through inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "398": "The respective efficacies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and standard heparin were investigated with respect to their inhibitory effects on intimal hyperplasia after balloon denudation of rat aorta. Local angiotensin II effects in the artery wall may participate in regulation of the vascular response to arterial injury, apparently independent of the plasma renin and angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors have been shown to block intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury in rats. Increasing evidence points toward an inhibitory effect of heparin on intimal hyperplasia independent of anticoagulation. Balloon catheter aortic denudation was performed in 25 rats pharmacologically treated from six days or one day before to fourteen days after surgery and split into four groups: group A (control group), normal feeding; group B (ramipril group), ramipril 10 mg/kg/day orally; group C (heparin group), heparin 1200 IU/kg/day subcutaneously; group D (combined group), both ramipril and heparin. Animals were killed and aortas were perfused and fixed at physiologic pressure fourteen days after denudation. Cross-sectional intima-to-media area ratios (I-M ratio) were calculated by an image analyze system.", 
    "399": "Much evidence indicates an involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in the genesis of silent myocardial ischemia. The authors assessed autonomic system activity by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability in 21 elderly hypertensive men with and without angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease and compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. In the analysis an autoregressive algorithm was used to determine the power spectrum from an electrocardiographic recording of 512 consecutive RR intervals. The autonomic nervous system induces two distinct sinusoids: a low-frequency signal attributable to sympathetic activity and a high-frequency vagal response. In the hypertensive patients with coronary disease the authors also evaluated sympathetic activation after double-blind, placebo-controlled administration of metoprolol (100 mg/day), followed by amlodipine (10 mg/day), quinapril (20 mg/day), and amlodipine (5 mg/day) plus quinapril (10 mg/day).", 
    "400": "Taking into account both the importance of microalbuminuria (MA) as a predictive parameter of clinical nephropathy in diabetic patients and the efficiency of exertion to show and/or to increase MA in both diabetic patients and normal individuals, we studied 37 type I diabetic patients divided into two groups: group A, with no MA at rest (n = 19), and group B, with MA at rest (n = 18). Group C comprised 10 healthy volunteers as controls. Changes of basal MA during exercise and postexercise were studied in all three groups. Normotensive patients with no metabolic disorders, normal renal function, and no proteinuria underwent an ergometric test up to 600 kg. This test was repeated after the administration of 20 mg enalapril in a single daily dose for 60 days. Body weight, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, creatinine, and creatinine clearance were determined and showed no significant variations either between groups or with treatment. Microalbuminuria was studied in the three groups with and without administration of enalapril throughout the 2 months of the study. Determinations were performed under conditions of rest, exercise, and postexercise. Mean baseline MA values +/- SEM were as follows: at rest, 5.22 +/- 0.49, 58.36 +/- 13.24, and 4.73 +/- 0.45 micrograms/min for groups A, B, and C, respectively; with exercise, 15.19 +/- 4.43, 74.70 +/- 14.89, and 16.76 +/- 4.62 micrograms/min for groups A, B, and C, respectively; and postexercise, 32.04 +/- 6.64, 253.15 +/- 63.88, and 9.23 +/- 3.25 micrograms/min, respectively. The geometric means of the baseline to posttreatment MA ratio were as follows: at rest, 0.95, 1.59 (P < 0.01), and 1.03 for groups A, B, and C, respectively; with exercise, 1.53 (P < 0.01), 1.91 (P < 0.01), and 1.69 for groups A, B, and C, respectively; and postexercise, 2.94 (P < 0.01), 3.24 (P < 0.01), and 1.03 for groups A, B, and C, respectively. In conclusion, in the early diagnostic suspicion of diabetic nephropathy, the screening of postexercise MA during an ergometric test could be of help. Treatment with enalapril decreased MA in diabetic groups A (no MA at rest) and B (MA at rest) during exercise and postexercise, and also decreased MA in group B while at rest.",

    "402": "Meta-analyses were used to examine the cost efficacy of renovascular hypertension diagnosis and treatment. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value were calculated for captopril renography, Doppler, the captopril test and arteriography. Sensitivities and specificities were used to project cost per patient cured or improved for each modality. This was compared with the lifetime cost of medical therapy. Cost efficacy was calculated using a hypothetical population (1000 patients, a prevalency rate of 30% for renal artery stenosis, expected cure or improvement rate of 0.77 after angioplasty).", 
    "403": "The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were similar for all modalities except the captopril test, which had a significantly lower sensitivity. The specificity was similar for all procedures; Doppler was highest but was mitigated by a 17% technical failure rate. The cost per patient cured or improved is greatest for arteriography and lowest for the captopril test. The relationship between cost per patient cured and the number of patients diagnosed in the population was calculated (relative value = (1/cost) x number patients detected). The relative value of captopril renography and arteriography is similar. Doppler and the captopril test have the lowest relative value. If angioplasty reduces medication by three drugs, the savings is $5807 to $8046 per patient. Surgical therapy is not cost-effective.",

In the present study, no deterioration in LV systolic function occurred in patients in whom regression of LV mass was achieved. Impairment in LV compliance has been shown in hypertensive patients, even in the presence of preserved systolic function and normal LV mass. In our study, improvement in diastolic function was observed only in patients whose LV mass decreased, and it was related to reduction in mass and not to a decrease in mean arterial pressure. Therefore, we suggest that because diastolic function is the first activity to deteriorate in hypertensive patients, it may be the first activity to improve, and this improvement may be related to reduction in LV mass with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "414": "Hypertension is common in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is also an early sign of diabetic nephropathy in those with insulin-dependent diabetes. Hypertension contributes to the progression of both macrovascular disease and nephropathy in patients with diabetes. Certain antihypertensive agents can adversely affect carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may slow the progression of renal complications in patients with diabetes. The pharmacologic approaches to treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes potentially differ from those in nondiabetic persons. On the basis of a review of the recent literature related to antihypertensive therapy for patients with diabetes, we describe an empiric approach to treatment of hypertension in such patients. The proposed approach must be modified as new data from randomized clinical trials become available.", 
    "415": "There is some evidence that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity can improve the uptake and conversion of glucose by heart and skeletal muscle in diabetes. To study the underlying mechanisms, we treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist ICI D8731 and the ACE inhibitor fosinopril for 4 months and determined the expression of the myocardial glucose transporter proteins. In diabetic rats, the expression of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4) was strongly diminished as shown by Western and Northern blots. ICI D8731 prevented the decrease of GLUT4 protein in diabetes but had no influence on the amount of mRNA encoding for GLUT1 and GLUT4. GLUT1 protein was hardly detected in the rat heart and was affected neither by diabetes nor by treatment with the AT1 antagonist. Additionally, ICI D8731 influenced the translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, because treatment increased the amount of GLUT4 protein in the plasma membranes as well as in intracellular membrane fractions compared with membranes of untreated diabetic control rats. In contrast, inhibition of ACE by fosinopril influenced neither the expression nor the translocation of the glucose transporter proteins. These observations indicate that angiotensin II has a distinct influence on the post-transcriptional regulation of the GLUT4 transporter protein, presumably indirectly as a consequence of hemodynamic effects and structural alterations of the vessel wall.", 
    "416": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is considered to be an independent risk factor giving rise to ischemia, arrhythmias, and left ventricular dysfunction. Slow movement of intracellular calcium contributes to the impaired contraction and relaxation function of hypertrophied myocardium. Myofibril content may also be shifted to fetal-type isoforms with decreased contraction and relaxation properties in left ventricular hypertrophy. Myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis are regulated independently by mechanical and neurohumoral mechanisms. In severely hypertrophied myocardium, capillary density is reduced, the diffusion distance for oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites is increased, and the ratio of energy-production sites to energy-consumption sites is decreased. The metabolic state of severely hypertrophied myocardium is anaerobic, as indicated by the shift of lactate dehydrogenase marker enzymes. Therefore, the hypertrophied myocardium is more vulnerable to ischemic events. As a compensatory response to severe cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure, the ADP/ATP carrier is activated and atrial natriuretic peptide is released to increase high-energy phosphate production and reduce cardiac energy consumption by vasodilation and sodium and fluid elimination. However, in severely hypertrophied and failing myocardium, vasoconstrictor and sodium- and fluid-retaining factors, such as the renin-angiotensin system, aldosterone, and sympathetic nerve activity, play an overwhelming role. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are able to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and improve cardiac function and metabolism. Under experimental conditions, these beneficial effects can be ascribed mainly to bradykinin potentiation, although a contribution of the ACEI-induced angiotensin II reduction cannot be excluded.", 
    "417": "In ischemia, the heart generates and releases kinins as mediators that seem to have cardioprotective actions. Kinin-generating pathways are present in the heart. Kininogen, kininogenases, kinins, and B2 kinin receptors can be measured in cardiac tissue. Kinins are released under conditions of ischemia. In anesthetized rats and dogs with coronary artery ligation and in human patients with myocardial infarction, kinin plasma levels are increased. In isolated rat hearts, the outflow of kinins is enhanced during ischemia but markedly attenuated after deendothelialization, pointing to the coronary vascular endothelium as the main possible source. Kinins administered locally exert beneficial cardiac effects. In isolated rat hearts with ischemia-reperfusion injuries, perfusion with bradykinin (BK) reduces the duration and incidence of ventricular fibrillation, improves cardiodynamics, reduces release of cytosolic enzymes, and preserves energy-rich phosphates and glycogen stores. In anesthetized animals, intracoronary BK is followed by comparable beneficial changes and limits infarct size. Inhibition of breakdown of BK and related peptides induces beneficial cardiac effects. Treatment with ACE inhibitors such as ramipril increases cardiac kinin levels and reduces post-ischemic reperfusion injuries in isolated rat hearts and infarct size in anesthetized animals. The importance of an intact endothelium that continuously generates kinins is supported by observations that basal and ramipril-induced release of kinins and PGI2 is markedly reduced after deendothelialization of isolated hearts. Blockade of B2 kinin receptors increases ischemia-induced effects. Endothelial formation of NO and PGI2 by ACE inhibition is prevented by the specific B2 kinin receptor antagonist icatibant. In isolated hearts, ischemia-reperfusion injuries deteriorate with icatibant, which also abolishes the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and of exogenous BK. Infarct size reduction by ACE inhibitors and by BK in anesthetized animals is reversed by icatibant. Kinins contribute to the cardioprotective effects associated with ischemic preconditioning because preconditioning or BK-induced antiarrhythmic and infarct size-limiting effects are attenuated by icatibant. In conclusion, kinins may act as mediators of endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms. Kinins are generated and released during ischemia, with subsequent formation of PGI2 and NO probably derived mainly from the coronary vascular endothelium. Their cardioprotective profile resembles that of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "418": "Receptors for bradykinin (BK) were characterized in primary cultures of beating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using [3H]BK was radioligand. Degradation studies demonstrated that [3H]BK was stable for at least 2 h when incubated with cardiomyocytes at 2 and 37 degrees C in the presence of bacitracin in combination with captopril or ramiprilat. Without these inhibitors, > 80% of the [3H]BK was degraded within 2 h at 37 degrees C. This indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is responsible for the main BK-degrading activity in cardiomyocytes. Scatchard plots were linear and gave a Kd of 1.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/l (mean +/- SD, n = 4) and a maximum binding capacity of 55-125 fmol/mg protein. Association and dissociation studies showed that binding of [3H]BK was saturable and reversible. Binding of [3H]BK at 37 degrees C led to internalization of the ligand. Competition studies with B1 and B2 agonists and antagonists were consistent with a B2 subtype of receptor. Addition of BK to beating cardiomyocytes (> 1 nmol/l) at 37 degrees C gave a strong but transient negative chronotropic effect. This response was paralleled by changes in the pulsation amplitude, which indicated a simultaneous negative inotropic effect of BK. These results provide a basis for the hypothesis that ACE inhibition exerts its cardioprotective effect at the level of a population of cardiomyocytes by virtue of kinin receptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "419": "Because of the importance of bradykinin in improving heart function in some conditions or in enhancing glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, we investigated kininases in these tissues. In P3 fraction of the heart and skeletal muscles, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) are the major kininases, as determined first with specific substrates and second with bradykinin. ACE activity was highest in guinea pig heart (2.7 +/- 0.07 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1) but decreased in other species in this order: dog atrium, rat heart, dog ventricle, and human atrium. The specific activity of NEP was lower: 0.45 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1 in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes and varying between 0.12 and 0.05 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1 in human, dog, rat, and guinea pig heart. In the skeletal muscle P3, ACE was most active in guinea pig and rat (1.2 and 1.1 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1, respectively) but less so in dog (0.09 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1). NEP activity was higher in dog P3 (0.28 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1) but lower in rat and guinea pig (0.19 and 0.1 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1, respectively). Continuous density gradient centrifugation enriched NEP activity in dog and rat (from 0.3 to 1.0 and 0.49 mumol.h-1.mg protein-1, respectively). Immunoprecipitation with antiserum to purified NEP proved the specificity of the rat enzyme. Bradykinin (0.1 mmol/l) was inactivated in the presence and absence of inhibitors by rat skeletal muscle NEP, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Here, 36% of the activity was caused by NEP and 19% by ACE. In radioimmunoassay (bradykinin 10 nmol/l), 46 and 55% of kininase in rat and dog skeletal muscle P3, respectively, was due to ACE; 36 and 28%, respectively, was due to NEP. Aside from these enzymes, an aminopeptidase in rat P3 also inactivates bradykinin. Thus, in conclusion, heart and skeletal muscle membranes contain kininase II-type enzymes, but their activity depends on the species.", 
    "420": "Insulin resistance of skeletal muscle glucose disposal underlies the pathogenesis of NIDDM and is associated with hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used primarily in antihypertensive therapy but also are known to improve whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal. However, the exact site of action is not well characterized. We have used the isolated epitrochlearis muscle from a well-established animal model of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, the obese Zucker rat, to test the effect of oral administration of ACE inhibitors on insulin-sensitive muscle glucose transport activity. Both acute and chronic administration of a sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor (captopril) or a non-sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor (tran-dolapril) significantly enhanced in vitro insulin-mediated muscle glucose transport activity. In addition, the acute effect of oral captopril administration was completely abolished by pretreatment of the animal with a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (HOE 140). These findings indicate that ACE inhibitors may improve whole-body glucose metabolism by acting on the insulin-sensitive skeletal muscle glucose transport system. In addition, bradykinin or one of its metabolites may be involved in the action of the ACE inhibitor captopril on insulin-resistant muscle.", 
    "421": "We measured the sensitivity of glucose metabolism to insulin in soleus muscle preparations isolated from spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats and normotensive age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. SH rats were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril (1 mg/kg) and/or a second antihypertensive drug, the calcium antagonist verapamil, alone (100 mg/kg) or as combination therapy (50 mg/kg). Treatment of SH rats with trandolapril or trandolapril in combination with verapamil for 6 weeks normalized the blood pressure. The estimated concentration of insulin required for half-maximal stimulation of glycogen synthesis (i.e., EC50 values) was approximately 500 microU/ml for muscles from both WKY and SH rats. This value is five times higher than the value obtained from soleus muscle preparations isolated from insulin-sensitive Wistar rats. This indicates that glycogen synthesis is insensitive to insulin in SH and WKY rat soleus muscle. Treatment of SH rats with trandolapril with or without verapamil improved the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to insulin in soleus muscle. Further experiments investigated whether acute exposure (1 h) of insulin-sensitive skeletal muscle with either trandolaprilat (the active metabolite of trandolapril) or bradykinin (levels of which may be raised by ACE inhibition) could affect the insulin-stimulated rate of glucose metabolism. These results show that both trandolaprilat and bradykinin caused a small but significant increase in the rates of glucose metabolism. In conclusion, 1) SH and WKY rat skeletal muscle was insulin resistant, 2) chronic treatment of SH rats with trandolapril with or without verapamil normalized blood pressure and improved the response of glycogen metabolism to insulin, and 3) bradykinin and trandolaprilat acutely caused a small but significant increase in the rate of glycogen synthesis to a submaximal physiological concentration of insulin.", 
    "422": "Using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp and the human forearm technique, we have demonstrated that the improved glucose disposal rate observed after the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as captopril may be primarily due to increased muscle glucose uptake (MGU). These results are not surprising because ACE, which is identical to the bradykinin (BK)-degrading kininase II, is abundantly present in muscle tissue, and its inhibition has been observed to elicit the observed metabolic actions via elevated tissue concentrations of BK and through a BK B2 receptor site in muscle and/or endothelial tissue. These findings are supported by several previous studies. Exogenous BK applied into the brachial artery of the human forearm not only augmented muscle blood flow (MBF) but also enhanced the rate of MGU. In another investigation, during rhythmic voluntary contraction, both MBF and MGU increased in response to the higher energy expenditure, and the release of BK rose in the blood vessel, draining the working muscle tissue. Inhibition of the activity of the BK-generating protease in muscle tissue (kallikrein) with aprotinin significantly diminished these functional responses during contraction. Applying the same kallikrein inhibitor during the infusion of insulin into the brachial artery significantly reduced the effect of insulin on glucose uptake into forearm muscle. This is of interest, because in recent studies insulin has been suggested to elicit its actions on MBF and MGU via the accelerated release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, the generation of which is also stimulated by BK in a concentration-dependent manner. This new evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies sheds new light on the discussion of whether BK may play a role in energy metabolism of skeletal muscle tissue.",

Segmental function within infarcted and remote noninfarcted tissue did not differ between groups. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition limited the decline in function in the adjacent noninfarcted region 8 weeks after infarction.

Conscious rats and dogs were dosed p.o. and i.v.; in both species the plasma bioequivalents are similar at the angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptor sites indicating balanced activity is maintained in vivo. L-163,017 prevents the pressor response to intravenous (i.v.) angiotensin II in the conscious rat, dog, and rhesus monkey. L-163,017 also significantly reduces blood pressure in a renin-dependent model of hypertension, similar to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Enalapril) and an angiotensin AT1 receptor-selective antagonist (L-159,282). These studies indicate that neither the angiotensin AT2 receptor nor bradykinin is important in the acute antihypertensive activity of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.", 
    "434": "Tetanus toxin (TeTX) is a dichain protein that blocks neuroexocytosis, an action attributed previously to Zn(2+)-dependent proteolysis of synaptobrevin (Sbr) by its light chain (LC). Herein, its cleavage of Sbr in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes was shown to be minimized by captopril, an inhibitor of certain metalloendoproteases, whereas this agent only marginally antagonized the inhibition of noradrenaline release, implicating a second action of the toxin. This hypothesis was proven by preparing three mutants (H233A, E234A, H237A) of the LC lacking the ability to cleave Sbr and reconstituting them with native heavy chain. The resultant dichains were found to block synaptosomal transmitter release, albeit with lower potency than that made from wild type LC; as expected, captopril attenuated only the inhibition caused by the protease-active wild type toxin. Moreover, these protease-inactive toxins or their LCs blocked evoked quantal release of transmitter when micro-injected inside Aplysia neurons. TeTX was known to stimulate in vitro a Ca(2+)-dependent transglutaminase (TGase) (Facchiano, F., and Luini, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13267-13271), an affect found here to be reduced by an inhibitor of this enzyme, monodansylcadaverine. Accordingly, treatment of synaptosomes with the latter antagonized the inhibition of noradrenaline release by TeTX while not affecting Sbr cleavage. This drug also attenuated the inhibitory action of all the mutants. Hence, it is concluded that TeTX inhibits neurotransmitter release by proteolysis of Sbr and a protease-independent activation of a neuronal TGase.", 
    "435": "Human myocardial angiotensin II receptors and the angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes were characterised using the partial angiotensin II receptor agonist [125I][Sar1,IIe8]angiotensin II and the selective antagonists losartan (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2'((1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphen yl-4-yl)- methyl]imidazole) and PD 123177 (1-[(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)methyl]-5-(diphenyl-acetyl)- 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazol[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid). The density of angiotensin II receptors was higher in atrial than in ventricular myocardium. Angiotensin AT2 receptors were predominant in atria and ventricles (80-85% of total angiotensin II receptors). Only in isolated, electrically driven atrial trabeculae but not in ventricular preparations, angiotensin II did produce a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect, which was antagonized exclusively by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and which amounted to about 20% of the positive inotropic effect of milrinone and isoprenaline. The application of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril, enalaprilat and ramiprilat had no inotropic effect in either tissue. It is concluded that angiotensin AT1 receptors exclusively mediate direct positive inotropic effects in atrial myocardium. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not produce any inotropic effect, tonic regulation of basal force of contraction by angiotensin II does not occur.", 
    "436": "Cis and trans isomers of X-proline (X-Pro) bonds can influence some aspects of the kinetics of peptide metabolism. We previously used the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin, to show that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) preferentially hydrolyzes the trans isomer of a synthetic tripeptide that contains a C-terminal proline (Dawson et al., Am J Physiol 257:H853-H865, 1989; Merker et al., J Appl Physiol 75: 1519-1524, 1993). Bradykinin (Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) exists as both cis and trans isomers at all three X-Pro bonds, and although its inactivation in the lung by pulmonary endothelial peptidases is extensive, commonly a small fraction of the peptide survives passage through the lung. To determine whether the presence of cis X-Pro bonds might limit the extent of bradykinin metabolism in the lung, we studied inactivation of bradykinin by the isolated perfused rat lung using the rabbit jugular vein superfused with the pulmonary venous effluent as a bioassay for bradykinin. A large fraction (> 90%) of the bradykinin in a bolus injection was inactivated in a single transit through the pulmonary circulation, but a detectable fraction emerged in the venous effluent. The addition of cyclophilin to the bradykinin in the bolus reduced the bradykinin emerging from the lungs to virtually undetectable levels. When the isomerase inhibitor cyclosporin A was included with bradykinin and cyclophilin in the injectate, this effect of cyclophilin was reversed. These observations suggest that the fraction of bradykinin that normally survives passage through the lungs contains isomers that have at least one X-Pro bond that is refractory to enzymatic inactivation and whose isomerization time constant is significantly longer than the pulmonary capillary transit time.",

A novel series of alpha-thio dipeptides containing central cyclic non-natural amino acids were prepared and were evaluated for their ability to inhibit these two metallopeptidases in vitro and in vivo. Most of these compounds were found to be excellent dual inhibitors of ACE and NEP in vitro and several were also found to inhibit angiotensin-I (AI) pressor response in conscious rats when given by intravenous administration. Compound 6n, one of our most potent dual inhibitors in vitro, was found to be more efficacious than captopril in the AI pressor experiment when administered orally to conscious rats. This compound was also found to inhibit plasma NEP activity following oral administration to conscious rats and was more efficacious than acetorphan. The structure-activity relationships and biological activity of these dual inhibitors will be discussed.",

    "449": "Perturbed angular correlation of gamma-rays (PAC) spectroscopy has been used to investigate the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) of rabbit lung. By substituting the zinc ions in ACE with excited 111mCd2+ ions, analysis of PAC spectra gave directly the percentage of cadmium ions bound to ACE. The result of the analysis was a dissociation constant of about 1 microM for the cadmium-ACE complex, and a stoichiometry of two moles cadmium/mole enzyme. Cadmium binding is thus about two orders of magnitude weaker than zinc binding to ACE but two orders of magnitude stronger than cobalt binding. PAC spectra monitor the nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI) for 111mCd. The NQI for ACE exhibits very low frequencies in the PAC spectra with a rather large spectral broadening. In the presence of the inhibitor ramiprilat, the frequencies increase but the spectral broadening is about the same as for ACE without inhibitor. When the inhibitor captopril is added, very high frequencies are obtained consistent with sulfur binding, but now with a narrower distribution of NQI's. A simple molecular orbital analysis of the obtained NQI's has been performed, using a coordination sphere of two His, one Glu residue and a solvent ligand, equivalent to the zinc ligands in thermolysin and carboxypeptidase. The calculated spectral parameters could be modelled with the measured parameters if the solvent ligand is H2O in free ACE, carboxylate from ramiprilat in the ACE-ramiprilat complex and a mercapto group in the ACE-captopril complex. The coordination geometry for cadmium carboxypeptidase obtained by X-ray diffraction gives a calculated set of NQI parameters consistent with the measured parameters for cadmium in the captopril-ACE complex using a mercapto group as the solvent ligand. However, for ACE and its complex with ramiprilat, a significant distortion of the cadmium geometry for carboxypeptidase A had to be adopted in order to calculate NQI's close to the experimental values.", 
    "450": "Cardiac volume overload by an aortocaval shunt increases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and plasma and cardiac renin activity and results in LV hypertrophy. To a similar extent, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril and quinapril prevent the increase in LVEDP. However, only quinapril attenuates the development of LV hypertrophy. We hypothesize that a low affinity of enalapril for cardiac ACE results in continuing generation of cardiac angiotensin II and thus hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes.",

Aortocaval shunt increased LV angiotensin II by 100% and 65% at 1 and 7 days, respectively. Both blockers similarly prevented the increase in plasma angiotensin II by aortocaval shunt at both time points. In contrast, only quinapril prevented the rise in LV angiotensin II induced by shunt at 1 and 7 days.",

    "456": "In chronic heart failure, a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor only partially suppresses aldosterone despite the fact that aldosterone has many harmful effects independent of angiotensin II. These possible harmful effects of aldosterone are magnesium loss, increased cardiac sympathetic activity, and increased ventricular arrhythmias. We have therefore assessed whether adding the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, to a loop diuretic and ACE inhibitor reverses any of these potentially harmful effects of residual aldosterone. In a preliminary animal study, we found that exogenous aldosterone reduced myocardial norepinephrine uptake by 24% in anesthetized rats in vivo. In our main study, 42 patients with New York Heart Association II to III congestive heart failure were randomized to spironolactone (50 to 100 mg/day, titrated to blood pressure and plasma potassium) or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Our principal finding is that cardiac norepinephrine uptake as assessed by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy increased with spironolactone (p < 0.01). Spironolactone also elevated plasma magnesium (p < 0.05), reduced urinary magnesium excretion (p < 0.05), and caused a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (p < 0.05). Spironolactone increased plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone (p < 0.01), 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (p < 0.05), and urinary sodium/potassium ratio (p < 0.01).

    "457": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the cornerstone of congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, but these drugs are not tolerated in up to 20% of patients. For these patients, therapeutic alternatives with comparable efficacy are needed. Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were examined and compared with enalapril using a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, peak oxygen consumption < 20 ml.min-1.kg-1, and symptoms of CHF despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin. After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in peak oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds). Quality-of-life parameters were affected slightly better by felodipine than by enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by 12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p < 0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally well tolerated. These data suggest that felodipine and enalapril have comparable effects on exercise parameters in patients with CHF. Neurohumoral activation was not observed with either drug.", 
    "458": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) are logically proposed for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure because of their effect on reducing arteriol resistance. When administered early after myocardial infarction, CEI reduce mortality, particularly patients with severely deteriorated myocardium. Up to 74 lives can be saved for every 1000 patients treated. This beneficial effect is additive with that resulting from aspirin, beta-blockers and fibrinolysis. The effect occurs within the first month of treatment if initiated within the first 24 hours following the infarction, and persists even if treatment is discontinued. Tolerance is generally good, but dosage must be adapted in case of hypotension or temporary renal failure. Macroproteinuric nephropathy in insulin-dependent-diabetes is another indication for CEI. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to slow progression of renal failure and decrease the risk of death and of chronic dialysis. Further studies are being conducted to determine the effect of CEI in non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Finally, experimental arguments suggest that atherosclerosis is partly dependent on the renin/angiotensin system and that CEI might inhibit its development. Most clinical trials evaluating the action of CEI on atheromatosis have studied the effect in the carotid and coronary arteries.", 
    "459": "In rats, chronic administration of the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) causes arterial hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial ischemic alterations such as necrosis and fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the effect of 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril maleate on cardiac weight and on the development of the histological alterations induced by L-NAME. Enalapril significantly inhibited the development of both arterial hypertension (117.2 +/- 5.8, 161.8 +/- 8.8 and 122.0 +/- 10.6 mm Hg, for control, L-NAME- and L-NAME + enalapril-treated animals, respectively) and left ventricular hypertrophy (1.36 +/- 0.13, 1.60 +/- 0.04 and 1.48 +/- 0.05 mg/g, for control, L-NAME- and L-NAME + enalapril-treated animals, respectively), but had no effect on the myocardial lesions.

    "460": "The mechanism of the NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA)-induced pressor response was examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The pressor effect of L-NNA (50 mg/kg, i.v.) was significantly and equally diminished by pretreatment with either hexamethonium (25 mg/kg, i.v.) or phentolamine (5 mg/kg, i.v.). The intracisternal administration of L-NNA (1 mg/kg), which did not cause changes in cardiovascular parameters when administered systemically, produced a significant pressor response and tachycardia. Furthermore, significant suppression of L-NNA-induced pressor responses was observed after treatment of dogs with captopril (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan (10 mg/kg, i.v.), or bilateral occlusion of renal veins. The inhibitory effects of hexamethonium and losartan were additive. These results suggest that, in addition to vasoconstriction due to the inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide production, increased activity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems contributes significantly to the development of pressor responses produced by the intravenous injection of L-NNA in anesthetized dogs.", 
    "461": "That the cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity is impaired in dogs with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has been shown previously. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevents or delays the development of abnormalities of cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in dogs with LV dysfunction. Serial changes in LV volumes and neurohumoral profiles (plasma norepinephrine and renin activity) were assessed in conscious dogs with progressive LV dysfunction due to rapid ventricular pacing. Enalapril 5 mg orally twice daily was administered from days 4 to 12 of pacing. Cardiopulmonary baroreflexes were assessed in enalapril-treated paced dogs (n = 8) and untreated paced dogs (n = 8) by recording changes in renal nerve activity and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during volume infusion in anesthetized sinoaortic denervated dogs on day 12 of rapid pacing. There was no difference in LV volume in the two groups. Neurohumoral factors were similar in both groups except for the expected high plasma renin activity in enalapril-treated dogs. Hemodynamic parameters also were comparable in the two groups. Cardiopulmonary baroreflex sensitivity for enalapril-treated dogs was not different from that of untreated paced dogs, and baroreflex gain in both groups was significantly lower than for the nonpaced control dogs (P < .05). Despite adequate converting enzyme blockade, treatment with enalapril failed to prevent the development of attenuated cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity in dogs with developing LV dysfunction.", 
    "462": "The clinical results of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Treatment Trial have been published previously, but no evaluation of cost-effectiveness based on the primary data has been reported. The authors used a decision analytic model based on primary data from SOLVD to estimate years of survival (overall, by New York Heart Association Class, and quality-adjusted) and to estimate costs of nonfatal hospitalizations, ambulatory care, therapy with enalapril, and deaths. Clinical and resource utilization data were derived from participants in SOLVD, and cost data were derived from the United States. Therapy with enalapril during the approximate 48-month follow-up period in SOLVD resulted in a gain of 0.16 year of life and savings of dollars 718. During the patient's lifetime, a survival benefit of 0.40 year, a cost per year of life saved of dollars 80, and a cost per quality-adjusted life year of dollars 115 with the use of enalapril were projected. The results indicated a net savings and gain in life expectancy during the SOLVD treatment trial. The lifetime projection suggests that therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as enalapril, is extremely attractive when compared with many commonly used interventions in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure.", 
    "463": "Using M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiography, the effects of enalapril on left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in essential hypertension and the relation between improvement in these two parameters and duration of hypertension were evaluated. The subjects, 30 previously untreated hypertensive patients, were divided into nonhypertrophy (18 patients) and hypertrophy (12 patients) groups. All patients received enalapril at a daily dose of 5 to 10 mg for 6 months. Left ventricular mass by M-mode echocardiography and LV inflow (LVIF) velocity by transthoracic pulsed Doppler echocardiography were measured before and after enalapril therapy. In the nonhypertrophy group, enalapril significantly increased peak early diastolic LVIF (E) velocity (P < .05), slightly lowered peak atrial systolic LVIF (A) velocity, significantly decreased their ratio (A/E) (P < .01), and significantly shortened both the deceleration time, from the peak of the early diastolic wave, and isovolumic relaxation time (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). In the hypertrophy group, enalapril significantly increased E (P < .05), slightly lowered A, significantly decreased A/E (P < .05), slightly shortened the deceleration time and isovolumic relaxation time, and slightly decreased LV mass. The administration of enalapril correlated significantly and positively with the duration of hypertension and the rates of change in A/E and LV mass in all of the hypertensive patients (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). These results suggest that long-term administration of enalapril to hypertensive patients improves LV diastolic hemodynamics regardless of the presence or absence of LV hypertrophy and that the effects are most remarkable in patients with the shortest duration of hypertension.", 
    "464": "Although atrial fibrillation is common in patients with heart failure, patients with atrial fibrillation are often excluded from congestive heart failure trials or are not analyzed separately. Consequently, while the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with sinus rhythm is well established, the effect on patients with atrial fibrillation is unknown. The authors hypothesized that these agents might be particularly effective in this patient category, given their antiadrenergic properties and the importance of adequate rate control. Therefore, the effects of lisinopril 10 mg once daily were evaluated in 30 patients with congestive heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation (mean age, 68 +/- 6 years) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. All patients were in New York Heart Association class II or III and were stable on conventional therapy (digoxin, diuretics, nitrates). After 6 weeks, mean peak oxygen consumption increased from 14.7 +/- 3.4 to 15.9 +/- 2.9 mL/min/kg in the lisinopril group (P = .034). Plasma norepinephrine levels during exercise and at peak exercise tended to be lower when the patients were taking lisinopril (10.8 +/- 4.2 to 8.9 +/- 4.4 nmol/L and 16.3 +/- 9.2 to 14.3 +/- 7.7 nmol/L, P < .1). Heart rate during exercise and ambulatory monitoring was not significantly affected. Left ventricular fractional shortening tended to increase after lisinopril (23 +/- 7 to 27 +/- 9%, P = .073). Left atrial volume was unchanged, as were plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels. After subsequent electrical cardioversion, treatment was continued for 6 more weeks, allowing assessment of the effect of lisinopril on maintenance of sinus rhythm; maintenance of sinus rhythm was 71% in the lisinopril group and 36% in the placebo group (P = NS). This study shows that treatment with an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor improves peak oxygen consumption in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. Attenuation of adrenergic drive during exercise may play a role in mediating this effect.", 
    "465": "26 patients with hypertension while on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal diseases were treated first with enalapril and then changed to metoprolol. Both drugs were shown to be similarly effective in controlling blood pressure. There was no difference between the two drugs in their effects on renal function, potassium balance, lipid profile, cardiac function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Mild worsening of anemia was observed during treatment with enalapril. No serious side effects were reported. Use of enalapril is safe in the treatment of hypertension in dialysis patients.", 
    "466": "Anemia has been frequently reported in renal transplant recipients receiving azathioprine for immunosuppression and enalapril for treatment of hypertension. During the course of a prospective trial in such patients we determined azathioprine metabolites in erythrocytes, plasma, and urine as well as erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels in order to evaluate a potential interaction between these 2 drugs, possibly leading to anemia. Two specific high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for determination of azathioprine metabolites, both employing a mercurial cellulose resin for extraction, are presented. One method using a strong anion exchange column allows detection of 6-thioguanosine di- and triphosphate (thioguanine nucleotides) in red blood cells (RBC) with a sensitivity of 30 pmol/100 microliters RBC. 6-mercaptopurine (MP) and 6-thiouric acid (TUA) in plasma and urine were analyzed simultaneously by reversed-phase HPLC with a sensitivity of 5 ng/ml. The average (median values are given) steady state concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides in erythrocytes came to 267 pmol/100 microliters RBC (range 53-613) with and to 246 pmol/100 microliters RBC (range 39-629) without concomitant enalapril medication. Mean plasma concentrations of MP and TUA 3 hours after drug intake came to 14.8 +/- 9.9 ng/ml and 398 +/- 262 ng/ml, respectively, during enalapril comedication. Withdrawal of enalapril did not influence these metabolite levels coming to 15.3 +/- 9.1 and 451 +/- 253 after stopping enalapril treatment. Thioguanine nucleotides in RBCs were neither related to the dose of azathioprine given (r = -0.113, p > 0.05) nor to hemoglobin levels (r = 0.278, p > 0.05). However, azathioprine dose/kg body weight seemed to be related to hemoglobin concentration, with and without enalapril comedication. We conclude that enalapril therapy does not influence the measured azathioprine metabolites, the reported cases of anemia may rather be due to a pharmacodynamic interaction as shown by the significant increase in erythropoietin after withdrawal of enalapril. The assays described here are suitable to study the metabolism of azathioprine in patients with various diseases.", 
    "467": "The pharmacokinetics of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often difficult to characterize using standard tools. Most of the problems arise from the tight binding of ACE inhibitors to ACE. The present paper discusses how tight binding of ramiprilat to ACE affects the pharmacokinetic characteristics and in vitro measurement of ACE inhibition. Data from a randomized crossover study in healthy volunteers given 2 different dosage forms with 5 mg ramipril serve to compare the theoretically deduced predictions with actual measurements. The data confirm that elimination is concentration-dependent and that therefore the pharmacokinetics are non-linear. Renal clearance increases with concentration. With respect to pharmacodynamics, free ramiprilat depletion due to tight binding is the reason for the steep nature of concentration-effect curves often observed for ACE inhibition. This type of relationship, however, cannot be described by the classical Emax model nor by the sigmoid Emax model. The model of tight binding presented shows that the concentration-effect curve becomes steeper the larger the concentration of ACE and the greater the affinity of the inhibitor to the target molecule. With the classical Emax model the concentration can be doubled about 3 times to increase the measurable effect from 10 to 50% maximum effect, and because the relationship is symmetric at the EC50% point of inflection, the concentration can be doubled another 3 times to increase the effect from 50 to 90%. With the tight-binding concentration-effect relationship, doubling the concentration about 3 times may also increase the effect from 10 to 50% of the maximum effect, a further doubling of the dose, however, causes a steep increase of the effect from 50 to nearly 100%. This tight-binding concentration-effect relationship may also be present in other classes of drugs.",

In nephrectomized SHR, Hoe 140 alone or cilazapril in combination with Hoe 140 (7 or 70 mu g/kg per day) induced no changes in these parameters, other than those associated with the effects of cilazapril alone. In nephrectomized WKY rats, cilazapril in combination with Hoe 140 (70 mu g/kg per day) slightly, but not significantly, attenuated the antihypertensive effect of cilazapril but did not affect the other parameters.

The growth-promoting effect of angiotensin II is mediated by the AT1 receptor and is associated with the increased expression of growth factors and immediate early genes. In endothelial cells, this effect is counteracted by the antiproliferative actions of the AT2 receptor.

These three agents increased RBF to about the same degree, between 6% and 18%, which was relatively large compared with the maximal vasodilator response achievable in the kidney with acetylcholine (30-37%). Captopril given intra-arterially had a more consistent effect on Na+ excretion rate than either ramiprilat or EXP 3174. An increase in Na+ excretion rate occurred with captopril ranging from 44% to 78%, whereas no significant change was obtained with the other drugs. The dose of captopril that increased RBF was the same as that which increased Na+ excretion rate. In those experiments in which ramiprilat resulted in an increase in Na+ excretion rate (five of 10 experiments), the effective dose was the same as that which increased RBF.",

Renal blood flow was increased by either losartan or captopril. In the binding study, losartan produced a single displacement curve (IC50 = 0.25 mumol/l), while the Ang II subtype-2 (AT2) receptor antagonist PD123319 did not, indicating that the predominant Ang II receptor is type-1 (AT1) in canine heart. Neither the ratio of AT1 to AT2 receptors nor the receptor density changed with the development of heart failure.",

Whether calcium antagonists prevent or reduce the rate of progression of renal damage is still a matter of controversy. This paper reviews the findings of recent animal and human studies on the haemodynamic and renal protective effects of calcium antagonists. These agents preferentially vasodilate afferent arterioles, leading to an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. These effects are more pronounced in hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects and persist even when renal function is impaired. In animal models of chronic renal failure, calcium antagonists can reduce glomerulosclerosis. However, the mechanisms involved in their renal protective effect appear to be different from those of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as they do not reduce intraglomerular pressure. Renal failure caused by vasoconstriction related to radiocontrast agents or cyclosporine can be partly prevented by the administration of a calcium antagonist. Furthermore, in patients with renal artery stenosis, calcium antagonists reduce blood pressure with less renal blood flow impairment than ACE inhibitors. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that verapamil or diltiazem may reduce proteinuria in hypertensive diabetic patients. Whether these compounds can also retard the progression of renal failure in these patients remains to be established with larger trials.",

Increases in endogenous kinin levels may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors. 2. ACE inhibitors increase vascular levels of both bradykinin-(1-9) and its ACE cleavage product bradykinin-(1-7), at doses below the threshold for ACE inhibition, leading to the proposal that ACE inhibitors may also inhibit a non-ACE kininase which cleaves both kinin peptides; this non-ACE kininase may be the major pathway of kinin metabolism in the vasculature and some other tissues. 3. In support of this proposal, ACE inhibitors potentiate bradykinin-(1-9) effects at doses which have little or no effect on ACE activity, as indicated by angiotensin I conversion to angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors also potentiate the actions of ACE-resistant kinin analogues, which may be susceptible to metabolism by a non-ACE kininase. 4. Identification and characterization of the putative non-ACE kininase which is inhibited by ACE inhibitors may reveal novel approaches to the tissue-specific modulation of kinin levels.", 
    "520": "Hypertension is known to occur much more frequently in blacks than in the general population, roughly 33% to 50% more frequently. In addition, severe hypertension occurs 3 to 7 times more commonly in blacks than whites and is associated with an excessive amount of target organ damage. Thus, damage to the heart, kidneys, and cerebral structures may occur as much as three to five times more frequently in blacks than the general population and is associated with a much greater mortality. Because of differences in clinical presentation, delays in entering the medical care system, and some pathophysiologic features specific for the black population, treatment becomes somewhat more challenging and should be tailored for this population. Because of economic factors often found in minority populations, inexpensive effective drugs such as diuretics and beta-blockers, which are preferred drugs according to the JNC-V, often should be given first consideration in this population. However, calcium channel blockers seem to be quite effective in this group, equal to in the white population, although they are somewhat more expensive. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, if given in proper dosage and especially with low dose diuretics, are also quite effective in this population. Tissue specific angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be more effective, but further studies are needed. Studies have shown that effective treatment of the black population, in spite of the differences and the more challenging situation, can result in improved survival and reduction in morbidity and mortality from the various complications.", 
    "521": "Diabetes mellitus and hypertension each confer increased cardiovascular risk. That risk is much greater when the diseases coexist and is further magnified by their frequent association with dyslipidemia and central obesity. Insulin resistance appears to be an important common component to these four entities, whether or not the relationship is truly cause and effect. Increased renal tubule absorption of sodium and increased sympathetic nervous system stimulation from insulin have been said to be the mechanisms by which elevated levels of insulin cause hypertension. However, animal experiments suggest that these are short-term effects only and that long-term insulin may actually increase peripheral blood flow and reduce blood pressure. Experiments in humans suggest that the insulin resistant state in obese patients and type II diabetics is associated with a decrease of the usual vasodilatory effect of insulin. Antihypertensive drugs have differing effects on insulin resistance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and dihydropyridines appear to improve insulin sensitivity. Other calcium channel blockers appear to be neutral, as is furosemide. Thiazide diuretics, spironolactone, and beta-adrenergic blockers impair insulin sensitivity. The drugs that increase insulin sensitivity also tend to improve dyslipidemia or remain lipid neutral. In contrast, those drugs that tend to impair insulin sensitivity also tend to worsen dyslipidemia.",

These effects, which are seen with thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics but not with spironolactone, are independent of body weight but are strongly dose-related. beta-BLOCKING AGENTS: beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have adverse effects on lipid metabolism, but beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity do not. From the metabolic point of view, the latter type of beta-blockers represent the ideal choice, but they are rarely used today. All types of beta-blockers can cause an increase in fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS AND CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Neither ACE inhibitors nor calcium antagonists show any negative effects on glucose and/or lipid metabolism. ACE inhibitors have even been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral, and there is evidence that combining an ACE inhibitor or calcium antagonist with a diuretic can reduce the adverse effects of the latter. ANTI-OXIDATION: Some calcium antagonists show a dose-dependent anti-oxidative activity. Lacidipine has the greatest anti-oxidative activity of the commonly used calcium channel blockers. Among ACE inhibitors, only captopril has anti-oxidative activity.",

This is in reasonable agreement with guidelines prepared by other regulatory authorities. CLINICAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT: Satisfactory preclinical data on a new compound are used to obtain authorization for human testing from the National Committees on Safety of Medicines. Clinical trials are performed in four phases, ranging from phase I studies performed on healthy volunteers (n = 20-50) to postmarketing (phase IV) studies. The latter are of great importance as they cover large patient populations (n = 2000 to > or = 10,000) and allow detection of rare adverse drug reactions. ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS: Type B reactions are serious, unpredictable reactions to a drug that necessitate treatment withdrawal. Type A reactions are dose-dependent, and represent the majority of adverse reactions. They are often managed by dose reduction rather than drug withdrawal. ADVERSE REACTIONS TO ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS: Examples of type B adverse reactions to antihypertensives are the cutaneous and ocular reactions to practolol, and angioneurotic oedema associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Lacidipine, a second-generation calcium antagonist, is an example of a modern antihypertensive agent with a favourable safety profile. The adverse reactions associated with lacidipine are mild to moderate and of the A type, the major ones being those typical of calcium antagonists (headache, flushing and pedal oedema due to vasodilation.",

There was no significant change in any of the other renal function tests: CCT, serum creatinine, uric acid, K+ and blood pressure. However, there were three cases of PET just prior to delivery. Maternal glycaemic control improved significantly prior to conception (P = 0.002) and remained euglycaemic (reflected by daily glucose profile, HbA1C and fructosamine) throughout gestation.

It is associated with an increased risk of complications due to thromboembolic events and has traditionally been treated by intermittent venesection. More recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to cause a fall in haematocrit in a number of groups of subjects and some uncontrolled studies have shown these drugs to be of possible therapeutic benefit in post renal transplant erythrocytosis.",

    "535": "Three new strategies for sampling the conformation space accessible to a series of structurally diverse, flexible molecules are defined and compared to samples obtained using a fixed-grid torsion angle sampling strategy. A set of 28 potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme selected by Mayer et al. [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 1 (1987) 3] and the unrestricted active-site model proposed by Waller et al. [to be published] are used to produce a realistic experimental setting. We modified our Constrained Search algorithm [Dammkoehler et al., J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 3 (1989) 3] to support these new sampling strategies, performing a series of 64 simulations (search experiments) and generating a large set of sterically allowed conformations. In each experiment, we systematically vary the internal torsion angles in each molecule using one of the sampling strategies. The common orientations of preselected functional groups thought to represent those dominating the interaction with the enzyme and presented by the set of molecules are classified and recorded for each experiment. Pairwise distances between groups are used to characterize the geometry of the common orientations. The results of each experiment, represented by a set of distance values, are compared and combined to evaluate the completeness of the conformational sampling. While no pure strategy or single search experiment was found to be adequate to fully explore the set of common sterically allowed conformations, a new sampling technique, called adaptive radial sampling, is shown to be significantly more complete than the commonly used fixed grid sampling.", 
    "536": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new ACE inhibitor trandolapril was able to inhibit brain ACE activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Therefore, we have measured ex vivo ACE activity in discrete brain areas of SHRs after a 2-week oral treatment with trandolapril (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day). The effects of trandolapril were compared to those of enalapril (10 mg/kg/day), used as a reference compound. Enalapril induced a decrease in ACE activity in brain areas not protected by the blood brain barrier (subfornical organ and median eminence) and in cerebral cortex. Conversely, trandolapril at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day and above induced a dose-dependent inhibition of ACE activity in all brain areas assayed, including the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, septum, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellar and cerebral cortex, nucleus of the tractus solitary and caudate nucleus. The inhibition was roughly similar in all brain areas studied. These data suggest that after chronic oral administration in SHRs, trandolapril or its metabolite, in contrast to enalapril or enalaprilat, was able to reach all brain areas of SHRs, including those protected by the blood brain barrier.", 
    "537": "The objective of the MACH1 study (MEMS for the Assessment of Compliance of Hypertensives) was to evaluate the real behaviour of patients in relation to antihypertensive treatment administered as a single daily dose. After a 2-week period during which no other antihypertensive was allowed to be administered, 590 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension received 2 mg of trandolapril as a single daily dose in the morning between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. for 4 weeks. Treatment was packaged in electronic pillboxes recording the date and time of each opening. Various profiles were distinguished on the basis of the individual chronograms for the 501 patients able to be analysed in terms of compliance, and as a function of the deviations observed in relation to the treatment regimen prescribed. One hundred and two patients (20%) omitted more than 20% of the prescribed doses, either consecutive doses or scattered throughout the month of treatment; these patients were referred to as \"omitters\". The other patients were classified according to the scatter of openings in relation to the mean time of the dose: 10 \"metronome\" patients (2%), 126 \"regular\" patients (25%), 221 \"irregular\" patients (44%) and 42 \"anarchic\" patients (8%). Irregularities of dose times were more frequent on public holidays than on week days and in patients living in Paris or the Paris region. \"Metronome\" patients were older than the overall patient population. The use of an electronic pillbox could allow the attending physician to more adequately adapt his therapeutic approach and management of specific problems of compliance observed in hypertensive patients.", 
    "538": "Isolated diastolic hypertension is not officially recognized as a form of hypertension. It is currently defined as a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg with systolic pressure < 140 mmHg. It implies an elevation of vascular resistance in the arteriolar sector and small arteries, and persistence of distensibility of the aorta and large vessels. It therefore predominantly affects young patients with relatively recent HT, without any accentuation of aging of the vessel wall by smoking, diabetes, or atheroma. It is responsible for a reduction of pulse pressure, and does not appear to be associated with deterioration of the prognosis. The demonstration of diastolic HT indicates the presence of excess adrenergic tone with predominance of alpha tone, or raised plasma renin, in the absence of any alteration of myocardial function capable of reducing systolic pressure. Monotherapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which reduce stimulation of growth of smooth muscle fibres, and calcium channel blockers, whose effects increase with increasing vasoconstrictor tone, would be preferable to diuretics and non-selective beta-blockers.", 
    "539": "Neointima formation was induced in the hamster carotid artery by mechanical intraluminal injury with a catheter covered with roughened dental cement, Neointimal thickening occurred as early as 7 days after denudation and further increased during the next 1 to 2 weeks. Proliferation indices of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) showed the highest proportion of proliferating cells in the media and neointima respectively 1 and 5 days after the vascular injury. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of damaged carotid artery sections as well as immuno-histochemical stainings of von Willebrand factor (vWF) confirmed that reendothelialization was progressive and already complete on day 14, at which time the neointima formation was almost complete. In order to pharmacologically characterize this model further, the effects on neointima formation of trapidil (triazolopyrimidine), a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) antagonist, and captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were investigated. Trapidil administered orally twice daily at total doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, started 3 days prior to infliction of injury and up to 7 or 14 days after the catheterization, significantly reduced neointima formation. Captopril administered orally three times daily at a total dose of 100 mg/kg/day, equally reduced neointima formation, with 100 mg/kg/day trapidil being more effective than 100 mg/kg/day captopril 7 days after injury. When the treatment by either one of these drugs was arrested on day 7, neointima formation resumed quickly. The hamster appears to be a small, reproducible and fast model for the study of SMC proliferation, requiring only relatively small amounts of experimental drugs. The model furthermore is sensitive to substances known to reduce neointima formation in other animal models.",

    "545": "To investigate the role of catecholamine and prostacyclin in ischemia reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation, experiments were performed in rat hearts using methods of radioimmunoassay and fluorohistochemistry. Regional myocardial ischemia was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery followed by reperfusion. In the ischemia reperfusion group, ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion took place in 78% of the hearts. In the group pretreated with captopril, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation decreased significantly (65.5%). In comparison with the ischemia reperfusion group, myocardial catecholamine content and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha of the captopril group were significantly increased (P < 0.01) while thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and TxB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha were decreased (P < 0.01). In Ang II group, infusion of angiotensin II reversed the protective effect of captopril and restored the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (85%), while myocardial catecholamine content was not different from the ischemia reperfusion group (P > 0.05). Above results suggest that reduction of the incidence of ischemia reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation by captopril may be due to its inhibition on angiotensin II production with consequent reduction of the release of myocardial catecholamine, suppression of TxB2 and promotion of PGI2 synthesis.",

After a 4-week placebo period, 32 patients (mean age, 51 +/- 9 years) with essential hypertension (average blood pressure of 181.4/104.5 +/- 13.0/6.9 mmHg) were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy (group A, n = 17) or monotherapy (group B, n = 15). After 12 weeks of active treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 16.1% and 13%, respectively, for patients taking combined therapy, and by 12.7% and 9.8%, respectively, for patients taking monotherapy. The difference was significant for between-group comparisons. There were no changes in serum sodium concentration, but a significant similar increase in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was seen in both groups. Serum calcium levels increased slightly and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion decreased significantly in both groups, probably due to chlorthalidone administration. Serum potassium levels increased slightly in group A (from 4.16 +/- 0.39 mmol/L to 4.30 +/- 0.42 mmol/L) and decreased slightly in group B (from 4.18 +/- 0.32 mmol/L to 3.99 +/- 0.49 mmol/L). Urinary potassium excretion did not change significantly in group A, but increased by approximately 15% in group B. There was a decrease in 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion (from 4.01 +/- 1.24 mmol/24 hours to 3.50 +/- 0.93 mmol/24 hours) in group A and an increase (from 3.49 +/- 0.98 mmol/24 hours to 4.35 +/- 1.12 mmol/24 hours) in group B. At the end of the trial these changes were significant in between-group comparisons. Consistent with the previously shown amelioration by ramipril of thiazide-induced metabolic side-effects, ramipril appears to improve magnesium balance during cotreatment with chlorthalidone.",

For example, amiodarone may produce thyroid and corneal injury apart from or in addition to the phospholipidosis seen in the liver. Oral contraceptive steroids remain a rare but important concern for developing hepatic adenomas and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as a risk factor for developing Budd-Chiari syndrome in long-term users. Among the antihyperlipidemic agents, nicotinic acid, especially the sustained release formulations, may produce severe of even fatal hepatic injury.

    "548": "The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with renal diseases of various origins has been well recognized. However, individual responses regarding the degree of decrease in urinary protein excretion appear to vary considerably. The mechanism underlying this variable response to ACE inhibitors has not been clarified yet. A possible role of ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the responsiveness to antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors is examined. Thirty-six patients with proteinuria (23 men and 13 woman; mean age, 47 +/- 13 yr) were studied. These patients were classified into two groups on the basis of the percent decrease in their urinary protein excretion: the effective group, those with a decrease in proteinuria (18 patients, -64 +/- 19%) and the noneffective group (18 patients, +13 +/- 40%). A 287-base pair (bp) I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene was examined by polymerase chain reaction. The allelic frequencies of the ACE gene were I/D = 0.53/0.47 in the effective group and I/D = 0.81/0.19 in the noneffective group. The difference in the allelic frequencies between the two groups was significant (chi 2 = 6.25, P = 0.0114 < 0.05). Furthermore, the difference in the responsiveness of proteinuria to ACE inhibition between genotype II versus genotype ID + DD was statistically significant (chi 2 = 4.05, P = 0.0442 < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to initial urinary protein level, blood pressure, renal function, and daily sodium intake. The genetic susceptibility to the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors was also studied, but no significant relation was observed. This study suggests the association of ACE gene I/D polymorphism with the antiproteinuric efficacy of ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria.",

Unstimulated and paraffin-chewing stimulated whole saliva and 3% citric acid stimulated parotid and submandibular-sublingual (SM-SL) secretion were collected at 10.30 a.m. (about 2h after intake of breakfast) on day 0 (baseline values), day 1 (experimental acute values) and day 7 (experimental chronic values) in each treatment period. In 8 of the subjects, also morning samples were collected at 7.30 a.m., with the test subjects in a fasting condition. Whole saliva was assessed for flow rate and for concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and phosphate. In addition, parotid and SM-SL secretion were assessed for concentrations of total protein, hexosamine, sialic acid, lactoferrin and salivary IgA and for activities of amylase, lysozyme and salivary peroxidase. During treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, the secretion rates tended to increase for unstimulated and paraffin-chewing stimulated whole saliva and for parotid secretion. For salivary composition, no alterations were observed in any of the collected secretions.", 
    "550": "The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of first-line antihypertensive drugs in Japanese patients. Four antihypertensive drugs were studied: trichlormethiazide (TCT), nifedipine retard (NIF), atenolol (ATN), and enalapril malate (ENP). Thirty-eight patients (16 men and 22 women; age, 53.3 +/- 8.8 years, mean +/- SD) were enrolled in the study. After a control period of 2 to 4 weeks, the four drugs were administered according to a randomized, cross-over design, the duration of each treatment period being 8 to 12 weeks. The initial dose of each drug was increased until blood pressure (BP) fell to less than 150/90 mmHg. The maximum doses of TCT, NIF, ATN, and ENP were 4, 40, 50, and 20 mg/day, respectively. The protocol was completed in 25 of the 38 patients. The BPs (SBP/DBP) at the end of each period were 168 +/- 3 (mean +/- SEM)/105 +/- 1 (control), 149 +/- 4/ 98 +/- 2 (TCT), 138 +/- 3/89 +/- 2 (NIF), 151 +/- 4/94 +/- 2 (ATN), and 152 +/- 4/97 +/- 2 mmHg (ENP). The BP during NIF treatment was significantly lower than during the other treatments. This finding suggests that the calcium antagonist had a greater hypotensive effect than the other first-line antihypertensive drugs studied. The subjects seem to more closely resemble black rather than white populations with respect to their response to antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "551": "To evaluate the effect of acute blood pressure (BP) changes on the myocardial perfusion in hypertensives, 10 patients with and 10 patients without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were examined with 99TCm-Sestamibi scintigraphy at rest and after acute pharmacological BP reduction using nifedipine and captopril. Signs of LV ischaemia was quantified as the size of the hypoperfused area defined as isotope uptake below 70% of maximum LV uptake, and LVH was defined as ventricular mass (LVM) > 125 g/m2 BSA by use of echocardiography. Not significant relations between BP and size of the hypoperfused area was found at rest. During BP reduction patients with LVH had negative correlations (r = -0.58) between the size of the hypoperfused area and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r = -0.49) while patients without LVH showed positive correlations (SBP r = 0.60, DBP r = 0.48). The differences in correlation coefficients were significant (P < 0.01) for both. Thus, in hypertensives with LVH, ischaemia may develop at low BP providing a possible mechanism for the observed increased risk of cardiovascular events in some hypertensive patients with low achieved BP during follow-up. Until treatment goals are defined on scientific grounds, BP should not be decreased below 90 mm Hg in subjects with LVH.", 
    "552": "In 19 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and symptoms of congestive heart failure, left ventricular (LV) systolic performance and diastolic velocity profiles were assessed by two- dimensional echocardiography and pulsed wave Doppler at rest and during handgrip exercise before and ninety minutes after administration of captopril (mean dose 25 +/- 12mg; range 12.5-50mg). Although heart rate and blood pressure increased similarly during handgrip exercise before and after captopril treatment, both were lower with handgrip exercise during captopril treatment. The results from this study indicated that acute angiotension converting enzyme inhibition with captopril reduces preload and afterload and ameliorates handgrip exercise-induced LV systolic and diastolic filling dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.",

In aortic rings precontracted with potassium chloride, captopril (1 microM) but not enalaprilat (0.1 microM) incubation potentiated the responses to nitroglycerin. It is suggested that captopril can reduce the tolerance of nitroglycerin because it is a sulfhydryl group donor.", 
    "554": "We studied whether post-renal transplant erythrocytosis (PRTE) could be corrected by enalapril with minimal side-effects, thus avoiding iterative phlebotomies or bilateral nephrectomy of native kidneys. From our renal transplant patients, 12 presented a true PRTE as defined by a 51-Cr red blood cell mass (RBCM) above 32 ml/kg for women and above 36 ml/kg for men. Secondary polycythemia was ruled out: all the patients had a normal renal artery pulsed ultrasonography; in all cases the blood arterial 02 saturation was above 96%. Bone marrow aspiration and histology were performed for each patient: none of them showed evidence of Vaquez disease. All of them had stable renal function i.e. the mean serum creatinine was 112.8 +/- 26.3 mumol/l. They all received the same immunosuppression: azathioprine; ciclosporine A; methylprednisolone. PRTE occurred within the first year post transplant (median 7.5 months; range: 2-34). Their mean RBCM was 37.38 +/- 2.7 ml/kg. Their mean serum value of Epo was 17.41 +/- 13.5 mU/ml (range: 9.1-54). After informed consent, all patients received enalapril starting with 5 mg/day, progressively increased to 20 mg/day, if necessary, in order to maintain the hematocrit below 45%. The mean daily dosage of enalapril was 13.75 +/- 6.1 mg (range: 5-20). The mean follow-up was 14.8 months (range: 3.5-29.5). There was no change in renal function (mean serum creatinine: 126.3 +/- 35 mumol/l). A successful response to enalapril was obtained with a median of 40 days (range: 20-120). 11 patients out of 12 responded to enalapril with a decrease of Hb (14 +/- 2 g/dl vs 16.8 +/- 1.04 g/dl; p = 0.0006) and Ht (41.9 +/- 6.17% vs 51.14 +/- 2%; p = 0.0002) without a significant decrease of Epo (8.1 +/- 3.87; p = 0.1). One patient did not respond to enalapril nor to captopril, but did respond to a combined treatment of enalapril and theophilline. Moreover, all PRTE patients but two did not have Epo levels, before enalapril, above the normal range, suggesting mechanisms other than Epo overproduction by native kidneys i.e. erythropoiesis dysregulation. In conclusion, all patients but one were successfully treated by enalapril without side effects. The treatment was effective as early as 3 weeks from the start and avoided the need for iterative phlebotomies and nephrectomy of native kidneys.", 
    "555": "Paraquat is a broad-spectrum herbicide known to produce lung injury via oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms. Different pharmacological strategies have been explored to reduce the formation of these reactive oxygen species and/or prevent their toxic effects in the treatment of paraquat poisoning. The present study was carried out to investigate whether the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol, incorporated into liposomes and delivered directly to the lungs of rats, could protect the organ against the long-term toxic effects of paraquat. Plain liposomes (composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) or alpha-tocopherol liposomes (8 mg alpha-tocopherol/kg body weight) were administered intratracheally to animals 24 h prior to an intraperitoneal injection of paraquat dichloride (20 mg/kg) and rats were killed 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19 or 24 days after paraquat treatment. Results of this study showed that lungs of animals treated with paraquat were extensively damaged, as evidenced by significant increases in lung weight and decreases in lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and alkaline phosphatase enzyme (AKP) activities. Moreover, paraquat treatment: resulted in a significant reduction in the number of neutrophils in the blood of rats with a concurrent increase in the pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity, suggestive of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of treated animals. Pretreatment of rats with liposomes alone did not significantly alter the paraquat-induced changes of all parameters examined. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with alpha-tocopherol liposomes, 24 h prior to paraquat challenge, attenuated paraquat-induced changes in ACE, AKP and myeloperoxidase activities but failed to prevent increases in lung weight. Thus, pretreatment of rats with liposome-associated alpha-tocopherol appears to protect the lung against some of the toxic effects of paraquat.", 
    "556": "1. Angiotensin II is a well-known vasopressive octapeptide that is the principal end-product of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to its tonic effect on vascular smooth muscle cells, it also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenals and promotes sodium reabsorption through renal tubular cells. 2. These physiological functions have been appreciated for some time, but as details of the molecular and cell biology of the angiotensin response mechanism become understood, it is increasingly apparent that the hormone has a much broader repertoire. Its functional variability is made possible by (i) different enzymatic routes for its generation, (ii) different receptors distributed in different tissues, (iii) different mechanisms for receptor regulation, and (iv) different signal transduction pathways. 3. This insight is the direct consequence of advances in pharmacology that led first to inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and later to angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This review looks at the current status of angiotensin biochemistry and physiology and provides a basis for anticipation of future developments.", 
    "557": "In two-kidney-one-clip (2k-1c) renovascular hypertensive rats, the blood pressure, left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio and blood platelet aggregation were increased significantly. Enalapril (Ena) 6 mg . kg-1 . d-1 ig 9 wk and Taurine 30 mg . kg-1 . d-1 ig 9 wk can not only decrease the high blood pressure, LVW/BW ratio, but also the blood platelet aggregation induced by ADP or thrombin, though still different from that of the normal group. When the 2k-1c renovascular hypertensive rats were treated with both Ena and Tau, the blood pressure and blood platelet aggregation were decreased to the same as that of the normal group, and the LVW/BW ratio was also lowered markedly, though still higher than that of the normal group. These results show that both Ena and Tau can reverse the left ventricular hypertrophy, decrease the blood pressure and suppress the blood platelet aggregation in 2k-1c renovascular hypertensive rats. When treated with both drugs, the effects can be improved. It suggests that the two drugs can enhance the effects when used together, and that they may be two good agents for treatment of hypertension.", 
    "558": "Large-scale trials have demonstrated a consistent mortality reduction from angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy for chronic heart failure. Nonetheless, the pharmacologic and physiologic mechanisms of this favourable affect and the appropriate target population remain controversial. ACE inhibitors exert vasodilator, neurohormonal inhibiting and growth inhibiting effects that may contribute to the clinical response. They improve pump function and prevent ventricular remodelling, but they also may exert an antiarrhythmic effect. They may prevent coronary ischaemic events but appear to reduce cardiovascular event rates even more in non-ischaemic than in ischaemic heart disease. Their efficacy in early stages of asymptomatic heart disease and the optimal dose of the drugs for long-term benefit require further study.", 
    "559": "The poor prognosis in heart failure, which can be reproduced by overloading the normal heart, may reflect molecular abnormalities associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Because terminally differentiated adult cardiac myocytes have little or no capacity to divide, overload-induced hypertrophy represents an unnatural growth response. The mechanism by which this unnatural growth response shortens survival remains speculative, but may involve apoptosis caused when overload reactivates growth factors to which the adult heart cannot respond with normal cell division. The ability of converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates, which have growth inhibitory as well as vasodilator effects, to improve prognosis in heart failure may reflect the ability of these drugs to modify this unnatural growth response.", 
    "560": "In untreated congestive heart failure, aldosterone plasma concentrations are elevated in proportion to the severity of the disease and are further increased by the use of diuretic treatment. Angiotensin II, plasma potassium concentration, and corticotropin are the major stimulators of aldosterone synthesis. During angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, the role of alternative major or minor regulatory mechanisms may become significant. This may explain why during continuous ACE inhibition, after an initial reduction, plasma aldosterone measurements may subsequently increase to pretherapeutic levels. In addition to causing sodium and water retention, aldosterone contributes to hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, which may induce electrical instability and death of cardiac myocytes. Aldosterone is also one factor involved in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which, together with myocardial cell death, may underlie progressive adverse myocardial remodelling. Evidence for a direct vascular effect of aldosterone suggests that this hormone may contribute to generalized vasoconstriction. Elevated plasma aldosterone levels can also contribute to depression of baroreflex sensitivity, and they are associated with increased mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Experimental and clinical research should be further expanded to investigate the potential benefits of opposing the effects of aldosterone by use of specific antagonists or other potentially more potent pharmacological agents with favourable side-effect profiles.", 
    "561": "In addition to inhibition of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, specific inhibition of the cardiac effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) represents an important therapeutic goal in the treatment of clinical heart failure. Subtype 1-specific Ang II receptor (AT1) antagonists have been developed to overcome potential limitations of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, e.g. insufficient control of tissue Ang II production and bradykinin-related side effects. Clinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of AT1 antagonists. In a single-dose study, the AT1 antagonist losartan decreased the mean arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure while increasing the cardiac index. Effects were dose dependent. Haemodynamic effects were greater with higher doses, but neurohormonal counter-regulation probably also increased, leading to relatively high levels of circulating Ang II with the 150-mg dose, A decrease in plasma levels of noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic factor, and aldosterone reached partial significance. Administration of multiple doses of losartan for 12 weeks also led to favourable haemodynamic and clinical results. Arterial blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance decreased. The neurohormonal effects of 12 weeks' administration of AT1 antagonists consisted in a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentrations. Whereas AT1 antagonists may counteract the effects of Ang II on the vasculature, and therefore are effective vasodilators, their direct myocardial effects are less clear. The subtype AT2, which represents the dominant, receptor in both healthy and failing human myocardium, is not blocked by AT1 inhibition. Angiotensin receptors on isolated human cardiac fibroblasts stimulate cellular proliferation via a yet undertermined receptor subtype. AT1 antagonists exert beneficial haemodynamic and neurohormonal effects in human heart failure. Their direct myocardial effects require further investigation.", 
    "562": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition undoubtedly has become the cornerstone of heart failure treatment. Useful in each stage, it should possibly be considered first-line treatment in many patients with mild heart failure in whom fluid retention is not clearly present. Careful consideration of the optimal dose for the individual is important. Until further data are available concerning the efficacy and tolerability of high and low doses, the clinician should consider the target doses used in large controlled heart failure trials. Even under optimal dosing conditions, it is likely that ACE inhibition may not suffice in completely modulating the extensive neurohormonal stimulation extant in heart failure. In part this may result from a breakthrough of the ACE inhibitor effect as well as from activation of hormones and peptides that may not be affected by ACE inhibition. Also, a substantial proportion of patients may not tolerate sufficient ACE inhibition. Alternative or additional therapy aimed at modulating neurohormonal activation concerns interference with other parts of the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II receptor and aldosterone receptor antagonism. Sympathetic activity and catecholamine levels may decrease with dopaminergic D2 agonists and, possibly, beta-blockade; in the latter, this may be confined to patients with pre-existing sympathetic over-activation. Increasing circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptide via neutral endopeptidase inhibition may offer an alternative way to increase diuresis and natriuresis without neuroendocrine stimulation. Novel possibilities that have not yet been tested sufficiently in patients with heart failure include endothelin receptor antagonism, arginine vasopressin antagonism, and renin inhibition. Finally, digitalis glycosides may be considered neurohormonal modulators in addition to being positive inotropes. Heart failure is a complex condition that involves many organs and systems besides the heart. Polypharmacy tailored to the individual is mandatory. It is thus necessary to investigate approaches to the modulation of neurohormonal activation beyond ACE inhibition.", 
    "563": "Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delays deterioration and improves survival in chronic congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. In two large placebo-controlled trials with survivors of acute myocardial infarction, but with left ventricular dysfunction, mortality was significantly lower in the ACE inhibitor arms, with risk reductions of 19% (with captopril) and 27% (with ramipril). A study of left ventricular dysfunction in more than 4000 patients resulted in significantly fewer myocardial infarctions among patients given enalapril than in those receiving placebo; the risk reduction was 24%. Knowledge of the degree of neurohormonal activation in patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class II-III) appears to be of major importance in determining the efficacy of ACE inhibition. Patients with plasma concentrations above normal show the greatest increase in survival when treated with ACE inhibitors compared to similarly treated patients with low or normal neurohormonal plasma levels as well as those treated with placebo or direct-acting vasodilators. In a study of 239 patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure, randomized to receive enalapril or placebo, mortality was significantly reduced in patients receiving enalapril who had plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, angiotensin II, aldosterone, or atrial natriuretic peptide levels above median values. No significant differences in survival between groups were found in patients with hormone levels below the median. A study in 804 men with congestive heart failure who received either enalapril or hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate showed the greatest reduction in mortality after 2 years in enalapril treated patients with plasma noradrenaline levels > 900 pg.ml-1 or plasma renin levels > 16 ng.ml-1.h-1. These results indicate that the main rationale for ACE inhibition in chronic congestive heart failure, in left ventricular dysfunction, and after myocardial infarction is the modulation of prolonged neurohormonal activation. Knowledge of this effect may provide the means to forestall disease progression and thus offer long-term treatment benefits.", 
    "564": "Benefit achieved through use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function is not confined to those with clinical manifestations of heart failure. Although rates of adverse clinical events are lower in asymptomatic patients, within this population ACE inhibitors have been shown to prevent adverse ventricular remodelling, prevent the development of clinical heart failure, reduce rates of hospitalization for heart failure and, in some studies, reduce mortality. Most of the benefit derived appears to be associated with preventing the progression of LV hypertrophy, dilatation, and dysfunction, resulting in prevention of heart failure. Additionally, the incidence of myocardial infarction is decreased, although the exact physiological basis for this benefit remains uncertain. Given the enormity and growth of heart failure as a public health problem and the potential for influencing the underlying pathophysiology, ACE inhibitor treatment offers substantial benefit for patients with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction.", 
    "565": "A recent series of experiments in our laboratory were designed to elucidate the cellular changes that underlie the cardiac remodelling response following myocardial infarction (MI) in the rat as well as the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this response. Inhibition of the RAS interferes with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial cell DNA synthesis, and collagen deposition; these effects are mediated through the angiotensin II AT1 receptor subtype. Also, vascular outgrowth is functionally diminished, an effect that seems to depend on AT2 receptor activation. The intracardiac RAS may be involved in the wound healing response in the infarct area. However, we found no evidence for activation of the RAS in the remnant myocardium, which suggests that myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis depend on activation of the systemic RAS. During the first weeks following MI, therapy of choice should thus inhibit the systemic RAS while allowing the wound-healing response of the intracardiac RAS, i.e. selective AT1 antagonists are appropriate early after MI. AT2 antagonists administered at that time can inhibit the cardiac vascularization response and cause a further decrease in level of cardiac function.", 
    "566": "Symptomatic heart failure is accompanied by diastolic ventricular dysfunction due largely to an extensive reactive and reparative fibrosis. Experimental evidence suggests a clear association between myocardial fibrosis and chronic inappropriate elevations in circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) and/or aldosterone. Although not entirely elucidated, injury follows Ang II-associated release of adrenal medullary catecholamines and aldosterone-induced myocardial potassium depletion. Increasing evidence indicates locally produced cardiac Ang II plays an important role in tissue repair that may underlie myocardial remodelling, the fibrous tissue accumulation both at and remote to the site of myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) binding density markedly increases at these fibrous tissue sites after experimental MI, indicating an involvement in wound healing regardless of the cause and location of fibrosis; cells expressing Ang II receptors are primarily myofibroblasts. Therapy with ACE inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonist have each been shown to attenuate development of fibrosis.", 
    "567": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in conjunction with loop diuretics and, possibly, digoxin, is associated with a relatively high incidence of recurrent heart failure and death. Even high doses of ACE inhibitors may not completely suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; aldosterone \"escape' may occur through non-angiotensin II dependent mechanisms involving corticotropin, atrial natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, and deficient high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Addition of spironolactone (an aldosterone receptor blocker) to an ACE inhibitor regimen causes marked diuresis and symptomatic improvement. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was organized to explore the role of combination therapy with spironolactone in patients with heart failure. Patients with New York Heart Association Functional Class II-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 40% who were on regimens comprising an ACE inhibitor, loop diuretic, and, possibly, digoxin were randomized to receive placebo or spironolactone in doses of 12.5, 25, 50, or 75 mg per day. Eve at the lowest dose of spironolactone, a significant decrease in plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide occurred, with concomitant increase in concentrations of plasma renin and urinary aldosterone. As prophylaxis for heart failure, a daily dose of 25 mg of spironolactone and monitoring of serum potassium concentrations are recommended; symptomatic therapy in refractory or severe heart failure may require doses as high as 100 mg b.i.d. The RALES Mortality Trial will follow up 1400 similar patients for 3 years to determine the effect of the addition of spironolactone on combined mortality and hospitalization for heart failure.", 
    "568": "In the setting of chronic heart failure (CHF), therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors generally reduces serum aldosterone levels acutely. However, long-term ACE inhibition is associated with aldosterone suppression that is weak, variable, and unsustained, i.e. aldosterone 'escape'. Magnesium loss caused by aldosterone and by diuretics can contribute to coronary artery spasm and arrhythmias. Aldosterone can block noradrenaline uptake by the myocardium; extracellular catecholamines may lead to arrhythmias and ischaemia. Aldosterone has been shown to have an acute arrhythmogenic effect as well as a potential detrimental effect on baroreflex function, a marker of prognosis in CHF. Both angiotensin II and aldosterone may stimulate myocardial fibrosis, which is associated with a higher incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. ACE inhibition initiated early in the progression of CHF may prevent development of patchy myocardial fibrosis and its inherent arrhythmias and thus reduce the incidence of sudden death. Spironolactone therapy added to the regimen of an ACE inhibitor and diuretic can induce natriuresis and magnesium retention, increase myocardial noradrenaline uptake, and reduce the incidence of arrhythmias.",

    "570": "Twenty-six patients with previously untreated essential hypertension took enalapril 20 mg twice daily for 5 years. Cardiovascular parameters were determined by two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography in a pre-treatment placebo phase, 8 weeks and 1, 3 and 5 years after the start of therapy, and 8 weeks after drugs were discontinued.", 
    "571": "Therapy reduced resting arterial pressure from 156/105 to 128/84 mmHg (P < 0.001) and arterial pressure during exercise from 205/113 to 172/94 mmHg (P < 0.0011). After 1, 3 and 5 years' therapy, left ventricular mass index had decreased by 15, 28 and 39% respectively (P < 0.001 in each case). Eight weeks after treatment was halted, arterial pressure at rest and during exercise had returned to pre-treatment values, but decreased left ventricular mass was maintained. Left ventricular pump function had improved after 5 years' treatment, and this improvement was maintained during the 8 weeks without treatment.", 
    "572": "Significant reductions in arterial pressure at rest and during exercise were achieved by 8 weeks' treatment with enalapril and maintained during 5 years' further treatment, while a marked reduction in left ventricular mass took place progressively throughout the 5 year period. Reduction of myocardial hypertrophy by enalapril appeared to be beneficial rather than detrimental to cardiac pump performance.", 
    "573": "This study was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial of fosinopril in 308 patients with mild to moderately severe heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IIS 17%, IIM 48%, and III 35%; mean ejection fraction [+/-SD] 26.5% [+/-6.9%]; bicycle exercise duration 1 to 11 min). An initial dose of 10 mg once daily was titrated as tolerated to 40 mg once daily. Patients all received diuretic therapy; digoxin was optional. The primary endpoint was maximal bicycle exercise time; a secondary endpoint was occurrence of the following prospectively defined, ordered clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure: death, study discontinuation, hospitalization, emergency room visits, and need for supplemental diuretic. At study endpoint (last value obtained for each patient), bicycle exercise time increased more with fosinopril (38.1 s) than with placebo (23.5 s) (P = 0.101 by ANCOVA and 0.010 by prospectively defined dropout-adjusted endpoint analysis). More patients remained free of clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure when treated with fosinopril (89%) than with placebo (75%), and the worst events of fosinopril-treated patients tended to be less severe than those of placebo patients (P = 0.001). Analysis of the occurrence of individual clinical events showed that the need for supplemental diuretic was markedly reduced with fosinopril (8% vs 20%, of patients, P = 0.002), as were hospitalizations (3% vs 12% of patients, P = 0.002) and study discontinuations (2% vs 12% of patients, P < 0.001) for worsening heart failure; the two groups had similar incidences of death (3% of patients in the fosinopril group vs 2% in the placebo group, P = 0.723). In addition, symptoms of dyspnoea (P = 0.017), fatigue (P = 0.019), and NYHA functional class (P = 0.008) improved with fosinopril relative to placebo. In conclusion, fosinopril, at an initial dose of 10 mg once daily, subsequently titrated as tolerated to 40 mg once daily, increased exercise tolerance and reduced the frequency of clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure.", 
    "574": "In this double-blind placebo-controlled study with enalapril, 74 patients with acute myocardial infarction were followed at 0, 7, 30, 60 and 180 days after the event. Platelets and leukocytes were activated during the first 7 days. During the 6-month period fibrinogen, leukocytes, elastase, and B beta 30-43 remained elevated in 50, 15, 30 and 80% of the patients, respectively, but there was no detectable angiotensin converting enzyme activity in platelets. Enalapril did not modulate fibrinogen, leukocyte count or elastase, while B beta 30-43 peptide showed decreased levels, although the proportion of patients with values above the reference limit did not differ from placebo. In conclusion, in the 6-month post acute myocardial infarction period, while platelet function is activated only during the first week after acute myocardial infarction, fibrinogen and leukocyte function continue to be activated throughout the 6 months in a considerable proportion of patients. These signs may indicate an ongoing atherosclerotic process. Enalapril has no major influence on these reactivities.", 
    "575": "The above study was performed as a single blind trial in 70 elderly patients (average age 66 years) who were randomized into two groups of 36 and 34 subjects respectively. After clinical and laboratory evaluation without treatment for at least two weeks, the two groups were treated with enalapril 5-10 or 20 mg daily plus doxazosin at the dosage of 1-2-4- or 8 mg daily; they were observed for 24 weeks. During the trial, pressure values, both systolic and diastolic, were seen to diminish significantly in both groups. This effect was accompanied by minor, usually transient side effects. At echocardiography at the end of the treatment period, doxazosin was found to reduce some volumetric cardiac parameters, thus showing to be apt to counteract left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings go to counteract left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings go to show that alpha-1 inhibitors are a valid alternative in the \"first step\" of antihypertensive therapy, especially in patients at risk for cardiovascular complications.",

Enalapril is a new converting enzyme blocker with a longer plasma half-life and less side effects than captopril. Oral administration of enalapril 0.1 mg/kg caused severe hypotension and renal failure in a preterm infant. We recommend an oral starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg in preterm infants and extremely close monitoring of infants receiving the first dose of enalapril.", 
    "577": "Removal of the superior colliculus (SC) in neonatal Wistar rats results in a rapid loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). There is an early twofold increase in RGC death 4-8 hr postlesion (PL) followed by a later 10-11-fold increase in pyknosis about 24 hr PL. We have now used neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NT-4/5, NT-3, NGF, LIF), glutamate receptor antagonists (MK-801, DNQX, CNQX), an antioxidant (N-ace-tyl-L-cysteine), and an NOS inhibitor (L-NAME) to determine whether the early and late phases of lesion-induced RGC death involved similar or different mechanisms. Normal and pyknotic nuclei of tectally projecting RGCs were visualized by injecting the left s.c. of 2 d old rats with diamidino yellow (DY). Two days later the injection site was removed. In most rats, right eyes were injected with factors immediately after the s.c. ablation. Rats were perfused either 6 or 24 hr PL. In the latter group a second intravitreal injection of the appropriate factor was sometimes made 12 hr PL. NT- 4/5 and BDNF significantly decreased RGC pyknosis 6 and 24 hr PL, whereas NT-3 was only protective 6 hr PL. LIF slightly reduced RGC death 24 hr PL, but NGF had no influence on RGC survival at either time point. NT-4/5 also reduced the rate of naturally occurring RGC death. MK-801, DNQX, CNQX, N-acetylcysteine, and L-NAME all prevented the early lesion-induced increase in RGC death but had no significant effect on RGC death measured 24 hr PL; none of these factors significantly reduced the rate of naturally occuring RGC death. Cycloheximide, shown previously to reduce RGC pyknosis 24 hr PL, did not prevent RGC death 6 hr PL. The data indicate that there are at least two mechanisms involved in RGC death after neonatal target ablation. The early increase is related to excitotoxic effects mediated by glutamate receptors and involves NOS and the production of free radicals. We found no evidence that RGC death measured 24 hr PL is dependent on these processes, but the later death does require protein synthesis and, most likely, the activation of an endogenous suicide program. NT-4/5 and BDNF protected RGCs from both types of lesion-induced death.", 
    "578": "The comparative effects on echocardiographically determined left ventricular (LV) mass and pulsed Doppler derived indexes of LV diastolic filling were studied in previously untreated hypertensive patients after 6 months of treatment with diltiazem 300 mg once daily (o.d.) (n = 16), and lisinopril 20 mg o.d. (n = 20). LV mass index decreased in the lisinopril group (from 98 to 96 g/m2; mean difference after 6 months of treatment with diltiazem-lisinopril was 13.7 g/m2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 26.6, p < 0.05]. In both groups diastolic filling parameters improved, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Both treatment regimens showed a similar decrease in office and maximal exercise systolic blood pressure (SPB). Ambulatory daytime BP was lower after lisinopril treatment (from 147/96 to 126/83 mm Hg) than after diltiazem treatment (from 142/93 to 135/87 mm Hg); mean difference between diltiazem and lisinopril after 6 months of treatment was 9.7 (95% CI 3.4 to 16.0, p < 0.05)/9.4 (95% CI 2.5 to 16.3, p < 0.05) mm Hg. Nighttime BP decreased from 129/81 to 113/70 mm Hg in the lisinopril group, but not in the diltiazem group (from 125/79 to 122/77 mm Hg); mean difference between diltiazem and lisinopril after 6 months of treatment was 4.4 (95% CI - 0.2 to 8.9)/6.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 12.0) mm Hg. Changes in diastolic filling parameters were significantly correlated with changes in LV mass index in the lisinopril group, suggesting that the improvements in diastolic filling in the diltazem group may be partly due to an effect on factors other than LV mass.", 
    "579": "The metabolic effects of captopril 25 mg twice daily and atenolol 50 mg daily on glucose, insulin and lipids were compared in 83 otherwise healthy mild-to-moderate hypertensive between the ages of 25 and 60 years in a randomised double-blind trial. Hourly glucose and insulin levels were measured during a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2, HDL3, triglycerides, apoprotein (Apo)A1, ApoB, and Apo(a) were obtained before and after the treatment period. Blood pressure decreased significantly and equivalently in both treatment groups. The glucose and insulin levels and glucose x insulin product at 2 hours after the glucose load increased after 12 weeks of treatment with atenolol compared with the baseline values, but these parameters all decreased after the treatment period with captopril compared with their baseline values. These results indicate an improvement in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a deterioration with atenolol. HDL-cholesterol and HDL3 decreased in the atenolol group but increased in the captopril group. We conclude that captopril has more favourable effects than atenolol on glucose, insulin and lipid metabolism in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "580": "New South African guidelines are proposed by the Hypertension Society of Southern Africa for the management of hypertension by primary health care services in South Africa. Specific South African guidelines are appropriate for hypertension, which is now recognised as one of the five major diseases that must be given priority by the new Government. Furthermore, patient participation and empowerment in blood pressure (BP) control become feasible through the new concept of lifestyle modification. This article gives the rationale underpinning these guidelines. The correct methods to measure blood pressure (BP), with patients sitting for 5 minutes, correct cuff-size and repeated readings, are emphasised to eliminate the 'white coat' effect and ensure accurate BP readings. The rationale for the overall management of all atherosclerosis-related risk factors is given, as are the principles of non-drug hypertension treatment and patient education. We emphasise that patients must understand hypertension to be a risk factor and not a disease. Patients should also be empowered to contribute to effective BP control. The justification for the chosen BP levels at which specific action is required by the primary health care team is given. The BP levels span the range from mild hypertension, requiring conservative treatment schedules, to possible malignant hypertension, which requires urgent management and referral to the appropriate level of care. The motivation for cost-effective antihypertensive drug therapy is provided. The recommended initiation of drug therapy is with effective, safe low-cost drugs. Suggested first-line therapy comprises lifestyle management and low-dose diuretics. The second-line drugs, in order of increasing price, are low-dose reserpine, or a beta-blocker, or a calcium blocker, or an ACE inhibitor. For third-line therapy hydralazine is chosen, or other second-line drugs could be added. Where possible, the examples of specific drugs given are those for which a generic is available, to ensure cost-containment. The motivation for drug choices for hypertension in special cases such as pregnancy, the elderly, blacks and patients with diabetes and renal disease is given. The management of malignant hypertension receives special attention.", 
    "581": "Plasma pharmacokinetic variables of benazeprilat, the active metabolite of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril, were evaluated in healthy Beagles. Benazeprilat was administered IV at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight (n = 9). The elimination of half-life of benazeprilat was 3.5 hours, although an additional terminal phase was observed in some dogs. Vehicle (gelatin capsules) or benazepril at dosages of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg was administered orally as a single administration, then once daily for 15 consecutive days (n = 5 or 6/group). Peak benazeprilat concentrations were rapidly attained by 2 hours. Benazeprilat concentrations accumulated moderately with repeated administration, with a peak concentration that was 23% higher and an area under the concentration-time curve that was 34% higher after the 15th dose of benazepril, compared with values after a single dose. The effective half-life for accumulation for all 4 dosages was 12 hours. Steady-state concentrations at 2 hours after administration were achieved after a median (range) of 1 (1 to 6) dose(s). Pharmacodynamic variables were assessed by measurements of plasma ACE activity after oral administration of benazepril or vehicle. All dosages of benazepril caused profound inhibition of ACE, with rapid onset of activity (time to peak effect, 2 hours) and long duration of action (single administration of all 4 doses induced inhibition of ACE that was significantly different from the value in the control [vehicle-treated] dogs for all time points between 1 and 30 hours). Maximal inhibition at all time points was induced by the 0.25-mg/kg dosage at a single administration and with the lowest dosage tested (0.125 mg/kg) at steady state. At steady state, the 0.25-mg/kg dosage caused (mean +/- SEM) 96.9 +/- 2.0% inhibition of ACE activity at maximal effect and 83.6 +/- 4.2% at trough effect (24 hours after dosing), indicating minimal variation in peak/trough effect. Steady-state inhibition of ACE activity at both peak and trough drug effect was achieved after 1 to 4 doses. The data indicate that benazepril is a potent and long-acting ACE inhibitor in dogs.", 
    "582": "Angio-oedema is a recognised complication of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, occurring in 0.1% to 0.5% of patients taking captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril. This is the first report of severe angio-oedema complicating therapy with quinapril, a new, long-acting drug. CASE REPORT. A 74-year-old female had been taking quinapril (10 mg/day) and diuretics (fixed combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) for arterial hypertension for 18 months without any complication. After a fracture of the ankle, the patient received spinal anaesthesia uneventfully for an osteosynthesis. Ten days postoperatively, she noted swelling of the lips and the left half of the tongue. Following intravenous injection of antihistamines and prednisolone, these symptoms regressed. However, a relapse occurred on the 16th postoperative day with rapidly increasing oedema of the lips, face, ventral collar area, and entire tongue. Despite high-dose steroids, dyspnoea developed within 2 h. Direct laryngoscopy was impossible, and a flexible bronchoscope was used for nasotracheal intubation. At this point, the diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema was made and quinapril was withdrawn. The patient recovered, tracheal extubation was performed after 48 h, and the later course was uneventful. DISCUSSION. This is the second report of angio-oedema as a postoperative complication in a patient on long-term and previously unremarkable ACE inhibitor therapy. The first reported case occurred immediately after oral intubation and was perhaps precipitated by mechanical irritation. In this case, it is likely that postoperative deterioration of renal function due to dehydration and diuretic therapy was the precipitant, as has been reported in patients on lisinopril without surgery. Despite a significant increase in angio-oedema associated with the use of long-acting ACE-inhibitors, there appears to be a lack of familiarity among anaesthesiologist and other emergency physicians concerning this adverse effect. Withdrawal of the drug is the only effective treatment. High-dose steroids may be helpful, but if there is beginning dyspnoea or stridor, early endoscopically controlled intubation or emergency tracheostomy is essential to avoid hypoxaemia and death, as has occurred in the past.", 
    "583": "For factorial clinical trials in which two monotherapy treatments under study can interact only in the presence of treatment effects for each treatment, the always-pooled test statistic using data from all four groups has a correct size in detecting the simple effect of an individual treatment used alone. However, this test statistic may have an unbounded bias in estimation of the simple effect. The never-pooled test statistic that uses only data from the treatment group not receiving the other treatment has poor precision for estimating the simple effect. Two alternative test statistics under consideration are the two-stage statistic involving a preliminary test of treatment interaction and the maximum test statistic taking the larger of the always-pooled and the never-pooled statistics. The power, bias, and mean square error of all four tests are compared. When negative interactions exist, the two-stage and maximum statistics are generally superior to the always-pooled statistic and compare reasonably well with the never-pooled statistic; the maximum statistic seems slightly more favorable than the two-stage statistic. The two-stage statistic is the best choice when a treatment interaction can be large.", 
    "584": "We studied the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril, on the clinical and morphological lesions of a normotensive model of immune complex nephritis. Untreated rats developed massive nephrotic syndrome, intense cell proliferation and glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions. In the renal cortex of nephritic rats there was a significant increase in gene expression of TGF-beta 1, fibronectin and collagens, and ACE activity. Systolic blood pressure remained normal with progression of the disease. Administration of quinapril for three weeks to animals with glomerular lesions (proteinuria 20 to 50 mg/day) avoided the development of intense proteinuria (79 +/- 28 vs. 589 +/- 73 mg/day, P < 0.001) and decreased cell proliferation, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial lesions, and inflammatory infiltrates. Cortical gene expression of TGF-beta 1 and matrix proteins was also diminished. ACE activity was inhibited by 68% in renal cortex. These results show that quinapril administration to normotensive rats with immune complex nephritis decreases proteinuria and glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions, probably modulating the local angiotensin II generation and its effects on cell growth, TGF beta and matrix protein synthesis.", 
    "585": "A variety of techniques have been used for quantitative estimation of renal transit time. We compared different indices of transit time in a group of 30 patients having baseline and ACE inhibitor technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renography prior to arteriography: peak time, mean transit time, and the ratio of background-subtracted counts at 20 min to those at 3 min. Each index was calculated from whole-kidney ROI, cortical ROI, and cortical factor (by factor analysis). The strongest correlations between angiographic percent of stenosis and transit time index were observed for the peak time (Spearman p=0.469, n=53, P <0.005) and for the R20/3 (again p=0.469, n=53, P <0.005) using the whole-kidney ROI and using only the baseline data without captopril. (Spearman's p is simply the correlation coefficient calculated from rank in list, which allows for nonlinear correlation.) Thus simple indices of transit time (whole-kidney peak time and R20/3) correlated as well with the observed pathology as did more complicated methods that required deconvolution, factor analysis, or selection of a cortical ROI.", 
    "586": "Polyploidization of cardiomyocyte nuclei is a physiological phenomenon that increases in pathological conditions such as myocardial hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential benefit of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril in reversing the polyploidization of cardiomyocyte nuclei in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Sixteen week-old male SHR were treated with oral quinapril (average dose 10 mg/kg per day) for 20 weeks. Sixteen- and 36-week-old untreated SHR and 16- and 36-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Nuclear polyploidization was determined by DNA flow cytometry of frozen tissues from the left ventricle, at least 20,000 nuclei being measured in each sample. The rates of tetraploidy in the 16- and 36-week-old SHR groups were 2.8 per cent (range 2.16-3 per cent) and 5.4 per cent (range 4.9-5.9 per cent), respectively. Treated SHR had a similar rate of DNA tetraploidy to the 16- and 36-week-old WKY rat groups: 1.8 per cent (range 1.5-2.3 per cent), 1.55 per cent (range 1.5-1.6 per cent), and 1.5 per cent (range 1.4-1.6 per cent), respectively. The differences in the percentage of tetraploid cardiomyocytes between the SHR untreated groups and the SHR treated group were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Regression of LVH and normalization of blood pressure were observed in treated rats. These results indicate that DNA tetraploidy in the myocardium of SHR increases with hypertrophy and decreases on quinapril treatment. It is suggested that ACE inhibition modifies nuclear processes involved in myocyte growth in arterial hypertension.", 
    "587": "All patients with heart failure should have an echocardiogram to establish a diagnosis, both to aid treatment as well as for prognostic reasons. An audit of 100 case notes of patients admitted with acute left ventricular failure over a 12-month period found that 26 patients had not had an echocardiogram. Of the 74 who did have an echocardiogram 68 patients had reduced systolic function (mean ejection fraction 42%). Almost all (93%) were commenced on an angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Those who did not receive an ACE inhibitor had no contraindications to these drugs. Seventeen patients had a confirmed myocardial infarction. Of these, 11 had an echocardiogram and 10 were discharged home on an ACE inhibitor. Despite appropriate indications some patients are deprived of echocardiography as well as the benefits of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "588": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats were given an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (benazepril or quinapril) or hydralazine and were left for up to 6 hr. To examine whether administration of antihypertensive agents affects expression of immediate early genes in left ventricular myocardium, groups of rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, and 6 hr after dosing; total RNA was extracted from left ventricular tissue and analyzed by blot hybridization technique using labeled probes for c-myc, c-fos, and GAPDH mRNA. All three antihypertensive agents reduced pressure similarly, and treatment with the two ACE inhibitors increased c-fos and c-myc mRNA expression in left ventriculum. By contrast, hydralazine did not increase steady-state mRNA expression of either proto-oncogene. Thus, in parallel with the pressure fall, acute administration of the ACE inhibitors induced expression of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs in the left ventricle. Since the equidepressor dose of hydralazine did not affect expression of these proto-oncogenes, this effect of ACE inhibitors is independent of their hemodynamic action.", 
    "589": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril inhibits mitosis in several cell types that contain ACE and renin activity. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the ACE inhibitors captopril and CGS 13945 (10(-8) to 10(-2) M) on proliferation and gene expression in hamster pancreatic duct carcinoma cells in culture. These cells lack renin and ACE activity. Both ACE inhibitors produced a dose-dependent reduction in tumor cell proliferation within 24 hr. Captopril at a concentration of 0.36 mM and CGS 13945 at 150 microM decreased cellular growth rate to approximately half that of the control. Neither drug influenced the viability or the cell cycle distribution of the tumor cells. Slot blot analysis of mRNA for four genes, proliferation associated cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), K-ras, protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) was performed. Both ACE inhibitors increased K-ras expression by a factor of 2, and had no effect on CA II mRNA levels. Captopril also lowered PCNA by 40% and CGS 13945 lowered PKC-beta gene expression to 30% of the control level. The data demonstrate that ACE inhibitors exhibit antimitotic activity and differential gene modulation in hamster pancreatic duct carcinoma cells. The absence of renin and ACE activity in these cells suggests that the antimitotic action of captopril and CGS 13945 is independent of renin-angiotensin regulation. The growth inhibition may occur through downregulation of growth-related gene expression.", 
    "590": "The aim of the present study was to determine, in rats with myocardial infarction, the systemic and cardiac hemodynamic effects of aladotrilat and of its prodrug, aladotril, both of which display inhibitory activity toward both neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC. 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The effects of acute intravenous injection of aladotrilat (30 mg/kg bolus injection plus 30 mg/kg/hr infusion) were measured for 1 hr in conscious infarcted rats and compared with the effects of SQ 28,603, a selective NEP inhibitor (30 mg/kg bolus injection plus 30 mg/kg/hr infusion), and captopril, a selective ACE inhibitor (10 mg/kg bolus injection plus 10 mg/kg/hr infusion). Unlike SQ 28,603, aladotrilat and captopril produced a slight fall in mean arterial blood pressure. The three treatments had no significant effect on heart rate and rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (LV + dP/dt) but caused significant decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The effect of aladotrilat on decreasing LVEDP was faster than those of captopril or SQ 28,603. In chronic experiments, groups of rats received orally, twice daily, captopril (10 mg/kg), aladotril (100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Treatments were started 18 to 20 hr after coronary artery ligation and continued for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters and cardiac hypertrophy were measured at the end of therapy. Unlike aladotril, captopril treatment resulted in significant decreases in mean arterial blood pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure (approximately 15 mm Hg) and produced renal vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "591": "S-Nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap) produced dose-dependent relaxation in isolated dog coronary arteries. This relaxation consisted of two parts: an initial phasic relaxation and a subsequent sustained relaxation. Relaxation was potentiated by superoxide dismutase but was suppressed by pyrogallol, methylene blue or oxyhemoglobin. The relaxant responses of coronary artery to vasoactive agents were reexamined after the development of nitrate tolerance induced by a 1-hr treatment with 4.4 x 10(-4) M nitroglycerin (NTG). NTG tolerance was verified by a 40-fold increase in the EC50 values. The relaxant response to nitroprusside was only marginally suppressed in NTG-tolerant arteries. NTG-tolerant arteries were not tolerant to nitric oxide (NO) or 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and did not show a significant change in the concentration-response curves. Similarly, the concentration-response curves for S-NO-Cap in NTG-tolerant coronary arteries were not significantly different from those in nontolerant coronary arteries. Captopril (5 x 10(-4) M) did not enhance the vasodilative effect of NTG or reverse NTG tolerance. The NTG-induced increase in cGMP was abolished after NTG tolerance was established. On the other hand, the S-NO-Cap-induced increase in cGMP was unaffected by NTG tolerance. In conclusion, these findings indicate that (1) S-NO-Cap is an NO-like substance, (2) an impaired formation of NO or S-nitrosothiol is responsible for the formation of NTG tolerance and (3) S-NO-Cap, which does not show cross-tolerance with NTG, may serve as a therapeutic alternative to current nitrovasodilators.", 
    "592": "Bradykinin (Bk), a potent vasoactive and cardioprotective peptide hormone, is almost completely inactivated during a single circulation through the rat lung. It has been hypothesized that membrane-bound aminopeptidase P, which can hydrolyze the Arg1-Pro2 bond of Bk, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) act in concert to degrade Bk in the pulmonary circulation. To test this hypothesis, an inhibitor of aminopeptidase P was designed and synthesized. N-[(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-prolyl-L - alaninamide (apstatin) inhibited purified rat lung membrane-bound aminopeptidase P with a Ki value of 2.6 microM (linear mixed-type inhibition, alpha = 5.1, beta = 0). Apstatin did not inhibit ACE or other known Bk-degrading enzymes. Apstatin and an ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, were tested for their ability to inhibit Bk degradation in the isolated perfused rat lung. [2,3-Proly-3,4-3H(N)]-bradykinin ([3H]-Bk) was perfused through the isolated lung in the presence or absence of inhibitors. The perfusate was then subjected to HPLC to identify and quantitate radiolabeled fragments. In the absence of inhibitors, no intact [3H]-Bk was found in the perfusate. In the presence of ramiprilat (0.5 microM), only 22% +/- 6% of the radioactivity in the perfusate was intact [3H]-Bk, and the remaining radioactivity indicated cleavage of the Arg1-Pro2 bond. When apstatin (40 microM) was perfused along with ramiprilat, degradation of [3H]-Bk was almost completely blocked (92% +/- 4% intact [3H]-Bk in the perfusate). The results indicate that the Bk-degrading activity in the rat pulmonary vascular bed can be fully accounted for by aminopeptidase P (30%) and ACE (70%).", 
    "593": "Fosinoprilat, the active product of fosinopril, is eliminated by a hepatic pathway, in addition to the renal pathway shared by other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Congestive heart failure (CHF) may elevate drug plasma concentrations caused by a reduction in steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) and/or an impairment of clearance. This study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fosinopril (intravenous and oral) in 10 patients with established CHF and 10 age-, sex-, and weight-matched normal control subjects. There were no statistically significant differences between the patients with CHF and the control patients with respect to maximum drug concentration (Cmax) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity. Absolute bioavailability was approximately 29%. Vss was similar, and protein binding was 99% in both groups. The oral half-life of fosinoprilat was significantly longer than the intravenous half-life for both the patients with CHF and normal subjects, without statistically significant differences between the study groups. Median time to reach Cmax occurred at 4 hours in each group and corresponded to maximum angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, which was essentially complete through 12 hours and markedly reduced through 24 hours. Thus these data indicate that patients with CHF can receive fosinopril without undue increases in fosinoprilat concentrations. This probably is due to the dual excretory pathways.",

The concordance in the renographic diagnoses between the three readers was reasonably good, with an intraobserver agreement and kappa (observed agreement corrected for chance) ranging from 64% to 89% and from 0.52 to 0.75, respectively, and an interobserver agreement and kappa ranging from 68% to 86% and from 0.61 to 0.82. The sensitivity of their interpretation of paired baseline plus captopril renograms in relation to the angiographic diagnosis is poor and below 50%. The post-test probability of RAS in case of a negative renographic study was found to be rather similar to the pre-test probability (prevalence) of 46%.

    "598": "The metabolism of Met-enkephalin and cholecystokinin (CCK) 8-(sulfated) by intact microslices was studied in rat brain regions. Incubation of brain slices with Met-enkephalin (400 microM) resulted in a linear rate of disappearance of parent peptide and appearance of metabolic fragments whose rate of accumulation was specific to brain region. The degradative rate (pmol/min/mg of protein) of Met-enkephalin was high in caudate-putamen (5,160 +/- 120) and lower in nucleus accumbens (3,630 +/- 110) and frontal cortex (3,180 +/- 120). Inhibition of aminopeptidases decreased Met-enkephalin degradation (50-97% vs. control) in frontal cortex but was less effective in caudate-putamen (20-34%). Tyr-Gly-Gly and Phe-Met were recovered in caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens, whereas negligible quantities of these fragments were recovered from frontal cortex. Phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, decreased Met-enkephalin degradation in caudate-putamen (14%) but had no effect on that in frontal cortex. A cocktail of bestatin or leuhistin (inhibitors of aminopeptidases), phosphoramidon, and captopril (an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme) protected Met-enkephalin from degradation (recovery > 95%) in caudate-putamen. CCK 8-(sulfated) degradation on slices from caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and frontal cortex was not altered by inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, metalloendopeptidase 24.15, angiotensin converting enzyme, or thiol proteases. Inhibitors of either aminopeptidases or serine proteases produced small reductions (13-30%) in CCK degradation in each region. These data provide evidence for regional and structural specificity in terminating the actions of neuropeptides.", 
    "599": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the fourth most common cause of end-stage renal disease and is a common cause of hypertension and associated vascular morbidity. Activity of the renin angiotensin system has been identified as a major component of hypertension and altered fluid and electrolyte physiology in PKD. Activity of this pathway also has been proposed as a potential modulator of structural change in both tubules and the interstitium of the kidney. Cilazapril is a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that has been effective in producing vascular remodelling in hypertensive vascular disease. We undertook a study to determine whether therapy with cilazapril would modify the expression of PKD in the Han:SPRD-cy rat, a model of autosomal dominant PKD that closely resembles human disease. Male rats were treated for 4 months, starting at 1 month of age. Control animals were hypertensive by 3 months of age, whereas treated animals were noted to be hypertensive only at the exit assessment (P < 0.001 at 3 months, P = 0.005 at 5 months). At 5 months of age, cilazapril-treated animals had modest but statistically significant reductions in serum creatinine (mean, 1.77 mg/dL v 1.97 mg/dL; P = 0.0006) and morphometrically assessed cyst volume (mean, 0.32 mL v 0.67 mL; P = 0.036). Cilazapril is an effective treatment for hypertension in this model of progressive renal disease and may have benefits beyond the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity.",

    "604": "Previous results from our laboratory showed that a methionine-rich caseinate-based (metcas) diet induces hyperhomocysteinemia in miniature pigs. In the present study, the contribution of the ileal and jejunal methionine absorption to the dietary induced hyperhomocysteinemia was evaluated by measuring the mucosal to serosal fluxes and the enterocyte incorporation in intact intestinal epithelia mounted in Ussing chambers. For 4 mo, 20 miniature pigs were daily fed control or metcas diets, and an oral combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (25 mg captopril, Cp) and diuretic (12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, HTZ) or placebo, ileal incorporation was higher in epithelia from miniature pigs metcas than in that from other groups. For a given transepithelial flux of methionine, i.e., a constant amount of methionine recovered in the serosal chamber, a greater enterocyte incorporation was detected. Cp-HTZ treatment corrected the diet-induced methionine trapping in intestinal epithelia but had little effect in control animals. In separate in vitro experiments, Cp added alone significantly activated methionine fluxes in epithelia from metcas-fed miniature pigs as it did in vivo, demonstrating that Cp rather than HTZ mainly contributed to the in vivo effects of the drug combination. Our results showed that the regulation of intestinal methionine absorption compensated the diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and that Cp-HTZ treatment altered these adaptative changes without increasing methioninemia and homocysteinemia.", 
    "605": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) belongs to the type I class of ectoproteins and is solubilized by Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the full-length human ACE cDNA. ACE release in Chinese hamster ovary cells involves a proteolytic cleavage occurring in the carboxyl-terminal region, between Arg-1137 and Leu-1138. The subcellular localization of ACE proteolysis was established by pulse-chase experiments, cell surface immunolabeling, and biotinylation of radiolabeled mature proteins. The proteolysis of ACE takes place primarily at the plasma membrane. The solubilization of ACE is less than 2% within 1 h, is increased 2.4-fold by phorbol esters, but is not influenced by ionophores. An ACE mutant lacking the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic part (ACE delta COOH), is secreted at a faster rate without a carboxyl-terminal cleavage, and phorbol esters or ionophores have no effect on its rate of production in the medium. Therefore, the proteolysis of ACE is dependent on the presence of the membrane anchor and suggests that the secretase(s) involved is also membrane-associated. An ACE mutant lacking the amino-terminal domain (ACECF) is secreted 10-fold faster compared with wild-type ACE. The solubilization of ACECF occurs at the plasma membrane and is stimulated 2.7-fold by phorbol esters, and the cleavage site is localized between Arg-1227 and Val-1228. The amino-terminal domain of ACE slows down the proteolysis and seems to act as a \"conformational inhibitor\" of the proteolytic process, possibly via interactions with the \"stalk\" of ACE and the secretase(s) itself.", 
    "606": "We examined whether the excretory effect of atrial natriuretic peptide could be antagonized by intravenously administered bradykinin or by elevated endogenous kinin levels attained during converting enzyme inhibition. Urinary volume and sodium and potassium excretion were determined every 20 minutes in female, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 0.19 to 0.22 kg) infused with 10 microL/min isotonic glucose. In some experiments, urinary cGMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay. Two intravenous boluses of 209 pmol (0.5 micrograms) atrial natriuretic peptide were given before and after the injection of test substances, and the response ratio was used to quantify inhibition. Single injections of 94.3 or 142 pmol (100 or 150 ng) bradykinin, 3 minutes prior to atrial natriuretic peptide, inhibited the excretion of water, sodium, and potassium by 70%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. Larger (236 to 472 pmol) or smaller (23.6 to 47.2 pmol) bradykinin doses were ineffective. None of the bradykinin doses tested affected basal urinary output, systemic pressure, or the modest depressor effect of atrial natriuretic peptide. The anti-atrial natriuretic peptide effect of bradykinin was completely prevented by the kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140. Converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril (96 nmol IV) also blunted atrial natriuretic peptide diuresis and natriuresis by 70% and reduced urinary cGMP excretion by 50%. These effects of ramipril were mediated by endogenous kinin accumulation, since they were abolished by pretreatment with Hoe 140. It is concluded that intrarenal kinins modulate the renal actions of atrial natriuretic peptide, and at a precise concentration bradykinin strongly antagonizes atrial natriuretic peptide by preventing its transduction mechanism.", 
    "607": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increases the angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and bradykinin concentrations in plasma and tissue. In this study we evaluated the interaction between these peptides by determining the effect of Ang-(1-7) on the hypotensive action of bradykinin in conscious rats. Administration of Ang-(1-7) (5 nmol) did not change mean arterial pressure or heart rate. However, the hypotensive effect of bradykinin, produced by an intravenous or intra-arterial route, was potentiated by Ang-(1-7) in a dose-dependent manner. The Ang-(1-7) doses necessary to transform the effect of a single dose of bradykinin into that produced by a double dose (potentiating unit) were 2 nmol i.v. and 5 nmol IA. The Ang-(1-7) dose used did not change either the pressor effect of Ang II or the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside. The bradykinin-potentiating Ang-(1-7) activity was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg IM, n = 4). In an additional group the bradykinin-potentiating activity of Ang-(1-7) was evaluated 30 minutes after treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (10 mg/kg i.v., n = 9). Under this condition the bradykinin-potentiating activity of Ang-(1-7) was substantially increased, resulting in a potentiating unit of approximately 0.2 nmol IV. Pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg IM, n = 7) also attenuated the bradykinin-potentiating activity of Ang-(1-7) in enalaprilat-treated rats. These results show that Ang-(1-7) is a bradykinin-potentiating peptide in vivo. Furthermore, the data obtained with indomethacin suggest that prostaglandins participate in the mechanism of the bradykinin potentiation by Ang-(1-7). More importantly, these data suggest that the interaction between Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin can contribute to the pharmacological effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "608": "Using ion-exchange chromatography of dialyzed human urine from healthy and hypertensive patients, we detected two peaks of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity on hippuryl-His-Leu eluted at ionic strengths of 0.7 (F1 peak) and 1.25 (F2 peak) mS. These hydrolytic activities decreased gradually in the urine of patients submitted to isradipine treatment, F2 and F1 disappearing after 12 and 24 hours, respectively. By Western blot analysis, the urine fractions corresponding to both peaks from healthy and untreated patients presenting ACE activity and from treated patients (24 hours) without this activity were recognized by an ACE-specific antibody. These results indicated that ACE was present but inhibited in the urine of isradipine-treated patients. In vitro assays with ACE isolated from human urine and guinea pig plasma demonstrated that the enzyme is inhibited by isradipine and other commercially available calcium channel blockers, such as felodipine, nifedipine, and verapamil. A noncompetitive inhibition was observed with all calcium channel blockers studied. In conclusion, these results suggest that besides the primary effect on calcium channels, the more commonly used calcium channel blockers are also ACE inhibitors. The development of efficient calcium channel blockers with higher ACE inhibitory activity could result in interesting bifunctional antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "609": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) plays an important role in central cardiovascular regulation through the activation of different neurotransmitter systems at distinct extrahypothalamic sites. To study possible alterations in the TRH system in the hypertensive state, we measured TRH concentration in cerebrospinal fluid and TRH content of the preoptic area in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) by radioimmunoassay. In addition, we also measured the density of the TRH receptor in this area by a rapid filtration technique using [3H]methyl-TRH. We found a significant increase in both the TRH content (634 +/- 61 versus 350 +/- 26 pg/mg protein, SHR versus WKY; P < .01, n = 5) and density of TRH receptors without changes in affinity (Bmax, 5.0 +/- 0.1 versus 3.3 +/- 0.1 fmol/mg protein, P < .01, n = 4). An increase in TRH concentration was also found in the cerebrospinal fluid of SHR (30 +/- 3 versus 21 +/- 2 pg/mL, P < .01, n = 5), suggesting increased TRH release in the central nervous system. Northern blot analysis indicated a threefold augmented abundance of TRH precursor mRNA in the preoptic area of SHR. A polyclonal antibody raised against TRH injected peripherally or intracerebroventricularly lowered arterial blood pressure in SHR but not in WKY. In addition, long-term treatment with enalapril (5 mg/kg twice daily), which was effective in inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by more than 50%, decreased arterial blood pressure and preoptic area TRH content of SHR, whereas another vasodilator, diltiazem (10 mg/kg every 8 hours), failed to produce a similar change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Neither of these has been applied to patients with type II diabetes mellitus, in whom it has been proposed that the desirable blood pressure should be lower than in nondiabetics. This multicenter study was designed to examine whether there are differences in the efficacy of a first-line antihypertensive drug when assessed by casual and ambulatory blood pressure determinations in patients with type II diabetes mellitus in whom 24-hour ambulatory monitoring confirms or fails to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. Forty-three patients (mean age, 57.7 years) with stable type II diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension (casual diastolic pressure, 90 to 104 mm Hg on at least two visits) were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril, 10 to 20 mg, once a day) for 8 weeks. Antihypertensive drug efficacy was assessed by casual (trough) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Diabetic patients were classified as nonconfirmed hypertensive if the mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic pressure was below 85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive treatment significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic pressures when determined by either casual measurement (from a mean of 162.7/98.0 to 153.9/89.2 mm Hg; P < .001) or ambulatory monitoring (from a mean of 143.1/84.4 to 137.0/81.5 mm Hg; P < .05). Twenty-one patients (49%) were classified as confirmed hypertensive and 22 as nonconfirmed hypertensive. In confirmed hypertensive patients benazepril significantly reduced systolic and diastolic pressures when assessed by either casual or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "611": "We tested whether cardiac mass can be related to decreased aortic stiffness in an original rat model of isolated systolic hypertension. Increased aortic stiffness was produced by calcium overload of elastic arteries after vitamin D3 plus nicotine treatment. Half of the animals were chronically treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg per day PO). Rats were pithed, and lower body vascular resistance was measured. Blood pressure was then increased by phenylephrine infusion, and carotidofemoral pulse wave velocity was measured. This value together with those for thoracic aorta internal diameter and medial thickness (determined after in situ fixation and histomorphometry) were used to calculate elastic modulus. Vitamin D3 plus nicotine treatment produced parallel increases in cardiac mass and elastic modulus, with a significant correlation between the two. There was no significant change in resistance. Treatment with perindopril reversed the changes in cardiac mass and elastic modulus but had no effect on resistance after calcium overload of the elastic arteries. In this model of isolated systolic hypertension, we showed that cardiac mass is related to arterial elasticity.", 
    "612": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration designed the trough-to-peak ratio as an instrument for the evaluation of long-acting antihypertensive drugs, but the ratios are usually reported without accounting for interindividual variability. This study investigated how the trough-to-peak ratio would be affected by interindividual and intraindividual variability and by smoothing of the diurnal blood pressure profiles. The ambulatory blood pressure was recorded on placebo in 143 hypertensive patients (diastolic pressure on conventional measurement > 95 mm Hg). After 2 months, the recordings were repeated on 10 mg (n = 66) or 20 mg (n = 77) lisinopril given once daily between 7 and 11 PM. The baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were determined from diurnal blood pressure profiles with 1-hour precision. Lisinopril reduced (+/- SD) the 24-hour pressure by 16 +/- 17 mm Hg for systolic and 10 +/- 10 mm Hg for diastolic (P < .001). According to the usual approach, disregarding interindividual variability, the trough-to-peak ratio was 0.72 for systolic pressure and 0.67 for diastolic pressure. In the 143 patients the ratios were not normally distributed. They were the same on both lisinopril doses. When interindividual variability was accounted for, the median trough-to-peak ratio was 0.34 (P5 to P95 interval, -0.46 to 0.87) for systolic pressure and 0.26 (-0.44 to 0.84) for diastolic pressure. In 66 patients examined twice on 10 mg lisinopril at a median interval of 32 days, the trough-to-peak ratios were characterized by large intraindividual variability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "613": "We assessed the renal hemodynamic response to L-arginine infusion (30 g within 60 minutes) in normotensive subjects, patients with never-treated essential hypertension, and hypertensive patients controlled by long-term (more than 2 years) treatment with or without an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The renal vasodilator response to L-arginine observed in normotensive subjects (15 +/- 4% increase in effective renal plasma flow) was abolished in untreated hypertensive patients and restored only in the group treated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. In the whole population a positive correlation between the change in effective renal plasma flow and the change in urinary cGMP was obtained. It is suggested that abnormalities of the renal nitric oxide pathway not corrected by increased availability of L-arginine and reversible only on long-term treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may underlie the abnormal renal resistance observed in essential hypertension.",

In Switzerland a total of 797 patients have been enrolled in the study. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with felodipine = Plendil (5 mg/day). This vasoelective calcium antagonist could reduce diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mg/Hg, respectively, in one of two or one of three patients within the first three months. In nine or six patients, respectively out of ten a reduction of diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mmHg was reached within one year by combination of felodipine with other antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics).", 
    "616": "1H NMR methods are described which allow direct studies of the Cys34 binding site of albumin in intact human blood plasma in vitro. Antiarthritic gold drugs and the alcohol-aversive drug disulfiram induce a structural transition detectable via H epsilon 1 and H delta 2 resonances of His3 of albumin, and reactions of cystine, glutathione and captopril in plasma have also been investigated. Contrary to most assumptions, little of the albumin in normal plasma appears to be blocked at Cys34 as a cystine disulfide.", 
    "617": "We describe how adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can play an important role in pharmaceutical research and drug development. Not only do ADRs represent the risks and drawbacks associated with drugs but they can also be related to other knowledge available in pharmaceutical and medical research. We offer a model that can be used to systematically map the pathways through which ADRs can lead to innovative research. These pathways include chemical, therapeutic or pathophysiological steps that can be taken to arrive at new knowledge based on ADRs. We used the development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, especially captopril, as a case study. The similarity between the ADR profiles of captopril and penicillamine was a starting point for further innovation. Historical analysis shows that in several instances research in the field of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been triggered by ADRs. The model presented here might be applicable to other areas of innovative drug research.", 
    "618": "A high prevalence of increased intima/media thickness of the arterial wall has been documented in hypertension. These alterations in vascular wall structure may be potent determinants for the promotion of the development of atherosclerosis. Direct histologic data from animal models of hypertension, and indirect data from hypertensive patients, have demonstrated a marked regression of increased intima/media thickness by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Long-term effects of ACE inhibition on structural wall changes in humans have not been examined. Therefore, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind European trial was designed to compare the effects of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in slowing or reversing progression of increased intima/media thickness of carotid and femoral arteries in hypertensive patients. A total of 800 patients at 17 clinical centers in 7 European countries, aged 35-65 years, with hypertension and ultrasonographically proven intima/media thickness > or = 0.8 mm of the common carotid artery will be randomly assigned to receive in a double-blind fashion either perindopril or hydrochlorothiazide and will be followed for 24 months. High resolution duplex sonography will be used to quantify intima/media thickness at baseline and twice a year during follow-up. A change of 0.1 mm of intima/media thickness from baseline is considered to be detectable, and the standard deviations of the changes from baseline are expected not to be higher than 0.2 mm. The primary endpoint of the study is the comparison of changes in intima/media thickness of the common carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "619": "Distensibility and compliance are large artery properties, that may be important in cardiovascular disease. Distensibility is a determinant of the pulsatile stress on the vessel wall and is thought important in ageing and atherosclerotic disease. Compliance reflects the buffering capacity of the arteries and is a major determinant of the afterload on the heart. In hypertension large arteries are getting stiffer, resulting in a decreased distensibility and compliance. Decrease in blood pressure by itself can improve large artery properties. Despite a decrease in blood pressure, not all antihypertensive drugs improve large artery properties. Compliance is improved by firstline antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers with vasodilating properties, selective beta 1-blockers and some diuretics. Recent data suggest that ACE inhibitors such as perindopril improve distensibility and compliance of large arteries more than diuretics such as amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide. Apart from the indirect effect (decrease in blood pressure), this makes a direct effect of perindopril on large artery properties very likely. ACE inhibitors such as perindopril decrease the afterload on the heart more than diuretics such as amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide by both a more pronounced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in large artery compliance.", 
    "620": "We investigated the effect of chronic angiotensin-covering enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment on functional and biochemical cardiac parameters in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Animals were treated prenatally and, subsequently, up to the age of 20 weeks with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (0.01 and 1 mg/kg per day). The contribution of endogenous bradykinin potentiation to the actions of the ACE inhibitor was assessed by co-treatment with the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, icatibant (500 micrograms/kg/day s.c.), from 6 to 20 weeks of age and by measurement of myocardial prostacyclin and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) concentrations. Chronic high-dose treatment with perindopril attenuated the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy while low-dose perindopril treatment had no effect on these parameters. However, low-dose perindopril improved cardiac function of isolated perfused hearts as demonstrated by an increasing left ventricular pressure and dp/dtmax without change in heart rate. Low-dose perindopril further reduced lactate concentrations and the enzymatic activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the coronary venous effluent and increased tissue concentrations of glycogen, adenosine triphosphate, and creatine kinase in the myocardium. Concomitant chronic bradykinin receptor blockade abolished all ACE inhibitor-induced effects on cardiac function and metabolism. Cardiac prostacylin concentrations were 3-fold elevated in perindopril-treated animals when compared to vehicle-treated controls, while cardiac cyclic GMP concentrations remained unchanged. Our data demonstrate that chronic ACE inhibitor treatment can improve cardiac function and metabolism independently of the antihypertensive and antihypertrophic drug actions by potentiation of endogenous bradykinin.", 
    "621": "A total of 25 patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomly selected from a larger group referred to hospital. Treatment was initiated with perindopril (4-8 mg orally). If normotension was not achieved, isradipine (5-10 mg orally) was added and, if necessary, hydralazine was added. Before treatment and at the end of a 9-month period of normotension (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg), 24-hour blood pressure and echocardiographic measurements were performed and resistance artery structure was determined. A total of 20 age- and sex-matched normotensives were used as controls. During antihypertensive treatment, mean blood pressure was reduced from 128 +/- 11 to 103 +/- 6 mm Hg. Left ventricular mass was reduced from 300 +/- 76 to 198 +/- 54 g. The media:lumen ratio of the resistance arteries decreased from 9.8 +/- 2.6% to 7.8 +/- 1.9%; control subjects exhibited a media:lumen ratio of the same magnitude (7.9 +/- 2.0%). Results indicate that a perindopril-based regimen is extremely efficient in normalizing resistance artery and cardiac ventricular structures within one year of treatment. The impact of these findings on the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in arterial hypertension still remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "622": "The growing emphasis on structural alterations in the heart and vasculature as a critical common pathway toward morbidity and mortality in a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases has opened the door to new interventions that might fundamentally affect these processes. Converting enzyme inhibitors, because of their demonstrable effect on both left ventricular and vascular remodeling, are attractive agents to alter the natural history of these diseases. Whether the effect of converting enzyme inhibitors is mediated by a reduction of angiotensin II, an increase in bradykinin, or other local growth factors remains to be established. Other agents may share or complement the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in inhibiting these unwanted remodeling processes. It is clear that the future of therapy for chronic cardiovascular diseases must take into consideration the structural abnormalities that in the past have been given inadequate attention. New and more targeted therapy to alter specific structural changes may profoundly affect the natural history of these diseases.", 
    "623": "Endothelial cells can produce at least 3 substances which cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle: (1) endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO, which is secreted not only toward the underlying vascular smooth muscle but also into the blood vessel lumen). NO also has a physiological role at the interface between the endothelial cells and the blood content; in particular, NO inhibits the adhesion of platelets and leukocytes to the endothelium. (2) Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, presumably a labile metabolite of arachidonic acid formed through the P-450 pathway, which appears to act on smooth muscle by being one of the few physiologic openers of the potassium channels. (3) Prostacyclin, which can be considered as an endothelium-derived relaxing substance, given its vasodilator activity and its primarily endothelial origin. One of the main factors modulating the release of these EDRFs is the shear stress of blood on the arterial wall, which explains why flow-induced vasodilation is endothelium-dependent in the intact organism. The peptide bradykinin is a potent stimulus for EDRF release. The normal lifespan of an adult human endothelial cell is some 30 years, after which aging takes its toll and the cells must be replaced. The regenerated cells lose some of their ability to release EDRF, in particular in response to platelet aggregation and thrombin. Finally, in hypertension and atherosclerosis, a decrease in endothelium-dependent relaxation is obvious in response to a variety of stimuli. All converting enzyme inhibitors tested so far share a potentiating effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin, and augmented local production of bradykinin may help to explain the acute vasodilator properties of these compounds.", 
    "624": "Systemic vasoconstriction due to stimulation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems is a hallmark of heart failure and this is accompanied by impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations at the level of large arteries. This study investigated, in a rat model of heart failure, whether such an endothelial dysfunction also exists at the level of the resistance artery, and whether this is associated with morphologic changes, as well as the effects of chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/kg/day). After 12 months, arterial pressure, left ventricular (LV) end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and LV dP/dt were measured in anesthetized rats. Responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside were determined in isolated and perfused mesenteric artery segments (diameter: 280 +/- 15 microns). After fixation, vessel diameter, media cross-sectional area, and media collagen and elastin densities were measured by image analysis. After 12 months, untreated rats showed signs of heart failure, i.e., reduced LV dP/dt, and increased LVEDP, heart weight/body weight, LV cavity circumference, and myocardial collagen density. In mesenteric vessels the endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine was impaired, whereas the response to the nitric oxide donor nitroprusside was unaffected. Heart failure did not affect vascular morphological parameters. Perindopril decreased blood pressure and LVEDP without any modification of LV dP/dt, and prevented cardiac remodeling. At the vascular level, perindopril improved the response to acetylcholine and reduced media cross-sectional area and collagen density without affecting internal vessel diameter or elastin density. Thus, heart failure decreases endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine without modification of vessel structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "625": "Application of periarterial collars induced atheroma-like lesions in the carotid arteries of normocholesterolemic rabbits. Vessel segments taken from the mid-region of the collar (cuffed region) and control regions of the same artery were studied at 7 days after surgery. A group of placebo rabbits was provided ad libitum with regular tap water, and treated animals were supplied for 14 days (beginning 7 days before collar application) with water containing perindopril (daily intake of approximately 0.3 mg/kg). Perindopril treatment reduced plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by 88% but did not significantly alter arterial blood pressure or heart rate. The sensitivity of arterial rings to angiotensins I and II did not differ between control and cuffed arteries in either placebo or perindopril-treated rabbits, but in rings from both groups of rabbits the sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor action of serotonin was higher in the cuffed segments, as in previous studies. In addition, in placebo rabbits the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant response to acetylcholine (which results from the release of nitric oxide) was weaker in cuffed arteries than in controls, whereas in the perindopril-treated animals, this impairment of relaxation was restored to the extent that, in cuffed vessels, it was no longer significantly different from the controls. Similar results were obtained in rabbits treated with another ACE inhibitor (ramipril). In contrast, acute treatment with the metabolite, perindoprilat, in vitro (1.0 microM) did not alter the response to acetylcholine in control or cuffed rings from placebo rabbits. Morphologically, vessel segments taken from the center of the cuffed artery of placebo rabbits showed a thickened intima with marked smooth muscle cell proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "626": "Endothelial function was studied in perfused mesenteric arterial bed preparations removed from 6, 12, 24, or 30 month-old, male, normotensive rats. Half of the animals were treated with a hypotensive dose of an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril, 1 mg/kg/day, p.o.) from 6 months onwards. Disruption of endothelium produced a fall in baseline perfusion pressure in all animals except 30-month old controls, suggesting that the maintenance of baseline tone by endothelial vasoconstrictor(s) is impaired with age. Physiologic antagonism of norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction by the muscarinic agonist carbachol was impaired in 30-month old controls. Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction increased following disruption of endothelium, suggesting that norepinephrine-induced release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor attenuates vasoconstriction. This mechanism was impaired in 30-month old controls. Chronic ACE inhibition postponed the age-related decrease in vasodilator and vasoconstrictor endothelial functions, either directly or indirectly via the hypotensive action of such treatment.", 
    "627": "Chronic heart failure is associated with neurohumoral activation and alterations of the peripheral circulation and skeletal muscle. Several mechanisms are involved in the impaired peripheral perfusion, including increased sympathetic tone and increased vascular stiffness. Recently, data suggest an important role of the endothelium for perfusion of skeletal muscle in heart failure. Endothelium-dependent dilation of resistance vessels is blunted in patients with severe chronic heart failure and may be involved in the impaired reactive hyperemia in these patients. In conductance vessels, flow-dependent dilation and the nitroglycerin-induced dilator response is attenuated in congestive heart failure as compared to normal subjects, indicating both endothelial dysfunction and a defect of smooth muscle relaxation. Recent data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can improve endothelial function of resistance vessels, reduce serum level of the soluble endothelial (vascular cell) adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and, in addition, improve peripheral vascular function by reducing or limiting the influence of cyclo-oxygenase-dependent vasoconstricting factor(s). It is conceivable that these beneficial effects of chronic ACE inhibition are due, in part, to blockade of bradykinin degradation by the ACE and the increased endothelial synthesis of prostaglandins and/or the release of nitric oxide by enhanced tissue levels of bradykinin.",

    "641": "Chronic administration of propionyl-l-carnitine has been recently shown to correct hypertrophy related abnormalities in muscle mechanics. Accordingly, this study investigated whether the drug would similarly improve cardiac dynamics in rats with pressure overload. Enalapril was used for comparison. Drugs were administered in the drinking water for 3 weeks to Wistar Kyoto rats with a 2 week abdominal aortic constriction. Cardiac function was studied under urethane anaesthesia in basal conditions, during increase in preload, and during increase in afterload. Basal cardiac function was comparable in pressure-overloaded and sham-operated animals. Neither propionyl-l-carnitine nor enalapril affected the basal performance. Compared to sham-operated animals, untreated pressure-overloaded rats showed an impaired cardiac response (cardiac output, stroke volume) to preload increase induced by saline i.v. infusion. Propionyl-l-carnitine dose dependently improved cardiac function in the range 30-180 mg/kg, without affecting cardiac hypertrophic growth. Enalapril (3 mg/kg) reduced cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac function. The two effects were unrelated. The afterload increase by total aortic occlusion evidenced a reduction in the left ventricle pressure generating capacity of hypertrophied hearts. Propionyl-l-carnitine did not modify this parameter, while enalapril afforded a significant improvement. Results show that propionyl-l-carnitine significantly improves in vivo cardiac dynamics under conditions of increased energy demand. The effect is not due to inotropic efficacy, but presumably to increased cardiac efficiency.",

    "646": "We have isolated by immunological screening of a lambda ZAPII cDNA library constructed from rat brain mRNAs a cDNA clone encoding endopeptidase 3.4.24.16. The longest open reading frame encodes a 704-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 80,202 daltons and bears the consensus sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family. The sequence exhibits a 60.2% homology with those of another zinc metallopeptidase, endopeptidase 3.4.24.15. Northern blot analysis reveals two mRNA species of about 3 and 5 kilobases in rat brain, ileum, kidney, and testis. We have transiently transfected COS-7 cells with pcDNA3 containing the cloned cDNA and established the overexpression of a 70-75-kDa immunoreactive protein.

    "647": "In this study we investigated, by means of the spectral analysis approach, the possible alterations in the activity of the pressor-control mechanisms in relation to the development of essential hypertension. Since the maintenance of controlled arterial blood pressure (ABP) levels is achieved by a continuously fluctuating control system, instantaneous ABP varies continuously in direct correlation with the activation of various control branches. The power spectrum of ABP fluctuations thus provides a quantitative measure of the activity of the various controlling mechanisms. Two strains of rats, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY), were subjected to acute hemorrhage, a procedure known to trigger a strong response, of both the neural (autonomic nervous system) and the hormonal (renin-angiotensin and vasopressin) systems. ABP was continuously recorded from the caudal artery in conscious, 1-month-old SHR and WKY. Three groups of rats were studied. Group 1, acute 2-ml hemorrhage; Groups 2, injection of prazosin (2.5 mg/kg) or Group 3, captopril (4 mg/kg), each followed by bleeding as in the group 1. Spectral analysis of ABP fluctuations was performed on time traces of 20 min duration. The low-frequency part of the power spectrum was analyzed. Three frequency bands were investigated: 0.004-0.04 Hz, 0.04-0.07 Hz and 0.07-0.1 Hz. In SHR, although the baseline mean ABP levels were similar to those of WKY, ABP fluctuations were significantly dampened in SHR in each of the three frequency ranges. Hemorrhage induced, in both strains, a similar fall in mean ABP accompanied by an increase in the slow ABP fluctuations. However, in SHR, the response was significantly greater that that of WKY. The steepest response was observed in the slowest, 0.004-0.04 Hz frequency band, 8.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.4 times the baseline levels. However, this intense increase in power after hemorrhage brought the two strains to similar levels. The difference in the response to bleeding was eliminated, in the three frequency ranges, by alpha 1 blockade. Captopril reduced the response to bleeding in SHR, to the level observed in WKY in all three frequency bands. Spectral analysis of the spontaneous oscillations in ABP unmasks abnormalities which conventional blood pressure measurements cannot detect in 1-month-old, still normotensive SHR. It thus, provides a tool to study the dynamics of the abnormalities which precede the development of hypertension. Bleeding amplifies the malfunction observed in SHR under baseline conditions, since the mean ABP levels were similar in both strains before and after bleeding, SHR seem to retain the ability to respond to a fall in blood volume by requiring a greater recruitment of the control mechanisms than WKY.",

Stress/rest thallium-201 scintigraphy is shown to have a predictive value of 78% for a diagnosis of microvascular disease in hypertensive patients with exertional angina and left ventricular hypertrophy. Lack of isotope uptake at peak stress correlates well with the decrease in coronary flow reserve in ischemic segments, which is 2-3 times lower than in normal subjects. Treatment with enalapril produces regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, normalization of thallium-201 uptake, and an increase in exercise capacity in patients with microvascular angina.", 
    "649": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have proven to be uniquely effective in inducing regression, or preventing the occurrence, of ventricular hypertrophy associated with systemic hypertension. This has pointed, for many years, to a possible direct involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Over the last 10 years further supporting evidence has been forthcoming about direct trophic effects of angiotensin II in several experimental systems. Additionally, we now have rather conclusive evidence for the existence of a local, intracardiac renin-angiotensin system, which is capable of synthesis of all components of the system, and of cleaving, via the classic pathway, angiotensin peptides from the precursor, angiotensinogen. Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of regulatory response and modulation of activity of the local system in response to a variety of pharmacologic perturbations as well as differential expression of specific components under pathologic conditions, including compensatory hypertrophy and remodeling after myocardial infarction, pressure overload hypertrophy, and volume overload hypertrophy. Continued research into the role of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure will provide us with the tools to devise more specific, targeted strategies for therapeutic intervention or prevention.", 
    "650": "Because it is not metabolized as is norepinephrine (NE), most of the metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) taken up by the heart is considered to be lost subsequently by release concomitant with sympathetic stimulation. Therefore we examined whether the washout of MIBG is influenced by sympathetic tone, which we modulated by using immobilization stress or activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).", 
    "651": "In 175 male ddY mice, left ventricular radioactivity was counted 30 minutes or 4 hours after injection of 74 kBq (2 microCi) of iodine 125- or iodine 131-labeled MIBG (125I- or 131I-MIBG). The washout rates of MIBG were determined under immobilization stress or under sodium loading or restriction in combination with losartan (10 mg/kg) or cilazapril (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. Immobilization enhanced the washout of 125I-MIBG (80.9% vs 57.9% in the control animals); this was determined to be related to washout from the neuronal compartment, because the nonneuronal component assessed through desipramine pretreatment was not affected. Pretreatment with losartan or cilazapril decreased the facilitation of 125I-MIBG washout in sodium-restricted mice (40.9% and 33.7%, respectively, vs 43.5% in the control animals), but not in sodium-loaded mice.", 
    "652": "Measurement of MIBG washout may be feasible for determining the changes in sympathetic tone caused by immobilization stress or activation of the RAS.", 
    "653": "To evaluate the blood pressure lowering efficacy as well as tolerability and safety of the angiotensin II antagonist losartan compared with that of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "654": "The study was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel study. Patients (n = 407) with diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 and < or = 120 mmHg at the end of a 2-week baseline placebo period were randomly allocated to receive either 50 mg losartan once a day or 20 mg enalapril once a day for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, clinical and laboratory safety, specific symptoms including coughing determined using a symptoms questionnaire and metabolic variables were examined at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12.", 
    "655": "Both losartan and enalapril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline at weeks 6 and 12. Blood pressure changes from baseline at trough (22-26 h after the dose) did not differ between the two groups in the per-protocol analysis. Response to treatment at trough was excellent or good (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg) in 51 and 53% of the patients in the losartan and enalapril groups, respectively. Enalapril administration increased dry coughing symptoms whereas losartan did not. The incidence of dry coughing was 1.0 and 12.2% as a spontaneously reported discomfort at week 12 and 3.0 and 15.1% as a clinical adverse experience in the losartan and enalapril groups, respectively. The difference from baseline at week 12 in the incidence of dry coughing between the two groups was 14.9% as a specific symptom in the symptoms questionnaire. Losartan reduced serum uric acid concentration, whereas effects on other metabolic parameters did not differ between the groups.", 
    "656": "Losartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug showing similar blood-pressure-lowering efficacy to that of enalapril at trough. However, in contrast to enalapril, losartan does not increase the incidence of dry coughing. Thus, the angiotensin II antagonist losartan provides a promising new approach to treatment of hypertension.", 
    "657": "To compare the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, on blood pressure and on other echocardiographic parameters.", 
    "658": "The study was conducted in accord with the PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded endpoint) design. Randomized treatment either with ramipril or with atenolol was continued for 6 months, and echocardiograms were recorded before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The echo tracings were blindly evaluated in a single reading centre.", 
    "659": "M-mode, two-dimensional guided echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular wall thicknesses and dimensions, from which left ventricular mass was calculated, according to the Penn convention.", 
    "660": "Of 193 patients at 16 centres, 111 had echocardiograms that could be quantitatively evaluated. The primary analysis of the study was performed using data from those patients. In addition, echocardiograms of 88 patients were analysed on an 'according to protocol' basis (patients with preset values of left ventricular mass). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced both by ramipril and by atenolol without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. The heart rate was significantly reduced by atenolol only. Both the 'primary' and the 'according to protocol' analyses showed that the left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by ramipril only. Comparison between treatments according to a multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass during ramipril than during atenolol treatment.", 
    "661": "The present study is the first of suitably large size in which a direct comparison of the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker on echocardiographic left ventricular mass has been performed. It has demonstrated that ramipril is more effective than atenolol in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertensive patients.", 
    "662": "Recent clinical data from the SOLVD (Studies on Left Ventricular Dysfunction) and SAVE (Survival and Ventricular Enlargement) studies have shown a significant reduction in ischaemic events with ACE inhibition. When the results of the two SOLVD and the SAVE trials were combined, the overall risk reduction in myocardial infarction with long-term ACE inhibitor treatment was 23% (P < 0.001) and the overall risk reduction for hospitalizations for unstable angina 15%. The time frame of the clinical effects suggests that ACE inhibitors may be working through an antiatherosclerotic mechanism, and genetic, epidemiological and mechanistic data suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a role in the atherosclerotic process. Genetic and epidemiological evidence has shown that an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system is associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction, and mechanistic studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibition can produce antiatherosclerotic effects in animal models. The antiatherosclerotic effects of ACE inhibitors may be mediated at one of several steps in the atherosclerotic pathway: blocking plaque formation, plaque rupture, or thrombus formation.", 
    "663": "Progressive changes typically occur in left ventricular (LV) architecture following moderate- to large-sized myocardial infarction (MI). These changes include early expansion and thinning of the infarct zone and subsequent increase in myocardial mass within the non-infarcted zone, with LV dilatation and loss of the normal elliptical configuration of the LV cavity. These changes are accompanied by impaired myocyte function and advancing clinical expression of heart failure. Numerous animal and human studies have documented inhibition of LV remodeling post-MI by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although the ideal timing for initiating treatment remains uncertain, evidence exists that benefit persists long after the time of initial injury. Mechanisms for the effects of ACE inhibitors on LV remodelling may be dependent on changes in myocardial load, may be load independent, or both. These effects are likely to be mediated by reductions in circulating and local tissue concentrations of angiotensin II and in bradykinin degradation. Regardless of the exact mechanism or mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors exert their favourable influence on LV remodelling, it is likely that this effect is a key mediator of the documented clinical benefits afforded by treatment with this class of agents.", 
    "664": "The renin-angiotensin and adrenergic nervous systems are cross-regulated compensatory mechanisms that are induced or activated in the failing heart. In ventricular myocardium, the activation of one of these systems leads to activation or induction of the other, resulting in co-amplification of cellular mechanisms that result in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, hyperplasia of nonmyocytic tissue components, increased contractility and heart rate, and increased ventricular volume. Although these changes serve to stabilize stroke volume and cardiac output following an insult to the myocardium, the chronic and continual activation of these systems produces ventricular dilatation and deleterious remodelling at a chamber level and progressive myocyte dysfunction at a cellular level. Because these systems are cross-regulated, inhibition of one of them attenuates the activity of the other. This appears to be especially true in the failing heart, where angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can produce substantial anti-adrenergic effects in individuals with high levels of adrenergic activation. The anti-adrenergic properties of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be at least partially responsible for the salutary effects of these agents in the clinical setting of heart failure or ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "665": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Similarly, reduced fibrinolytic activity has been associated with an increased risk of AMI. Evidence is now accumulating that the RAS plays an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis and that pharmacological interruption of the RAS exerts a positive effect on endogenous fibrinolytic balance. This relationship appears to provide a partial explanation for the newly recognized effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing AMI.", 
    "666": "The cardiac vasculature and myocardium contain components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which may regulate local growth and cellular function. Alterations in the expression or action of these components, which include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II type-1 receptors, may contribute to the development of disease, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and end-stage heart failure. ACE is one RAS component found to have genetic variants associated with cardiovascular disease. Molecular variants in any of the RAS components may affect signalling pathways, possibly increasing the risk of heart failure. In addition, variants may exacerbate the deleterious effects of altered RAS expression on cardiac function. Genetic variation in RAS components may affect therapy with ACE inhibitors and receptor-blocking agents. Although at present there is no compelling reason to target molecular variations for treatment, a new era in selective pharmacological therapy for cardiovascular disease may be imminent.", 
    "667": "Genetic variations in the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems could prove to be significant pathophysiological mechanisms affecting coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly given the powerful vasoactivity of products such as angiotensin II and bradykinin. Indeed, studies show that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death, even in otherwise low-risk subjects. Genetic differences do not appear to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis or hypertension, however. Because ACE polymorphism modulates local production of angiotensin II, a powerful coronary vasoconstrictor, it may influence left ventricular mass in general as well as in coexisting disease states such as hypertension and cardiomyopathy. However, further study is needed to clarify the implications of ACE polymorphism in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Interactions between ACE and angiotensin II type-1 receptors may have clinical implications for preventing and managing CHD. Screening for genetic risk, as evidenced by certain variants in receptor coding sequence, may prove worthwhile if detrimental effects can be countered by drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Given the important roles of angiotensin II and bradykinin as modulators of cellular growth and of vasoactivity, deleterious and beneficial effect at different stages of the atherosclerotic process and during acute events leading to myocardial infarction or sudden death can be suspected.", 
    "668": "In the blood-vessel wall, the endothelium plays a key functional role by generating several substances that modulate vascular smooth muscle tone, as well as growth, and platelet function. This review focuses on the role of the endothelial L-arginine/nitric oxide signal transduction pathway in the maintenance of vascular integrity. Functional alterations of this pathway may be important in cardiovascular disease, because depressed activity of this protective mechanism leads to impaired relaxation and is also associated with reduced antithrombotic properties of the endothelial layer. Many of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy may be mediated through their ability to enhance the physiological roles of nitric oxide.", 
    "669": "The short- and long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol on serum lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels were investigated in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Fifty-two patients completed the 12-month, randomized, multicenter trial. After administration of lisinopril (10 to 20 mg/d; n = 24) and bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg/d; n = 28), systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P < 0.01) from baseline in both groups at 3, 6, and 12 months. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the lisinopril group than in the bisoprolol group only at 6 months. Heart rates dropped significantly in the bisoprolol group but not in the lisinopril group. No significant changes in lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, or Lp(a) levels were observed with either drug at 3, 6, or 12 months, and no significant differences were noted between the two drugs for these parameters. We conclude that lisinopril and bisoprolol are effective as antihypertensive drugs without adverse metabolic effects after short- and long-term treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension."
