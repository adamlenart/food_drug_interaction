These effects were observed in association with the local inhibition of ACE and NEP at the tissue level in the aorta and kidney. These results suggest that the anti-atherosclerotic effect conferred by omapatrilat treatment in the diabetic apo E-KO mouse is predominantly mediated by its capacity to inhibit local vascular ACE. By contrast, in the kidney, local renal ACE and NEP inhibition and the superior antihypertensive effect of omapatrilat all contribute to the renoprotective effect conferred by omapatrilat treatment in the diabetic apo E-KO mouse.",

Simultaneously with blood pressure decrease, we detected plasma kininogen depletion in the treated rats. The effect observed in vivo was abolished by pre-incubation of cathepsin L with the cysteine peptidase-specific inhibitor E-64 (1 microM) or by previous administration of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist JE049 (4 mg/kg). A potentiation of the hypotensive effect caused by cathepsin L was observed by previous administration of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg). In vitro studies indicated that cathepsin L excised bradykinin from the synthetic fluorogenic peptide Abz-MTSVIRRPPGFSPFRAPRV-NH2, based on the Met375-Val393 sequence of rat kininogen (Abz = o-aminobenzoic acid). In conclusion, our data indicate that in vivo cathepsin L releases a kinin-related peptide, and in vitro experiments suggest that the kinin generated is bradykinin. Although it is well known that cysteine proteases are strongly inhibited by kininogen, cathepsin L could represent an alternative pathway for kinin production in pathological processes.", 
    "27": "Investigations conducted in medical centers worldwide and ours indicate that patients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) will have short kidney graft survival when proteinuria and/or azotemia develop early, during the first post transplantation year. The analysis of published results suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) DD genotype represents unfavorable marker of rapid progression of chronic renal allograft dysfunction (CRAD). Differences of response to ACEi therapy in patients with chronic nephropathy of one's one or transplanted kidney could be explained by ACE genotype variety, where ACE DD is unfavorable genotype. Related factors influencing the ACEi therapy success in patients with particular ACE genotype are highly salt diet, interactions of genotype variety of all renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) molecules, i.e. diversity in the ACE, angiotensinogen, AT1 receptor or aldosterone genotype, as well as differences of ACEi responses in patients with glomerular and tubulointerstitial kidney diseases. Retardation of chronic renal failure in patients with ACE DD genotype who developed chronic allograft nephropathy has been obtained with long-term ACEi treatment and restricted salt intake to 50 mmol Na+ per day. We consider that genotype investigation of RAS molecule, primarily of ACE genotype in recipient and kidney donor should be done before high-risk kidney transplantation.",

We examined the effects of enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) or losartan (angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist) on duodenal HCO3- secretion in rats and investigated the mechanisms involved in the renin-angiotensin system-related HCO3- response. A proximal duodenal loop was perfused with saline, and HCO3- secretion was measured at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat method and by adding 2 mM HCl. Enalapril increased the HCO3- secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with a decrease in arterial blood pressure (MBP), and these effects were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin, L-NAME and FR172357 (a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist). Although losartan alone did not affect the HCO3- secretion, despite reducing MBP, the agent dose-dependently increased the HCO3- secretion in the presence of angiotensin II, and this response was totally antagonized by prior administration of FR172357, indomethacin and L-NAME. Bradykinin also dose-dependently increased the HCO3- secretion with no change in MBP, though transient, and again the effects were blocked by indomethacin, L-NAME and FR172357. Both prostaglandin (PG) E2 and the nitric oxide (NO) donor NOR-3 also increased the HCO3- secretion, the latter effect being inhibited by indomethacin. These results suggest that both an ACE inhibitor and AT1 antagonist (in the presence of angiotensin II) increase duodenal HCO3- secretion via a common pathway, involving bradykinin, NO and PGs. It is also assumed that bradykinin releases NO locally, which in turns stimulates HCO3- secretion mediated by PGs.",

    "59": "Kinins, the vasoactive peptides proteolytically liberated from kininogens, were recently recognized as signals alerting the innate immune system. Here we demonstrate that Leishmania donovani and Leishmania chagasi, two etiological agents of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), activate the kinin system. Intravital microscopy in the hamster cheek pouch showed that topically applied promastigotes induced macromolecular leakage (FITC-dextran) through postcapillary venules. Peaking at 15 min, the parasite-induced leakage was drastically enhanced by captopril (Cap), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a kinin-degrading metallopeptidase. The enhanced microvascular responses were cancelled by HOE-140, an antagonist of the B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R), or by pre-treatment of promastigotes with the irreversible cysteine proteinase inhibitor N-methylpiperazine-urea-Phe-homoPhe-vinylsulfone-benzene (N-Pip-hF-VSPh). In agreement with the above-mentioned data, the promastigotes vigorously induced edema in the paw of Cap-treated J129 mice, but not Cap-B2R-/- mice. Analysis of parasite-induced breakdown of high molecular weight kininogens (HK), combined with active site-affinity-labeling with biotin-N-Pip-hF-VSPh, identified 35-40 kDa proteins as kinin-releasing cysteine peptidases. We then checked if macrophage infectivity was influenced by interplay between these kinin-releasing parasite proteases, kininogens, and kinin-degrading peptidases (i.e. ACE). Our studies revealed that full-fledged B2R engagement resulted in vigorous increase of L. chagasi uptake by resident macrophages. Evidence that inflammatory macrophages treated with HOE-140 became highly susceptible to amastigote outgrowth, assessed 72 h after initial macrophage interaction, further suggests that the kinin/B2R activation pathway may critically modulate inflammation and innate immunity in visceral leishmaniasis.",

    "66": "Increased myocardial capillary density (P < .02) induced by phVEGF-A165 was counteracted by both enalapril (P < .07) and candesartan (P < .02) and then did not differ from control values. We found that phVEGF-A165 induced myocardial hVEGF-A expression (110 +/- 15 pg/heart, P < .0001). Both enalapril and candesartan decreased (P < .01) expression of hVEGF-A to a level not different from control values. Although phVEGF-A165 upregulated (P < .0001) mVEGFR-2, addition of candesartan downregulated endogenous mVEGF-A (P < .0001) and mVEGFR-2 (P < .0001) below the level in normal myocardium. Enalapril or candesartan did not effect luciferase expression.", 
    "67": "Enalapril and candesartan both specifically inhibit phVEGF-A165 induced myocardial angiogenesis in the normal heart. The mechanism of inhibition is a combination of inhibition of cardiac hVEGF-A expression and of decreased endogenous expression of the mVEGF ligand and receptor system.",

    "69": "One hundred seventy-three consecutive normotensive subjects admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with AMI were studied retrospectively with prospective follow-up 4 years after AMI. All the patients who were not known to be diabetic on admission (n = 150) underwent glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 2 months after AMI.", 
    "70": "Among the 15 patients (8.7%) who developed hypertension, GTT was abnormal in 75% (diabetes = 3, impaired glucose tolerance = 9). There were significantly more Indo-Asians and fewer whites in the hypertensive than in the normotesive patients but they were similar in age and gender, creatinine kinase level, and rate of thrombolysis during admission for AMI. Multiple regression analysis showed that progression to hypertension was a function of the presence of anterior AMI on admission (P = .0297), abnormal GTT (P = .0156), and subsequent MI on follow-up (P = .0122), but was independent of age, gender, smoking habit, body weight, previous MI, thrombolysis, creatinine kinase level, subsequent development of heart failure, and intake of beta-adrenergic blockade or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Of the hypertensive patients, 47% (n = 7) died compared to 8% (n = 13) of the normotensive subjects (P < .0001).",

    "72": "Hypertension produced by renal artery occlusive disease is an important secondary form of hypertension. Clinicians commonly encounter forms of renal arterial disease of varying severity, many of which are of little hemodynamic significance when first detected. Experimental studies emphasize that transient activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is necessary for initiation of renovascular hypertension. At some point, angiotensin II activates additional mechanisms responsible for sustained increased blood pressure including sodium retention, endothelial dysfunction, and vasoconstriction related to production of reactive oxygen species. Widespread application of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, render many patients with unilateral renal arterial disease manageable primarily by medical means for many years. In the setting of high a priori likelihood of renovascular disease, recognizing the potential for disease progression during medical therapy and individually evaluating the risks and benefits of renal revascularization are important tasks. Recent prospective studies show limited, but real, benefit regarding blood pressure control for patients with atherosclerotic disease. Whether earlier renal revascularization offers benefits regarding improved morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular end point reduction is an important question to be addressed in multicenter, prospective, randomized trials. Our paradigm stresses the fact that patients with renovascular hypertension require intensive blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk factor intervention, both before and after revascularization. Hence, management of such patients requires close attention and periodic review regarding restenosis and progression of vascular disease.", 
    "73": "Arterial hypertension in renal transplant patients plays a major role in the progression to chronic allograft failure, and in morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Its cause is diverse, with contributions not only from donor and/or recipient factors, but it also is influenced strongly by the type of immunosuppressive regimen. Despite increased awareness of the adverse effects of hypertension in both graft and patient survival, long-term studies have shown that arterial hypertension in the transplant population has not been controlled adequately. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements provide the advantage of a better assessment of the diurnal blood pressure variation, a predictor of target organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality events. Although the available data do not support the recommendation of any class of antihypertensive medication as preferred agents for blood pressure management in the transplant population, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers have shown beneficial effects beyond their antihypertensive effects. Clinical data in transplant recipients are emerging that suggest that applying interventions proven to be effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population may be effective for the transplant population.", 
    "74": "Although numerous prospective randomized trials since the Veterans Administration studies clearly have attested to the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive therapy, there remain some controversial issues with all classes of antihypertensive drugs. Thiazide diuretics increase the risk for new-onset diabetes and their long-term safety has been questioned. Alpha-blockers do not reduce morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated hypertension but are well known to cause a variety of poorly tolerated side effects. The safety of calcium antagonists has been questioned for many years, although recent large prospective randomized trials such as Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study, Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension, Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) have attested to their safety and efficacy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in general, are well tolerated but have potentially fatal adverse effects in a few patients. Angiotensin-receptor blockers are exceedingly well tolerated, but may be less-efficacious antihypertensive agents than other drug classes. Most antihypertensive drug classes have an effect on new-onset diabetes that should be taken into account in patients at risk. No head-to-head comparison of combination therapy looking at efficacy and safety has been available. The long-term safety of antihypertensive therapy is documented poorly because most trials only last 4 to 6 years. Despite these drawbacks and concerns, the benefits of antihypertensive therapy clearly outweigh its potential risk.", 
    "75": "The benefits of reducing blood pressure (BP) on the risks of major cardiovascular event and preservation of renal function are well established in patients with hypertension. We estimated effects of strategies based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) and calcium channel antagonist (CCB), which is predominantly prevalent in Japan in patients with hypertenstion than ACEI/ARB, on the risks of these events, overviewed with data from clinical trials and meta-analysis of these trials including underwent in Japan. ACEI and ARB-based regimens reduced the risks of heart failure and progression of renal dysfunction complicated with and without diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with hypertension compared with control and CCB-based regimens. CCB-based regimens reduced the primary risks of cerebella event and dementia and primary and secondary risks of coronary events in patients with hypertension having many coronary risk factors compared with control and ARB/ACEI-based regimens. Greater risk reductions, however, were produced by regimens that targeted lower (BP) goals, by combined regimens based on ACEI/ARB and CCB and diuretics, demonstrated in mega-trial of ALLHAT and proposed in guideline of JSH 2004.", 
    "76": "Angiotensin II is known to stimulate angiogenesis in the peripheral circulation through activation of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor. This study investigated the effect of angiotensin receptor blockade on cerebral cortical microvessel density. Rats (6-7 wk old, n = 5-17) were instrumented with femoral arterial and venous indwelling catheters for arterial blood pressure measurement and drug administration. Rats were treated for 3 or 14 days with the AT1 receptor blocker losartan (50 mg/day in drinking water) or vehicle. Brains were sectioned and immunostained for CD31, and microvessel density was measured. Treatment with losartan for 3 or 14 days resulted in a slight decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (3 days, 92 +/- 1 mmHg; and 14 days, 99 +/- 2 mmHg) compared with vehicle (109 +/- 3 and 125 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively). A furosemide + captopril 14-day treatment group was added to control for the blood pressure change (96 +/- 3 mmHg). Microvessel density increased in groups treated with losartan for 14 days (429 +/- 13 vessels/mm2) compared with vehicle (383 +/- 11 vessels/mm2) but did not change with furosemide + captopril (364 +/- 7 vessels/mm2). Thus AT1 receptor blockade for 14 days resulted in increased cerebral microvessel density in a blood pressure-independent manner.", 
    "77": "Heart failure consists of two phenotypes: systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure (DHF). A growing body of evidence demonstrated benefits of beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and angiotensin II receptor blocker in systolic heart failure; however, evidence leading to therapeutic strategy of DHF is lacking.", 
    "78": "The Japanese Diastolic Heart Failure Study (J-DHF) is a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial designed to assess effects of beta-blocker in patients with DHF. A total of 800 patients (400 patients in each group) will be enrolled. The primary outcome is a composite of cardiovascular death and unplanned admission to hospital for congestive heart failure. Other outcomes include all-cause mortality, worsening of the symptoms of heart failure, or a need for modification of the treatment for heart failure. Serial assessment of echocardiographic and neurohumoral parameters and cost analysis of the treatment regimen will be conducted. The follow-up period is a minimum of 2 years.",

Mean age was 60 years, mean NYHA class was 2.3, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 27.9%. Electrocardiograms were recorded and analyzed at the beginning of the study, at 2 weeks, 4 months, 1 year, and 2 years. The mean observation period for mortality was 25 months. Patients > or = 65 years and patients with an EF <20% had a significantly longer QRS D (P = .02; P = .0005). NYHA class, etiology of heart failure, therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, amiodarone or beta-blockers, implanted defibrillator, and atrial fibrillation had no significant influence on QRS D. Total mortality was 9%: 14 patients died suddenly, 7 from heart failure, 2 from noncardiac causes. Kaplan-Meier plots show significantly different survival rates for patients with QRS D <120 ms, QRS D 120-159 ms, or QRS D > or = 160 ms (P = .0085). Multivariate analysis showed that QRS D was the only independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (P = .008). NYHA class, EF, atrial fibrillation, age, and gender failed to qualify as independent prognostic factors.",

    "83": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. However, recent evidence suggests that it may also contribute to the development of diabetes itself. In the endocrine pancreas, all the components of an active renin-angiotensin system are present, which modulate a range of activities including local blood flow, hormone release and prostaglandin synthesis. In both types 1 and 2 diabetes, there is an up-regulation of its expression and activity in the endocrine pancreas. Whether these changes have a direct pathogenetic role or reflect a response to local stress or tissue injury remains to be established. Angiotensin-mediated increases in oxidative stress, inflammation and free fatty acids levels potentially contribute to beta-cell dysfunction in diabetes. In addition, activation of the renin-angiotensin system appears to potentiate the action of other pathogenic pathways including glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and advanced glycation. In experimental models of type 2 diabetes, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists results in the improvement of islet structure and function. Moreover, the incidence of de novo diabetes appears to be significantly reduced by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in clinical studies. At least two large controlled trials are currently underway to study the role of renin-angiotensin system in the development of diabetes. It is hoped that these studies will demonstrate the true potential of the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system for the prevention of diabetes.", 
    "84": "Hypertension contributes to the progression of renal disease by accelerating structural changes in the kidney, leading to a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate. Hypertension and microvascular changes can create a vicious circle, leading to further renal damage and increases in blood pressure. Prevention of renal damage is a priority, especially in the growing number of patients with diabetic hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blocking drugs and ACE inhibitors have been shown to display renoprotective effects, and ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of microalbuminuria, the initial step in renal disease in diabetes. Impressive results have been obtained with a low-dose combination of the ACE-inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide, which not only gave superior reductions in blood pressure to enalapril, but also a 24% greater reduction in albumin excretion. Perindopril/indapamide also showed a trend towards reducing cardiovascular events. There is evidence from animal studies that this combination protects both renal structure and function.", 
    "85": "Meta-analyses of clinical trials of antihypertensive medications which have measured regression of left ventricular hypertrophy reveal differences between classes of agent, with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium antagonists being more effective than beta-blockers. The PICXEL study showed that a strategy based on a low-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide was significantly more effective than the ACE inhibitor enalapril alone in reducing left ventricular mass. The cardioprotective effect of the combination appears to be independent of its blood pressure lowering effect. A pilot study in patients has shown that perindopril/indapamide improves coronary perfusion which is reduced in hypertension, especially in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. In a separate study perindopril/indapamide has shown a trend towards reducing cardiovascular events. Animal studies suggest that the combination reverses the changes in arteriolar and capillary densities associated with hypertension. Clinical and experimental studies of the cardioprotective actions of antihypertensive agents are providing a better understanding of how cardiovascular complications in hypertension can be reduced by careful choice of antihypertensive medication.", 
    "86": "Guidelines for the treatment of hypertension recommend reducing blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg. However, there is little to guide the clinician on which pharmacological strategy to pursue: monotherapy with stepped-care, sequential monotherapy, or the initial use of combination therapy. The STRATHE study was designed to clarify this issue by comparing the three strategies. A low-dose combination of perindopril/indapamide was significantly superior to either stepped-care or sequential monotherapy in terms of reducing systolic blood pressure and in the percentage of patients achieving normalisation without adverse effects. Pulse pressure showed a trend to greater reductions with the low-dose combination. Although there must be caution about extrapolating these results to other combinations, which may not have the same pharmacological properties, the STRATHE study has shown that initiating antihypertensive therapy with a low-dose combination has advantages over the two other classical therapeutic strategies.", 
    "87": "The present study investigates the effects of chronic administration of ACEIs (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; either zofenopril or enalapril) in combination with a diruetic (hydrochlorothiazide) on BP (blood pressure) increase and renal injury induced by L-NAME (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), an inhibitor of NO (nitric oxide) synthesis. Rats were untreated or received L-NAME alone, L-NAME+zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide or L-NAME+enalapril+hydrochlorothiazide for 8 weeks. L-NAME treatment resulted in marked elevation in BP and mortality. Treatment with either ACEI and diuretic prevented the increase in BP induced by L-NAME, reduced the death rate and improved excretory parameters. Renal injury in the L-NAME group was severe, but, in the groups treated with either ACEI and diuretic, glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions were not observed and the intensity, number and size of vessels affected was reduced. However, the efficacy of zofenopril+diuretic was superior to that of enalapril+diuretic in reducing vascular alterations. Oxidative stress indices and the expression of NO synthase and nitrotyrosine were normalized by the treatments. In conclusion, the combined treatment of zofenopril or enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide completely prevented the development of arterial hypertension induced by L-NAME. Renal morphological and functional alterations in the hypertensive animals were also almost completely normalized, but the treatment with zofenopril+diuretic produced a more complete organ protection. The protective effect is related to an activation of endothelial NO synthase expression and to a normalization of the oxidative stress parameters due to the inhibition of angiotensin II.",

V 1/2 of steady state inactivation of I(Na) shifted to hyperpolarization, and time constant (tau) of recovery from inactivation in HMI ventricular myocyte was longer than that of sham ventricular myocyte. I(Na) density in IMI group increased markedly as compared with that of HMI group.",

A novel approach in retention modelling in the liquid chromatographic separation of fosinopril sodium and its degradation product, fosinoprilat, applying a microemulsion as the mobile phase, was used. The modifications of the mobile phase included the changes to the type of the lipophilic phase, the type and concentration of co-surfactant and surfactant, as well as the pH of the mobile phase. In this study, a full factorial 2(3) design, as the optimal method for screening of the experiment, was applied for selecting factors which had an influence on separation. Optimisation was done by a central composite design. An appropriate resolution with reasonable retention times was obtained with a microemulsion containing 0.9% w/w of cyclohexane, 2.2% w/w of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 8.0% w/w of n-butanol and 88.9% of aqueous 25 mM disodium phosphate, the pH of which was adjusted to 2.8 with 85% orthophosphoric acid. Separations were performed on an X-Terra 50-mmx4.6-mm, 3.5-mum particle size column at 30 degrees C. UV detection was performed at 220 nm and with a flow rate of 0.3 mL min(-1). The established method was validated and applied for analysis of appropriate tablets. The proposed chromatographic procedure for the separation of fosinopril sodium and its degradation product is less expensive compared with the conventional reversed-phase HPLC method, as well as being simple and rapid. The optimised and validated method can be used for separation, identification and simultaneous determination of fosinopril sodium and fosinoprilat in bulk drug and in pharmaceutical dose forms.",

The kinetic parameters of the degradation reaction of quinapril hydrochloride in the presence of excipients were calculated. The degradation of quinapril hydrochloride with acidic excipients was significantly lower than that observed for the basic excipients (magnesium stearate) under the same study conditions. The degradation rate constant was approximately 100 fold greater than the decomposition in the quinapril hydrochloride alone.

    "102": "90% of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is found locally as tissue-bound ACE on vascular endothelial cells. Recently postulated classification of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) on plasma and tissue ACE-I based on stronger and prolonged inhibition of tissue ACE, connected with their higher penetration to tissues. Tissue ACE-I, through their high affinity to endothelium, considerably stronger prevents the local synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II) and by inhibition of kininase II causes the subsequent increase of bradykinin level and mediated by BK2 receptor release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacycline (PGI2) and tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Therefore the beneficial consequences of tissue ACE inhibition may improve endothelial dysfunction by prevention of the unfavorable structural and functional changes and modulation the coagulation and fibrinolysis system. In this review authors discuss the hypothesis that tissue ACE-Is more effectively influence haemostasis and prevent thrombosis in comparison to plasma ACE-I.",

    "111": "Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are major determinants of cardiovascular risk in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Microparticles are membrane fragments shed from damaged or activated cells. Because microparticles can affect endothelial cells, this study investigated the relationship between circulating microparticles and arterial dysfunction in patients with ESRF and identified the cellular origin of microparticles associated with these alterations. Flow cytometry analysis of platelet-free plasma from 44 patients with ESRF indicated that circulating levels of Annexin V+ microparticles were increased compared with 32 healthy subjects, as were levels of microparticles derived from endothelial cells (three-fold), platelets (16.5-fold), and erythrocytes (1.6-fold). However, when arterial function was evaluated noninvasively in patients with ESRF, only endothelial microparticle levels correlated highly with loss of flow-mediated dilation (r = -0.543; P = 0.004), increased aortic pulse wave velocity (r = 0.642, P < 0.0001), and increased common carotid artery augmentation index (r = 0.463, P = 0.0017), whereas platelet-derived, erythrocyte-derived, and Annexin V+ microparticle levels did not. In vitro, microparticles from patients with ESRF impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations and cyclic guanosine monophosphate generation, whereas microparticles from healthy subjects did not. Moreover, in vitro endothelial dysfunction correlated with endothelial-derived (r = 0.891; P = 0.003) but not platelet-derived microparticle concentrations. In fact, endothelial microparticles alone decreased endothelial nitric oxide release by 59 +/- 7% (P = 0.025). This study suggests that circulating microparticles of endothelial origin are tightly associated with endothelial dysfunction and arterial dysfunction in ESRF.",

In the case-control study, psoriasis was associated with benzodiazepines (OR 6.9), organic nitrates (OR 5.0), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (OR 4.0) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR 3.7). In the case-crossover study, psoriasis was associated with ACE inhibitors (OR 9.9), beta-blockers (OR 9.9), dipyrone (OR 4.9) and NSAIDs (OR 2.1). Extensive psoriasis may be associated with intake of ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs or beta-blockers.",

    "117": "Quinapril, the active ingredient in Accupril tablets, is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension. Quinapril is unstable in aqueous solution and therefore the development of a liquid formulation is a significant challenge. Previous studies show the rate of degradation of quinapril into its two major degradants to be pH dependent, indicating the parent compound to be most stable in the narrow pH range of 5.5-6.5. Accupril (20 mg) and readily available pharmaceutical components were combined to generate three formulations that are stable for at least 28 days, possess acceptable appearance, and are palatable to pediatric patients. To combat the presence of magnesium carbonate in the Accupril tablets, which increase the pH of the solution above 6.5, several pharmaceutically available buffers were incorporated. Nine prototypes were developed and their characteristics evaluated after 1 week under stressed conditions. The three that most closely matched the stability criteria were chosen for a definitive stability study. A stability-indicating method was developed and validated for these studies. All three formulations met the following specifications when stored at 5 degrees C for 6 weeks; Quinapril remained >or=90% intact and the two known degradants did not reach values >or=3.0% individually or >or=5.0% combined.",

The rats with glomerulosclerosis were randomly divided as ten per group into those without further treatment (group D) and those treated with Benazepril (group DB), Losartan (group DL), or sham-operation (group C), respectively. After 6 weeks of administration of Benazepril or Losartan, the mRNA expressions of TGF-beta1, Col IV, Fn, ET-1 and iNOS in renal cortex were measured by RT-PCR. Besides, the expressions of TGF-beta1, ET-1 and iNOS at protein level were detected by Western blotting and the concentrations of Col IV and Fn were analyzed with immunohistochemistry respectively. Results showed that the rats in group D appeared as obvious proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia, which had a significant difference compared with group C (p < 0.05), and most of their mesangiums were detected with cellular proliferation and significant increasing for extracellular matrix. Renal cortex TGF-beta1, Col IV, Fn, ET-1 and iNOS in rats of group D were increased by 3.59, 2.57, 2.21, 2.58 and 3.28 times at mRNA level, and by 2.60, 1.40, 0.75, 1.83 and 2.15 times at protein level, respectively, compared with group C. When the animals were treated with Benazepril (group DB) or Losartan (group DL), however, the biochemical and pathological damages were significantly recovered, and protein expressions of TGF-beta1, Col IV, Fn, ET-1 and iNOS were also significantly diminished (p < 0.05). This study suggested that blocking RAS using Benazepril or Losartan can have protective effects on the renal injury in glomerulosclerosis by down-regulating the expressions of TGF-beta1, Col IV, Fn, ET-1 and iNOS.", 
    "119": "Therapeutic activation of the vascular NO/cGMP pathway is induced by a variety of stimuli/mediators including physical activity, supplementation with the precursor L-arginine and organic nitrates which generate NO in the vasculature. The necessity of an enzymatic reduction for NO generation from these drugs as well as differences in the activity of the NO/cGMP pathway within the vascular tree determine the unique hemodynamic changes elicited by organic nitrates. These changes include preferential venodilation, vessel-size specific arterial dilation and improvement of the aortic distensibility and Windkessel-function. Some animal experiments and clinical investigations suggest that nitrates may also be endowed with cardioprotective and/or vasoprotective effects. \"Early entry\" therapy with nitrates do not significantly improve survival in myocardial infarction but increases the beneficial effects of the ACE-inhibitor enalapril by 50%. Furthermore, nitrates have been shown to improve survival in heart failure, but prognostic effects in stable angina pectoris are unknown. Short-term experimental and clinical investigations suggest that nitrate tolerance induced by nitroglycerin is associated with toxic effects in the vasculature, but this is not true for pentaerythrityl tetranitrate and isosorbide mononitrate. The observed endothelial dysfunction induced by a continuous treatment with nitroglycerin may be an additional risk for patients who receive continuous nitroglycerin to treat conditions such as unstable angina and acute heart failure. In general, nitrates are remarkably safe drugs and are well tolerated. Appropriate clinical trials are needed to answer the question whether nitrates can do more than symptomatic relief in cardiovascular disease.",

These reactions can be divided into Type A (hypersensitivity reactions, with the incidence of 4/100,000) and Type B (nonspecific reactions, incidence 3-5/100). Many different mechanisms have been postulated, including complement activation, pulmonary leukostasis, hypersensitivity to ethylene oxide, interaction between the AN69 membrane and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and dialysate contamination. An unusual case of dialyzer reactions is presented here, involving a patient who had to discontinue peritoneal dialysis when she was admitted with fungal peritonitis. Upon initiation of hemodialysis, she experienced dyspnea and burning sensation and demonstrated significant leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and oxygen desaturation. These reactions persisted despite double-rinsing of the dialyzers and the use of several different dialyzers with synthetic membranes (polysulfone and AN69), and a variety of sterilization methods (electron beam and gamma radiation). In the end, a simple measure was found to be effective in preventing further dialyzer reactions in this fascinating case.",

The underlying intraglomerular mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. As podocyte injury constitutes a critical step in the pathogenesis of glomerular proteinuria, beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB may partially result from interference with a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in podocytes. The knowledge of expression and function of a local RAS in podocytes is limited. In this study, we demonstrate functional expression of key components of the RAS in differentiated human podocytes: podocytes express mRNA for angiotensinogen, renin, ACE type 1, and the AT(1) and AT(2) angiotensin receptor subtypes. In Western blot experiments and immunostainings, expression of the AT(1) and AT(2) receptor was demonstrated both in differentiated human podocytes and in human kidney cortex. ANG II induced a concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration via AT(1) receptors in differentiated human podocytes, whereas it did not increase cAMP. Furthermore, ANG II secretion was detected, which was blocked by neither the ACEI captopril nor the renin inhibitor remikiren nor the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. ANG II secretion of podocytes was not increased by mechanical stress. Finally, ANG II was found to increase staurosporine-induced apoptosis in podocytes. We speculate that ACEI and ARB exert their beneficial effects, in part, by interfering with a local RAS in podocytes. Further experiments are required to identify the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of podocyte protection.",

Remission was defined as shift to normoalbuminuria and regression as a 50% reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) from one 2-year period to the next. Reduction of urinary AER was frequent, with a 6-year cumulative incidence of 51% (95% CI 42-60) for remission and 54% (45-63) for regression, whereas the frequency of progression to overt proteinuria was 28% (19-37). Microalbuminuria of short duration, the use of renin-angiotensin system-blocking drugs, and lower tertiles for HbA(1c) (<6.95%) and systolic blood pressure (<129 mmHg) were independently associated with remission or regression in the pooled logistic regression analysis.

    "158": "The phosphorylation of the short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the regulation of enzyme shedding. We determined whether the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE (ACEct) on Ser1270 regulates the cleavage/secretion of the enzyme by affecting its association with other proteins. ACE was associated with beta-actin and the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) in endothelial cells, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation experiments as well as an ACEct affinity column. The ACE-associated MYH9 immunoprecipitated from (32)P-labeled endothelial cells was basally phosphorylated and cell stimulation with ACE inhibitors, or with bradykinin, increased the phosphorylation of MYH9. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) but not protein kinase C phosphorylated MYH9 in vitro, CK2 coprecipitated with MYH9 from endothelial cells and the phosphorylation of MYH9 in intact cells paralleled the phosphorylation of ACE on Ser1270 by CK2. The CK2 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole attenuated the phosphorylation of ACE and MYH9, disrupted their association, and enhanced the cleavage/secretion of ACE from the plasma membrane. Cytochalasin D decreased the interaction between ACE and MYH9 and stimulated ACE shedding. Although MYH9 was still able to associate with residual amounts of a nonphosphorylatable S1270A ACE mutant, no ACE inhibitor-induced increase in MYH9 phosphorylation could be detected in S1270A-expressing cells. These data indicate that the interaction of ACE with MYH9 determines ACE shedding and is modulated by phosphorylation processes. Furthermore, because ACE inhibitors affect the phosphorylation of MYH9, the phosphorylation of this class II myosin might contribute to the phenomenon of ACE signaling in endothelial cells.",

Hemodynamic and morphological alterations suggested the development of hypertrophy of the right ventricle and chronic heart failure by the 8th week. By the end of the 8th week, alpha- and beta-sarcoglycans and dystrophin were decreased. Increases in mu- and m-calpains in the hypertrophied right ventricle were associated with an elevation of casein-proteolytic activity in the cytosolic fraction. Oral administration of 3 mg/kg/day trandolapril or 1 mg/kg/day candesartan from the 2nd to 8th week after the left coronary artery ligation attenuated decreases in alpha-sarcoglycan and dystrophin and reduced the increased proteolytic activity. The results suggest that attenuation of decreases in sarcoglycans and dystrophin is a possible mechanism underlying trandolapril- and candesartan-mediated improvement of structural and functional alterations of the right ventricle in the coronary artery-ligated rat.",

Prior to icv infusions, rats were sodium depleted with furosemide, followed by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, to block endogenous angiotensin formation. Both angiotensin analogs, at either of the two doses, were capable of eliciting fluid intakes of water and 0.3 M NaCl. Water and saline intakes were increased to a similar extent by 125 and 1250 pmol of [D-Asp1D-Arg2]AngII. [D-Arg1]AngIII produced a dose-dependent increase in water intake, whereas saline intake was equivalently increased by the 125 and 1250 pmol infusions. Pretreatment with EC33 or PC18 decreased water and saline intakes in response to [D-Asp1D-Arg2]AngII, while pretreatment with PC18 altered the time course of the [D-Arg1]AngIII-induced water and saline intakes. The ability of both inhibitors to decrease, but not completely block, AngII analog-induced intakes, coupled with the altered time course of the responses induced by the AngIII analog in the presence of PC18, supports the hypothesis that both AngII and AngIII are active ligands in brain angiotensin-mediated thirst and sodium appetite.

The most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data show an improvement in awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension compared with previous surveys. Nonetheless, fewer than one third of adults with hypertension are achieving blood pressure control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) states that most patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve goal blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease). Hypertension is common in patients with diabetes, and aggressive blood pressure control has been shown to reduce the risk of these complications. In a study conducted from 2002 to 2005, the medical charts of 9492 adults with hypertension and diabetes from physician practices across the United States were reviewed. Only 27.5% of this high risk study population achieved the blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg. Ninety-eight percent of patients were receiving antihypertensive therapy; 37.1% were using 1 agent, 34.4% were using 2, and 26.2% were using 3 or more agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were the most frequently used antihypertensive agents in this study population, but they were underutilized, being used by 55.4% and 32.3%, respectively.

In survival analyses, some studies are in favour for the ACE inhibitors, other studies report reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality by using calcium channel blockers. Beta blockers seem to be ideal antihypertensive agents, since sympathetic nerve activity is inappropriately increased in ESRD patients. Most studies indicate that hypertension control is still not adequate in the majority of chronic hemodialysis patients. Randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the most advantageous antihypertensive agent(s) to use in ESRD patients on chronic hemodialysis therapy.", 
    "199": "An elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE) below the proteinuric level, i.e. microalbuminuria (MAU), has long been recognized as a marker of kidney disease and increased cardiovascular risk in both types of diabetes mellitus. Subsequent clinical evidence documented an association between MAU and other cardiovascular risk factors, target organ damage and risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population and in specific clinical contexts including essential hypertension. This article reviews the available evidence on the clinical value of MAU in subjects with essential hypertension. In these subjects, the reported prevalence of MAU ranges from about 4% to 46% across different studies and these differences may be explained by the huge intraindividual variability in UAE, age and ethnicity, discrepancies in the technique of measurement and different definitions of MAU. A direct and continuous association between UAE and blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass has been found in most studies. In contrast, it is not yet clear whether the association between UAE and other factors including age, gender, smoking, ethnicity, insulin resistance, lipids and obesity is independent or due to confounders, particularly BP. Several prospective studies disclosed an association between MAU and the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Of particular note, in some of these studies the incidence of major cardiovascular events progressively increased with UAE starting below the conventional MAU thresholds. Thus, besides being a direct risk factor for progressive renal damage, MAU can be considered a marker which integrates and reflects the long-term level of activity of several other detrimental factors on cardiovascular system. Antihypertensive treatment reduces UAE and such effect may be detected after just a few days of treatment. Among available antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor antagonists seem to be superior to other antihypertensive drugs in reducing UAE. The dual blockade of the renin angiotensin system with an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a new and promising approach to control UAE in hypertensive patients. Determination of MAU is recommended in the initial work-up of subjects with essential hypertension as suggested in the most recent European hypertension guidelines, even though, as upcoming evidence suggest, the periodic evaluation of this simple, inexpensive and predictive marker might be valuable and cost-effective.",

    "203": "Aldosterone plays an important role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF), and spironolactone improves cardiovascular function and survival rates in patients with CHF. We hypothesized that the mineralocorticoid receptor blockade (MRB) exerted its beneficial effects by reducing oxidative stress and changing the balance between the counter-acting enzymes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2. Monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained from 10 patients with CHF before and after 1 month of treatment with spironolactone (25 mg/d). Spironolactone therapy significantly (P<0.005) reduced oxidative stress, as expressed by reduced lipid peroxide content, superoxide ion release, and low-density lipoprotein oxidation by 28%, 53%, and 70%, respectively. Although spironolactone significantly (P<0.01) reduced macrophage ACE activity by 47% and mRNA expression by 53%, ACE2 activity and mRNA expression increased by 300% and 654%, respectively. In mice treated for 2 weeks with eplerenone (200 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), cardiac ACE2 activity significantly (P<0.05) increased by 2-fold and was paralleled by increased ACE2 activity in macrophages. The mechanism of aldosterone antagonist action was studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) in vitro. Although ACE activity and mRNA were significantly increased by 250 nmol/L aldosterone, ACE2 was significantly reduced. Cotreatment with eplerenone (2 micromol/L) attenuated these effects. In MPM obtained from p47 knockout mice, where NADPH oxidase is inactive, as well as in control MPMs treated with NADPH oxidase inhibitor, aldosterone did not increase ACE or decrease ACE2. MRB reduced oxidative stress, decreased ACE activity, and increased ACE2 activity, suggesting a protective role for MRB by possibly increasing generation of angiotensin (1-7) and decreasing formation of angiotensin II. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by NADPH oxidase.", 
    "204": "The lack of large randomised controlled trials to guide therapy in diastolic heart failure causes some difficulties for evidence-based medicine practising clinicians. Traditionally, treatments for systolic heart failure have been highjacked for diastolic heart failure without much proof of benefit. However, recent studies have began to provide some evidence base for our practice. Betablockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists have recently been shown to reduce hospitalisation in large randomised controlled trials. Diuretic based antihypertensive regimes have been shown to reduce heart failure by 50%. Left ventricular hypertrophy regression is likely to be a good surrogate endpoint for diastolic heart failure, although definitive proof for this is not yet available. Angiotensin receptor antagonists, ACEI, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and aldosterone blockers have all been shown to cause left ventricular hypertrophy regression. We recommend these drugs to achieve strict blood pressure control together with dietary and lifestyle modification for the treatment of diastolic heart failure. We emphasise the importance of rate control, as diastolic heart-failure patients tolerate tachycardia poorly. We further argue that the pathophysiology of diastolic heart failure is part of systolic heart failure and the two should not be thought of as separate entities. Therefore, our traditional practice of using systolic heart failure treatments for diastolic heart failure is theoretically sound and should not cause us undue anxiety.",

The effect of glucose on cell proliferation was examined using the water-soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1 and [3H]-thymidine uptake.

In contrast, we found that both the ACEI and the ARB attenuated the increase in TGF-beta1 production and reduced cell proliferation caused by exposure to high glucose. These effects were greater with a combination of the two drugs.",

    "214": "Recently, the updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure were published. This review focuses on the pharmacological treatment. Basically, all patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be treated with diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated. It is important to uptitrate ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers to the high recommended doses that were used in the randomised clinical trials. If an ACE-inhibitor is not tolerated or contra-indicated, it is recommended to start an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Dose and choice of diuretics (loop acting or thiazides or combination) depends on volume status, renal function, and severity of heart failure. If patients remain symptomatic (NYHA class II), an ARB can be added, mainly to reduce worsening of heart failure and related hospitalisation. If patients remain severely symptomatic (NYHA class III), it is recommended to either add an aldosterone blocker, an ARB or both. The choice between an aldosterone blocker and an ARB depends on volume status, other specific patient characteristics, side effects, and personal preference. If all other therapies fail, one might consider nitrates, hydralazine and/or digoxin, while digoxin is always recommended in chronic heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, treatment of chronic heart failure is relatively simple. Although individual patient characteristics should always be taken into account, the current recommendations apply to all patients with chronic heart failure, irrespective its underlying cause.", 
    "215": "The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). This complex system includes the precursors of kinins known as kininogens and mainly tissue and plasma kallikreins. The pharmacologically active kinins, which are often considered as either proinflammatory or cardioprotective, are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. The interest of the various components of this multi-protein system is explained in part by the multiplicity of its pharmacological activities, mediated not only by kinins and their receptors, but also by their precursors and their activators and the metallopeptidases and the antiproteases that limit their activities. The regulation of this system by serpins and the wide distribution of the different constituents add to the complexity of this system, as well as its multiple relationships with other important metabolic pathways such as the renin-angiotensin, coagulation, or complement pathways. The purpose of this review is to summarize the main properties of this kallikrein-kinin system and to address the multiple pharmacological interventions that modulate the functions of this system, restraining its proinflammatory effects or potentiating its cardiovascular properties.", 
    "216": "We have produced a soy protein-derived angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysate and characterized its activity, physicochemical, and biochemical properties. The final yield of the hydrolysate was 8.47% (protein basis) with an IC50 value for ACE inhibitory activity of 0.048 mg of protein/mL. ACE inhibitory activity remained stable after a 2-hour incubation with gastric enzymes in vitro. These hydrolysates were shown to be competitive inhibitors as evaluated by the Lineweaver-Burk plots. These ACE inhibitory hydrolysates from soy proteins have potential as biofunctional food components, which have an economic advantage over single purified peptides for the treatment of hypertension and may be incorporated into foods with functional benefits.", 
    "217": "Most studies agree that post-nasal drip syndrome (PNDS), asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) are the commonest causes of chronic cough in the immunocompetent, non-smoking patient who is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. No diagnostic test has been found to define those who are said to have PNDS other than a response to a first-generation antihistamine. Examining the available evidence suggests that mechanical stimulation of the pharynx by mucus is not an adequate theory for the production of cough. Inflammatory mediators in the lower airways are raised in PNDS, cough variant asthma and GORD, and the theory that an inflammatory process is affecting 'one airway' is a plausible one. Nasal disease is more likely to result in cough from the co-existing involvement of the lower airways through an as yet undefined pathway, and eosinophil and mast cell mediation appear a likely mechanism.",

Treatment with both Irb and Per + Irb induced similar plasma renin elevation, but treatment with Per did not, suggesting escape. Plasma aldosterone was reduced only by treatment with Per + Irb (-36%, p < 0.02). Reduction in proteinuria during Per + Irb (-33%) was not significantly different from Per (-34%) or Irb (-22%). Urinary transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) excretion was significantly reduced with both Irb (-24%, p < 0.05) and Per + Irb (-36%, p < 0.05) but not with Per (-11%, p = 0.60).",

    "222": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which are used to treat common cardiovascular diseases, are associated with a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction known as angioedema (AE-ACEi). We have previously documented a significant association between AE-ACEi and low plasma aminopeptidase P (APP) activity. With eight large pedigrees, we hereby demonstrate that this quantitative trait is partially regulated by genetic factors. We tested APP activity using a variance-component QTL analysis of a 10-cM genomewide microsatellite scan enriched with seven markers over two candidate regions. We found significant linkage (LOD = 3.75) to a locus that includes the XPNPEP2 candidate gene encoding membrane-bound APP. Mutation screening of this QTL identified a large coding deletion segregating in one pedigree and an upstream single-nucleotide polymorphism (C-2399A SNP), which segregates in the remaining seven pedigrees. Measured genotype analysis strongly suggests that the linkage signal for APP activity at this locus is accounted for predominantly by the SNP association. In a separate case-control study (20 cases and 60 controls), we found significant association of this SNP to ACEi-induced AE (P=.0364). In conclusion, our findings provide supporting evidence that the C-2399A variant in XPNPEP2 is associated with reduced APP activity and a higher incidence of AE-ACEi.", 
    "223": "This study was undertaken to evaluate a dosing time-dependent effect of temocapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the mortality of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Temocapril (1 mg/kg/day) prolonged the survival rate of these animals, with a maximum effect after dosing at the early resting period and a minimum effect after dosing at the early active period. The pharmacokinetics of temocaprilat, an active metabolite of temocapril, did not differ significantly between the two dosing times. However, the inhibition of ACE activity in serum and organs (brain and aorta) and the reduction of blood pressure were significantly greater after dosing at the early resting period than at the early active period. These data suggest that the effect of temocapril on the mortality of SHRSP depends on the time of dosing, with a maximum effect seen after dosing at the early resting period. Dosing time-dependent differences in the pharmacodynamics of temocapril might be involved in explaining this phenomenon.",

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during kidney development produces chronic alterations in renal morphology and function that have been characterized in detail in adult animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the consequences of neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal haemodynamics and function in rats at a much earlier age, namely 3-4 weeks. 2. Male Wistar pups received daily intraperitoneal injections of enalapril (10 mg/kg) or isotonic saline from birth until 24-28 days of age, when renal haemodynamics and function were assessed using clearance techniques under pentobarbital anaesthesia. 3. Enalapril-treated rats showed significant reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR; -44 +/- 6%; P < 0.05), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF; -33 +/- 6%; P < 0.05) and filtration fraction (-16 +/- 3%; P < 0.05) compared with saline-treated controls. Although mean arterial pressure tended to be lower in enalapril-treated rats, this group demonstrated a significant increase in renal vascular resistance compared with control rats (RVR; 46 +/- 6 vs 32 +/- 3 mmHg/mL per.min per g.kidney weight, respectively; P < 0.05). In enalapril-treated rats, urine osmolality was reduced (-59 +/- 5%; P < 0.05) and urine flow rate and fractional urinary excretion rates of sodium and potassium were markedly elevated compared with controls (P < 0.05). Enalapril-treated rats showed severe renal histological abnormalities, including wall thickening of cortical arterioles, papillary atrophy and tubulointerstitial alterations, mimicking those described previously in similarly treated rats examined in adulthood. 4. In conclusion, neonatal ACE inhibition in rats induces pronounced alterations in renal haemodynamics and function, characterized by reductions in ERPF and GFR, increased RVR and impaired tubular sodium and water reabsorption, which are evident at weaning.", 
    "229": "Calcium antagonists comprise 2 main subclasses, dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridines, and have been studied extensively in hypertensive patients. Early meta-analyses suggested that short-acting calcium antagonists were associated with higher mortality rates resulting from cardiovascular events and other etiologies. Recent meta-analyses failed to show any substantive difference between long acting calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drug classes with regard to cardiovascular outcomes in those with low to moderate cardiovascular risk or kidney disease progression among those with stage 2 or 3 nonproteinuric kidney diseases. The data from calcium antagonist trials are consistent in that they decrease stroke incidence but fail to protect against new-onset heart failure. In people with proteinuric kidney disease, that is > 300 mg protein/gram creatinine, use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists to lower blood pressure without the use of agents that block the renin angiotensin aldosterone system does not provide optimal slowing of nephropathy progression. This relates directly to lack of antiproteinuric effects with this subclass and not seen with nondihydropyridine agents that reduce proteinuria to a greater degree than dihydropyridines. Thus, calcium antagonists are safe and as efficacious as other antihypertensive agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. They should be avoided in people with systolic dysfunction but may be used for blood pressure lowering in people with preserved systolic function. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should only be used in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in proteinuric kidney disease because they will not optimally slow kidney function loss in their absence.",

However, only a minority of patients with CHF have impaired renal function or underlying hematinic deficiencies.

These 10 anemic patients were matched with 10 nonanemic patients in terms of age and left ventricular ejection fraction. Serum ACE activity was 73% lower in anemic CHF patients compared with nonanemic CHF patients (P=0.018). Moreover, serum of these patients inhibited in vitro the proliferation of bone marrow-derived erythropoietic progenitor cells of healthy donors by 17% (P=0.003). Levels of the hematopoiesis inhibitor N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), which is almost exclusively degraded by ACE, were significantly higher in anemic CHF patients and were clearly correlated to erythroid progenitor cell proliferation (r=-0.64, P=0.001).",

The key role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in this process has been documented and the enzyme has been involved in the oxidative modification of apolipoprotein B-100 in the intima and at the surface of endothelial cells. As the inhibition of this last phenomenon could be of relevance in pharmacological interventions, thiol-containing molecules such as glutathione, captopril, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and its lysinate salt (NAL) were tested in this system and their properties were compared with those of flufenamic acid (control). This last compound already demonstrated an inhibition of the production of HOCl by MPO and a more intense inhibition of MPO activity than glutathione, NAC, NAL, and captopril. However, NAC and NAL inhibited the oxidative modification of LDL more intensively than captopril and glutathione whereas flufenamic acid had no comparable inhibiting effect. This could be related to the presence of LDL close to the catalytic site of the enzyme. NAC and NAL therefore appeared as the most efficient inhibitors probably as a consequence of their relatively small size. The relevance of such effects has to be documented by in vivo studies.",

Pharmacologic therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, and perhaps aldosterone and calcium channel blockers may have a role in the prevention of atrial fibrillation onset and recurrence.

The 7-day ACEi treatment up-regulated both kinin receptor mRNAs in the oropharynx and the B1 receptor mRNA in the lingual vascular endothelium (immunohistochemistry). The inhibition of ACE in plasma is responsible for an accumulation of bradykinin and des-arginine9-bradykinin generated during activation of the contact system with glass beads. The expression of critical components of the kallikrein-kinin system in the oropharyngeal tissues supports the role of kinins in ACEi-induced AE.", 
    "269": "Extracellular matrix expansion in the glomerular mesangium contributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis and chronic renal disease in arterial hypertension. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are involved in this process. Conflicting data are reported on the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on MMPs and TIMPs in early stages of hypertensive glomerular damage. We therefore investigated the effects of Ang II-dependent hypertension on MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in isolated glomeruli of 8-week-old homozygous male rats overexpressing the mouse Ren2 gene [TGR(mRen2)27]. At this age, systolic blood pressure was already significantly elevated in Ren2 compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (197 +/- 38 versus 125 +/- 16 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Ren2 exhibited renal damage as determined by increased urinary albumin excretion, focal glomerulosclerosis, mesangial matrix expansion, and alpha-smooth muscle actin deposition. Quantification of mRNA levels in isolated glomeruli by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a significant increase of TGF-beta1, a 2.3- and a 2.6-fold increase of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in Ren2 compared with SD (p < 0.01, respectively) and no strain differences for TIMP-2. In contrast, MMP-9 mRNA expression was markedly suppressed to 10% of control levels in Ren2 (p < 0.01). Early treatment with ramipril completely prevented renal damage in Ren2 and restored mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 to SD control levels. Interestingly, down-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA, protein, and activity was not affected by ramipril, indicating that the protective effect of this compound is not attributable to restoration of MMP-9 in the glomerulus.", 
    "270": "As the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide, diabetes-related macrovascular morbidity and mortality are becoming major health care problems. Epidemiologic evidence suggests this relationship begins early in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to frank diabetes. This report reviews this epidemiologic evidence linking early stages of glucose dysregulation with cardiovascular disease and discusses the results of major clinical trials demonstrating that lifestyle or pharmacologic intervention can reduce the incidence of diabetes in high-risk individuals. These observations indicate that early identification and aggressive treatment of subjects with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance have the potential to reduce both the incidence of diabetes and its related cardiovascular disease. Three clinical trials are being conducted to test whether early pharmacotherapy can reduce or delay the incidence of diabetes, and their results may well begin to shift the treatment paradigm toward earlier intervention.",

The impact of gender on the diabetic hyperfiltration state has not previously been studied. Since hyperfiltration is a factor in the development of diabetic renal disease, and is influenced by hyperglycemia and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, we examined gender differences in the renal response to hyperglycemia and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in young males and females with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes mellitus.",

    "273": "During clamped euglycemia, males exhibited significantly higher effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and renal blood flow (RBF) and a lower renal vascular resistance (RVR). During clamped hyperglycemia, females exhibited reductions in ERPF and RBF, and increased RVR and filtration fraction (FF). Males exhibited no significant renal hemodynamic changes during hyperglycemia. After ACE inhibition treatment, both genders exhibited significant declines in arterial pressure, but only females displayed a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and FF.", 
    "274": "The renal responses to hyperglycemia and ACE inhibition appear to differ between male and female adolescents with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hyperglycemia-induced changes in RVR and FF in women may account, at least in part, for the loss of gender-based protection in diabetic renal disease.",

A 51-year old physically fit woman experienced angio-oedema and hypotensive shock after irbesartan ingestion requiring noradrenaline infusion. Serum tryptase rose to three times the normal value. Total immunoglobulin E and skin prick tests were normal, however. As nonallergic increases in tryptase have been observed, e.g. during angio-oedema from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and bradykinin itself can degranulate mast cells acutely, we interpret the reaction as a class effect. To our knowledge, our report is one of the first on shock and angio-oedema from irbesartan.", 
    "276": "Angiotensin II, the major effector molecule produced from the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, is a vasoconstrictor contributing to hypertension. Evidence indicates, however, that angiotensin II also is a potent proinflammatory mediator with growth and remodeling effects. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that angiotensin II blockade significantly reduces concentrations of proinflammatory mediators and oxidative stress products in numerous inflammatory models. Interruption of angiotensin II activity with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers has been beneficial for patients with inflammatory diseases. Much of this benefit occurs independent of the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II interruption, suggesting a distinctive protective mechanism. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may represent a novel class of antiinflammatory drugs with indications far beyond cardiovascular diseases.",

Treatment of intermittent claudication depends of the arterial lesions. If an endovascular procedure is feasible and safe, iliac stenosis or short iliac occlusion, it permits a spectacular improvement. Most often only medical treatment with physical training is advisable. Surgical revascularisation is rarely justified in patients with intermittent claudication.", 
    "278": "The coupling of the techniques, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometry (OATOF-MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) provides a very powerful method for identifying and quantifying the products of bradykinin metabolism. In this study, we were able to identify the major metabolites of bradykinin degradation reported in the literature. In addition, a new bradykinin metabolite corresponding to bradykinin 5,9 fragment (BK-(5,9)-fragment) was identified as a product of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity. This finding establishes that NEP cleaves bradykinin simultaneously at the positions 4-5 and 7-8. We also demonstrate the equivalent participation of NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) within the rat lung tissue membranes (RLTM) in bradykinin degradation, suggesting its suitability as a model for the assay of dual ACE/NEP inhibitors. On the contrary, in rat kidney brush border membranes (KBBM), ACE is not significantly involved in bradykinin metabolism, with NEP being the major enzyme.",

We determined the mRNA for elastase-2 and its relative role in generating Ang II in the rat isolated aorta and carotid artery rings. In carotid rings, the Ang I-induced vasoconstrictor effect was only partially inhibited by captopril or chymostatin, whereas that of tetradecapeptide renin substrate (TDP) was greatly inhibited by chymostatin but unaffected by captopril; however, Ang I- and TDP-induced effects were abolished by the combination of both inhibitors. Effects of [Pro11-D-Ala12]-Ang I (PDA), an Ang I-converting enzyme (ACE)-resistant biologically inactive precursor of Ang II were blocked by chymostatin or N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-chloromethylketone (elastase-2 inhibitor) in carotid artery. PDA failed to induce an effect in aortic rings, and Ang I-induced contractions were completely inhibited by captopril. The mRNA for rat elastase-2 was detected in aorta, carotid, and mesenteric arteries, although its expression was found to be less important in aorta. These findings indicate the presence of a functional alternative pathway to ACE for Ang II generation in rat carotid artery and represent strong evidence of a physiological role for elastase-2; however, its functional contribution to Ang II formation in aorta appears to be negligible.",

Observational studies and intervention trials have established that even low levels of albuminuria (microalbuminuria) are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in general, and especially in high-risk populations such as those with diabetes mellitus. People with hypertension are at increased risk for proteinuria and arguably should be treated with regimens that not only lower blood pressure but also reduce proteinuria. Clinical trials indicate that lowering proteinuria in those with chronic kidney disease is associated with reduced risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes. Many of these trials employ antihypertensive agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and indicate that these drugs are, in general, more effective than other antihypertensive regimens for reducing proteinuria. In addition, several small studies suggest that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are comparable with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and more effective than dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for reducing proteinuria in type 2 diabetics with advanced kidney disease.

Both the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and the Reduction in Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study were large, randomized, prospective studies in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria. There was no reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke with the ARBs compared to placebo in either trial. A broader overview of clinical trials comparing ACEIs and ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs fails to show any substantive blood pressure-independent effects on stroke or myocardial infarction with these classes of drugs. Therefore, for cardiovascular end points (as opposed to renal end points), it may be more important that the blood pressure is reduced, rather than how the process is started.", 
    "327": "Current national guidelines recommend aggressive lowering of blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this paper, we summarize recent clinical trial data evaluating the effect of lower blood pressure goals on renal outcomes. The epidemiologic data relating blood pressure to progression of kidney disease, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study (in patients with > 1 g proteinuria/d), and meta-analyses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor clinical trials all support lower blood pressure goals in CKD patients, particularly those with proteinuria. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) supports lower blood pressure goals in terms of reduction of proteinuria, but demonstrates no additional benefit for clinical renal outcomes. Similarly, the second Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study (REIN-2) shows that in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic renal disease who are receiving ACE inhibitors, a lower than usual blood pressure goal does not improve renal outcomes. However, there are limited clinical trial data evaluating the effects of low blood pressure on the increased cardiovascular risk seen in patients with CKD. Pending further clinical studies, current recommendations to target tight blood pressure control (< 130/80 mm Hg) in patients with CKD appear reasonable.", 
    "328": "The association between obesity and cardiovascular disease is well established, and up to 60% of overweight or obese patients have hypertension. Dietary interventions associated with modest weight loss are effective in controlling blood pressure and in reducing use of antihypertensive drug therapy in overweight and obese patients. However, long-term maintenance of weight loss is achieved only in a small proportion of patients. Orlistat and sibutramine may help to achieve and maintain weight loss but may not be sufficient to control blood pressure in overweight and obese hypertensive patients. Consequently, antihypertensive drug therapy is often necessary in addition to weight loss interventions. Few studies have investigated different antihypertensive drugs, specifically in overweight and obese patients with hypertension. Based on studies involving obese and nonobese patients, first-line treatment options include a diuretic alone or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor alone. If monotherapy is inadequate for blood pressure control, combination therapy with diuretic and ACE inhibitor and/or combining either of these drugs with a calcium channel blocker are reasonable treatment options. Additional studies to further clarify the management of these patients are warranted.", 
    "329": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major public health problem in the aged. In order to better evaluate this problem in Brazil, this study was designed to assess the prevalence of ADRs in an elderly hospitalised population, identify the most common ADRs and the principal medications involved, evaluate the appropriateness of use of these drugs in elderly people and determine the risk factors implicated in the appearance of such ADRs.", 
    "330": "The study population was comprised of 186 elderly patients (> or =60 years of age) admitted to the internal medicine service of a teaching hospital. The patients were assessed by a single observer using an intensive drug surveillance method to identify and report ADRs. The degree of probability for each adverse reaction was determined using the Naranjo algorithm.", 
    "331": "The mean (+/- SD) age of the patients studied was 73.6 +/- 9.1 years. Up to 115 patients (61.8%) of the study population presented at least one ADR. A total of 199 ADRs were found, at an average of 1.7 per patient. The ADRs appeared during hospitalisation in 46.2% of the study population, were present at the time of the admission but did not cause hospitalisation in 17.2% of patients, and were the cause of admission in 11.3% of patients. The most frequent ADR that caused hospitalisation was digitalis toxicity (22.7% of such ADRs). Hypokalaemia as a result of diuretics was the most prevalent ADR both during hospitalisation (11.8%) and at the time of admission without being the cause (12.1%). Captopril was the most frequently prescribed drug (138 prescriptions), and led to an ADR in 18.1% of patients who received the drug. Almost a quarter of the patients presenting an ADR were prescribed drugs considered inappropriate for the elderly. By means of a multiple logistic regression model, the following were considered to be significant risk factors for the appearance of ADRs: number of diagnoses (odds ratio [OR] 1.40; 95% CI 1.06, 1.86), number of drugs (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01, 1.13) and use of drug that is inappropriate for the elderly (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.17, 4.59).", 
    "332": "The main contribution of the present study was identification of use of drugs that are considered inappropriate for elderly populations as a major risk factor for presenting an ADR. This finding is useful for continuous education programmes, therapeutic committees and policy makers, because adverse effects complicate the course of diseases in aged patients, cause hospitalisation and/or require the prescription of additional drugs. In addition to contributing to a reduction in healthcare costs, continuous efforts to promote rational drug use could also benefit elderly patients by preventing some avoidable drug toxicity.", 
    "333": "A significant prevalence of ADRs was found among hospitalised elderly people. The risk factors associated with ADRs in this population included use of drugs considered to be inappropriate for that population, number of previous diagnoses and number of administered drugs. More appropriate drug prescription could avoid part of this burden of disease by minimising preventable ADRs.", 
    "334": "The aim of this study was to investigate age-related changes in the density of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing nerve fibers in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the effects of long-term inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on these changes. The density of immunocytochemically stained nerve fibers in the mesenteric artery was quantified by computer-assisted image processing. An age-related decrease in the density of CGRP-like immunoreactive (LI)-containing nerve fivers but not neuropeptide Y (NPY)-LI-containing sympathetic nerve fibers was found in the mesenteric artery of SHR but not Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The density of NPY-LI-containing sympathetic nerve fibers was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. SHR were treated for 7 weeks with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (0.005% temocapril), angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (0.025% losartan) or vasodilator (0.01% hydralazine) in their drinking water. Each drug treatment significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure measured by tail-cuff method. Long-term treatment of SHR with temocapril and losartan significantly increased the density of CGRP-LI-containing nerve fibers in mesenteric arteries. However, the density after hydralazine treatment was similar to the level in non-treated SHR. The density of NPY-LI-containing nerve fibers was not increased by any of the drug treatments. These results suggest that long-term inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in SHR prevents remodeling of CGRPergic nerve fibers and prevents the reduction of CGRPergic nerve function.", 
    "335": "Vascular smooth muscle cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) express angiotensin II-forming chymase (rat vascular chymase [RVCH]), which may contribute to blood pressure regulation. In this study, we studied whether chymase-dependent angiotensin II formation contributes to the regulation of blood pressure in SHR. The systolic blood pressure in 16-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was 113 +/- 9 mmHg, compared to 172 +/- 3 mmHg in SHR. Using synthetic substrates for measuring angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase activities, it was found that both ACE and chymase activities in extracts from SHR aortas were significantly higher than in those from WKY rat aortas. Using angiotensin I as a substrate, angiotensin II formation in SHR was found to be significantly higher than that in WKY rats, and its formation was completely suppressed by an ACE inhibitor, but not by a chymase inhibitor. RVCH mRNA expression could not be detected in aorta extracts from either WKY rats or SHR. In carotid arteries isolated from WKY rats and SHR, angiotensin I-induced vasoconstriction was completely suppressed by an ACE inhibitor, but not by a chymase inhibitor. Angiotensin I-induced pressor responses in both WKY rats and SHR were also completely inhibited by an ACE inhibitor, but they were not affected by a chymase inhibitor. In SHR, an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker showed equipotent hypotensive effects, but a chymase inhibitor did not have a hypotensive effect. These results indicated that chymase-dependent angiotensin II did not regulate blood pressure in SHR in the present study.", 
    "336": "We examined the relationship between structural changes of the aorta and pulse wave velocity (PWV), and the effects of antihypertensive treatments on PWV in N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated rats. Twelve-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into the following groups, all of which received drug treatment in their drinking water: an untreated control group (n = 36), an L-NAME-treated group (0.7 mg/ml) (n = 32), an L-NAME and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI)-treated group (imidapril: 0.4 mg/ml) (n = 8), and an L-NAME and hydralazine-treated group (0.2 mg/ml) (n = 10). PWV was measured at the same blood pressure (BP) level as in the control group and the wall-to-lumen ratio of the thoracic aorta was evaluated in all groups. In the L-NAME group, PWV increased compared with the value in the control group, at the same time that BP was increasing. After the third day of treatment, PWV was higher in the L-NAME group than in the control group after adjusting BP to the control level, while the wall-to-lumen ratios were equal between the two groups. After the first week of treatment, not only the adjusted PWV, but also the wall-to-lumen ratios were greater in the L-NAME group than in the control group. With administration of antihypertensive agents, both PWV and the thickening of the aortic wall were reduced, but there was no significant difference between the ACEI and hydralazine-treated groups. In conclusion, in a rat model of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibition, the increase in PWV preceded the vascular structural changes, while antihypertensive treatment reduced both changes. There was no significant difference between treatments with ACEI and hydralazine in this model.", 
    "337": "In a meta-analysis published in June 2003, we reported that new and old classes of antihypertensive drugs had similar long-term efficacy and safety. Furthermore, we observed that in clinical trials in hypertensive or high-risk patients gradients in systolic blood pressure (SBP) accounted for most differences in outcome. To test whether our previous conclusions would hold, we updated our quantitative overview with new information from clinical trials published before 2005. To compare new and old antihypertensive drugs, we computed pooled odds ratios from stratified 2 x 2 contingency tables. In a meta-regression analysis, we correlated these odds ratios with corresponding between-group differences in SBP. We then contrasted observed odds ratios with those predicted from gradients in SBP. The main finding of our overview was that reduction in SBP largely explained cardiovascular outcomes in the recently published actively controlled trials in hypertensive patients and in placebo-controlled secondary prevention trials. The published results suggested that dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers might offer a selective benefit in the prevention of stroke and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in the prevention of heart failure. For prevention of myocardial infarction, the published results were more equivocal, because of the benefit of amlodipine over placebo or valsartan in 2 trials, whereas other placebo-controlled trials of calcium-channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors did not substantiate the expected benefit with regard to cardiac outcomes. In conclusion, the hypothesis that new antihypertensive drugs might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effect remains unproven. Our overview emphasizes the need of tight blood pressure control, but does not allow determining to what extent blood pressure must be lowered for optimal cardiovascular prevention.", 
    "338": "This study sought to assess the effects of Quercetin and Enalapril on urinary protein excretion and amount of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and vascular endothelial growth factor-1 (VEGF-1) in renal tissue of diabetic rats. 29 streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into 3 groups, diabetic control group (group D, n=12); Enalapril group (group E, n=10); Quercetin group (group Q, n=7). In addition, there was one normal control group (group N, n = 5). The urinary protein excretion of 24 hours was measured at 4, 8, 12 weeks. All rats were sacrificed at 12 weeks. The amounts of PDGF-B and VEGF-1 in renal tissue were measured by immunohistochemical techniques. The 24-h levels of urinary protein excretion of D,Q and E groups were higher than that of N group; the level of Q, E groups were lower than that of D group; there was no difference between Q and E group. The expression levels of PDGF-B and VEGF-1 in renal tissue of D, Q, and E groups were significantly higher than that of N group the levels of Q and E groups were significantly lower than that of D group, no difference was found between Q and E group. The protective role of Quercetin and Enalapril in lowering urinary protein excretion may be related to the decreased amounts of PDGF-B and VEGF-1 in renal tissue.", 
    "339": "Human genetic data have associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with Alzheimer disease (AD), and purified ACE has been reported to cleave synthetic amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in vitro. Whether deficiency in ACE activity, arising from genetic alteration or pharmacological inhibition, can decrease Abeta degradation and allow Abeta accumulation in intact cells is unknown. We cloned ACE from human neuroblastoma cells and showed that it had posttranslational processing and enzymatic activity typical of the endogenous protease. Cellular expression of ACE promoted degradation of naturally secreted Abeta40 and Abeta42, leading to significant clearance of both species. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that both active sites within ACE contribute to Abeta clearance, and an ACE construct bearing mutations in each catalytic domain had no effect on Abeta levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ACE with a widely prescribed drug, captopril, promoted the accumulation of cell-derived Abeta in the media of beta-amyloid precursor-protein expressing cells. Together, these results show that ACE can lower the levels of secreted Abeta in living cells and that this effect is blocked by inhibiting the protease's activity with an ACE inhibitor. This work, combined with the genetic studies, supports the hypothesis that ACE may modulate the susceptibility to and progression of AD via degradation of Abeta. Our data encourage further analyses of the ACE gene for disease association and raise the question of whether currently prescribed ACE inhibitors could elevate cerebral Abeta levels in humans.", 
    "340": "Atrial fibrillation (Af) is the most common disorder of cardiac rhythm and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in the general population. A recent community-based observational study revealed that diabetes and hypertension were associated with the development of Af. Since there is no definite evidence to show that type 1 diabetes is at increased risk for the development of Af, insulin resistance rather than hyperglycemia per se could explain the link between diabetes and Af. Several clinical trials suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Indeed, interruption of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients. Further, several experimental and clinical studies showed the beneficial role for the inhibition of the RAS in preventing Af as well. However, to what extent the insulin-sensitizing effects of ARBs could account for the prevention of Af remains to be clarified. Recently, telmisartan, an ARB, was found to act as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). PPAR-gamma influences the gene expression involved in carbohydrate metabolism. In animal study, telmisartan administration caused a significant attenuation of weight gain and reduced glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, compared with treatments of losartan, another type of ARB. Furthermore, recently, some clinical papers also reported the insulin-sensitizing effects of telmisartan in hypertensive patients. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of clarifying to what extent the insulin-sensitizing effects of ARBs could account for the prevention of Af. (1) Does telmisartan reduce the development of Af in insulin resistant hypertensive patients? (2) When adjusted for blood pressure, is the effect of telmisartan superior to other ARBs? (3) Does this beneficial effect of telmisartan correlate to its insulin-sensitizing properties? Ongoing clinical trial (ONTARGET) has been designed the efficacy of telmisartan with an ACEI, ramipril, alone or in combination. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter international studies will provide further information whether telmisartan can improve insulin resistance and subsequently reduce the development of Af in high-risk hypertensive patients.",

Combined inhibition of NHE-1 and ACE, but not the monotherapies, significantly reduced LVDed (1.02+/-0.02 cm). 5 Preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW), dp/dt(max) (parameter of systolic function) and end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR, diastolic function) were significantly impaired in placebo-treated MI group (PRSW: 39+/-7 mmHg; dp/dt(max): 5185+/-363 mmHg s(-1); EDPVR: 0.042+/-0.001 mmHg microl(-1); all P<0.05). Cariporide treatment significantly improved PRSW (64+/-7 mmHg), dp/dt(max) (8077+/-525 mmHg s(-1)) and EDPVR (0.026+/-0.014 mmHg microl(-1)), and reduced cardiac hypertrophy in rats with MI. Combined inhibition of NHE-1 and ACE had even a more pronounced effect on PRSW (72+/-5 mmHg) and EDPVR (0.026+/-0.014 mmHg microl(-1)), as well as cardiac hypertrophy that, however, did not reach statistical significance compared to cariporide treatment alone. 6 The NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide significantly improved LV remodeling and function in rats with congestive heart failure induced by MI. The effect of cariporide was comparable or tended to be stronger (e.g. systolic function) compared to ramipril. Combined treatment with cariporide and ramipril tended to be more effective on LV remodeling in rats with heart failure than the single treatments. Thus, inhibition of the NHE-1 may be a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of congestive heart failure.",

Expression of glomerular nephrin decreased while expression of TGFbeta1 and matrix components increased in ZO rats. Captopril treatment prevented increase in intrarenal ANG II, and reversed expression of nephrin, TGFbeta1, collagen and fibronectin. We conclude that in this model of type 2 diabetic nephropathy, chronically elevated intrarenal ANG II causes proteinuria via decrease in nephrin and glomerulosclerosis via TGFbeta1 mediated increase in matrix component.",

The suspicion of drug induction was confirmed in a laboratory study in which a pemphigus-like effect was induced by glibenclamide in cultured human skin explants. Withdrawal of the drugs and their replacement by hydrochlorothiazide and metformin resulted in subsidence of the lesions and no appearance of new lesions. The laboratory study carried out to verify the suspicion of drug induced pemphigus and to confirm the diagnosis proved useful in the differential diagnosis in this case.",

    "371": "The substudy comprised 192 participants who had a cerebral MRI both at baseline and after a mean follow-up time of 36 months (SD=6.0 months). At the first MRI, WMHs were graded with a visual rating scale from A (no WMH) to D (severe WMH). Participants were assigned to a combination of perindopril plus indapamide (or their placebos; 58%) or to single therapy with perindopril (or placebo). At the time of the second MRI, the blood pressure reduction in the active arm compared with the placebo arm was 11.2 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 4.3 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. Twenty-four subjects (12.5%) developed new WMHs at follow-up. The risk of new WMH was reduced by 43% (95% CI -7% to 89%) in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group (P=0.17). The mean total volume of new WMHs was significantly reduced in the active treatment group (0.4 mm3 [SE=0.8]) compared with the placebo group (2.0 mm3 [SE=0.7]; P=0.012). This difference was greatest for patients with severe WMH at entry, 0.0 mm3 (SE=0) in the active treatment group versus 7.6 mm3 (SE=1.0) in the placebo group (P<0.0001).",

    "373": "We describe N-[(2S)-2-(mercaptomethyl)-3-methylbutanoyl]-4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-L-phenylalanine (GW796406), a vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) that possessed approximately 3-fold selectivity for neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) versus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in in vitro assays using rat and human enzymes. In the same assays, omapatrilat, the most extensively studied VPI, displayed approximately 3-fold selectivity for ACE. The in vivo ACE and NEP inhibition profile and the liability of the compounds to increase plasma extravasation were compared at two (low and high) therapeutically equivalent intravenous doses in the rat. At the low dose, both agents inhibited ACE activity by approximately 85%. Consistent with their in vitro ACE/NEP selectivity, omapatrilat produced 49% inhibition, whereas GW796406 produced >95% inhibition of NEP. Neither compound increased plasma extravasation. When the low dose was administered to rats pretreated with the NEP inhibitor ecadotril to normalize NEP background to <5% of control, only omapatrilat significantly increased plasma extravasation. At the high dose, omapatrilat and GW796406 produced profound, nonselective inhibition of ACE (>90%) and NEP (>95%), and they significantly increased plasma extravasation. The activity of the agents as inhibitors of dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) and aminopeptidase P (APP) was also investigated. Neither compound inhibited DPP IV. Interestingly, omapatrilat, but not GW796406, was a relatively potent inhibitor of APP (IC50 = 260 nM). We investigated whether APP inhibition increased the plasma extravasation liability of GW796406. The low dose of GW796406 administered with apstatin, an APP inhibitor, did not increase plasma extravasation. This finding inferred that APP inhibition is not involved in plasma extravasation in the rat and that APP inhibition does not explain the increased plasma extravasation produced by omapatrilat in NEP-inhibited rats.", 
    "374": "Angiotensin II plays a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of proteinuric nephropathies and related cardiovascular complications. Losartan is a selective non-peptide angiotensin Type 1-receptor blocker (ARB) with unique uricosuric effect, not shared by other ARBs. Losartan has demonstrated renoprotective effects in animals and humans with diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases similar to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with a lower incidence of dry cough and angioneurotic oedema. A reduced incidence of cerebrovascular events and diabetes has been reported in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy on losartan therapy compared with patients treated with atenolol. Whether ARBs have superior cardioprotective effects, compared with other blood pressure medications, is still unknown. Combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARB therapy improves renal outcomes in non-diabetic nephropathies more than single drug renin-angiotensin system inhibition. Whether this also applies to diabetic nephropathy and related cardiovascular outcomes is still unknown.",

    "376": "Chronic heart failure is a clinical syndrome associated with an ominous long-term prognosis and major economic consequences for Western societies. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the pharmacological management of heart failure, and several treatments have been confirmed to confer survival and symptomatic benefits. However, pharmaceuticals remain underutilised, and the combination of several different drugs present challenges for their optimal prescription, requiring a thorough knowledge of potential side effects and complex interactions. This article reviews in detail the evidence pertaining to the out-patient pharmacological management of chronic heart failure, and offers recommendations on the use of various drugs in complex clinical conditions, or in areas of ongoing controversy.", 
    "377": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been used in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Despite the therapeutic benefits of ACEIs, there are several reported side effects, including chronic cough, angioedema and anaphylactoid reactions. These adverse events cannot be explained by the vasodilatory effects of this group of medications. Preliminary studies have shown that patients with a history of developing these side effects have a lower activity of an enzyme called aminopeptidase-P. This enzyme has an important role in degrading bradykinin. This defect in enzymatic activity can be partially explained by genetic variation. Using genome-wide screening strategies, the locus (loci), gene(s) and untimely polymorphisms that explain the low enzymatic activity and side effects can be identified.",

Correspondence analysis is performed on the array produced by fuzzy coding. Projections of mean paths on factorial mappings, according to subgroup characteristics, highlight the behaviour of the underlying process. This approach is illustrated with an application to a randomized controlled clinical trial designed for comparing non-diabetic chronic renal failure treatments. Our methodology has resulted in the identification of a difference between the treatments with an interpretation of the effects in subgroups of patients not obtainable with traditional survival methodology; it also provides some valuable insights for designing further studies on treatment of renal impairment.",

The 2 strategies were blindly compared with regard to the combined primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and with regard to each of these end point components individually. Bisoprolol-first treatment was noninferior to enalapril-first treatment if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the absolute between-group difference was <5%, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17. In the intention-to-treat sample, the primary end point occurred in 178 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment versus 186 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -1.6%, 95% CI -7.6 to 4.4%, HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.16). In the per-protocol sample, 163 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment had a primary end point, versus 165 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -0.7%, 95% CI -6.6 to 5.1%, HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21). With bisoprolol-first treatment, 65 patients died, versus 73 with enalapril-first treatment (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22), and 151 versus 157 patients were hospitalized (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.19).",

    "386": "The HOPE TIPS study assessed the practicality and tolerability of ramipril titration to a target dose of 10 mg (as achieved in definitive efficacy studies) in a clinical practice setting. 3881 patients at high cardiovascular risk (HOPE study criteria) were recruited in primary and specialist care settings in 9 countries by 439 investigators. Dose titration of ramipril from 2.5 mg to 10 mg daily took place over 9-12 weeks. The mean age of the patients was 64 years, 60% were male and 79% Asian. The target dosage of 10 mg daily was reached in 73% of patients with 96% of patients achieving 5 mg or 10 mg daily. During the study period uncontrolled hypertension (> 160/90) was recorded in 15% of patients, myocardial infarction or unstable angina 1.6%, heart failure 0.4%, new diabetes 0.6%. Only 9.8% of patients discontinued treatment with 5.9% attributed to treatment side-effects and 4% related to cough. The large majority of patients in a wide range of clinical practice settings with high cardiovascular risk can be treated with ramipril titrated to 10 mg daily with good tolerability.", 
    "387": "The aim of our study was to evaluate whether captopril administered at night, can shift the circadian blood pressure (BP) from a nondipper to a dipper pattern in adequately controlled hypertensive patients, who continued their antihypertensive therapy. In a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled designed study, we enrolled 121 treated, adequately controlled nondipping hypertensive patients. All patients were randomly assigned to 12.5 mg captopril or placebo treatment administered at night. In case of nondippers, the dosage of captopril or placebo was doubled after two weeks of treatment, while for dippers antihypertensive regimens were not changed. After another two weeks, all patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. Our results show that at the end of the active treatment period, the prevalence of a dipping diurnal BP pattern in the captopril group (70%) was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (9.8%, P < 0.001). Nighttime BP, night/day BP ratio, nighttime BP load and 24-h systolic BP were significantly lower after 4 weeks nighttime captopril treatment compared to baseline. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that captopril administered at night can restore the diurnal BP rhythm and decrease the elevated night/day BP ratio in appropriately controlled, nondipper hypertensive patients. These results were mainly due to the decrease of nighttime BP.", 
    "388": "Hypertension is both a disease and risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and each 20/10 mm Hg rise in blood pressure (BP) doubles the risk for CVD. Although BP reduction through lifestyle modification and/or antihypertensive therapy has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk for CVD, recent evidence has shown that many patients with hypertension do not have adequate BP control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) provides comprehensive guidelines on the diagnosis, classification, and management of hypertension and related CV conditions. The JNC 7 guidelines recommend that most patients receive first-line therapy with thiazide diuretics, but the majority of patients will require 2 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve adequate BP control. The selection of additional antihypertensive therapies should be based on the presence of concomitant CV and metabolic conditions as well as patient-specific factors such as race. An important role exists for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, particularly in patients with comorbid CV or metabolic conditions. Clinical evidence suggests that these agents may offer benefits beyond simple BP lowering. Furthermore, synergies among antihypertensive classes may improve BP control and combination therapy may also permit the use of smaller doses of each medication and reduce the risk of dose-related adverse effects.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate potential cardiovascular protective properties of aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts from kiwifruit by analyzing the antioxidative, antihypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, and fibrinolytic activities in vitro. Aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts at 50 mg/ml showed DPPH-radical scavenging activities of 72.31% and 70.75%, respectively. Total antioxidant activity in linoleic acid emulsion was 85-88% at 10 mg/ml and 96-98% at 50 mg/ml of kiwifruit extract. Inhibitory activities against angiogensin I-converting enzyme of kiwifruit extracts were 21-26% at 10 mg/ml and 46-49% at 50 mg/ml, and inhibitory activities on HMG-CoA reductase were 13-14% at 10 mg/ml and 19-30% at 50 mg/ml. Fibrinolytic activity of kiwifruit was also observed at a high concentration of 100 mg/ml in both aqueous and 70% EtOH extracts. Based on our results, kiwifruit have potential cardiovascular protective properties in vitro.",

Cellular cholesterol efflux to plasma from proteinuric patients was 41% higher than to plasma from healthy subjects (P<0.001). Reduction of proteinuria from 5.0 to 1.4 g/day by dual RAAS blockade was associated with a 23% reduction in plasma apo B levels (P<0.05). Pre-beta HDL formation and plasma PLTP activity did not change significantly. Combined antiproteinuric treatment did not reduce the elevated cellular cholesterol efflux.", 
    "393": "Cellular cholesterol efflux to plasma from patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria is enhanced, in conjunction with elevated pre-beta HDL formation and plasma PLTP activity. These changes may attenuate the cardiovascular risk associated with proteinuria-associated hyperlipidaemia. Antiproteinuric therapy lowers plasma apo B, but does not affect cell-derived cholesterol efflux, suggesting that this therapy beneficially affects cardiovascular risk in proteinuric patients.",

    "398": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) activates a wide spectrum of signaling responses via the AT1 receptor (AT1R) that mediate its physiological control of blood pressure, thirst, and sodium balance and its diverse pathological actions in cardiovascular, renal, and other cell types. Ang II-induced AT1R activation via Gq/11 stimulates phospholipases A2, C, and D, and activates inositol trisphosphate/Ca2+ signaling, protein kinase C isoforms, and MAPKs, as well as several tyrosine kinases (Pyk2, Src, Tyk2, FAK), scaffold proteins (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1, p130Cas, paxillin, vinculin), receptor tyrosine kinases, and the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. The AT1R also signals via Gi/o and G11/12 and stimulates G protein-independent signaling pathways, such as beta-arrestin-mediated MAPK activation and the Jak/STAT. Alterations in homo- or heterodimerization of the AT1R may also contribute to its pathophysiological roles. Many of the deleterious actions of AT1R activation are initiated by locally generated, rather than circulating, Ang II and are concomitant with the harmful effects of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system. AT1R-mediated overproduction of reactive oxygen species has potent growth-promoting, proinflammatory, and profibrotic actions by exerting positive feedback effects that amplify its signaling in cardiovascular cells, leukocytes, and monocytes. In addition to its roles in cardiovascular and renal disease, agonist-induced activation of the AT1R also participates in the development of metabolic diseases and promotes tumor progression and metastasis through its growth-promoting and proangiogenic activities. The recognition of Ang II's pathogenic actions is leading to novel clinical applications of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1R antagonists, in addition to their established therapeutic actions in essential hypertension.",

P-wave duration was also increased and premature atrial beats were frequent on the 24-h electrocardiogram. Similar improvements in LV dysfunction were observed after 1 month of spironolactone, ACE-inhibitor, or beta-blocker therapy alone or in combination.

However, it remains uncertain whether ARBs are effective for protecting against hypertension-related organ damage in the general Japanese population. In the present report, we describe the results of a single blind, randomized, prospective study conducted in 1999-2002 and employing a total of 2,048 essential hypertensive subjects (sitting blood pressure 140-180/90-110 mmHg) aged 35-79 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive the ARB candesartan, 2 to 12 mg daily, or conventional antihypertensive drugs other than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs. We used Cox regression analysis to compare the two regimens. The primary outcome was assessed by hospitalization due to stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. Blood pressure was reduced from 162.1/91.1 to 140.1/78.9 mmHg in the candesartan group and from 165.9/95.9 to 138.4/81.1 mmHg in the conventional therapy group. The main outcomes were as follows: there was a 39% reduction in hospitalization for stroke (5.8 vs. 9.4 cases: relative risk [RR]: 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.84; p<0.05) and a 57% reduction in hospitalization for myocardial infarction (RR: 0.44; CI: 0.21-0.84; p<0.05) with the candesartan-based treatment compared with the conventional treatment. In spite of a significant difference in the total incidence of both stroke and myocardial infarction, there was no significant reduction in the incidence of congestive heart failure (15% reduction: 4.3 vs. 5.0; RR: 0.85; CI: 0.57-1.26). Further analysis in stratifying the subjects with or without a past history of cardiovascular diseases including stroke and myocardial infarction revealed that candesartan reduced the incidence of stroke (61% reduction; RR: 0.39; CI: 0.15-0.43; p<0.01) and congestive heart failure (49% reduction; RR: 0.51; CI: 0.23-0.92; p<0.05) but not myocardial infarction (RR: 0.74; CI: 0.36-1.48; p=0.1) in hypertensive patients with a past history. However, conventional treatment was superior to candesartan-based treatment in reducing the incidence of stroke in the patients without a past history of cardiovascular diseases (66% reduction; RR: 0.34; CI: 0.16-0.69; p<0.05). This is the first demonstration that an ARB-based antihypertensive treatment was superior to the conventional treatment for reducing the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in Japanese hypertensive patients, especially in the patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "415": "To summarize safety data such as clinical adverse experiences in clinical trials with a moderate to long-term follow-up, we may use a measurement which accounts for the potential differences in the follow-up duration between treatment groups. The incidence rate, which uses the total person-time follow-up in a treatment group as the denominator, is one of these measures. When treatment comparisons are based on the difference of the incidence rates, it is of interest to construct confidence intervals for the rate differences. In this paper, we first discuss the assumptions and scenarios in which the exposure adjusted incidence rate may be appropriate. Then we review several methods of calculating confidence intervals for the difference of two incidence rates assuming that the number of events come from a Poisson distribution. The methods considered include Wald's method, the two-by-two table method, the Miettinen and Nurminen (MN) method, and the conditional MN method. For all but the MN method, explicit confidence intervals can be obtained. For the MN method, some numerical iterations are required. The properties of these methods are evaluated by simulations. The results show that the MN method outperforms the other three in terms of the coverage of the confidence interval, especially when the rates and therefore the number of events are small. Lastly, data from a clinical study are used to demonstrate the application of the methods.", 
    "416": "In this study we examined diabetes- and hypertension-induced changes in cardiac structure and function in an animal model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We hypothesized that treatment with omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, which causes simultaneous inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, provides additional cardioprotective effects, during normal- as well as high sodium intake, compared to treatment with enalapril, a selective inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. Fifty-two GK rats were randomized into 6 groups to receive either normal-sodium (NaCl 0.8%) or high-sodium (NaCl 6%) diet and enalapril, omapatrilat or vehicle for 12 weeks. The GK rats developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and overexpression of cardiac natriuretic peptides and profibrotic connective tissue growth factor compared to nondiabetic Wistar rats. The high dietary sodium further increased the systolic blood pressure, and changed the mitral inflow pattern measured by echocardiography towards diastolic dysfunction. Enalapril and omapatrilat equally decreased the systolic blood pressure compared to the control group during normal- as well as high-sodium diet. Both drugs had beneficial cardioprotective effects, which were blunted by the high dietary sodium. Compared to enalapril, omapatrilat reduced the echocardiographically measured left ventricular mass during normal-sodium diet and improved the diastolic function during high-sodium diet in GK rats. Furthermore, omapatrilat reduced relative cardiac weight more effectively than enalapril during high sodium intake. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin and the neutral endopeptidase system are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy since vasopeptidase inhibition was shown to provide additional benefits in comparison with selective angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition alone.", 
    "417": "Rational drug design is a method for developing new pharmaceuticals that typically involves the elucidation of fundamental physiological mechanisms. It thus combines the quest for a scientific understanding of natural phenomena with the design of useful technology and hence integrates epistemic and practical aims of research and development. Case studies of the rational design of the cardiovascular drugs propranolol, captopril and losartan provide insights into characteristics and conditions of this integration. Rational drug design became possible in the 1950s when theoretical knowledge of drug-target interaction and experimental drug testing could interlock in cycles of mutual advancement. The integration does not, however, diminish the importance of basic research for pharmaceutical development. Rather, it can be shown that still in the 1990s, linear processes of innovation and the close combination of practical and epistemic work were interdependent.",

Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY, n = 7) were served as controls. After 10 weeks of treatment, the serum concentration of TGF-beta1, collagen type I, III and TGF-beta1 in the renal interstitum and renal mRNA levels of TGF-beta1 were detected.", 
    "420": "There were no significant differences in the serum TGF-beta1 levels among the 3 groups (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemical studies revealed a significant interstitial accumulation of collagens I, III and TGF-beta1 in SHR compared with those in WKY (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). These changes in SHR were significantly ameliorated by the administration of perindopril (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). In SHR, renal TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was increased significantly compared with that in WKY (P < 0.01), but perindopril decreased it to the normal levels of WKY (P > 0.05). The increased expression of TGF-beta1 was blocked by perindopril. The expressions of collagens I and III in renal interstitum significantly correlated with the accumulation of TGF-beta1 in the renal (r = 0. 734, r = 0.762, respectively; P < 0.01).",

Patient admissions that had the principal admission diagnoses of angioedema and other acute allergic disorders (anaphylaxis, urticaria, or allergy unspecified) were extracted. Characteristics of angioedema admissions were tabulated and compared with those of other acute allergic disease admissions with respect to demographic variables and comorbidities.",

The number of angioedema hospitalizations increased progressively from 293 in 1990 to 636 in 2003, which exceeded the number of hospitalizations for anaphylaxis that year. African Americans constituted 42% of the angioedema admissions despite being less than 16% of the state population.

    "432": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative effects of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria. Randomized, controlled trials that compared any antihypertensive agent with placebo or another agent in hypertensive or normotensive patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate <30 mg/d) were identified on Medline, in Embase, on the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, in conference proceedings, and by contacting investigators. Two authors independently extracted data on renal outcomes and other patient-relevant outcomes (e.g., mortality, serious cardiovascular events) and assessed quality of trials. Analysis was by a random-effects model, and results were expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sixteen trials (7603 patients) were identified, six of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) versus placebo, six of ACEi versus calcium antagonists, one of ACEi versus calcium antagonists or combined ACEi and calcium antagonist, and three of ACEi versus other agents. Compared with placebo, ACEi significantly reduced the development of microalbuminuria (six trials, 3840 patients; RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84) but not doubling of creatinine (three trials, 2683 patients; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.71) or all-cause mortality (four trials, 3284 patients; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03). Compared with calcium antagonists, ACEi significantly reduced progression to microalbuminuria (four trials, 1210 patients; RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84). A significant reduction in the risk for developing microalbuminuria in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes has been demonstrated for ACEi only. It seems that the effect of ACEi is independent of baseline BP, renal function, and type of diabetes, but data are too sparse to be confident that these are not important effect modifiers, and an individual patient data meta-analysis is required.", 
    "433": "High glucose concentrations are involved in the development of diabetic-associated vascular complications. We have previously reported that acute high glucose challenge, corresponding to post-prandial glycemia levels observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, blunts ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of the renal circulation of non-diabetic rabbits. Isolated perfused kidneys from non-diabetic rabbits were acutely exposed (3 h) to normal (5.5 mM--control group) or high (15 mM) D-glucose concentrations in the presence or absence of a continuous infusion of metformin (20 or 100 microM). Renal vascular reactivity was evaluated with endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine, ACh) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) vasodilating agents. ACh-induced maximal renal vasodilation was reduced by high glucose infusion (15 mM) in comparison to the control group (25+/-3% and 41+/-3% respectively; P<0.01), being restored to 41+/-4% and 43+/-2% by a simultaneous 3-h infusion of 20 or 100 microM of metformin respectively (P>0.05). Perfusion of the kidneys with the angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 microM) also significantly prevented the deleterious effects of high glucose challenge in the renal circulation. The use of a continuous infusion of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM) did not affect the protective effect of metformin in the renal circulation (39+/-4%; P>0.05), while tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM) partially blunted this effect (33+/-4, P<0.01). Renal vasodilation induced by SNP was not modified by simultaneous infusion of high glucose and/or metformin. It is concluded that the impairment of ACh-induced endothelium-dependent renal vasodilation observed after acute exposure to high glucose concentrations is abolished by metformin administration. These alterations of renal vascular reactivity can be accounted for, at least in part, by the activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system during hyperglycemia. The protective effects of metformin present some EDHF-dependent component and are not related to metabolic pathways dependent on nitric oxide.", 
    "434": "Patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathies are at high risk of developing progressive renal insufficiency. There are limited controlled data on the efficacy of potentially toxic immunosuppressive therapies for many of these diseases such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy and idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. This limitation has not deterred healthcare providers from using such agents based on anecdotal experience. We report our experience taking care of three children with heavy proteinuria from chronic glomerular diseases. All were treated with a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers without concomitant immunosuppression. All went into complete remission soon after starting therapy, allowing corticosteroid avoidance. The purpose of this report is to make healthcare professionals more aware of the potential success that can be achieved with this relatively nontoxic drug regimen. Larger controlled clinical trials using this strategy are needed to better evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in children with glomerular diseases.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of quantifying serum KL-6 levels for following-up the patients with sarcoidosis.", 
    "436": "Sera were obtained from 36 uveitic patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis and the same number of healthy volunteers. To examine the influence of systemic medication, we also collected blood samples from four more sarcoidosis patients, who were systemically treated with corticosteroid or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an anti-hypertensive drug. The serum concentration of KL-6 was measured by a human KL-6 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA).",

Although the association of chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular risk was first shown in patients with end-stage renal disease, even minor renal dysfunction has now been established as an independent risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency. Coronary revascularization improves the prognosis in patients with renal dysfunction, but there is still an underutilization of coronary revascularization procedures in patients with renal insufficiency. There is enough data that shows high mortality after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with reduced renal function and that slight renal dysfunction exposes the patient with a cardiac event to an excessive cardiac mortality. Further investigation should focus on the cause of and possible preventive interventions, for the staggering cardiovascular risk in the ever-increasing number of people with renal dysfunction.",

After discontinuing captopril and starting systemic steroids, her symptomatology rapidly improved, and her eosinophilia and radiographic abnormalities both resolved.", 
    "441": "Children with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy may recover clinically and echocardiographically. Plasma levels of the N-terminal segment of B-type natriuretic peptide prohormone (NT-proBNP), a sensitive marker for cardiac dysfunction, may reflect residual cardiac damage in these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate NT-proBNP status in pediatric patients with a history of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac evaluation was performed and the levels of NT-proBNP were measured in 23 children who had a history of myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy. NT-proBNP levels were also measured in 56 age-matched control children. Nine of the 23 patients had evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (DCM group), whereas 14 had none (recovery). NT-proBNP levels were higher in the DCM group (3154 +/- 2858 pg/ml) than in the recovery group (122 +/- 75 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and the control group (113 +/- 96 pg/ml, p < 0.001). There was no difference between the recovery and the control groups (p = 0.45), and none of the recovered patients had a NT-proBNP level higher than the upper limit of normal. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the diagnosis of persistent left ventricular dysfunction was 0.984. NT-proBNP levels correlated with echocardiographically derived shortening fraction and with clinical score. NT-proBNP is a good marker for persistent left ventricular dysfunction in children who have had myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. In this group of patients, NT-proBNP levels are normal in children who recover echocardiographically, suggesting no residual hemodynamic abnormalities.", 
    "442": "Large differences exist between women and men in the syndrome of heart failure (HF). In contrast to men, hypertension and diabetes represent the major risk factors for development of HF in women and hypertension is also the major cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and stroke. Left ventricular hypertrophy in women increases the risk for mortality to a higher degree than it does in men. The clinical course of HF is generally more benign and more frequently characterized by HF with preserved systolic function. Estrogen receptors are present in the human heart. Based on data from rodent models, they are believed to modulate hypertrophy and the progression of HF. Some of the signaling pathways have been described and involve phosphorylation of intracellular kinases and production of nitric oxide. Interestingly, estrogen receptors are upregulated in human hypertrophy and HF. The clinical course of HF in women is characterized by the more frequent occurrence of diastolic HF. Myocardial remodeling with age and, as a consequence, of mechanical load is different in both genders. Adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of HF is less strict in women than in men, leading to undertreatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Women are generally underrepresented in clinical trials in HF and gender-specific analyses have been neglected in most older large survival trials. In some of the large survival studies angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-receptor blockers did not reach significant endpoints in women. However, meta-analyses show overall positive effects for these groups of substances. Angiotensin receptor blockers were effective in large studies including high percentages of women.",

    "445": "Besides the 14 national guidelines used by primary care physicians in the countries contacted, the European guideline was used in four countries, and separate guidelines for specialists and primary care were available in another four countries. Two countries indicated that no guideline was used up to 2000. Comprehensiveness of the guidelines varied with respect to length, literature included and evidence ratings. Relevant differences in treatment recommendations were seen only in drug classes where evidence had changed recently (beta-blockers and spironolactone). The relation between recommendation and prescribing for selected recommendations was inconsistent among countries.",

    "447": "Fosinopril sodium presents a prodrug for the active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. The dual elimination of fosinoprilat by the liver and the kidney distinguishes fosinopril from other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Such ways of elimination are important for antihypertensive therapy of patients on haemodialysis. The paper presents development and evaluation of a new and sensitive liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the analysis of fosinoprilat in plasma obtained from patients on haemodialysis. A microemulsion system mixture as mobile phase has been used for the separation and analysis of fosinoprilat in plasma samples. The plasma samples were injected directly onto the HPLC system (Waters Breeze) after appropriate sample dilution with mobile phase. Separations were performed on the Bakerbond ENV 4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size column with UV detection at 220 nm. The flow rate was 1.00 mL min(-1). The mobile phase consisted of 1.0% (w/v) of diisopropyl ether, 2.0% (w/v) of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 6.0% (w/v) of n-propanol and 91% (w/v) of aqueous 25 mM di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, pH adjusted to 2.8 with 85% orthophosphoric acid. The developed method was then subjected to method validation according to the criteria stated in the FDA bioanalytical method validation guidance. The results for specificity, linearity, low limit of quantification (LLOQ), precision, accuracy and stability were within the accepted criteria. The unique approach applied in this paper makes possible the determination of fosinoprilat even in the presence of metabolites of other drugs, so the method can be used for obtaining the reliable results in a fast and simple way.", 
    "448": "Essential arterial hypertension often predisposes patients to prothrombotic state and increased risk of vascular and organ complications. Vital role in regulation of hemostatic processes is played by genetic factors, renin-angiotensin system and disorders of lipid metabolism. Prime genetic factors involved in the process are 4G/5G polymorphism of promoter region coding tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and I/D polymorphism for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene. The aim of work was the evaluation of alterations within fibrinolysis system (estimation of t-PA and PAI-1 levels), fibrinogen concentration (Fb) and ACE activity with regard to co-existent dyslipidemia and features of left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH). Moreover the analysis of influence of 4G/5G PAI and I/D ACE gene polymorphism on intensification of aforementioned alterations among hypertensive patients was performed. Research was carried out in 170 subjects under 40 years old, in two study groups, HT-- hypertensive group--125 patients with previously untreated hypertension without clinical features of ischaemic heart disease and NT--45 normotensive, healthy subjects. HT group has been further divided into four subgroups: DLP (dyslipidemic, n = 51), NLP (normolipidemic n = 74), LVH+ (with features of left ventricle hypertrophy, n = 35), LVH (-) (without features of left ventricle hypertrophy, n = 90). In a whole HT group significantly higher levels of PAI-1, t-PA and Fb were noted in comparison to NT group, considerably more pronounced within DLP rather than NLP subgroups. Moreover, pronounced increase in ACE activity was recorded in DLP and LVH+ subgroups. It has been proved that 4G/4G homozygous subjects of 4G/5G PAI-1 gene polymorphism from HT group tend to present higher levels of PAI-1 and t-PA if contrasted to 4G/4G genotype of NT group, with more distinct effect within DLP subgroup. Carriers of D allele (genotypes I/D, D/D) of I/D ACE gene polymorphism from HT group characterise with significantly higher activity of ACE in contrast to I/I genotype of HT group, with particularly marked effect in DLP and LVH+ subgroups. Basing on above mentioned results it may be concluded that essential hypertension (especially if complicated with dyslipidemia) impairs fibrinolysis, what might be related to renin-angiotensin system activation in lipid metabolism disorders. Deletion alleles of 4G/5G polymorphism (4G allele) and I/D polymorphism (D allele) in patients with hypertension independently modify fibrinolysis towards prothrombotic state with more distinct effect in dyslipidemia. Increased activity of ACE in D allele carriers may predispose to left ventricle hypertrophy.",

The rates of use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the 2 groups (72% ramipril versus 68% placebo) were similar after the end of the trial. During the posttrial follow-up, patients allocated to ramipril had a 19% further lower relative risk (RR) of myocardial infarction (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 1.01), a 16% lower RR (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) of revascularization, and a 34% lower RR of a new diagnosis of diabetes (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.95). Similar RR reductions in vascular events were observed during and after the active phase of the trial, regardless of baseline risk (RR of 0.76, 0.89, and 0.83 for low-, medium-, and high-risk patients, respectively) or ancillary treatments (RR of 0.90 for aspirin, 0.76 for beta-blockers, and 0.84 for lipid-lowering medication).", 
    "451": "The benefits of ramipril observed during the active period of the HOPE trial were maintained during posttrial follow-up for cardiovascular death, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure.

These benefits were consistent regardless of patient risk or ancillary treatments.",

Recently, we reported that AF was associated with endocardial dysfunction, limited to the left atrium (LA) and LAA and manifest as reduced nitric oxide (NO*) production and increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. We hypothesized that reduced LAA NO* levels observed in AF may be associated with increased superoxide (O2*-) production.", 
    "453": "After a week of AF induced by rapid atrial pacing in pigs, O2*- production from acutely isolated heart tissue was measured by 2 independent techniques, electron spin resonance and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome C reduction assays. Compared with control animals with equivalent ventricular heart rates, basal O2*- production was increased 2.7-fold (P<0.01) and 3.0-fold (P<0.02) in the LA and LAA, respectively. A similar 3.0-fold (P<0.01) increase in LAA O2*- production was observed using a cytochrome C reduction assay. The increases could not be explained by changes in atrial total superoxide dismutase activity. Addition of either apocyanin or oxypurinol reduced LAA O2*-, implying that NADPH and xanthine oxidases both contributed to increased O2*- production in AF. Enzyme assays of atrial tissue homogenates confirmed increases in LAA NAD(P)H oxidase (P=0.04) and xanthine oxidase (P=0.01) activities. Although there were no changes in expression of the NADPH oxidase subunits, the increase in superoxide production was accompanied by an increase in GTP-loaded Rac1, an activator of the NADPH oxidase.", 
    "454": "AF increased O2*- production in both the LA and LAA. Increased NAD(P)H oxidase and xanthine oxidase activities contributed to the observed increase in LAA O2*- production. This increase in O2*- and its reactive metabolites may contribute to the pathological consequences of AF such as thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue remodeling.",

Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship of CRP to mortality and morbidity. Interactions were tested to determine whether differences in CRP changes from baseline to 4 and 12 months between groups randomly assigned to valsartan or placebo depended on baseline ACE inhibitor use. Median plasma CRP was 3.23 mg/L (interquartile range 1.42 to 7.56 mg/L), which is higher than in the general population. Patients with CRP above the median had features of more severe heart failure than those with CRP levels below the median. The cumulative likelihood of death and first morbid event increased with increasing quartile of CRP. Relative to the lowest CRP quartile, the risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9) and first morbid event (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.84) was increased in the highest CRP quartile in multivariable models. CRP added incremental prognostic information to that provided by brain natriuretic peptide alone.

The therapy should be initiated as early as possible, bearing in mind that the renoprotection is more effective if used before overt proteinuria or a reduction in kidney function is present. The therapy should be offered to all patients, regardless of renal function, as well as to subjects with severely impaired glomerular filtration. CEIs and ARBs should be administered in therapeutic doses as high as possible to achieve maximal possible proteinuria reduction and systemic blood pressure target <130/80 mm Hg, and 125/75 mm Hg in those subjects with renal insufficiency who present with proteinuria above 1 g/24 h.

    "476": "Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been found to alter the voluntary consumption of alcohol. Here we characterize the role of central angiotensin II (Ang II) in alcohol intake first by using transgenic rats that express an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen and consequently have reduced Ang II levels exclusively in the central nervous system [TGR(ASrAOGEN)680]. These rats consumed markedly less alcohol in comparison to their wild-type controls. Second, Spirapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which passes the blood-brain barrier, did not influence the alcohol consumption in the TGR(ASrAOGEN)680, but it significantly reduced alcohol intake in wild-type rats. Studies in knockout mice indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin receptor AT1 whereas the AT2 receptor and the bradykinin B2 receptor are not involved. Furthermore, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is markedly reduced in rats with low central Ang II, strengthening our hypothesis of a role of dopaminergic transmission in Ang II-controlled alcohol preference. Our results indicate that a distinct drug-mediated control of the central RAS could be a promising therapy for alcohol disease.", 
    "477": "In the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, pharmacological treatment strategies should have several aims: (i) in individuals without overt cardiovascular disease, but with risk factors such as hypertension and/or diabetes, pharmacotherapy should prevent or delay disease development; (ii) in patients who have already progressed to cardiovascular disease, pharmacotherapy should help either to prevent or regress target organ damage (TOD); and (iii) in patients with TOD, pharmacotherapy should prevent events. Any medication intended for long-term therapy also should be well tolerated. Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system has proven a successful therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular and renal medicine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated important advantages over conventional agents such as beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, and have become a relevant part of treatment for heart failure post-myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction and renal disease. Tolerability concerns may prevent their use in some patients, however. Angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) provide a different form of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and a growing body of evidence suggests that this alternative approach may confer additional cardiovascular protection for some patient subgroups. In addition, ARBs generally are better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, enhancing patient compliance and persistence with long-term therapy. Furthermore, evidence in favour of combining an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in certain circumstances is continuously growing.",

Captopril dose was individualized according to blood pressure. Changes in UAE, blood pressure, and metabolic control were monitored to analyze the influence of the addition of diltiazem on progression of diabetic nephropathy. In patients treated with captopril and diltiazem, absolute UAE did not change during the study (baseline: 101 mg/24 h, range 39-298; 2 years after randomization: 74 mg/24 h, range 12-665). In contrast, UAE increased in patients treated with captopril monotherapy (baseline: 118 mg/24 h, range 32-282; 2 years after randomization: 164 mg/24 h, range 15-1161, p<0.05). In addition, fewer patients in the captopril/diltiazem group progressed to macroalbuminuria (eight patients in captopril group and one in captopril/diltiazem group, p<0.05). The beneficial effects of the addition of diltiazem were independent of blood pressure and metabolic control. We suggest that the combination of ACE inhibitors and NDCA should be considered in type 2 microalbuminuric patients at high risk for progression to established diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "479": "Although various neurohormones at initial measurement confer prognostic value in heart failure and correlate with the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac volumes, the significance of their temporal changes (Delta) remains undetermined. This study examined temporal changes in neurohormones related to cardiac remodeling and prognosis in patients with systolic dysfunction and heart failure receiving therapeutic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Temporal changes in plasma renin, angiotensin-II, aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-ANP) in 768 treated patients with heart failure measured at baseline and 17 and 43 weeks after randomization were examined for their relations with concurrent changes in the EF, cardiac volumes, and risk for subsequent adverse clinical outcomes. Increasing BNP (p < 0.0001) and NT-ANP (p = 0.01) over time were associated with a concurrent decreasing EF, increasing end-diastolic volume (EDV), and increasing end-systolic volume (ESV; all p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, DeltaBNP and DeltaNT-ANP were independent predictors of DeltaESV and DeltaEDV, whereas DeltaBNP also predicted DeltaEF (all p < 0.0001). Patients who died or experienced heart failure hospitalization had larger antecedent increases in NT-ANP (+293.7 vs -21.5 pmol/ml, p = 0.006) and lesser decreases in norepinephrine (-22.3 vs -48.5 pg/ml, p = 0.04). Increasing NT-ANP (hazard ratio [HR] 3.45, p = 0.009) and norepinephrine (HR 2.04, p = 0.02) over time independently predicted increased risk for subsequent death or heart failure hospitalization. In conclusion, in treated patients with heart failure, increasing NT-ANP and BNP over time predict a decreasing EF and ventricular dilatation, while increasing NT-ANP and norepinephrine independently predict greater mortality and morbidity. Serial measurements of these neurohormones may serve as useful surrogate markers of ventricular remodeling and prognosticators for clinical risk stratification.", 
    "480": "Structural and functional changes in large and small arteries in hypertension, even at early stages, may affect one or several end organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys, contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, modern treatment strategies should not only target blood pressure (BP) reduction but also normalize vascular structure and function. The purpose of this article is to review the large body of evidence, from randomized double-blind clinical trials, that has been gathered in regard to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, demonstrating its efficacy in reducing BP, reversing abnormalities of vascular structure and function in patients with essential hypertension, and ultimately preventing cardiovascular events. At the site of small resistance arteries, long-term treatment with perindopril, but not atenolol, reduced arterial wall hypertrophy for a given BP reduction. The improvement in small artery function in response to structural changes is exemplified at the site of the coronary circulation. Perindopril increased coronary blood flow and coronary reserve, in parallel with the regression of periarteriolar and interstitial collagen of coronary arterioles. At the site of large arteries, long-term treatment with perindopril reduced carotid and radial artery wall hypertrophy, and reduced carotid artery internal diameter. In response to these structural changes, large artery function improved at the site of the carotid and brachial arteries, showing a higher arterial distensibility, and at the site of the coronary circulation, showing a normalized arterial dilation in response to a cold pressor test or an increase in blood flow. Moreover, in patients with end-stage renal disease, perindopril decreased pulse wave velocity independently of BP changes, resulting in a highly significant relative risk reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The multifactorial antiatherosclerotic profile of perindopril suggests a beneficial effect not only in patients with uncomplicated hypertension but also in patients with established coronary heart disease or previous stroke, as exemplified by the EUropean trial on Reduction Of coronary events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS).", 
    "481": "Perindopril is a long-acting, once-daily lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme affinity, lowering angiotensin II and potentiating bradykinin. Its efficacy, safety, and tolerability are well established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Moreover, large morbidity-mortality trials, such as the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), have shown that antihypertensive treatment with perindopril reduces and prevents cardiovascular disease in a large range of patients with vascular diseases, whether or not they are hypertensive. Thus, the outcomes of these and other trials support the concept of cardiovascular protective properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with perindopril in addition to the obvious blood-pressure-lowering effect. Considering its properties and the clinical evidence on efficacy and tolerability that has been gathered, perindopril fulfils the criteria of the latest guidelines for hypertension and cardiovascular disease management and should therefore be considered as a first-line antihypertensive agent, forming a consistent part of the comprehensive strategy against hypertension and related cardiovascular complications.", 
    "482": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays important roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, renal diseases, cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Angiotensin II exerts classic hemodynamic and renal effects, but it is also a local biologically active mediator with direct effects on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Two subtypes of Ang II receptors, type 1 (AT(1)) and type 2 (AT(2)), have been identified. Their roles have been investigated in depth in vivo and in vitro, although few data are available concerning the role of the AT(2) receptors in the adult circulation in humans. The two receptors, both of which belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, have different signaling pathways and different functions. The AT(1) receptor subtype is expressed ubiquitously and is involved in most of the well-known biological functions of Ang II. The AT(1) receptor transactivates growth pathways and mediates major Ang II effects such as vasoconstriction, increased cardiac contractility, renal tubular sodium reabsorption, cell proliferation, vascular and cardiac hypertrophy, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. In contrast to AT(1), the physiologic role of AT(2) receptors has long remained an enigma. The AT(2) receptors are highly expressed in fetal tissues, although their expression dramatically decreases after birth, being restricted to a few organs, including the cardiovascular system. The AT(2) receptor is re-expressed in the adult animal after cardiac and vascular injury and during wound healing, suggesting a role for this receptor in tissue remodeling, growth, or development. Recent and concordant data suggested that overstimulation of AT(2) receptors might be implied in cardiac and vascular hypertrophic processes. Both Ang II receptors are involved in hypoxia-induced neovascularization. A large set of experimental evidence suggests that activation of the AT(1) receptor results in proangiogenic effects, whereas AT(2) receptors mediate apoptosis and thus antiangiogenic effects. Furthermore, bradykinin through its B(1) or B(2) receptors is a potent activator of experimental hypoxia-induced neovascularization. Thus, pharmacologic blockade of the AT(1) receptor and resulting overactivation of AT(2) receptors could impair or delay neovascularization in ischemic tissues in patients receiving chronic treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, increased tissue bradykinin resulting from inhibition of converting enzyme could help to restore functional vascularization in ischemic tissues. These basic concepts deserve a second reading and reevaluation to discuss differences in vascular protection in large clinical trials with different classes of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "483": "Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is considered to be the most complete way to manage high-risk patients including those with hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with overt clinical heart failure, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Furthermore, recent trials like the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluations (HOPE) study and the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) support extending the use of ACE inhibitors to the routine/first-line treatment of patients with an increased global cardiovascular risk. Although some investigators have seen the development of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as a more effective and tolerable way of reproducing the benefits of ACE inhibition, there remain important concerns regarding the distinct pharmacologic profiles and modes of action of these two classes of drugs. Careful evaluation of data from recent large-scale studies revealed that, unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs are either neutral or may actually increase rates of myocardial infarction despite similar levels of blood pressure reduction. The fact that this effect is most apparent when ARBs are compared with placebo in the absence of concomitant ACE inhibitors suggests that differential effects on the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors may be important. Other important pharmacologic differences are also known to be present and may be of direct relevance. The weight of available evidence therefore supports the use of appropriate ACE inhibitor regimens, although not ARBs, in the treatment of global cardiovascular risk.",

For valsartan-treated patients, savings due to reduced hospitalizations and shorter length of hospital stay were 1,083,938 US dollars and 221,364 US dollars, respectively. Subtracting the cost of valsartan treatment (629,472 US dollars) from savings yielded projected net savings of 675,830 US dollars per year.

In the nested case-control analysis, interval medication adherence (IMA, the ratio of the number of days of medication dispensed in a single prescription divided by the number of days until the next prescription is filled) during the prescription interval immediately before an increase in the antihypertensive regimen was compared with a similar interval in control patients without an increase matched by age, medication, number of days of medication dispensed, and months since initiation of therapy.",

A total of 250 99mTc-MAG3 captopril renography tests were used in the study. The material was collected from two different patient groups. One group consisted of 101 patients who also had undergone a renal angiography. The angiographies, which were used as gold standard, showed a significant renal artery stenosis in 53 of the 101 cases. The second group consisted of 149 patients, who's captopril renography tests all were interpreted as not compatible with significant renal artery stenosis by an experienced nuclear medicine physician. Artificial neural networks were trained for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis using eight measures from each renogram. The neural network was then evaluated in separate test groups using an eightfold cross validation procedure. The performance of the neural networks, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.93. The sensitivity was 91% at a specificity of 90%. The lowest performance was found for the network trained without use of a parenchymal transit measure, indicating the importance of this feature. Artificial neural networks can be trained to interpret captopril renography tests for detection of renovascular hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. The result almost equals that of human experts shown in previous studies.",

The mitral valve annulus was enlarged in all patients (mean diameter 31 +/- 2 mm; 27 +/- 4 mm/m2 BSA). MR resulted from prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (P of AMVL) in 16 patients (36%), and from prolapse of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (P of PMVL) in nine (20%); the other 19 patients (43%) had restrictive motion of the PMVL, with normal motion of the AMVL, resulting in a 'false prolapse' of the AMVL (FP of AMVL). During the six-month interval following the RF episode, mitral valve surgery was required in 11 patients (25%); three patients (7%) died from cardiogenic shock before they could undergo surgery, while the other 30 patients were stabilized under medical treatment. Using univariate analysis, death or mitral valve surgery was associated with PAPS > 50 mm (OR = 1.7, p = 0.04), male gender (OR = 1.88, p = 0.008), clinical signs of congestive heart failure at admission (OR = 2.7, p < 10(-4)), and prolapse of the PMVL (OR = 5.2, p = 0.01). Death occurred, or mitral valve surgery was necessary, in eight patients with P of PMVL (89%), in four with P of AMVL (25%), and in two with FP of AMVL (11%) (p < 0.001). Despite limitations due to co-linearities and small sample size, multivariate analysis identified P of PMVL as the most potent predictor of adverse outcome. The long-term follow up (mean 6.3 years) of patients without P of PMVL, alive and not operated on during the first six-month interval after an RF episode, demonstrated a sharp decrease in the mean severity of MR (from grade 4 to 1.7; range: 1-3).",

    "529": "Mortality remains high in chronic heart failure (CHF) because under ACE inhibitor treatment other neurohumoral systems remain/become (de)activated, such as the endothelin and atrial natriuretic peptide pathways. Dual endothelin-converting enzyme-neutral endopeptidase (ECE-NEP) inhibition exerts beneficial effects in experimental CHF, but whether \"triple\" ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition is superior to ACE or ECE-NEP inhibition is unknown. We compared, in rats with CHF, ACE-ECE-NEP to ACE or ECE-NEP inhibition in terms of left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics and remodeling. Benazepril (2 mg/kg/d) or the ECE-NEP inhibitor CGS26303 (10 mg/kg/d) were administered alone or in combination (subcutaneously for 28 days starting 7 days after coronary ligation). ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition reduced blood pressure more markedly than ACE or ECE-NEP inhibition. All treatments increased cardiac output to the same extent, but ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition reduced LV diameter and LV end-diastolic pressure more markedly than ACE or ECE-NEP inhibition. The reduction of LV weight and collagen accumulation in the \"viable\" myocardium was most pronounced after ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition. These results, obtained in experimental CHF, illustrate a further improvement of LV hemodynamics and structure after ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition compared with either ACE or ECE-NEP inhibition, but whether this is associated with a further improvement of exercise tolerance and/or survival remains to be determined.", 
    "530": "Resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and functional capacity do not correlate in chronic heart failure patients treated with digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We sought to determine whether substantial improvement in LVEF, as may occur during long-term beta-blockade or after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, leads consistently to improvement in functional class. Doppler echocardiogram and assessment of functional class were obtained at baseline and 12 months after initiation of beta-blockade (87 patients) or CABG surgery (51 patients). At 12 months the effects of beta-blockade were variable: LVEF increased greatly by >or=11% (median value) in 45 patients (52%) and by <11% in 19 (22%), but it decreased or remained unchanged in 23 patients (26%). In contrast, functional class was unchanged or worsened in 59 patients (68%) and improved in only 28 (32%). Similarly, surgery had variable effects on LVEF. LVEF increased by >or=12% (median) in 28 patients (55%) and by <12% in 14 (27%), whereas it decreased or remained unchanged in 9 patients (18%). Functional class was unchanged or worsened in 41 patients (80%) and improved in only 10 (20%). Changes in functional class and LVEF were unrelated for both interventions. Both beta-blockade and CABG surgery improve LVEF in the majority of patients. However, significant improvement in LVEF does not enhance functional capacity consistently in chronic heart failure.", 
    "531": "Administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol results in cardiac apoptosis. The effect of short-term beta-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol on the activity of plasma, lung, and left ventricular (LV) angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and its association with the development of cardiac apoptosis was investigated. beta-Adrenergic stimulation for 24 hours produced an early increase only in the proapoptotic proteins bax and bcl-XS without changes in the levels of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-XL. The ratio between these bcl family proteins was indicative of apoptosis and correlated with an early and significant increase (300%) in DNA laddering. However, after 5 days of the beta-adrenergic stimulation, the ratio changed in favor of antiapoptotic proteins and correlated with the absence of DNA fragmentation. In addition, LV and plasma ACE activities increased markedly with isoproterenol over the study period up to 5 days. ACE activity also regulated expression of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-XL. The administration of perindopril (an ACE inhibitor) prevented the observed increase in bax and bcl-XS levels and attenuated (50% decrease, P<0.05) the effect of isoproterenol on DNA fragmentation. Thus, early and transient cardiac apoptosis triggered by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol is reversed in the presence of perindopril.",

    "533": "Forty percent to 50% of patients with chronic heart failure have normal or relatively normal left ventricular ejections fractions. These are much more frequently women and tend to be older than those with reduced ejection fractions. In most, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction plays a major role in the genesis of heart failure. Until recently, these patients have been systematically excluded from heart failure trials, so that there are no proven treatments for this group. This article reviews the recent and ongoing trials in patients with diastolic heart failure, which hopefully will lead to improved treatment and outcomes.", 
    "534": "There is little objective to guide the therapy of patients with diastolic heart failure. Because of the similarities of pathophysiology abnormalities in diastolic and systolic heart failure, it is a reasonable inference to suggest that the proven therapy for systolic heart failure may also be of benefit in patients with diastolic heart failure. Treatment of underlying or exacerbating conditions in diastolic heart failure, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemia, diabetes, anemia, obesity and pulmonary disease is an important means of managing diastolic heart failure. Control of systolic blood pressure is effective in improving and preventing the development of diastolic heart failure. Treatment of diastolic heart failure is most effective when it is associated with hypertension. Production of systolic arterial pressure acutely reduces pulmonary congestion, ischemia, and chronically may lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with diastolic heart failure in the absence of hypertension are very difficult to treat.", 
    "535": "Therapeutic strategies to prevent atherosclerotic plaque progression and achieve plaque stabilization involve 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors (statins) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockade, but studies investigating the potentially additive effects of a combined treatment strategy are rare. We hypothesised that the adjunction of atorvastatin with telmisartan or ramipril might achieve additional effects on experimental atherosclerosis though statin-induced lipid-lowering is lacking. ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and randomized to either placebo (CON), atorvastatin (ATO), ramipril (RAM), telmisartan (TEL) or RAM+ATO and TEL+ATO (N=23 per group). RAS-blockade, but not ATO, reduced systolic blood pressure. None of the treatment regimens lowered systemic cholesterol levels or lipoprotein fractions. RAM, TEL and the combined therapy, but not ATO, significantly reduced aortic lipid deposition. All substances significantly reduced monocyte chemoattracting protein (MCP)-1 concentrations, macrophages and matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP)-9 content and enhanced plaque's content of tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1, collagen and fibrous cap thickness, resulting in an overall decrease of advanced plaques (classified as types IV-VI). Additive effects of the adjunction were observed on MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 plasma levels. These results indicate that a combined treatment with RAS-blockade and statins may have additive effects on systemic cardiovascular risk markers even in the absence of lipid-reduction, although additional effects on atherosclerotic plaque progression and stability were not observed in this model.",

A total of 131 volunteers with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension were randomly divided into four groups (n 32 or 33 in each group). Each volunteer was given two tablets containing four different dosages of VPP and IPP (VPP+IPP: 0, 1.8, 2.5 and 3.6 mg), daily for 6 weeks. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure was observed at 6 weeks in the active group receiving 1.8 mg (P<0.01) VPP and IPP; in the active groups receiving either 2.5 mg or 3.6 mg, systolic blood pressure was decreased at both 3 weeks (P<0.05 and P<0.05) and 6 weeks (P<0.001 and P<0.0001) compared with systolic blood pressure measured before treatment. Changes in the systolic blood pressure after 6 weeks of treatment in the four groups were --1.7, --6.3, --6.7 and --10.1 mmHg, and these effects were dose dependent. In addition, a significant difference in systolic blood pressure between the placebo group and the VPP and IPP group receiving 3.6 mg was observed (P<0.001) by two-way ANOVA. The antihypertensive effect was greater in mildly hypertensive subjects (n 20 or 21 in each group) than in any of the other subjects. No significant change of diastolic blood pressure was observed for all the test groups, and no differences in diastolic blood pressure in the test sample groups compared with the placebo group were observed during the test period.",

After being weaned, male 3-week-old SHR were randomized into five groups. Until the 20th week of life, rats in each group were given one of the following drinking fluids: tap water (negative control 1), a fermented milk without ACE-inhibitory activity (negative control 2), captopril (100 mg/kg) (positive control), the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk that had significant ACE-inhibitory activity, or Ca-enriched E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk. Animals in the different groups were then given tap water as drinking fluid from the 20th to 25th week of life. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured weekly in the rats, from the 6th to 25th week of life, by the tail-cuff method. A definite decrease in SBP and DBP could be observed in the rats treated with captopril and also in the rats that received the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milks. The greatest antihypertensive effect was observed when the pharmacological treatment was administered. The effect of the Ca-enriched fermented milk was slightly more accentuated and more constant than the effect of the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk that had not been enriched in Ca. SBP and DBP increased in the treated SHR when the corresponding antihypertensive treatment was removed. Fermentation of milk with E. faecalis CECT 5728 may therefore be a successful strategy to produce a functional food with antihypertensive activity.",

In addition to treating the culprit lesion mechanically, admission for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD) gives an opportunity for the interventional cardiologist to optimize medical therapy. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current medical literature pertaining to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction and vascular event prevention in the setting of PCI, with emphasis on antiplatelet therapies, beta-blockers, HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with regard to therapy optimization during PCI and for chronic CAD.

    "539": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were accepted as a potential cause of inadequate epoetin response in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We aimed to determine the effects of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), on serum ertyhropoietin levels and on certain biochemical and haematological parameters in hypertensive CKD patients. Twenty-two stage III-IV CKD patients (mean age; 56.8 +/- 8.9 years, 12 male 10 female) were included in the study. Before initiating the treatment, current anti-hypertensive treatments (if any) were discontinued, and blood samples were collected after a washout period of 3 weeks. Valsartan 80 mg/day was started, and additional anti-hypertensive agents were given according to study protocol if needed. One way Anova and paired t-tests were used for statistical comparisons. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, potassium, haemoglobin and erythropoietin values were measured, and glomerular filtration rates were calculated before and 3, 6 and 90 days after valsartan treatment, a significant reduction in EPO level was observed at 3rd (19.6 +/- 24.0 vs. 13.8 +/- 8.5, p = 0.010), 6th (12.1 +/- 7.6, p = 0.009), and 90th days (8.3 +/- 5.4, p = 0.007). When pre-treatment values were compared with 90th day results, no significant change was observed in terms of hgb, htc, serum BUN, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, and GFR values. In conclusion, valsartan, an ARB, did not decrease haemoglobin levels in stage III-IV CKD patients despite significant reduction in serum erythropoietinlevels, so ARBs may be preferred to ACEIs in CKD patients when indicated.", 
    "540": "Arterial hypertension is a leading contributor to the progression of chronic renal disease. Short-term studies had addressed the role of oxidative stress in hypertensive nephropathy. We have now studied oxidative stress and caspase activation in a long-term model of hypertensive renal injury. Nontreated spontaneously hypertensive rats with uninephrectomy displayed severe arterial hypertension over a 36-week follow-up. Uncontrolled high blood pressure in the context of modest renal mass reduction resulted in significant histological renal injury. Blood pressure control by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril, or the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, decreased the degree of renal injury. Hypertensive renal injury was associated with evidence of activation of the apoptotic pathway (increased activation of caspase-3) and local renal (increased staining for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) and systemic [increased serum levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha)] lipid oxidation when compared with normotensive control rats. In addition, severe hypertension decreased the renal antioxidant defenses, as exemplified by decreased expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Treatment with quinapril or losartan decreased caspase-3 activation, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal staining, and 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels and increased Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase expression. These results suggest that hypertension-associated oxidative stress and its consequences may be decreased by either ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor antagonist, emphasizing the role of angiotensin II in hypertensive renal damage.", 
    "541": "Trandolapril/verapamil sustained release (SR) [Tarka] is an oral, fixed-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril and the SR formulation of the phenylalkylamine calcium channel antagonist verapamil. It is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients who require more than one agent to achieve blood pressure (BP) targets. In the large, randomised, multicentre INVEST (INternational VErapamil SR/trandolapril STudy), a verapamil SR-based treatment strategy that included trandolapril in most patients was as effective as an atenolol-based treatment strategy in reducing the risk of the primary outcome (first occurrence of death [all-cause], nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke) in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) and was as well tolerated. Trandolapril/verapamil SR is generally more effective at controlling hypertension than either component as monotherapy, and is as effective as a number of other fixed-dose combination therapies. The combination is as well tolerated as trandolapril monotherapy and is at least as well tolerated as verapamil SR monotherapy. In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the BENEDICT (BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetes Complications Trial), trandolapril/verapamil SR prolonged the time to the onset of persistent microalbuminuria compared with placebo, as did trandolapril monotherapy. Thus, trandolapril/verapamil SR is an effective option for the treatment of essential hypertension in patients requiring more than one agent to achieve BP targets, including those with compelling indications, such as CAD or type 2 diabetes.", 
    "542": "Ramipril/felodipine extended release (ER) [Triapin and Triapin Mite, Unimax] is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the ER formulation of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist felodipine. It is indicated in adult patients with essential hypertension whose blood pressure (BP) is inadequately controlled with ramipril or felodipine monotherapy. In this patient population, commercially available fixed-dose combinations (i.e. 2.5 mg/2.5 mg and 5 mg/5 mg) of ramipril and felodipine ER are more effective at controlling hypertension than the individual components used as monotherapy at the same dosages. Likewise, the 5 mg/5 mg combination is as effective as felodipine ER 10 mg, and more effective than ramipril 10 mg administered as monotherapy. The addition of low-dose ramipril plus felodipine ER (fixed-dose or combination of individual components) to the existing antihypertensive regimen also appears to provide adequate BP control and renal protection in hypertensive patients with non-diabetic chronic renal disease. In these patients, the low-dose combination of ramipril and felodipine ER was as effective as standard-dose felodipine ER, but more effective than standard-dose ramipril, in providing diastolic BP (DBP) control, and as effective as standard-dose ramipril, but more effective than standard-dose felodipine ER, in slowing the rate of regression of glomerular filtration. The ramipril/felodipine ER combination is as well tolerated as ramipril or felodipine ER monotherapy administered at the same dosages, and is better tolerated than felodipine ER monotherapy given at twice the dosage used in the combination. Overall, ramipril/felodipine ER appears to be an effective option for the treatment of adults with essential hypertension that is poorly controlled with monotherapy. In addition, a fixed, low-dose combination of ramipril/felodipine ER is a potential alternative to monotherapy for the initial management of essential hypertension.", 
    "543": "We report a case of a 46-year-old white male with renal graft artery stenosis who developed acute renal shutdown with total anuria while on the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, one week following the discontinuation of aspirin. The serum creatinine was 8.5 mg/dl. Doppler ultrasound and MAG3 scintigraphy of the grafted kidney were highly suggestive of a viable but nonfunctioning kidney. A femoro-femoral bypass for total thrombosis of the right common iliac artery was performed distal to the occlusion. Immediate diuresis was obtained after establishing the bypass. Serum creatinine dropped to 1.35 mg/dl three days later. In this case we believe that the collateral circulation played a significant role in immediate recovery of kidney function by maintaining renal perfusion pressure and preventing acute tubular necrosis (ATN). We also believe that the ACE inhibitor might have contributed to salvaging the kidney by improving medullary oxygen balance and maintaining adequate medullary blood flow.",

Two hundred and fifty adult Malaysian patients with a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure of more than 95 mmHg and less than 115 mmHg after a 14 day washout period were randomized to receive either valsartan 80 mg once daily (n=125) or perindopril 4 mg daily (n=125) for eight weeks. The primary end point for efficacy was the change in mean sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SiSBP and SiDBP). The primary criteria for evaluation of tolerability was the incidence of adverse events. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to sex, age, weight, baseline sitting and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At 0, 4 and 8 weeks the mean SiDBP in the valsartan group were 101.4, 92.8 and 91.0 mmHg respectively. The corresponding BP for the perindopril treated group was 102.6, 93.8 and 93.2 mmHg. (95% CI -1.39 to +3.27). There were no significant differences in the mean BP measurements between the valsartan and perindopril group at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. In each group there were significant differences between the BP at 4 and 8 weeks compared to baseline. A similar pattern was seen with SiSBP. At 4 weeks 28.7% of the valsartan and 25% of the perindopril group had their BP normalized (SiDBP <90 mmHg) The percentages of patients who responded (SiDBP reduction >10 mmHg but SiDBP >90 mmHg) were 21.3 in the valsartan group and 20.8 in the perindopril group. At 8 weeks, 31.1% of the valsartan group and 30.8% of the perindopril group had their BP normalized. The response rate was 27% and 22.5% for valsartan and perindopril respectively. The major adverse event was cough which occurred in 18 patients (14.4%) in the perindopril and 1 (0.8%) in the valsartan group at 4 weeks. At 8 weeks the figures were 24 (19.2%) and 2 (1.6%) respectively. The results indicate that Valsartan is safe and efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It is equally efficacious to Perindopril and not associated with any major adverse event. It has a better tolerability profile with respect to dry cough.",

It provided clear evidence that Ramipril should safely and cost-effectively be used in individuals not known to have low ventricular ejection fraction or heart failure but at high-risk of cardiovascular events. It was also beneficial in patients with renal insufficiency, reducing progression of proteinuria and development of new microalbuminuria. It provided micro- and macrovascular benefits in people with diabetes, reduced the development of new cases of diabetes and showed a positive and graded association between the waist-to-hip ratio and the risk of developing diabetes.

    "559": "Although first described more than 130 years ago, the pathophysiology, origin, and management of the several types of angioedema are poorly understood by most dermatologists. Although clinically similar, angioedema can be caused by either mast cell degranulation or activation of kinin formation. In the former category, allergic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced angioedema are frequently accompanied by urticaria. Idiopathic chronic angioedema is also usually accompanied by urticaria, but can occur without hives. In either case, an autoimmune process leading to dermal mast cell degranulation occurs in some patients. In these patients, histamine-releasing IgG anti-FcepsilonR1 autoantibodies are believed to be the cause of the disease, removal or suppression by immunomodulation being followed by remission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema is unaccompanied by hives, and is caused by the inhibition of enzymatic degradation of tissue bradykinin. Hereditary angioedema, caused by unchecked tissue bradykinin formation, is recognized biochemically by a low plasma C'4 and low quantitative or functional C'1 inhibitor. Progress has now been made in understanding the molecular genetic basis of the two isoforms of this dominantly inherited disease. Recently, a third type of hereditary angioedema has been defined by several groups. Occurring exclusively in women, it is not associated with detectable abnormalities of the complement system. Angioedema caused by a C'1 esterase inhibitor deficiency can also be acquired in several clinical settings, including lymphoma and autoimmune connective tissue disease. It can also occur as a consequence of specific anti-C'1 esterase autoantibodies in some patients. We have reviewed the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of these different subtypes of angioedema.",

    "561": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have favourable effects on hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, but persistent use may result in incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Long-term effects of dual blockade using the ACE inhibitor lisinopril and the long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan on blood pressure and albumin excretion rate (AER) were evaluated. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >or=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >or=90 mmHg) and microalbuminuria (AER 30-300 mg/24h) received 20mg of lisinopril or 80 mg of telmisartan once a day for 24 weeks. Patients were then randomised to continuing treatment with the respective monotherapy or with lisinopril plus telmisartan for a further 28 weeks. Significant (P<0.001) declines in SBP (11.1 mmHg versus 10.0 mmHg), DBP (5.6 mmHg versus 5.3 mmHg) and AER (98 mg/24 h versus 80 mg/24 h) were achieved with lisinopril (n=95) or telmisartan (n=97), respectively, after 24 weeks. Subsequent treatment with lisinopril plus telmisartan for 28 weeks resulted in further significant reductions (P<0.001) in SBP, DBP and AER compared with either monotherapy. All treatments were well tolerated. Lisinopril plus telmisartan thus provides superior blood pressure and AER control than either monotherapy. We conclude that use of dual blockade may provide a new approach to prevention of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and microalbuminuria.",

The AT1 receptor antagonist eprosartan reduced adrenal 125I-Ang II accumulation by 80%, and increased plasma Ang II to a greater degree than tissue Ang II. As a consequence, eprosartan equally reduced the tissue/plasma concentration ratios of both Ang II and 125I-Ang II. Captopril did not alter 125I-Ang II accumulation, and acutely, but not chronically, reduced the adrenal Ang II/I ratio.",

Local adrenal Ang II generation occurs extracellularly and is followed by internalization via AT1 receptor-mediated endocytosis.

    "581": "The prevalence of both acute and chronic renal failure is high in the Arab world. Data available on the exact prevalence of various renal diseases are very limited. Nevertheless, the reported prevalence of chronic renal failure is 80 to 120 per million population (pmp) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 225 pmp in Egypt. This is in comparison with the reported prevalence of 283 pmp in Europe, 975 pmp in the United States, and 1149 pmp in Japan. Lower prevalence rates reported in this region could be due to underreporting. The economic burden of renal replacement on health care providers is enormous. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the estimated cost per annum incurred toward maintenance hemodialysis is US 19,400 US dollars and, considering that there are more than 7200 patients on regular dialysis in this country, the total expenditure is enormous. Such large amounts may be beyond the monetary capacity of many countries in this region because of limited financial resources. These figures clearly suggest that there is an urgent need to establish a massive prevention program. The strategy adapted should be innovative and imaginative and should be one that is maximally cost effective. Paradoxically, in the Arab world, we have a good opportunity to reduce the incidence of kidney failure (chronic and acute) substantially by appropriately chosen models. This is because many of the causes of renal failure are eminently preventable. In fact, a rough estimate is that these programs, if successful, can reduce the incidence by as much as 40% (personal communication, Shaheen, 2003). It is worthy of mention that, in the Arab world, the budget for research is about 0.15% of the national domestic product compared with the international average of 1.5%. In this article, we concentrate on some of the main causes of renal failure in the Arab world that we feel can be prevented and suggest ways that can best address this issue.", 
    "582": "Both reduced filtration power and increased excretion of albumin in the urine are powerful markers for renal and cardiovascular progressive function loss. These risk markers indicate the risk above and beyond the conventional existing risk markers/factors. The risk is substantial, because both reduced filtration and microalbuminuria are highly prevalent in the general population, matching in prevalence with the most well-known risk factor, hypertension. Therapeutic interventions to preserve renal and cardiovascular function, such as with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, are highly effective, particularly in those patients that have reduced filtration power. In addition, short-term reduction of albuminuria that follows the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system intervention appears to be predictive of long-term cardiovascular and renal protection. In conclusion, estimated glomerular filtration rate as well as albumin excretion in the urine are powerful predictors for cardiovascular and renal outcome and should be used as such. Intervention and prevention could be aimed at not only at reducing conventional risk markers, but also at reducing albuminuria.", 
    "583": "The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system both by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk of doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic nephropathies treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients that reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of end-stage renal disease is likely to be achieved in the next future for chronic nephropathies, provided that we can improve the degree of renoprotection. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of blood pressure and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for diabetics, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for management of patients with chronic nephropathies.",

In this study, the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) both individually on each other are explored and compared. In the first study arm, Sprague-Dawley rats received a continuous infusion of AGE-modified rat serum albumin (RSA) or unmodified RSA for 4 wk with or without the angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonist valsartan. In the second arm, animals received a continuous infusion of Ang II (58.3 ng/kg per min) with or without the AGE inhibitor pyridoxamine. Components of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system were measured using real time reverse transcription-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity assays. Renal and serum AGE were quantified by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and AGE-fluorescence. After an infusion of AGE-RSA, renal expression of angiotensinogen, ACE, renin, and angiotensin receptor type 1 were increased significantly (all P < 0.01), and ACE activity was elevated. This was associated with tubular and glomerular hypertrophy and AGE accumulation, which could be antagonized by valsartan. However, valsartan had no effect on increased filtration fraction associated with an AGE-RSA infusion. At the same time, an infusion of Ang II increased the serum and renal accumulation of AGE and advanced oxidation protein products and induced renal hypertrophy and salt retention that could be antagonized by pyridoxamine. However, pyridoxamine had no effect on renal vasoconstriction manifested by reduced renal blood flow. AGE and Ang II have overlapping activities in the kidney. The beneficial effects of blockade of either pathway underline the importance of this interaction in diabetic renal disease and the aging kidney.",

Two of the rare causes of CPHT (< or = 7%) are: chronic thromboembolic hypertension and primary one; these two diseases resemble in many situations and, consequently, the diagnosis is frequently difficult (especially when risk factors for recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism are not present). Our case presentation is just such a situation; only pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy allowed us to make the right diagnosis--chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension--in an \"apparently clear\" primary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "593": "The aim of this study is to prove for a well tolerated medication (clinical and financial) a supplementary effect in improvement prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD, already treated with classical pneumology drugs. Three pts. groups were selected: the first received only classical pneumology treatment, the second with supplementary therapy by IECA and Ca-blockers, the third with supplementary therapy with IECA and nebivolol; the follow-up protocol included clinical and paraclinical status (blood gases, spirometry, ECG, echocardiography, 6 minute walk test) over 3 months. Clinical and paraclinical evolution of the pts. in group 2 and group 3 was significantly better that in pts from group 1.

Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSOV) represents a small fraction (1.3%) of these anomalies, with an overall prevalence of 0.017% to 0.03% in angiographic studies. The high incidence of sudden cardiac death associated with this specific anomaly during or immediately after vigorous physical exercise makes identification and appropriate surgical intervention critical. We present a case report of a 14-year-old patient with an LMCA arising from the RSOV with an initial intramural course, presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as the first indication of the anomaly. Transthoracic echocardiogram suggested this anomaly, which was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and transesophageal echocardiogram.", 
    "595": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class is one with considerable staying power. ACE inhibitors are not only well established antihypertensive agents but also are compounds that fairly regularly provide end-organ protection. Several of the ACE inhibitors are entangled in an active debate regarding class effect. Class effect for ACE inhibitors is a hopelessly confused term because its definition is not standardized and is subject to interpretation that in many cases is self-serving. For the most part, ACE inhibitor side effects are readily identifiable, and management strategies put in place can be logical and sequential. The future of this drug class remains bright. Other drug classes, such as angiotensin receptor blockers, have narrowed-but not entirely closed-the outcomes gap that exists between these two drug classes.", 
    "596": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are widely-prescribed drugs for hypertension and are supported by clinical trials in which they reduce cardiovascular events. In the high-risk patients in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study, and European Trial of Reduction of Cardiac Events With Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, ramipril and perindopril showed impressive benefits. One reason trandolapril did somewhat less well in the Prevention of Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition trial may be that its patients were very well treated with other effective modalities. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, lisinopril-treated patients had a slightly lower incidence of myocardial infarction, despite much poorer control of blood pressure, perhaps because a second-line diuretic was prohibited by protocol. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause cough and angioedema (more common among blacks), angiotensin receptor blockers are currently more expensive and have fewer outcome trials to support their use.", 
    "597": "Nephrotic syndrome is an important chronic disease in children, characterized by minimal change disease in the majority. Research on pathogenesis has emphasized the importance of T lymphocyte dysregulation and vascular permeability factors that might alter podocyte function and permselectivity. While mutations in genes that encode important podocyte proteins have also been identified, a hypothesis unifying available evidence on pathogenesis is yet to be proposed. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at risk for life threatening infections and thromboembolic episodes. Long-term effects of persistent hyperlipidaemia and prolonged steroid therapy are increasingly recognized. Remission of proteinuria following corticosteroid therapy has greater prognostic value, in relation to long-term outcome, than the precise renal histology. Prospective studies show that prolonged duration of therapy for the initial episode results in sustained remission and reduced frequency of relapses. Treatment with levamisole, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil is beneficial in a variable proportion of patients with frequent relapses or steroid dependence. The management of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is difficult; most patients failing to achieve remission show progressive renal damage. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) are capable of inducing remission in a significant proportion of patients, but at risk of nephrotoxicity. Reduction of proteinuria is also possible, in children, using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers. Prospective trials are necessary to identify effective and safe therapies for patients with frequent relapses, steroid dependence and resistance.",

    "599": "Eligibility criteria from the trials establishing the efficacy of CRT were applied to two prospective cohorts: the first enrolled patients with newly diagnosed heart failure discharged from 103 hospitals between April 1999 and March 2001 ('the hospital discharge cohort'); the second enrolled patients seen in a specialized clinic between August 2003 and January 2004 ('the specialty clinic cohort'). In the hospital discharge cohort, 73 patients (3% of the 2640 patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and 1% of all 9096 patients with heart failure discharged alive) met trial eligibility criteria: LVEF< or =0.35, QRS > or =120 ms, sinus rhythm, and NYHA class III or IV symptoms despite the treatment with ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker. In the specialty clinic cohort, 54 patients (21% of the 263 patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and 17% of all 309 patients with heart failure) met these criteria. If persistent symptoms despite taking spironolactone were required for CRT eligibility, then the proportions qualifying dropped to 1% in the hospital discharge cohort and 18% in the specialty clinic cohort.",

    "601": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interfere with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in a different way. Theoretically, one might expect beneficial effects when they are used in combination, as a more complete suppression of the RAS can be achieved. But can this additional effect still be seen in patients on full-dose ACE-inhibition? Several controlled trials demonstrated that combination therapy can have additional benefits in hypertensive patients, in chronic heart failure patients, and in both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy patients. However, the clinical benefit was not always as pronounced as expected and not every patient will benefit from dual blockade of the RAS. There is some evidence of a less pronounced effect of combination therapy when a full dose of the ACE-inhibitor is given. However, it is well known that ACE-inhibitors cannot completely suppress the formation of angiotensin II, in particular, when the RAS is activated. Indeed, clinical trials indicated that add-on therapy with an ARB was especially of use when the RAS remained activated despite full-dose ACE-inhibitor treatment. In summary, combination of a full-dose ACE-inhibitor and an ARB can be a rational choice in selected patients.",

A total of 1535 patients (mean age: 64 years, 79% men), 321 after coronary surgery and 1214 after percutaneous coronary intervention, were included. Of them 37% still described anginal symptoms (Canadian class 1 in 80% of them); 38% still had elevated blood pressure (> or = 140 mm HG systolic and/or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic) and 27% of previous smokers still smoked after the procedure. All classes of secondary prevention medications were more often prescribed after than before intervention, antiplatelet agents (63.5 to 89%), beta-blockers (53 to 73.5%), statins (51 to 3%), ACE inhibitors (27 to 39%) and nicorandil (14 to 21%). Factors associated with the prescription of the different classes of medications were both expected (such as hypertension for ACE inhibitors or statins in hyperlipidemic patients) or unsupported by scientific evidence (less beta-blockers in diabetic patients). Overall this survey shows that myocardial revascularisation constitutes a key point in the management of patients with coronary disease, and that cardiologists consider that treatment of the atherosclerotic process is as important as the treatment of focal coronary artery stenoses.",

    "604": "Among diabetic hypertensive patients, ethnic differences in blood pressure control and outcomes have been attributed in part to greater reluctance of providers to prescribe combination antihypertensive regimens to African Americans than to Caucasians. African Americans purportedly receive fewer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which reduce target organ complications. To assess these issues, cross-sectional data were analyzed from 19,864 diabetic hypertensives from 62 primary care clinics. Among diabetic hypertensives, African Americans (N=6230) were less likely than Caucasians (N=8041) to have blood pressure (BP) <130/80 mm Hg at their last clinic visit (23.1% [23.0%-23.2%] vs. 30.7% [30.6%-30.9%]) despite a greater number of prescriptions for antihypertensive medications (2.67 [2.63-2.70] vs. 2.23 [2.20-2.26]). African Americans were more likely than Caucasians to have an ACEI and/or ARB prescribed and to receive prescriptions for at least two antihypertensive medications that included an ACEI or ARB (64.1% [63.8%-64.4%] vs. 53.1% [52.8%-53.4%]). Among diabetic hypertensives, African Americans are less likely than Caucasians to attain BP <130/80 mm Hg, despite receiving more antihypertensive medication prescriptions. African Americans receive more ACEIs and/or ARBs than Caucasians for target organ protection and/or BP control. The data suggest provider prescribing patterns are not a major contributor to ethnic differences in BP control and outcomes in diabetic hypertensives.", 
    "605": "This article demonstrates the applicability of quantitative proteomics to assays of proteolytic enzyme activity. A novel assay was developed for measurement of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in plasma. The method was validated in animal models associated with alterations of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) with a ProteinChip Array technology, plasma renin and ACE1 could be measured in <0.5 microL of plasma. Plasma is incubated with peptide substrates for renin and ACE, tetradecapeptide (TDP), and angiotensin I (Ang I), respectively. The reactions mixtures are spotted onto the ProteinChip WCX2 and detected using SELDI-TOF-MS. Peak height or area under curve for TDP, Ang I, and angiotensin II (Ang II) peaks are measured. There was a linear relationship between disappearance of substrate and appearance of products for both renin and ACE (R2=0.95 to 0.98). ACE1 activity was blocked with chelating agents (EDTA and 1,10 phenanthrolene), indicating action of a metalloprotease. The ACE1 inhibitor, captopril, selectively blocked ACE1. Renin activity was specifically blocked with renin inhibitor and was not affected by phenanthrolene or captopril. Animal models tested were Ang AT1a receptor-deficient and streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic mice. Plasma renin activity was increased >2-fold in AT1a(-/-) as compared with AT1a(+/+). In STZ diabetic mice, ACE1 was increased 2-fold as compared with controls. The advantage of the method is that it is tagless, does not require additional purification steps, and is extremely sensitive. The approach can be multiplexed and used for identification of novel substrates/inhibitors of the RAS.",

    "612": "Follow-up data were available for a total of 162 individuals (95.3%) with the other 38 individuals (4.7%) being lost-to-follow-up premature MI patients. During a mean period of 4.43 years' follow-up, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and Killip's status > or =II were more frequent among patients with subsequent cardiac events (all P-values <0.05). The frequency of 5A allele of stromelysin-1 gene was significantly higher among event group (P = 0.01). Smoking cessation after MI, use of beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) could improve outcome (all P-values <0.05). After multivariate analysis, we found that DM was an independent risk factor for survival [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.45, P = 0.01]. Successful smoking cessation and therapy with ACEI could have a protective effect (HR 0.33 and 0.09, P = 0.01 and <0.01, respectively). The stromelysin-1 5A gene polymorphism was also an independent survival predictor (HR 2.51, P = 0.03). In addition, smoking cessation could significantly modify the risk, especially among patients with 5A allele polymorphism (HR 6.75 vs. 1.50).",

    "614": "Milk proteins are precursors of many different biologically active peptides. These peptides are inactive within the protein sequence, requiring enzymatic proteolysis for release of the bioactive fragment from the proteins precursor. It is evident that activated peptides originating from milk proteins should be taken into account as potential modulators of various regulatory processes in the body. Activated peptides are potential modulators of various regulatory processes in the living system: immuno-modulatory peptides stimulate the activities of cells of the immune system and several cytomodulatory peptides inhibit cancer cell growth, antimicrobial peptides kill sensitive microorganisms, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides exert an hypotensive effect, opioid peptides are opioid receptor ligands which can modulate absorption processes in the intestinal tract, mineral binding peptides may function as carriers for different minerals, especially calcium, antithrombotic peptides inhibit fibrinogen binding to a specific receptor region on the platelet surface and inhibit aggregation of platelets. Moreover, many milk-derived peptides reveal multifunctional properties, i.e. specific peptide sequences having two or more different biological activities have been reported. Bioactive peptides can interact with target sites (e.g. receptors, enzymes) at the luminal side of the intestinal tract, or they could be absorbed and reach any potential site of action in the system to elicit physiological effects. Bioactive peptides encrypted in bovine milk proteins can be produced on an industrial-scale and are claimed to be health enhancing components for functional foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical preparations that are used to reduce risk of disease or to enhance certain physiological functions.", 
    "615": "An apparent low prevalence of cancer in hypertensive patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is reported; however, the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) is well known to be associated with hypertension, as a main peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, and its detailed molecular mechanisms have recently been elucidated. For instance, Ang-II directly activates the mitogenic signal transduction pathway through the angiotensin-II type-1 (AT1) receptor in smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. Ang-II receptor blockers (ARBs), a class of antihypertensive agent, suppress signal transduction pathways mediated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), through the AT1 receptor. Our studies demonstrated that an ARB had the potential for antiproliferative effects and inhibition of angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells. The AT1 receptor is categorized in the guanosine phosphate binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are viewed as critical regulators of the interactions between epithelial and stromal cells. Hence, we consider that in overcoming prostate cancer, it is very important to inhibit GPCR signaling in cancer cells by ARBs. It is unclear how prostate cancer growth changes from being hormone dependent to independent, and no effective therapy has therefore been developed. Our clinical data revealed that ARB administration decreased prostate specific antigen (PSA) and improved performance status in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This review provides an insight into the key role of Ang-II and the possibility of ARBs for molecular targeting of mitogenesis and angiogenesis in prostate cancer.", 
    "616": "Recent studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as well as angiogenesis is involved in tumor development. The aim of the present study was to examine the interaction of RAS, angiogenesis and a potent angiogenic factor, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in the hepatocarcinogenesis process. In a diethylnitrosamine-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis model, a clinically used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (PE), significantly suppressed glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive preneoplastic lesions along with inhibition of neovascularization in the liver. The hepatic expression of VEGF was also attenuated. The degree of angiogenesis correlated well with the development of preneoplastic lesions. Our in vitro study showed that PE significantly suppressed VEGF-induced tubular formation and the migration of endothelial cells (EC), whereas it did not affect the proliferation of EC. These results suggested that RAS plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, at least partly through VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.",

Thus, GPs provided a significantly higher percentage of correct answers with respect to the remaining categories (p = 0.05). The lower rate of correct answers (0 to 15.9%) concerned the time of onset of cough and the action to take. Cardiologists seemed to be less aware of the fact that angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) can cross-react with ACE-I.",

    "623": "The effect of the anabolic androgenic steroid, nandrolone decanoate, on substance P endopeptidase-like activity was examined in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg day) or oil vehicle (sterile arachidis oleum) were administered by intramuscular injections during 14 days. Substance P endopeptidase, a predominantly cytosolic enzyme, generates the bioactive N-terminal fragment substance P(1-7) from the enzyme substrate substance P. Nandrolone decanoate significantly reduced the substance P endopeptidase-like activity compared to control animals in hypothalamus (43% reduction), caudate putamen (44%), substantia nigra (32%) and the ventral tegmental area (27%). It was previously reported that both hypothalamus and caudate putamen contained significantly higher levels of substance P after nandrolone administration. The higher concentration of substance P in these regions could to an extent be attributed to the reduction in substance P endopeptidase-like activity. This result elucidates the important role of peptidase activity in the regulation of the substance P transmitter system. The present study provides additional support for the hypothesis that alterations in the substance P system in certain brain areas may contribute to some of the personality changes reported in connection with AAS abuse.", 
    "624": "Our previous studies have shown that the cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) was enhanced in the chronic heart failure in dogs and rats. Exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) potentiated this reflex which was mediated by AT1 receptor. The aim of the present study was to determine if the abnormal endogenous Ang II and AT1 receptor in the PVN were responsible for the enhanced CSAR in rats with coronary ligation-induced chronic heart failure (CHF). Under urethane and alpha-chloralose anesthesia, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded in sino-aortic denervated and cervical vagotomized CHF and sham-operated rats. The effects of bilateral microinjection of AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on the CSAR evoked by epicardial application of bradykinin (BK, 0.04 and 0.4 microg) were determined respectively. Both AT1 receptor mRNA and AT1 receptor protein in the PVN were measured. Bilateral microinjection of either captopril (10 nmol) or losartan (50 nmol) into the PVN inhibited the enhanced CSAR evoked by BK in rats with CHF, but had no significant effects in sham-operated rats. AT1 receptor protein in the PVN significantly increased in CHF rats compared with sham-operated rats. These results indicated that either decrease of Ang II or blockage of AT1 receptor in the PVN normalized the enhanced CSAR evoked by epicardial application of BK in rats with CHF, and that increased expression of AT1 receptor in the PVN contributed to the enhanced CSAR in the CHF state.", 
    "625": "Studies of mammalian terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase (TdT) are facilitated by use of inhibitors that selectively knock down the activity of the enzyme. We have screened for selective inhibitors of TdT and identified a natural compound with this property in the Japanese vegetable, Arctium lappa. The compound has little effect on the activities of mammalian DNA polymerases, such as alpha, beta, delta or lambda polymerase, and prokaryotic DNA polymerases, such as Taq DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow fragment. H1- and C13-NMR spectroscopic analyses showed the compound to be baicalin, a compound previously reported as an anti-inflammatory or antipyretic agent. The IC50 value of baicalin to TdT was 18.6 microM. We also found that genistin, a baicalin derivative known to be antimutagenic, more selectively inhibited TdT activity than baicalin, although its IC50 value was weaker (28.7 microM). Genistin and baicalin also inhibited the activity of truncated TdT (the so-called pol beta core domain) in which the BRCT motif was deleted in its N-terminal region. In kinetic analyses, inhibition by either genistin or baicalin was competitive with the primer and non-competitive with the dNTP substrate. The compounds may, therefore, bind directly to the primer-binding site of TdT and simultaneously disturb dNTP substrate incorporation into the primer. Genistin and baicalin should prove to be useful agents for studying TdT.",

Diabetes is a significant independent risk factor for heart failure, and there are a substantial number of patients with diabetes and heart failure. Neurohormonal activation plays an important pathophysiologic role in insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular events, and progression of heart failure. Pharmacologic intervention in these neurohormonal systems (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibition, aldosterone antagonism, and beta-adrenergic blockade) has been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality of diabetes and of heart failure. Despite this knowledge, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are grossly underutilized, and deaths and hospitalizations due to heart failure have steadily increased. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with mild, moderate, and severe heart failure with or without diabetes. Aldosterone antagonists are recommended in severe heart failure and recent data also support their use in mild to moderate heart failure. Concerns about increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity with beta-blockers may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for their patients with diabetes who have heart failure. Beta-blockade, in conjunction with ACE inhibition and aldosterone antagonism, should be standard therapy for all patients with diabetes and heart failure. Furthermore, every effort should be made to ensure that eligible patients are treated with these evidence-based, guideline-recommended, life-prolonging therapies.",

Bradykinin (BK) in the trachea is believed to play some role in this adverse effect. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of imidapril and enalapril on the activity of aminopeptidase P (APP), one of the BK-metabolizing enzymes, in the mouse trachea. Imidapril (0.5 mg/kg) or enalapril (0.5 mg/ kg) was given orally to mice once daily for 7 days. Drug concentrations and APP activity in the trachea were determined at the end of the experiment. Active metabolites (imidaprilat and enalaprilat), but not parent drugs (imidapril and enalapril) were detected in the trachea after a repeated dose for 7 days. Tissue concentrations of imidaprilat and enalaprilat did not significantly differ. The APP activity in the trachea did not significantly change after the 7th dose of imidapril. However, the enzyme activity was significantly inhibited after the final dose of enalapril. Thus, the present study showed that enalapril, but not imidapril inhibited the airway APP activity during repeated dosing. This finding is compatible with previous reports that the incidence of dry cough is lower with imidapril than with enalapril, and with the hypothesis that the dry cough induced by ACE inhibitors may be related to accumulation of BK in the trachea.",

The multivariate analysis showed that the variables associated with ICH development were smoking (odds ratio [OR], 0.684; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.478-0.979); oral b-blockers (OR, 0.488; CI, 0.337-0.706); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (OR, 0.480; CI, 0.340-0.678); arterial hypertension (OR, 4.900; CI, 2.758-8.705); age of 55-64 yrs (OR, 2.253; CI, 1.117-4.546); age of 65-74 yrs (OR, 4.240; CI, 2.276-7.901); age of 75-84 yrs (OR, 4.450; CI, 2.319-8.539); and age of >84 yrs (OR, 2.997; CI, 1.039-8.647). The mortality rate among patients with ICH was 48.3%, vs. 8.3% among patients without ICH. The multivariate study showed that the mortality rate among patients with ICH was associated with age (OR, 1.086; CI, 1.033-1.143), arterial hypertension cardiovascular risk factor (OR, 2.773; CI, 1.216-6.324), and the need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 4.324; CI, 1.665-11.230) or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR, 12.258; CI, 1.268-118.523). However, the administration of b-blockers (OR, 0.369; CI, 0.136-0.997) or ACE inhibitors (OR, 0.367; CI, 0.149-0.902) was associated with a reduction in the mortality rate.", 
    "649": "Factors associated with the development of ICH in our population were age and arterial hypertension, whereas smoking and the administration of b-blockers or ACE inhibitors were associated with a reduction in incidence. Among patients with AMI complicated by ICH, mortality was associated with age, arterial hypertension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of mechanical ventilation, whereas the administration of oral b-blockers and ACE inhibitors could be associated with a reduction in mortality.", 
    "650": "The rate of cleavage secretion of the enzymatically active ectodomain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein and by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C. Here, we report that both calmodulin inhibitor (CaMI) and calmodulin kinase inhibitor could also enhance cleavage secretion of ACE. This effect was accompanied by the dissociation of calmodulin from a specific region within the cytoplasmic domain of ACE to which it had been bound. The same domain of ACE was phosphorylated, and both CaMI and PMA caused dephosphorylation of ACE as well. Mass spectrometric and mutational analyses identified Ser730 as the only phosphorylated residue in the cytoplasmic domain of ACE. The Ser730 --> Ala mutant of ACE was not phosphorylated, but it still bound calmodulin, and its cleavage secretion was enhanced by both CaMI and PMA. Similarly, when Ser730 was replaced by the phosphoserine mimetic, Asp, cleavage secretion of the resultant mutant remained susceptible to the enhancing effect of CaMI and PMA. These results demonstrate that, although CaMI and PMA can enhance both cleavage secretion of ACE and its dephosphorylation, the two effects are not mutually interdependent.",

Funnel plots, trim and fill methods and meta-regression were used to assess publication bias and sources of heterogeneity.", 
    "654": "In patients with type 1 or type 2 DM and microalbuminuria there is a RR of all-cause mortality of 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 2.1] and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) respectively. Similar RRs were found for other mortality end-points, with age of cohort being inversely related to the RR in type 2 DM. In patients with type 1 DM, there is evidence that microalbuminuria or raised albumin excretion rate has only weak, if any, independent prognostic significance for the incidence of retinopathy and no evidence that it predicts progression of retinopathy, although strong evidence exists for the independent prognostic significance of microalbuminuria or raised albumin excretion rate for the development of proliferative retinopathy (crude RR of 4.1, 95% CI 1.8 to 9.4). For type 2 DM, there is no evidence of any independent prognostic significance for the incidence of retinopathy and little, if any, prognostic relationship between microalbuminuria and the progression of retinopathy or development of proliferative retinopathy. In patients with type 1 DM and microalbuminuria there is an RR of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of 4.8 (95% CI 3.0 to 7.5) and a higher RR (7.5, 95% CI 5.4 to 10.5) of developing clinical proteinuria, with a significantly greater fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with microalbuminuria. In patients with type 2 DM, similar RRs were observed: 3.6 (95% CI 1.6 to 8.4) for developing ESRD and 7.5 (95% CI 5.2 to 10.9) for developing clinical proteinuria, with a significantly greater decline in GFR in the microalbuminuria group of 1.7 (95% CI 0.1 to 3.2) ml per minute per year compared with those who were normoalbuminuric. In adults with type 1 or type 2 DM and microalbuminuria at baseline, the numbers progressing to clinical proteinuria (19% and 24%, respectively) and those regressing to normoalbuminuria (26% and 18%, respectively) did not differ significantly. In children with type 1 DM, regression (44%) was significantly more frequent than progression (15%). In patients with type 1 or type 2 DM and microalbuminuria, there is scarce evidence as to whether improved glycaemic control has any effect on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the incidence or progression of retinopathy, or the development of renal complications. However, among patients not stratified by albuminuria, improved glycaemic control benefits retinal and renal complications and may benefit CVD. In the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on GFR in normotensive microalbuminuric patients with type 1 DM, there was no evidence of a consistent treatment effect. There is strong evidence from 11 trials in normotensive type 1 patients with microalbuminuria of a beneficial effect of ACE inhibitor treatment on the risk of developing clinical proteinuria and on the risk of regression to normoalbuminuria. Patients with type 2 DM and microalbuminuria, whether hypertensive or not, may obtain additional cardiovascular benefit from an ACE inhibitor and there may be a beneficial effect on the development of retinopathy in normotensive patients irrespective of albuminuria. There is limited evidence that treatment of hypertensive microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients with blockers of the renin--angiotensin system is associated with preserved GFR, but also evidence of no differences in GFR in comparisons with other antihypertensive agents. The data on GFR in normotensive cohorts are inconclusive. In normotensive type 2 patients with microalbuminuria there is evidence from three trials (all enalapril) of a reduction in risk of developing clinical proteinuria; in hypertensive patients there is evidence from one placebo-controlled trial (irbesartan) of a reduction in this risk. Intensive compared with moderate blood pressure control did not affect the rate of progression of microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria in the one available study. There is inconclusive evidence from four trials of any difference in the proportions of hypertensive patients progressing from microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria when ACE inhibitors are compared with other antihypertensive agents, and in one trial regression was two-fold higher with lisinopril than with nifedipine.", 
    "655": "The most pronounced benefits of glycaemic control identified in this review are on retinal and renal complications in both normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients considered together, with little or no evidence of any greater benefit in those with microalbuminuria. Hence, microalbuminuric status may be a false boundary when considering the benefits of glycaemic control. Classification of a person as normoalbuminuric must not serve to suggest that they will derive less benefit from optimal glycaemic control than a person who is microalbuminuric. All hypertensive patients benefit from blood pressure lowering and there is little evidence of additional benefit in those with microalbuminuria. Antihypertensive therapy with an ACE inhibitor in normotensive patients with microalbuminuria is beneficial. Monitoring microalbuminuria does not have a proven role in modulating antihypertensive therapy while the patient remains hypertensive. Recommendations for microalbuminuria research include: determining rate and predictors of development and factors involved in regression; carrying out economic evaluations of different screening strategies; investigating the effects of screening on patients; standardising screening tests to enable use of common reference ranges; evaluating the effects of lipid-lowering therapy; and using to modulate antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "656": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) could contribute to the protective effects of preconditioning, and to explore its underlying mechanism. The Langendorff model of isolated rat heart was used. Cardiac contractility and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary effluent were measured, and infarct area of hearts after 30 min of ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion was analyzed. We found that: (1) The subthreshold preconditioning (2 min of ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion), captopril (an ACEI with sulfhydryl groups) or perindoprilate (an ACEI without sulfhydryl groups) alone did not protect the hearts from being injured by 30 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. (2) However, the combination of captopril or perindoprilate with subthreshold preconditioning could decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), increase left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and coronary flow compared with the subthreshold preconditioned group. The combination treatments also inhibited the release of LDH from ischemia/reperfusion hearts, and reduced the infarct area in ischemic heart after 2 h of reperfusion (P<0.05). (3) By using NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 mumol/L) before combined administration of ACEI with subthreshold preconditioning, the protection effect triggered by the combination treatment was significantly reduced. Pretreatment of the hearts with mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoK(ATP)) channel inhibitor 5-HD (100 mumol/L) also abolished the protection effect (P<0.05). (4) Subthreshold preconditioning, captopril or perindoprilate alone could enhance the NO content in coronary effluent (P<0.05), but the combination of captopril or perindoprilate with subthreshold preconditioning could further augment the NO content compared with the subthreshold preconditioned group (P<0.05). The results indicate that ACEIs with or without sulfhydryl groups may potentiate the subthreshold preconditioning to trigger cardiac protection effect against the ischemia/reperfusion injury. This protection effect in the heart is possibly mediated by the generation of NO and the activation of mitoK(ATP) channel.",

Experiments with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), diclofenac, and L-NAME + diclofenac suggested that cyclooxygenase and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor components of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation were also impaired. A high-sodium diet aggravated hypertension and diabetes-induced vascular and renal complications. Omapatrilat and enalapril normalized blood pressure and albuminuria during the normal-sodium diet, and effectively ameliorated diabetes-induced renal complications also during the high-sodium diet. However, omapatrilat improved endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh to a greater extent (85 +/- 5%) than enalapril (68 +/- 6%, P < 0.05).

Glomerular disorders include IgA nephropathy, cryoglobulinemia, amyloidosis, and a lupus-like immune complex glomerulopathy. The most attention has been focused on collapsing glomerulopathy associated with nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure, which appears to be unique for patients with HIV/AIDS, called HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and it occurs predominantly in African American patients. Investigations in humans and in a transgenic mouse model reveal direct infection of renal epithelial cells by HIV and toxic cellular and immunologic processes mediated by HIV glycoproteins as the principal pathophysiology of HIVAN. Highly active antiretroviral treatment may be associated with an improved renal outcome and even reversal of kidney disease in some patients. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may avert progression of HIVAN to end-stage kidney disease and result in superior patient and kidney survival as compared with untreated patients.", 
    "673": "The first association between HIV-1 infection and kidney disease was made in 1984 and much has been learned over the past 20 years. In recent years, more effective therapies for HIV-1 infection and its associated opportunistic infections have led to improved patient survival. However, with prolonged survival, morbidity associated with renal disease has also increased. Among the multiple glomerulopathies that can affect patients with HIV, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is most common and frequently leads to end-stage renal disease. Although the precise mechanisms of HIV-associated FSGS remain to be elucidated, it appears that host genetic susceptibility, direct infection of the renal epithelium, and toxicity of one or more viral accessory protein contribute. Therapy for HIV-associated FSGS includes control of blood pressure and the use of angiotensin antagonist therapy. A randomized trial of angiotensin receptor blocker will be initiated shortly. Drug-related nephropathies are also common, manifesting as acute renal failure, nephrolithiasis, and interstitial nephritis. Tenofovir, a newer nucleoside analogue, has recently been implicated in causing tubular toxicity, although the incidence is low. Appropriate screening for renal dysfunction can minimize the likelihood of progressive renal injury in all patients with HIV-1 infection.", 
    "674": "Cardiac remodelling is the expression of molecular, cellular and interstitial changes in response to cardiac injury, manifesting as adverse alterations in the size, shape and function of the ventricle. Several clinical studies have documented significant elevations in the levels of renin, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone attending acute myocardial infarction and/or congestive heart failure. Similar to catecholamines, markedly elevated activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with poor prognosis. The effects of Ang II upon cardiac tissue are related to two primary receptors, Ang II type 1 (AT1) and Ang II type 2 (AT2). The AT1-receptor appears to mediate many of the deleterious effects of chronic RAAS activity, while the AT2-receptor is increasingly shown to have potential cardioprotective effects. Attenuating the deleterious effects of sustained Ang II stimulation can be achieved by direct inhibition of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) and/or direct antagonism of AT receptors. ACE inhibition reduces left ventricular (LV) volumes, retards the progression of LV dilatation and hypertrophy and increases systolic function in systolic dysfunction. By blocking at the receptor level, Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) provide an alternative and more direct approach to inhibiting the effects of Ang II; however, data relating to their effects upon ventricular remodelling, whether used in isolation or in combination with ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is), are less convincing. Data arising from several recent clinical trials suggest that simultaneous use of ACE-Is and ARBs maybe of more benefit in attenuating ventricular remodelling than either agent alone.", 
    "675": "Animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in preventing left ventricular (LV) remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI). Preliminary human studies are underway, yet no studies have demonstrated efficacy in combination with standard medical therapy, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. Nude rats underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to induce MI. Animals were randomised to receive no treatment (MI, n = 5), quinapril 200 mg/L + metoprolol 2 g/L (ACE/BB, n = 5), two million EPCs intravenously (EPC, n = 5)or both (ACE/BB + EPC [n = 5]), then sacrificed after two weeks treatment. ACE/BB resulted in a 75% reduction in fibrosis in the region remote from the MI (p < 0.05), but EPC therapy had little effect here. Conversely, EPC therapy induced neovascularisation at the peri-infarct rim, thereby preventing peri-infarct apoptosis by 81% (p < 0.05). Acting via different but complementary mechanisms, the combination of ACE/BB + EPCs resulted in a greater overall improvement in LV function on echocardiography than either therapy alone. Clinical trials using stem cell therapy in conjunction with standard medical treatment are warranted.", 
    "676": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of diabetes- related morbidity and mortality; however the clinical course of the disease and the renal prognosis is highly variable among individuals. The current review will discuss the genetic influence on the development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetic patients and potential improvements to the current treatment strategy to slow the loss of kidney function in these patients. In this first part, the growing evidence that glucose-induced activation of the intra-renal and systemic renin-angiotensin systems plays an essential role in processes leading to destruction of renal function is summarised. Genetic variations, especially the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ID polymorphisms in the gene coding for ACE, are involved in activation of the renin-angiotensin system and seem to influence the clinical course of diabetic nephropathy during treatment with ACE inhibitors. In addition, this polymorphism may interact with other polymorphisms within the renin-angiotensin system, leading to high risk of ESRD. As new genetic approaches and methods develop, further understanding of diabetic nephropathy will evolve and genotyping will help prevent ESRD in diabetic patients.",

Left-sided eosinophilic pleurisy was diagnosed based on eosinophilic pleural effusion and peripheral eosinophilia. Soon after administration of imidapril was discontinued, her clinical symptoms subsided, and there was improvement in both diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings. So far, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which ACEI induced eosinophilic pleurisy.", 
    "678": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors interfere with several key events of vascular inflammation resulting in impressive reductions in coronary vascular events. However, in human arteries ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II (AngII) incompletely because of the involvement of alternative pathways in local AngII formation. Therefore, our study concentrated on the presumed modulation by ACE inhibition of local AngII-mediated inflammatory actions by a mechanism independent of blockage of AngII formation. We analyzed the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat on AngII-dependent cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression and adhesion of monocytic THP-1 cells to endothelial cells. AngII induced upregulation of P-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells via activation of AT 1, which was correlated with enhanced THP-1 adhesion in flow chamber assays. Both enhanced adhesion and adhesion molecule expression were significantly reduced by pretreatment with ramiprilat. Ramiprilat reduced AT 1 expression on endothelial cells and decreased the AngII-induced p65 translocation into the nucleus. Diminished AT 1 expression and adhesion molecule expression in response to ramiprilat treatment were partially reversed after incubation with a bradykinin 2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that elevated bradykinin levels under ACE inhibition may be involved in the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors. Thus, modulation of the local AngII system by ramiprilat may at least in part contribute to the benefits of ACE inhibition in the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases.",

    "688": "There is substantial evidence suggesting that angiotensin II plays an important role in elevating blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, despite normal plasma renin activity, and that converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril) can effectively normalize blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. One mechanism by which angiotensin II induces hypertension is via oxidative stress and endothelin, as seen in subpressor angiotensin II-induced hypertension. In fact, it has been shown that antioxidants lower mean arterial pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, the relationship between angiotensin II, oxidative stress, and endothelin in the spontaneously hypertensive rats is still relatively undefined. This study examines the relationship between mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, oxidative stress, and endothelin in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, and the effects of captopril on this association. Untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats had increased plasma angiotensin II levels despite normal plasma renin activity, oxidative stress, and endothelin. Captopril treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered mean arterial pressure, angiotensin II, oxidative stress, and endothelin, and increased plasma renin activity. In contrast, captopril increased plasma renin activity (suggesting effective captopril treatment) but did not significantly alter mean arterial pressure, angiotensin II, oxidative stress, or endothelin of Wistar Kyoto rats. These results suggest that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, angiotensin II is a primary instigator of hypertension, and that captopril selectively lowers angiotensin II, oxidant stress, and endothelin, which in turn may contribute to the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats.",

Levels of CRP and TNF-alpha mRNA were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were performed to identify the cellular sources of CRP and TNF-alpha. Both CRP and TNF-alpha mRNA were expressed in myocardium obtained from DCM patients, but not in controls. A positive correlation was found between CRP and TNF-alpha levels. CRP/TNF-alpha double staining was found to be colocalized in the cardiomyocytes of DCM patients. Both forms of mRNA were also expressed in cardiomyocytes. Both CRP and TNF-alpha mRNA levels were negatively correlated with systolic function and positively correlated with left ventricular volume in DCM patients. These mRNA levels were lower in DCM patients treated with a combination of spironolactone and either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) than in patients not treated with these drugs.",

This may be due to unfamiliarity with the evidence-base for these therapies, the clinical guidelines recommending the use of these treatments or both, as well as concerns regarding adverse events. ACE inhibitors have long been the cornerstone of therapy for systolic HF irrespective of aetiology. Recent trials have now shown that treatment with beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers also leads to substantial improvements in outcome. In order to accelerate the safe uptake of these treatments and to ensure that all eligible patients receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of HF. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists, in order to increase the use of evidenced based therapy for HF. These practical recommendations are meant to serve as a supplement to, rather than replacement of, existing HF guidelines.",

    "708": "PAD has been overlooked in many epidemiologic studies evaluating cardiovascular risk associated with renal disease. Conversely, CKD has not been evaluated as a potential risk factor in epidemiologic studies of PAD. PAD, however,seems to be more prevalent among patients with even moderate CKD than in the general population and is most common among chronic dialysis patients, one third or more of whom have a low ABI. Patients with CKD also seem to be at increased risk for developing claudication and for requiring surgical intervention for lower extremity PAD. Furthermore, even moderate CKD seems to be a risk factor for postoperative death and complications after both lower extremity amputation and revascularization procedures. Conversely, even asymptomatic PAD seems to be a risk factor for death among dialysis patients. In the general population, statins, antiplatelet agents (particularly clopidogrel), antihypertensive agents, and ACE inhibitors all have a proven benefit in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with PAD and in some instances may also reduce PAD events. Available evidence suggests that patients with CKD also experience cardio-vascular risk reduction with statin and ACE-inhibitor therapy, but these therapies have not been shown to reduce PAD events specifically in patients with CKD. Further studies are needed to identify interventions that can specifically reduce the incidence of PAD complications in patientswith CKD. Although it is clear that mortality and complication rates after both lower extremity amputation and revascularization are increased in patients with even moderate CKD, currently available observational studies do not provide clear guidance for surgical decision making in CKD patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risksand benefits of amputation over revascularizationamong patients with CKD and to investigatereasons for the high mortality associated with these procedures in this patient group. Further studies are also needed to measure the impact of CKD on care processes for PAD with the goal of identifying target areas for improvement.",

High-risk features (eg, heart failure, older age) were related to failure to use aspirin and beta-blockers. Being at a teaching hospital and care by a cardiologist were associated with better use of aspirin and beta-blockers. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with failure to use ACE inhibitors and aspirin. When hospitals were divided into quartiles of quality performance, adjusted in-hospital mortality was 4.1% in the top versus 5.6% in the bottom quartile, representing a 27% (95% confidence interval: 11% to 42%) lower relative mortality.",

We selected subjects aged 40 years and older, permanently living in the area during the whole period of the study, who received their first prescription of antihypertensives between January and December 1999, with no prescription of antihypertensive agents in the previous year. For each patient, we documented the starting regimen and evaluated adherence to treatment in terms of persistence during the years (patients were defined persistent if they received at least one prescription per year) and in terms of daily coverage (patients were defined covered if they received an amount of drugs consistent with a daily treatment). Finally, switches or addition of other therapeutic classes during the 3-year period were identified.",

On the basis of previous studies, we have suggested that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) may be a part of the sarcolemmal K(ATP)-channel protein complex. A polypeptide of approximately 42 kDa was immunoprecipitated with an anti-SUR2A antibody from guinea-pig cardiac membrane fraction and identified as GAPDH. Immunoprecipitation/western blotting analysis with anti-Kir6.2, anti-SUR2A and anti-GAPDH antibodies showed that GAPDH is a part of the sarcolemmal K(ATP)-channel protein complex in vivo. Further studies with immunoprecipitation/western blotting and the membrane yeast two-hybrid system showed that GAPDH associates physically with the Kir6.2 but not the SUR2A subunit. Patch-clamp electrophysiology showed that GAPDH regulates K(ATP)-channel activity irrespective of high intracellular ATP, by producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a K(ATP)-channel opener. These results suggest that GAPDH is an integral part of the sarcolemmal K(ATP)-channel protein complex, where it couples glycolysis with the K(ATP)-channel activity.", 
    "722": "Pneumonia is the fourth leading cause of death despite the availability of potent new antimicrobials in Japan. Aspiration of oropharyngeal bacterial pathogens to the lower respiratory tract is one of the most important risk factors for pneumonia. Impairments in swallowing and cough reflexes among disabled older persons, e.g., related to cerebrovascular disease, increase the risk of pneumonia. Thus, strategies to reduce the volumes and pathogenicity of aspirated material should be pursued. Since both swallowing and cough reflexes are mediated by endogenous substance P contained in the vagal and glossopharyngeal nerves, pharmacologic therapy using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which decrease substance P catabolism, can improve both reflexes and result in the lowering of the risk of pneumonia. Similarly, since the production of substance P is regulated by dopaminergic neurons in the cerebral basal ganglia, treatment with dopamine analogs or potentiating drugs such as amantadine can reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Furthermore, since mortality from infections correlates with cutaneous anergy, interventions that reverse these age-associated changes in the immune system are also effective. The main theme of this review is to discuss how pneumonia develops in disabled older people and to suggest preventive strategies that may reduce the incidence of pneumonia among these subjects.",

Currently, we proposed to further investigate whether short-term blood pressure response to benazepril, was modulated by haplotypes re-constructed from both C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in MTHFR gene. A total of 410 hypertensive patients recruited from 344 nuclear families were treated orally with benazepril at a daily dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. In addition, 689 family members of these patients were also genotyped. Among these patients, the frequency of MTHFR A1298C AA, AC and CC genotypes was 74.4%, 23.9%, and 1.7%, respectively. The frequency of MTHFR C677T CC, CT and TT genotypes was 23.7%, 51.2%, and 25.1%, respectively. Only three haplotypes, 677T-1298A (50.8%), 677C-1298A (35.7%), and 677C-1298C (13.5%) were re-constructed. Multivariate regression models with generalized estimating equation (GEE) correction detected that the individuals carrying one copy of haplotype 677C-1298C had significantly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP and DeltaSBP) to benazepril treatment (p= 0.003 and p =0.043, respectively), in comparison to those without haplotype 677C-1298C. The results of family-based association test further confirmed that haplotype 677C-1298C was more frequently transmitted in subjects with either lower residual of DeltaDBP or DeltaSBP. For residual of DeltaDBP, the p-values are 0.007 in an additive model and 0.005 in a dominant model. For residual of DeltaSBP, the p-values are 0.009 in an additive model and 0.006 in a dominant model.

Newborn metabolic screening programs do not include this disorder, although there is a possibility that presymptomatic treatment may attenuate the development of cardiomyopathy. We report a case of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency in a 5-month-old boy who presented with cardiomyopathy and hypotonia. Retrospective analysis of the newborn screening test showed an elevation in the concentration of malonylcarnitine at age 3 days. Unfortunately, this perturbation was missed because the screening test did not routinely measure malonylcarnitine in the newborn blood. Our experience confirms the possibility of screening for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency with tandem mass spectrometry. This finding should enable studies to determine if presymptomatic treatment could change the outcome in this often fatal disorder.",

    "769": "Ventricular remodeling subsequent to myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex process and is considered to be a major determinant of the clinical course of congestive heart failure (CHF). Emerging evidence suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in post-MI ventricular remodeling; however, it is becoming clear that this is one of several neurohumoral systems that are activated in CHF. Blockade of RAS by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists attenuates the ventricular dysfunction, but the effects of individual drugs in reducing the morbidity and mortality in CHF patients are variable. Furthermore, there is a difference of opinion as to the time of initiation of therapy with RAS blockers after the onset of MI. Since blockade of RAS partially improves cardiac function, it is suggested that a combination therapy involving RAS blockers (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists) and agents that affect other neurohumoral systems may prove useful for improved treatment of CHF. Although activation of RAS has been shown to promote oxidative stress in experimental studies, the use of antioxidant therapy in CHF patients is controversial. Recent experimental studies have shown that ventricular remodeling in CHF is associated with remodeling of subcellular organelles such as sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrils and extracellular matrix in terms of their molecular structure and composition. Since attenuation of remodeling in one and/or more subcellular organelles by different agents may prevent the progression of CHF, it is a challenge to develop specific drugs affecting molecular mechanisms associated with subcellular remodeling for the improved therapy of CHF.",

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus there is evidence that intensive glucose lowering therapy diminishes the risk of microvascular complications. In all patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), blood pressure should be lowered irrespectively of the baseline level with either diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, or calcium antagonists. The role of angiotensin II (AT2) receptor blockers has not been established so far. In general terms a global approach to management of patients with vascular risk factors should be developed. An extended follow-up of randomised trials on preventive therapy should be completed. Controlled trials comparing angiotensin receptor blockers with ACE inhibitors should be started. Further research may focus on the new lipid lowering agents, and on the comparison of single lipid lowering agent vs. combinations in stroke prevention. These efforts should help in finding the best vasoprotective strategy in stroke prevention.",

Reference (Zestril, AstraZeneca, UK) and test (Lisotec, Julphar, UAE) products were administered to fasting volunteers on 2 treatment days separated by a 2-week washout period; blood samples were collected at specified time intervals, and the plasma was separated and analysed for lisinopril using a validated LC-MS/MS method at ACDIMA Laboratory. The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0- proportional), C(MAX), T(MAX), T(1/2) and the elimination rate constant were determined from the plasma concentration-time profiles for both formulations and were compared statistically to evaluate bioequivalence between the two brands, using the statistical modules recommended by the FDA. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals fell within the acceptable range for bioequivalence. Based on these statistical inferences it was concluded that the two brands exhibited comparable pharmacokinetic profiles and that Julphar's Lisotec is bioequivalent to Zestril of AstraZeneca, UK.", 
    "777": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a powerful independent risk predictor for cardiovascular disease and reversal of LVH has become a primary goal of antihypertensive management. Recent evidence has confirmed that most hypertensive patients will benefit from a low-dose combination strategy to manage their hypertension, and two trials have recently examined the effect of this strategy on left ventricular mass. The REASON study (pREterax in regression of Arterial Stiffness in a contrOlled double-bliNd study) compared the low-dose combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic with beta-blocker monotherapy in hypertensive patients with LVH, and the PICXEL study (Preterax In a double-blind Controlled study versus Enalapril in LVH) compared the same low-dose combination with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic LVH. The REASON study demonstrated that the low-dose combination produced a significantly greater change in left ventricular mass after 1 year than the beta-blocker, despite inducing a similar change in mean blood pressure. Additionally, perindopril/indapamide reduced central (carotid) and peripheral (brachial) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) to a significantly greater extent than beta-blocker, and these benefits were more pronounced for the central values; LVH is affected more by central rather than peripheral haemodynamic changes. Results of the analysis of the PICXEL study showed a significantly greater decrease in LVH parameters and blood pressure over 1 year in favour of the low-dose combination. This reduction cannot be entirely explained by the better efficacy of the low-dose combination on blood pressure reduction.", 
    "778": "The burden of Type II diabetes is growing rapidly worldwide, across high-, middle- and low-income countries. This burden is associated primarily with increased risks of macrovascular and microvascular diseases, and it is agreed that multifactorial treatment regimens are required to reduce it. ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation) is a large-scale, 2 x 2 factorial, randomised clinical trial. It will investigate the potential benefits of blood pressure lowering, using a fixed low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide vs placebo, and of tighter glucose control, using an intensive gliclazide-MR-based glucose control regimen vs a standard guidelines-based regimen, separately and together. The two primary outcomes are a composite macrovascular end point of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death; and a composite microvascular end point of new or worsening nephropathy or microvascular eye disease. Following successful recruitment and randomisation of 11,140 participants by March 2003, the study is currently half way through its planned follow-up of 4.5 years. Adherence to randomised study treatment is good; and loss to follow-up is minimal. It is hoped that the study will answer a number of unresolved issues. The blood pressure lowering arm will investigate the possible reduction in major vascular disease in patients with Type II diabetes whether or not they have hypertension, and the possible benefits of blood pressure lowering in such patients already receiving background therapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril. The glucose control arm will investigate the possible reduction in both macrovascular and microvascular disease achieved with tighter glucose control, targeting an HbA1c of 6.5% and a fasting blood glucose of 6.0 mmol/l. Finally, the factorial design will enable investigation of the combined effects of more intensive glucose control and tighter control of blood pressure.", 
    "779": "The endothelium is a favourite early target of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases like hypertension. This key role of the endothelium results from its capacity to respond to numerous autocrine and paracrine stimuli and to mechanical factors like shear stress but also from the pathophysiological consequences of endothelial dysfunction on vasomotor tone, arterial stiffness, arterial remodelling, and inflammation, all of which are factors that play a critical role in atherosclerosis and target-organ damage. In hypertension, endothelial dysfunction has been shown at the level of both resistance and conduit arteries and mainly results from an increase in nitric oxide (NO) degradation by interaction between NO and superoxide anions, while in experimental models of hypertension a decrease in NO production can also be observed. The fact that forearm endothelial dysfunction is a marker of future cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension stresses the importance of the clinical evaluation of endothelial function and of the evaluation of the effects of the different antihypertensive drug classes on this parameter. In this context, many studies have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the perindopril-indapamide combination, and angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) blockers improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation partly independently of arterial pressure. Both their antioxidant effects and the stimulation of the release of NO are involved in their beneficial effects. For calcium antagonists, only the recent drugs have been shown to improve endothelial function with a simultaneous improvement in several markers of oxidative stress. Finally, beta-blockers classically do not affect endothelial function. Only nebivolol, a beta-blocker with NO donor properties, has been shown to improve endothelial function, but this effect results from the increase in NO and not from the beta-blocking properties of the drug.", 
    "780": "Type II diabetes and the dysmetabolic syndrome are becoming more and more prevalent, not only in the Western world, but also in many developing countries. The key issue is early prevention and treatment, not only antihyperglycaemic and antihyperlipidaemic treatment, but also, and maybe in particular, antihypertensive treatment. The first issue is first of all screening patients for elevated blood pressure and for microalbuminuria, especially if blood pressure elevation or diabetes is present. Especially, diabetic patients are at risk. The key feature in the therapeutic approach is blocking the renin-angiotensin system, which has proven effective in many original studies. Also the combination with diuretics is a key issue, since these patients have sodium retention. It has been discussed whether ACEi, ARBs or diuretics should be initial treatment, but usually a combination treatment is recommended to reduce blood pressure early and efficiently. The PREMIER study emphasized combination therapy, since the study had very efficient outcomes with combination therapy compared to an ACEi alone as far as blood pressure lowering is concerned, but also with reduction in microalbuminuria and, indeed, end point-reduction. Cardiovascular events showed a decreased incidence with the combination therapy with Preterax (perindopril/indapamide) compared with the enalapril group.", 
    "781": "There is increasing evidence that Angiotensin II (AngII), a major regulator of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation and tissue remodeling, which suggests that this peptide might also play a role in cancer. This review focuses on the expression and function of Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and AngII receptors in various aspects of cancer. Recent experimental data suggests that ACE inhibitors and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists have beneficial effects on tumor progression, vascularization and metastasis, and that the AngII type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype has a potential role in cancer. An overview of the major intracellular signaling pathways associated with AT1R and AT2R activation in cancer cells, as well as in endothelial and inflammatory cells, is presented here.", 
    "782": "The various antihypertensive regimens have varying effects on glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes mellitus. Recent large hypertension trials have shown great differences in the development of new-onset diabetes among antihypertensive drug therapies. The incidence of diabetes is unchanged or increased by thiazide diuretics and b-adrenergic blockers, and unchanged or decreased by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-receptor blockers. The differences in new-onset diabetes mellitus have not influenced the outcome of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in all of the large clinical trials, but drug-induced diabetes among hypertensive patients is known to carry the same cardiovascular risk as that seen in patients with previously known diabetes; however, it might take years for the increased risk to become apparent.", 
    "783": "Since the late 1950s, new-onset diabetes has been a recognized adverse effect of some antihypertensive drugs. Although diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus have changed greatly since then, epidemiologic and physiologic studies suggest that there are differences in glucose tolerance and incident diabetes across antihypertensive drug classes. Data about incident diabetes are now available from 16 long-term, randomized, clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs. From traditional meta-analyses, the rank-ordering of the drug classes is: beta-blocker approximately thiazide diuretic > placebo approximately calcium antagonist > angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor approximately angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Earlier studies indicated that most individuals who developed incident diabetes were \"pre-diabetic\" before beginning antihypertensive therapy, and ipso facto had increased cardiovascular risk compared with individuals with normal glucose tolerance. An earlier diagnosis of diabetes mellitus generally has little impact (over 5 years) on cardiovascular risk. The clinical importance of differential effects of antihypertensive drugs on incident diabetes is, therefore, much less clear.",

Significantly fewer patients receiving irbesartan needed to change their antihypertensive medication. All three study treatments exhibited similar efficacy profiles, but irbesartan had significantly less adverse events.",

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure data showed similar results in both groups without any statistically significant differences between treatments. Both enalapril and nifedipine tended to reduce ICAM-1 and E-selectin, while only nifedipine reduced von Willebrand factor. Both treatments were well tolerated.",

After a 2-week placebo period, 55 mild to moderate hypertensive patients were randomized to manidipine 20 mg o.d. or delapril 30 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks. After this period, 30 patients, aged 30-76 years (18 males and 12 females) whose diastolic blood pressure was not adequately controlled (> or = 90 mmHg) by monotherapy were treated with the fixed combination of manidipine 10 mg plus delapril 30 mg o.d. for 8 weeks. A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recording was performed at the end of the placebo washout, of the monotherapy and of the combination therapy. Blood pressure control over the 24 h was quantified by the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index. As compared to placebo, the fixed combination of manidipine and delapril produced a statistically significant (p<0.01) decrease in sitting clinic (18 +/- 9/14 +/- 5 mmHg) and 24-h blood pressure (12 +/- 7/10 +/- 5 mmHg) without affecting heart rate. This reduction was greater than that observed with single components. At the end of the 8-week combination treatment period, the rate of normalilized patients was 73%. Treatment with the fixed combination was associated with a positively high smoothness index (1.2 +/- 0.7/13.8 +/- 0.8) and with a relatively good trough-to-peak ratio (0.46/0.60). The combination of manidipine and delapril produced significant and smooth reductions in blood pressure values, which persisted over the 24-h dosing interval. These results support the use of fixed manidipine-delapril combination in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertensive patients inadequately controlled by monotherapy.",

Here we present a case of a girl suffering from nephrotic syndrome (NS) in whom unusual healing of glomerular changes appeared. First time the girl was admitted to our department at the age of 4 year with 2 years history of steroid-dependent NS. Kidney biopsy studied in light microscopy revealed 11 glomeruli among which 5 were totally sclerosed and the others showed mesangial proliferation and segmental mesangial matrix expansion. Diffuse interstitial mononuclear cells infiltration was also visible. In fluorescence microscopy only granular C3 and fibrinogen deposits were seen. C3 nephropathy was diagnosed and cyclophosphamide therapy started. As no effects appeared, CsA was introduced together with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril for two years without any relapse during treatment. Prednisone was gradually reduced and finally stopped after a year. On the second biopsy performed to assess CsA nephrotoxicity among 16 glomeruli evaluated in light microscopy only 1 was sclerosed, while the others presented just mild mesangial proliferation. No interstitial changes were found. Fluorescence showed IgA and IgM added to glomerular C3 deposits. CsA was then stopped and after 4 months relapses and steroid-dependency appeared again, so CsA was reintroduced. Actually the girl is 8-year-old, remission of NS has been observed for six months. As a conclusion we would like to suggest that treatment with CsA and ACEI may cause glomerular healing even in a case of advanced glomerulosclerosis.",

ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein with its active site domain exposed to the extracellular surface of endothelial cells and the renal tubular epithelium. Here ACE2 is poised to metabolise circulating peptides which may include angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and the product of angiotensin I cleavage by ACE. To this end, ACE2 may counterbalance the effects of ACE within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, ACE2 has been implicated in the regulation of heart and renal function where it is proposed to control the levels of angiotensin II relative to its hypotensive metabolite, angiotensin-(1-7). The recent solution of the structure of ACE2, and ACE, has provided new insight into the substrate and inhibitor profiles of these two key regulators of the RAS. As the complexity of this crucial pathway is unravelled, there is a growing interest in the therapeutic potential of agents that modulate the activity of ACE2.",

Systemic and glomerular hypertensions together with proteinuria occur in CAN under conditions of JGA hypertrophy with up-regulated RAS activity in the renal allograft, and they represent independent factors of rapid progression of chronic renal allograft failure. ACEi are safe and efficient antihypertensives with renoprotective effects in patients with CAN. Favorable response to ACEi has been reflected in diminished proteinuria, slow increase of creatininemia, regulation of arterial hypertension and better long-term survival of patients and kidney allografts.

    "821": "The ability of angiotensin I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) to induce directly protein degradation in skeletal muscle has been studied in murine myotubes. Angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation with a parabolic dose-response curve and with a maximal effect between 0.05 and 0.1 microM. The effect was attenuated by coincubation with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidaprilat, suggesting that angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation through conversion to Ang II. Angiotensin II also stimulated protein breakdown with a similar dose-response curve, and with a maximal effect between 1 and 2.5 microM. Total protein degradation, induced by both Ang I and Ang II, was attenuated by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin (5 microM) and MG132 (10 microM), suggesting that the effect was mediated through upregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. Both Ang I and Ang II stimulated an increased proteasome 'chymotrypsin-like' enzyme activity as well as an increase in protein expression of 20S proteasome alpha-subunits, the 19S subunits MSS1 and p42, at the same concentrations as those inducing protein degradation. The effect of Ang I was attenuated by imidaprilat, confirming that it arose from conversion to Ang II. These results suggest that Ang II stimulates protein degradation in myotubes through induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Protein degradation induced by Ang II was inhibited by insulin-like growth factor and by the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid. These results suggest that Ang II has the potential to cause muscle atrophy through an increase in protein degradation. The highly lipophilic ACE inhibitor imidapril (Vitortrade mark) (30 mg kg(-1)) attenuated the development of weight loss in mice bearing the MAC16 tumour, suggesting that Ang II may play a role in the development of cachexia in this model.",

The special attention was given to the influence of a combination of teveten and prestarium on morphofunctional performance of the myocardium and vessels, the neurohumoral status, quality of life and survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Our study confirmed that Prestarium or Teveten monotheraphy gives approximately identical result, while their combination have better influence on the quality of life and hemodynamic parameters.

    "823": "We recently reported an involvement of ANG II and the ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor in the hepatic expression of IL-1beta induced in dehydrated rats by LPS. Here, we first confirmed that ANG II and AT1 receptors contribute to the LPS-induced increase in the splenic concentration of IL-1beta in dehydrated rats. We then investigated whether ANG II contributes to IL-1 production through a modulating effect on the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors (NF-kappaB and AP-1) that is induced in the dehydrated rat's liver and spleen by intravenous injection of LPS. Surprisingly, LPS markedly increased the hepatic activation of NF-kappaB, an effect that was significantly enhanced (rather than reduced) by pretreatment with an ANG-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or AT1-receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the same ACE inhibitor and AT1-receptor antagonist each increased the resting NF-kappaB activity in the liver and spleen, although they had no effect on the LPS-induced splenic expression of NF-kappaB. Both hepatic and splenic AP-1 expressions were enhanced by LPS. This response was significantly augmented by pretreatment with the AT1-receptor antagonist (but not with the ACE inhibitor) in the spleen, while in the liver, neither drug had any effect. These results suggest that the endogenous ANG II or AT1 receptor suppresses the activation of hepatic or splenic transcription factors in dehydrated rats given LPS. Our results seem not to support the idea that NF-kappaB and AP-1 play key roles in the ANG II-induced enhancement of the production of proinflammatory cytokines that is induced by LPS in dehydrated rats.", 
    "824": "The effects of iptakalim, a new ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Treatment of 12-week-old male SHR (six animals in each group) with iptakalim by gastric lavage at doses of 1, 3, or 9 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks resulted in a lowering of blood pressure. Iptakalim provided significant renoprotection to SHR rats as measured by decreased proteinuria and improved renal function. Histological evidence demonstrated that iptakalim could reverse renal vascular remodeling (of afferent arterioles, arcuate arteries, or interlobular arteries), and improve pathological changes of glomerular, renal interstitial, and glomerular filtration membranes. These effects were accompanied by the decreased circulation and intrarenal concentrations of endothelin 1 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), and down-regulated overexpression of genes for ET-1, endothelin-converting enzyme 1, TGF-beta1, and the subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)), Kir1.1 and Kir6.1, in the kidney during hypertension. Abnormal expression of matrix components [collagen IV, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP tissue inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1)] was also significantly reversed by iptakalim. Our results demonstrate that chronic treatment with iptakalim not only reduces blood pressure but also preserves renal structure and function in SHR. In addition to reducing blood pressure, the renoprotective of iptakalim may be involved in inhibiting the circulation and intrarenal concentrations of endothelin 1 and TGF-beta1, regulating the expression of K(ATP) genes and correcting MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance in renal tissue, which may result in reducing the accumulation of extracellular matrix molecules.",

The functions of this axis are often opposite to those attributed to the major component of the RAS, angiotensin II. This review will highlight the current knowledge concerning the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin-(1-7) through a direct interaction with its receptor Mas or through an indirect interplay with the kallikrein-kinin system.

Control of blood pressure, of glucose and lipids are needed. If microalbuminuria is present, the administration of a blocker of RAS, even in the presence of normal blood pressure can prevent the progression to diabetic nephropathy.

Among F2-isoprostanes, 15-F2t-IsoP is a vasoconstrictor in animal and human vascular beds. Several recent studies found increased 15-F2t-IsoP levels in animal models of hypertension. However, no data is available on the vascular effect of 15-F2t-IsoP in such models. The contractile responses of 15-F2t-IsoP (10(-9) to 3 x 10(-5) mol/L) were tested on rat thoracic aortic rings in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The contraction induced by 15-F2t-IsoP was not significantly different in aortic rings from WKY rats and SHR (Emax 139% +/- 5% vs. 134% +/- 6%, respectively) and was mediated through thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptor activation as shown by the rightward shift of the concentration-contraction curves in presence of GR 32191, a specific thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist. Endothelial denudation increased the maximal contraction compared to intact rings induced by 15-F2t-IsoP in both WKY rats (170% +/- 20% vs. 139% +/- 5%, p < 0.05) and SHR (194% +/- 11% vs. 134% +/- 6%, p < 0.01), whereas pretreatment with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (10(-4) mol/L) or with indomethacin (10(-5) mol/L) increased the maximal contraction to 15-F2t-IsoP in WKY rats but not in SHR. SHRs treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, for four weeks showed decreased maximal contraction to 15-F2t-IsoP in vessels with and without endothelium compared with untreated SHR. In conclusion, 15-F2t-IsoP-induced vasoconstriction is similar in SHR compared with WKY rats. Endothelium modulates 15-F2t-IsoP contraction in both strains. However, whereas this effect is mediated through nitric oxide- and cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways in WKY rats, other mediators are implicated in SHR.", 
    "838": "Stroke is a major cause of death and disability and its incidence increases linearly with age and the level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Stroke, besides being a cause of long-term disability for the affected person, also imposes a significant burden on society and healthcare costs. Although good blood pressure control is very critical for stroke prevention, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be superior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for the same degree of blood pressure control. This hypothesis has clinical and experimental support. ARBs prevent stroke incidence by blocking the angiotensin II (AII), AT1 receptors preventing brain ischaemia and allowing AII to stimulate the unoccupied AT2 receptors, which improve brain ischaemia. ACEIs, by reducing AII generation, are less effective in preventing stroke. This hypothesis provides evidence that AII plays an important role in the prevention of stroke. Certain ARBs like losartan, and telmisartan, irbesartan and candesartan possess additional properties which may play a role in stroke prevention, which is independent of AII. These include antiplatelet aggregating, hypouricemic, antidiabetic and atrial antifibrillatory effects. However, the most critical factor in stroke prevention is good blood pressure control irrespective of drug used.", 
    "839": "Lung Kr\u00fcppel-like factor (LKLF/KLF2) is an endothelial transcription factor that is crucially involved in murine vasculogenesis and is specifically regulated by flow in vitro. We now show a relation to local flow variations in the adult human vasculature: decreased LKLF expression was noted at the aorta bifurcations to the iliac and carotid arteries, coinciding with neointima formation. The direct involvement of shear stress in the in vivo expression of LKLF was determined independently by in situ hybridization and laser microbeam microdissection/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a murine carotid artery collar model, in which a 4- to 30-fold induction of LKLF occurred at the high-shear sites. Dissection of the biomechanics of LKLF regulation in vitro demonstrated that steady flow and pulsatile flow induced basal LKLF expression 15- and 36-fold at shear stresses greater than approximately 5 dyne/cm2, whereas cyclic stretch had no effect. Prolonged LKLF induction in the absence of flow changed the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-1, adrenomedullin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase to levels similar to those observed under prolonged flow. LKLF repression by siRNA suppressed the flow response of endothelin-1, adrenomedullin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P < 0.05). Thus, we demonstrate that endothelial LKLF is regulated by flow in vivo and is a transcriptional regulator of several endothelial genes that control vascular tone in response to flow.",

All reports should be considered as preliminary data, as analyses may change in the final publication. The erythropoiesis stimulating protein, darbepoetin alfa, increased haemoglobin levels, improved quality of life and showed a trend for improved exercise duration in anaemic patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure. In the ECHOS study, the selective dopamine agonist nolomirole (CHF1035) showed no benefit in heart failure patients. Preliminary results of the ASCOT-BPLA study, which were reported at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2005, showed that in hypertensive patients, treatment with a calcium antagonist plus an ACE inhibitor was more effective at reducing cardiovascular outcomes than atenolol plus a diuretic.", 
    "841": "IgA nephropathy associated with heavy proteinuria is considered a more progressive form of this disease. In this report, we describe the favorable clinical effect of combination therapy with low doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in the chronic stage of pediatric IgA nephropathy associated with heavy proteinuria.", 
    "842": "We initially used ACEI for seven children with IgA nephropathy and heavy proteinuria who did not achieve remission with the routine treatment including steroids.", 
    "843": "With ACEI therapy alone, only three patients showed an antiproteinuric response. In one of the three patients, the proteinuria decreased by half, but was still over 1 g/day. In the other four patients, the proteinuria did not decrease. In these five patients, of whom one partial was a responder and four were non-responders for ACEI, ARB was added, and in marked contrast to ACEI therapy alone, the antiproteinuric effect was significantly augmented (p < 0.01). The antiproteinuric response induced by combination therapy was not accompanied by blood pressure changes. Urinary low-molecular protein and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels tended to decrease after both ACEI alone and combination therapy.", 
    "844": "These data indicate that inhibition therapy of the angiotensin system not only decreases proteinuria levels but also protects renal tubular cells. Moreover, there were no obvious side effects associated with this therapy during the follow-up period of our clinical trial. In conclusion, this report shows that the combination of low doses of ACEI and ARB might provide marked antiproteinuric and long-term renoprotective effects in pediatric IgA nephropathy, with this approach appearing to be both well-tolerated and safe.", 
    "845": "Many studies show that the extent of the nocturnal blood-pressure decline is deterministic of cardiovascular injury and risk. Accordingly, there is growing interest in how to tailor the treatment of hypertensive patients according to their circadian blood-pressure pattern.", 
    "846": "Differences in efficacy depending on the time of day of drug administration lead to differences in effects of antihypertensive drugs on the nocturnal decline relative to the diurnal mean of blood pressure. Thus, bedtime dosing with nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is more effective than morning dosing, while also reducing significantly secondary effects. Bedtime administration of trandolapril results in a safe and effective means of controlling morning blood pressure without inducing excessive reduction nocturnally. The dose-response curve, therapeutic coverage, and efficacy of doxazosin GITS are all markedly dependent on the circadian time of drug administration. Moreover, valsartan administration at bedtime as opposed to upon wakening results in improved day/night blood-pressure ratio, a significant increase in the percentage of controlled patients after treatment, and a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "847": "Nocturnal hypertension increases one's risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, nephrosclerosis, and progression to end-stage kidney failure in renal patients. Normalization of the circadian blood-pressure pattern is considered an important clinical goal of pharmacotherapy because it may slow the advance of renal injury. Chronotherapy provides a means of individualizing treatment of hypertension according to the circadian blood-pressure profile of each patient, and constitutes a new option in optimizing blood-pressure control and reducing risk.", 
    "848": "Despite the large number of antihypertensive drugs available, their usefulness is limited due to low efficacy, side effects, poor patient compliance and failure to reduce the cardiovascular risk to the level of the general population. These limitations have stimulated the research and development of new antihypertensive drugs, which we briefly review herein.", 
    "849": "Novel antihypertensive drugs under development include new oral renin inhibitors, brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 modulators, short-acting L-type Ca channel blockers, new T-type Ca channel blockers, inhibitors of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme crosslink breakers, Rho kinase inhibitors, renal Na/K ATPase inhibitors, potassium channel openers and drugs combining different mechanisms of action.", 
    "850": "Essential hypertension is a multifactorial and multigenic disorder, which means that various mechanisms contribute to a greater or lesser extent to increasing blood pressure. Drugs combining several mechanisms of action or combinations of antihypertensive drugs with those targeting other risk factors may offer an alternative to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. As we improve our understanding of essential hypertension, it should be possible to develop safer and more effective antihypertensive drugs. The risk/benefit ratio of these new existing antihypertensive drugs will require long-term endpoint assessment studies.",

    "852": "We followed 185 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and with or without signs of overt renal disease for at least 3 years, median 5.1 (3-6.8) years. Each patient had a baseline visit and at least four follow-up visits (average 4.8+/-0.3). Cases were patients who were smoking (n = 44) at the time the survey was started. Controls were patients who had never smoked (n = 141). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the MDRD formula. Multiple logistic regression was used to correct for confounding factors.", 
    "853": "At baseline, smokers were younger (47+/-14 vs 54+/-16 years, P < 0.01), and had a lower GFR (95+/-26 ml/min) than non-smokers (107+/-33 ml/min, P < 0.05). Mean GFR remained constant during follow-up in non-smokers (106+/-31 ml/min), but decreased significantly in smokers (83+/-22 ml/min, P < 0.0001), and this relationship persisted when adjusted for retinopathy, glycaemic control, age, body habitus, ACE-inhibitor treatment, blood pressure control or severity of proteinuria. The effect of smoking on GFR decline was stronger in patients with type 1 diabetes or male gender.", 
    "854": "Cigarette smoking causes a decrease in GFR in diabetic patients with normal or near-normal renal function, independent of confounding factors including severity of proteinuria. The latter finding suggests a mechanism independent of glomerular damage.",

Procollagen type III aminoterminal peptide (PIIIP), and procollagen type IV aminoterminal peptide (PIVP) levels in serum as well as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) level in plasma were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) before and 6 months after the treatment. Doppler ultrasound recordings were obtained from all patients before and 6 months after the treatment to determine several parameters related to the left ventricular anatomy and function.", 
    "857": "After 6 month of treatment, the mean blood pressure (MBP), PIIIP, PIVP, TGFbeta1, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), interventricular spectum dimension (IVSD), and left ventricular posterio wall dimension (LPWD) in the 2 groups were significantly lower than those before the treatment. TGFbeta1 decreased in the simvastatin and benazepril group compared with the benazepril group (P < 0.01). The ratio of early diastolic blood flow velocity of mitral valve (VE) and blood flow velocity of atrium systolic period (VA) in the 2 groups significantly increased after 6 months of treatment, and the ratio in the simvastatin and benazepril group was significantly higher than that in the enazepril group (P < 0.05).",

    "859": "A high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported among idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. We examined the prevalence of DCM patients with HCV antibody, and the pathophysiological characteristics and responsiveness to neurohormonal antagonism in DCM with HCV. HCV antibodies were determined in 540 patients with cardiac diseases. In 117 DCM patients, clinicopathologic data were evaluated before and 1 year after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta-blocker (ACE-inhibitor/BB) administration and their prognosis was followed-up for a mean of 72 +/- 41 months. HCV antibodies were found in 12 of 135 DCM patients (8.9%) and in 37 of 405 patients without DCM (9.1%) (P = NS). At baseline, contrary to DCM without HCV, DCM with HCV was associated (P < 0.05) with greater left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimension, LV mass, and myocardial diameter in endomyocardial biopsy, and lower % fractional shortening. By multivariate analysis, HCV infection was independently associated with larger LV end-systolic dimension among DCM patients (P = 0.005). The advanced LV dilatation and hypertrophy in DCM with HCV decreased more in response to the ACE-inhibitor/BB therapy compared to DCM without HCV. There were no differences between DCM patients with and without HCV in survival and cardiac event-free rates. In summary, although HCV infection appears not to be the specific cause of DCM, HCV may enhance ventricular remodeling leading to heart failure among DCM patients. Nevertheless, the advanced ventricular remodeling with HCV was adequately reversed by neurohormonal antagonism, and did not lead to an unfavorable outcome.",

The incidence of angioedema was higher after initiation of therapy (3.6/1000 patients per month) and declined to 0.4/1000 patients per month. Treatment was not given in 44 (51%) of the cases; antihistamines were administered in 35 (41%); corticosteroids, in 20 (23%); and epinephrine, in 1 (1%). Two patients were hospitalized but none had airway compromise.",

The adjusted likelihood of receiving early (within 24 hours of presentation) aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was higher in patients with STEMI. Similar patterns of care were noted at hospital discharge: the adjusted likelihood of receiving aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, smoking cessation counseling, and cardiac rehabilitation referral was higher in patients with STEMI.", 
    "867": "Evidence-based medications and lifestyle modification interventions were used less frequently in patients with NSTEMI. Quality improvement interventions designed to narrow the gaps in care between NSTEMI and STEMI and to improve adherence to guidelines for both categories of patients with MI may reduce the high mortality rates associated with acute MI in contemporary practice.",

    "872": "Low-affinity state beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1-AR) was functionally expressed in some blood vessels and was different from beta1, beta2 and beta3-AR. In rat aorta, low-affinity state beta1-AR activation produced an endothelium-independent relaxation which was impaired in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the present work, we investigated whether renin-angiotensin system was involved in this alteration by evaluating the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or losartan, an AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist. Cumulative concentration-response curves to low-affinity state beta1-AR agonists (CGP 12177, cyanopindolol or alprenolol) and to NS 1619, a large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK) agonist were performed in denuded aortic rings isolated from control or treated Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats or SHRs in different experimental conditions. The low-affinity state beta1-AR-mediated aortic vasodilation was impaired in 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs when compared to age-matched WKY. Twelve days enalapril (5 mg/kg/day) or losartan (15 mg/kg/day) treatments reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) only in 12 weeks old SHRs whereas no significant change was observed in other groups. These treatments improved low-affinity state beta1-AR effect only in SHRs groups. In 12 weeks old WKY rats, CGP 12177-induced relaxation was insensitive to glibenclamide, a K(ATP)+ channel blocker, but was reduced by TEA or iberiotoxin, two large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK) blockers. The impairment of NS 1619-induced vasodilation in both 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs was restored by enalapril or losartan. These results suggested that improvement of the low-affinity state beta1-AR-mediated vasodilation in 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs could be attributed to enhanced BK channels-induced hyperpolarization in SHRs independently of lowering of SBP.", 
    "873": "Hemopressin is a novel vasoactive nonapeptide derived from hemoglobin's alpha-chain as recently reported by Rioli et al.

J Biol Chem 2003;278(10):8547-55]. In anesthetized male Wistar rats, this peptide exhibited hypotensive actions similar to those of bradykinin (BK) when administered intravenously (i.v.), and was found to be metabolized both in vitro and in vivo by several peptidases, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In this study, these findings were expanded upon by examining: (i) the degradation kinetics following incubation with ACE purified from rabbit lung and (ii) the blood pressure lowering effects of HP and BK injected i.v. or intra-arterially (i.a.) in male rabbits, rats, and mice. Our findings demonstrate that, in vitro, HP and BK are both degraded by ACE, but at different velocity rates. Furthermore, both HP and BK induced transient hypotension in all animals tested, although the responses to HP relative to the administration sites were significantly lower (by 10-100-fold) on an equimolar basis compared to those of BK. In rabbits, the decrease of blood pressure induced by HP (10-100 nmol/kg) did not differ whether it was administered i.v. or i.a., suggesting an absence of pulmonary/cardiac inactivation in contrast to BK (0.1-1 nmol/kg). The in vivo effect of HP was significantly potentiated in rabbits immunostimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but was unaffected by both the B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (0.1 micromol/kg) and captopril (100 microg/kg), contrary to BK. Therefore, HP acts as a weak hypotensive mediator, which does not activate kinin B2 receptors, but uses a functional site and/or signaling paths appearing to be up-regulated by LPS.", 
    "874": "Hypertension frequently accompanies diabetes mellitus, as it is present in 50% of diabetic patients. Hypertension can sometimes preceed diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance plays a major role in the hypertensive risk. In type 1 diabetes, nephropathy is often noted as soon as hypertension is present. Both hypertension and diabetes increase the risk for cardiovascular and renal complications. For their prevention, first of all, modification of the diet with increasing exercise must be proposed, associated to antihypertensive agents with a blood pressure target lower than 130/80 mmHg. Renin-angiotensin blockers constitute the main drug therapy in such patients associated with diuretics or betablocker if angina pectoris is present or even calcium channel blocker when large arteries abnormalities exist.

ABI was evaluated both continuously and as peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (-) and PAD (+) using the cutoff of 0.9. Statistical analyses were performed with consideration of covariates and the use of ACEI/ARB. Results showed that in patients not using ACEI/ARB, ln (ACR) negatively correlated with ABI (r = -0.261, p < 0.01) and was associated with ABI with adjusted regression coefficient of -0.0213 (p < 0.05). PAD patients had a significantly higher level of ln (ACR) than those without PAD (4.83+/-1.34 vs 3.73+/-1.29, p < 0.001) and PAD prevalence was significantly higher in those with albuminuria than in those with normoalbuminuria (22.6% vs 4.9%, p < 0.001). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for PAD for every 1 unit increment of ln (ACR) was 2.10 (1.31-3.38), and for albuminuria vs normoalbuminuria 3.86 (1.04-14.31) in patients not using ACEI/ARB.

In this work, a recombinant D-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used to transform 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid (OPBA) to R-HPBA, with concomitant oxidation of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD(+). The cofactor NADH was regenerated by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) present in whole cells of Candida boidinii, which were pre-treated with toluene to make them permeable. The whole cells used in the process were more stable and easier to prepare as compared with the isolated FDH from the cells. Kinetic study showed that the reaction rate was dependent on the concentration of cofactor, NAD(+), and that both R-HPBA and OPBA inhibited the reaction. A novel method for co-immobilization of whole cells and LDH enzyme on cotton cloth was developed using polyethyleneimine (PEI), which induced the formation of PEI-enzyme-cell aggregates and their adsorption onto cotton cloth, leading to multilayer co-immobilization of cells and enzyme with high loading (0.5 g cell and 8 mg LDH per gram of cotton cloth) and activity yield ( > 95%). A fibrous bed bioreactor with co-immobilized cells and enzyme on the cotton cloth was then evaluated for R-HPBA production in fed-batch and repeated batch modes, which gave relatively stable reactor productivity of 9 g/L . h and product yield of 0.95 mol/mol OPBA when the concentrations of OPBA and R-HPBA were less than 10 g/L.",

Protein modifications, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), serve as footprints of biochemical processes and also help in the search for novel agents that efficiently inhibit protein damage. Interestingly, several medical agents that are used clinically interfere with oxidative protein damage through different mechanisms characteristic of their chemical structures. We recently found that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) lower the in vitro formation of the AGEs pentosidine and carboxymethyllysine. Their inhibition for AGE formation is more striking than aminoguanidine. Unlike aminoguanidine, ARBs and ACEIs do not trap reactive carbonyl precursors of AGEs. Rather, they inhibit AGE formation, possibly as a result of their potent ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals and to chelate the transition metals necessary for the Fenton reaction. We tested their AGE-lowering ability in vivo in a unique type-2 diabetic model with nephropathic SHR/NDmcr-cp rats, which exhibits the metabolic syndrome (obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia) in addition to hypertension. Obesity and associated metabolic derangements, in addition to hypertension, markedly accelerate renal injury. Expectedly, correction of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia partially but significantly improves renal injury. A low-calorie diet greatly improves renal injury despite persistent hypertension. Among antihypertensive agents, ARBs, unlike nifedipine and atenolol, are renoprotective despite persistent metabolic syndrome, but their action is independent of blood pressure lowering and is observed in a dose-dependent manner despite the complete blockade of angiotensin II receptor. Interestingly, the improvement of renal injury by ARBs as well as a low-calorie diet is associated with a significant reduction in local oxidative stress and AGE formation in the kidney. During the characterization of the AGE-lowering profile of our chemical compound libraries ( approximately 2000), we identified several inhibitors of oxidative stress and advanced glycation. They are indeed renoprotective, independently of correction of hypertension and metabolic syndrome, in experimental diabetic nephropathy and other nephritis models. Altogether, our data are in good agreement with the recent therapeutic concept for diabetic nephropathy that multiple risk factor interventions are critical in the treatment of diabetic renal injury, and further implicate a therapeutic potential of inhibition of oxidative stress and advanced glycation.",

    "894": "The study comprised 914 participants aged 50 to 75 years recruited by their general practitioner during a general health examination. All participants and their physicians were asked to fill out a standardized questionnaire which contained information on socio-demographic and lifestyle factors as well as medical history. Native stool was examined for pancreatic elastase-1 with a commercially available ELISA (ScheBo Tech, Giessen, Germany).", 
    "895": "Overall, 524 women and 390 men aged 50 to 75 years (mean age 61.9 years) were included in the analysis. In total, 105 (11.5%) of the 914 subjects showed signs of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with =200 microg elastase-1/g stool, and 47 (5.1%) subjects showed signs of a severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (SEPI, < 100 microg elastase-1/g stool). There was a clear increase in EPI with age. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had a lower prevalence than subjects without this medication; these associations persisted after adjustment for covariates.", 
    "896": "Prevalence of EPI increases with age and seems to be tentatively higher in men than in women. However, smoking seems to be an independent risk factor for EPI and SEPI whereas ACE-inhibitor intake might be a protective factor. The latter finding may even point to new options in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis.", 
    "897": "We have evaluated the effects of different doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril (ENA) and of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan (OLM), on extracellular matrix of the heart, kidney, aorta and mesenteric artery of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Forty SHR and eight Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY) were included in the study. Eight SHR were treated with high-dose OLM 15 mg/kg per day, eight with high-dose ENA 25 mg/kg per day, eight with low-dose OLM 1 mg/kg per day and eight with low-dose ENA (2 mg/kg per day). Eight SHR and eight WKY were kept untreated as controls. Treatment was from age 4 to 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured non-invasively every week. The left ventricular weight to body weight (RLVM) was measured, and the cardiac, aortic and glomerular interstitial collagen content was evaluated using Sirius red staining and image analysis. Mesenteric small arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph, and the media:lumen ratio (M/L) was calculated. Collagen subtypes were evaluated by polarized light microscopy. The SHR treated with high-dose OLM or ENA showed a normalization of SBP. The RLVM was significantly increased in untreated SHR compared with untreated WKY, whereas significantly lower values were observed in the groups of SHR treated with high-dose OLM or ENA. A significant increase in cardiac and glomerular collagen content was observed in untreated SHR. Both high- or low-dose OLM and ENA normalized collagen content in the heart and the kidney. Both high-dose OLM and high-dose ENA normalized M/L ratio; however, OLM proved to be more effective than ENA in normalizing collagen pattern. In fact, aortic collagen content was normalized by both high-dose and low-dose OLM, but only by high-dose ENA. In conclusion, both OLM and ENA were significantly and equally effective in the prevention of cardiac and renal damage in SHR, whereas OLM was more effective than ENA in terms of effects on vascular extracellular matrix.", 
    "898": "This study compared the use of antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure (BP) controls between patients with diabetic kidney disease (DK+) and patients with non-diabetic kidney disease (DK-) exhibiting moderate-to-severe chronic renal failure who did not need renal replacement therapy. A cross-sectional survey included all renal patients with s-creatinine at ?200 micromol/l attending regular control sessions at six renal units in Norway. Of the 351 patients included, 73 (20.8%) were DK+. The proportion reaching a BP goal of <130/80 mmHg was similar in DK+ and DK- (14.1% vs 13.6%, p = 0.92), while 38% and 39% achieved a BP of <140/90 mmHg, respectively. The systolic BP goal was more difficult to achieve than the diastolic BP goal in DK+ patients (35% vs 15%) despite a mean of three different types of drugs being used. Loop diuretics and beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists were the most frequently prescribed drugs, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists declined when renal function deteriorated, from 80% to 0% and from 66% to 20% in the DK+ and DK- groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Thus, despite the use of multiple antihypertensive drugs, controlling BP - especially the systolic BP - is difficult in high-risk patients with chronic renal failure caused by diabetic kidney disease.", 
    "899": "Hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) often occur simultaneously and the combination requires vigorous control of hypertension. This can generally be achieved by a combination of antihypertensive drugs.

    "900": "Rats were divided into four groups as follows: group I served as control; group II--LU-135252 30 mg/kg/day; group III--trandolapril 0.1 mg/kg/day and group IV--both LU-135252 30 mg/kg/day and trandolapril 0.1 mg/kg/day. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and plasma glucose levels were evaluated at the beginning of the experiment and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks.", 
    "901": "SBP decreased significantly in all treated groups after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Maximum decrease was in group IV (combination) from 174.8+/-3.7 to 136.1+/-2.4 mmHg (22%) (p<0.0001); in group III (trandolapril) from 165.8+/-2.7 to 137.5+/-2.9 mmHg (17%) (p=0.0002); and in group II (LU-135252) and from 169.1+/-3.1 to 147.8+/-2.5 mmHg (12%) (p=0.0004). Glucose levels in plasma decreased significantly after 6 weeks of treatment. Maximum decrease was in group IV: from 501.0+/-42.8 to 178.6+/-7.3 mg/dl (62%) (p<0.0001); in group III from 428.2+/-47.7 to 146.8+/-5.6 mg/dl (63%) (p<0.0001); and in group II from 491.2+/-39.3 to 272.2+/-28.3 mg/dl (42%) (p=0.0002).", 
    "902": "The SBP decrease was additive when both drugs were given together. Thus, combination of ETA antagonist and ACE inhibitor appears to offer a rational fixed-dose antihypertensive therapy, which is superior to that of either drug alone. The decrease in glucose level, which was the least impressive while on LU-135252 alone, was more prominent during combination after 2 weeks, although without further decrease.",

    "906": "Elderly (70--84 years) patients (n=303) with a systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (or=180 and/or 105 mmHg).", 
    "907": "Costs for patient management were analyzed and categorized in costs for routine care (protocol-driven costs, PDC), costs for extra visits or care (non-protocol-driven costs, NPDC), and direct drug costs (drug treatment costs, DTC). All calculations are related to costs during the first year of treatment after inclusion in STOP Hypertension-2.", 
    "908": "Out of the scheduled visits, a total of 99% were actually performed by the patients. There were no differences in the number of visits between the three treatment groups (diuretics/beta-blockers, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors). PDC did thus not differ between the three treatment groups. NPDC were similar in the conventional and calcium antagonist groups and lower than for the ACE inhibitor group. DTC were lower in the conventional treatment group compared with the other two groups. CONCLUSION. In elderly hypertensives in STOP Hypertension-2, total costs for management of hypertension were lower in patients assigned to diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists compared with ACE inhibitors during the first year of treatment. These results may be relevant to management of elderly hypertensive patients, especially in those patients without compelling indications or contraindications to starting treatment with either of these three main drug alternatives. Notably, with a specific drug regimen there are sizable NPDC such as extra visits and controls associated with symptoms or side-effects of a specific therapy, which significantly add to the total costs of treatment. Such costs, beyond the actual costs for the drugs, are important to realize and evaluate in order to provide the true costs for treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "909": "Overwhelming clinical trial evidence confirms the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) caused by systolic dysfunction. beta-Blockers are recommended in national HF guidelines as standard of care therapy. Yet there is also a large body of evidence demonstrating that the use of beta-blockers for HF is seriously inadequate under conventional care. This HF treatment gap is due, in part, to the persistence of perceptions--despite recent evidence to the contrary--that beta-blocker therapy should be delayed until HF patients have been titrated to target doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and have been stable for at least 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge, and that early beta-blocker initiation results in a substantial risk of worsening HF. Conversely, recent clinical trial evidence substantiates that beta-blockers significantly reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity, including hospitalization for worsening HF, and have produced early survival benefits in patients with HF. It has also become evident that in-hospital initiation of life-prolonging cardiovascular therapies, including beta-blockers, has a positive impact on clinical outcomes and on long-term patient compliance. Overwhelming clinical evidence suggests that beta-blockers should be administered to all stable HF patients without contraindication and that this therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to ensure that patients derive early and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes.", 
    "910": "Although the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers has resulted in significant improvements in the management of heart failure (HF), morbidity and mortality remain high. Therefore, additional approaches have been sought to discover newer agents that might add incremental benefit. Although not all of these approaches have been successful, there have been some notable new approaches to therapy that have shown benefit or may be promising in terms of additional benefit. Most of these agents are targeted to achieve a more global neurohormonal blockade aiming to reduce or potentially reverse the ventricular remodeling process that occurs in HF. Some of the newer approaches aim for targets other than neurohormonal systems, eg, effects on myocardial metabolism or the vasculature. This article reviews the latest advances in pharmacologic therapy in HF, looking at several trials that may have a significant impact on the treatment of HF. We also discuss several newer agents with promising potential in HF management.", 
    "911": "Retrospective analyses of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and Vasodilator Heart Failure Trials (V-HeFT) have addressed the question of whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are equally efficacious in black patients and white patients with heart failure. In SOLVD, there was no ethnic difference in the efficacy of enalapril for reducing mortality and preventing the development of heart failure, but enalapril was more effective in whites in reducing hospitalizations. In V-HeFT II, enalapril was more efficacious than the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in whites in reducing mortality, but not in blacks. However, the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine may be particularly advantageous in black patients as suggested by V-HeFT I and the recent African American Heart Failure Trial. In aggregate, the available data suggest that ACE inhibitors should remain a cornerstone of therapy for heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction in white patients and black patients.", 
    "912": "The neurohormonal hypothesis for the pathogenesis of heart failure found an early champion in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. More recently, the beta-blockers and aldosterone receptor antagonists have provided significant support by demonstrating marked additive clinical benefit. Within this context, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were specifically designed to antagonize one of the most potent contributors to the development and progression of heart failure, angiotensin. This review discusses the recent evidence for the addition of ARBs to standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and suggests how this evidence may be used to care for patients.", 
    "913": "Over the past few years, anemia has emerged as a powerful independent predictor of adverse outcomes in chronic heart failure (CHF). It affects up to 50% of patients with CHF, depending on the definition of anemia used and on the population studied. Even small reductions in hemoglobin are associated with worse outcome. However, the causes of anemia in CHF remain unclear, although impairment of renal function and inflammatory cytokines are proposed mechanisms. Both may act through impairment of the synthesis or action of erythropoietin. Preliminary studies have demonstrated improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and reductions in hospitalizations when patients with severe CHF were treated with erythropoietin. The benefits and the potential risks of such therapies will be further addressed in upcoming larger randomized trials. The recent interest in anemia reflects a new perspective in heart failure therapy, focusing on non-cardiovascular comorbidities.", 
    "914": "The importance of addressing neurohormonal activation in patients after a myocardial infarction is now well-appreciated. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and the sympathetic nervous system can result in improved cardiac function and survival. As we learn more about other systems, we should be able to realize further benefits. In particular, the roles of endothelin, matrix metalloproteinases, and cytokines in remodeling are being investigated, with the potential to result in better outcomes for patients.", 
    "915": "Worsening and progressive heart failure has been the most common mode of death in patients with heart failure. With the development of drugs that primarily have modulation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems as their mechanism, relative importance of progressive heart failure has decreased. Sudden death has become a larger issue and the dominant mode of death in heart failure. This change requires the clinician to redirect therapy to the prevention and treatment of sudden death.", 
    "916": "Therapies that modulate the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. However, they are grossly underused in clinical practice; when used, the doses prescribed are substantially smaller than the target doses used in the large-scale studies that established their utility. Whether these suboptimal doses are as effective in reducing morbidity and mortality is largely unknown. This review focuses on the relationship between the dose of b-blockers and their effect on clinical outcomes. Because direct dose comparisons of b-blockers are limited, we draw upon a broader spectrum of clinical trials across the cardiovascular continuum that involved neurohormonal modulators to address the question, \"Is more better?\"", 
    "917": "Deactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is clearly beneficial in patients with recent myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Most of the experience with deactivation of the RAAS has been collected in placebo-controlled randomized trials of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI). The hypothesis that angiotensin receptor blockade may be a better approach to deactivate the RAAS has not survived the test of time. Despite the extensive experience with ACEI and aldosterone receptor blockade in patients with recent myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure, several issues remain unanswered. These are addressed in this review.", 
    "918": "Results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study and the Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study indicate aldosterone receptor antagonism, together with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and loop diuretics, is a most effective strategy in reducing risk for all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Responsible mechanisms are likely multifactoral. As a circulating hormone, aldosterone has well-known endocrine properties that contribute to the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure. This includes Na+ resorption at the expense of K+ excretion in such tissues as kidneys, colon, sweat, and salivary glands. Mg2+ excretion at these sites is likewise enhanced by aldosterone, whereas adrenal aldosterone secretion is regulated by extracellular Mg2+. Other endocrine actions of aldosterone receptor-ligand binding include: a reduction in biologically active cytosolic-free Mg2+, with intracellular Ca2+ loading in nonepithelial cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells; its influence on endothelial cell function; and its central actions, including the choroid plexus, activity of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and autonomic nervous system. De novo generation of aldosterone within the cardiovasculature is recognized and findings suggest its auto/paracrine properties contribute to tissue repair. Each of these actions is interrupted by aldosterone receptor antagonism and therefore may contribute to its salutary response in heart failure.", 
    "919": "Therapy for heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction is based on interference with maladaptive activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Agents that block beta-adrenergic receptors, decrease angiotensin-II formation, and antagonize the effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone have been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in this syndrome. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, it would be desirable to actually diminish the degree of overactivity of these two homeostatic systems. There are compelling physiologic arguments and much experimental data to suggest that beta-adrenergic blockade may diminish activity of the RAAS. Conversely, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, and aldosterone antagonists may diminish activity of the SNS. Some clinical trials data may be interpreted in a fashion that suggests that part of the benefit of interfering with each system may relate to diminishing activity of the other. If true, combined therapy may lead to a virtuous cycle in which diminishing the adverse effects of each individual system is combined with reduced activity of the other. Such a cycle may be one factor underlying the impressive clinical results of recent neurohormonally based therapeutic trials and reinforces the need to look beyond acute hemodynamic effects of therapeutic agents when assessing their long-term impact in heart failure.", 
    "920": "This review examines the clinical benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with severe heart failure symptoms and interventricular conduction delay. The magnitude of CRT effects on exercise duration, quality of life, and reversal of adverse remodeling are compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy and combined beta-blocker/ACE inhibitor therapy. Overall, CRT delivers substantial improvement in clinical well-being to an extent similar to or greater than what would be expected with neurohormonal intervention alone.", 
    "921": "Clinical research during the past several decades has shown the importance of cardiac remodeling as a basic mechanism in the progression of heart failure. Changes in cardiac remodeling have high concordance with long-term clinical outcomes. Cardiac remodeling should be regarded as a primary target for treatment and also can serve as a reliable surrogate for clinical outcomes. Neurohormonal blockade with combination treatments that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic systems has proven effective in improving cardiac remodeling and clinical outcomes. Such treatment should be standard therapy for patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction and patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "922": "Diabetic nephropathy, or diabetic kidney disease, affects 20 to 30 percent of patients with diabetes. It is a common cause of kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy presents in its earliest stage with low levels of albumin (microalbuminuria) in the urine. The most practical method of screening for microalbuminuria is to assess the albumin-to-creatinine ratio with a spot urine test. Results of two of three tests for microalbuminuria should be more than 30 mg per day or 20 mcg per minute in a three- to six-month period to diagnose a patient with diabetic nephropathy. Slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy can be achieved by optimizing blood pressure (130/80 mm Hg or less) and glycemic control, and by prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Patients with diabetes and isolated microalbuminuria or hypertension benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In the event that these medications cannot be prescribed, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be considered. Serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored carefully for patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. These medications should be stopped if hyperkalemia is pronounced.", 
    "923": "Diabetic patients frequently develop heart failure and have a guarded prognosis because of the combination of diabetic cardiomyopathy, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. The lack of patient awareness of the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease contributes to the risk of heart failure in the diabetic population. Therefore, physicians should consider the risk of comorbidities and use appropriate screening tests to achieve early identification and initiate preventive strategies. There is evidence suggesting that adequate glycaemic control may improve cardiac metabolism and myocardial function in diabetics with heart failure. Improvement in cardiac function engendered by neurohumoral inhibition is associated with a decrease in mortality that is at least as great in the diabetic patients with heart failure as it is in the non diabetic patients. However, several therapeutic interventions have not yet been specifically validated in diabetic subjects. Thus, physicians should be encouraged to use therapies tested in the diabetic population, such as B-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Diabetic patients would benefit from more aggressive preventive programs aimed at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "924": "Diabetes mellitus represents a major coronary risk factor. Diabetes promotes atherosclerotic plaque development through different mechanisms among which oxidative stress induced by hyperglycaemia appears to play a major role. Knowledge of pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with diabetes helps to better understand the rationale for treatment. Besides a tight control of all cardiovascular risk factors, prescription of drugs aiming of stabilization or even reduction of atherosclerosis should be systematically recommended. These drugs include statines, ACE inhibitors and aspirin eventually combined with clopidogrel. The use of beta blockers should be encouraged in case of stable angina. Finally, any patient with symptomatic modification suggesting acute coronary syndrome should be considered for myocardial revascularization.", 
    "925": "This paper aims at comparing two meta-analyses of clinical trials having investigated the effect of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system either with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or with a selective angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on the incidence of new cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects with arterial hypertension or with congestive heart failure. The protection appears similar with ACEIs in six trials in a total of 24.623 patients (hazard ratio: 0.77; CI 95% 0.72-0.81; p < 0.00001 and with ARBs in five trials in a total of 14.344 patients (hazard ratio: 0.79; CI 95% 0.73-0.85; p < 0.00001). It is consistent whatever the comparator, a thiazide diuretic agent, a beta-blocker, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a placebo. The large ongoing ONTARGET controlled study will allow a direct comparison between an ACEI, ramipril, and an ARB, telmisartan, and will also investigate the potential benefit of a combined treatment with both drugs. The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system should be considered among pharmacological strategies of prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

We undertook sensitivity analysis on studies with high methodological quality.", 
    "931": "The review included data from 37 studies, comprising a total of 1227 patients. Of these, 658 received some form of treatment and 569 acted as controls. The interventions were mostly employing different pharmaceutical agents such as dopamine, diuretics, calcium channel blockers. ACE inhibitors or selected hydration fluids. The results indicated that certain interventions showed some benefits, but all the results suffered from significant heterogeneity. Hence we can draw no conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions in protecting the kidneys during surgery.",

    "933": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) contains a single spike (S) protein, which binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), induces membrane fusion and serves as a neutralizing antigen. A SARS-CoV-S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using the VSVDeltaG* system was generated. Partial deletion of the SARS-CoV-S protein cytoplasmic domain allowed efficient incorporation into VSV particles and led to the generation of a pseudotype (VSV-SARS-St19) at high titre. Green fluorescent protein expression was demonstrated as early as 7 h after infection of Vero E6 cells with VSV-SARS-St19. VSV-SARS-St19 was neutralized by anti-SARS-CoV antibody and soluble ACE2, and its infection was blocked by treatment of Vero E6 cells with anti-ACE2 antibody. These results indicated that VSV-SARS-St19 infection is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein in an ACE2-dependent manner. VSV-SARS-St19 will be useful for analysing the function of SARS-CoV-S protein and for developing rapid methods of detecting neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection.", 
    "934": "Type 2 diabetes is a cardiovascular disease equivalent that is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and significant mortality. However, the metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, indicating that atherogenic vascular changes begin prior to the onset of overt diabetes. At the core of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance (IR), which sets the stage for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction is the first stage of the atherosclerosis process and results from exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, such as IR and diabetes. IR and atherosclerosis follow parallel paths as they progress in severity. Thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-AT1 blockers, and statins are widely used in the treatment of diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that these pharmacologic agents have added mechanisms of action, especially on the endothelium and in the prevention of diabetes.", 
    "935": "s-ACE (the somatic form of angiotensin-converting enzyme) consists of two homologous domains (N- and C-domains), each bearing a catalytic site. Negative co-operativity between the two domains has been demonstrated for cow and pig ACEs. However, for the human enzyme there are conflicting reports in the literature: some suggest possible negative co-operativity between the domains, whereas others indicate independent functions of the domains within s-ACE. We demonstrate here that a 1:1 stoichiometry for the binding of the common ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril, to human s-ACE is enough to abolish enzymatic activity towards FA {N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]}-Phe-GlyGly, Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl)-Phe-His-Leu or Hip (N-benzoylglycyl)-His-Leu. The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of seven tripeptide substrates by human s-ACE appeared to represent average values for parameters obtained for the individual N- and C-domains. Kinetic analysis of the simultaneous hydrolysis of two substrates, Hip-His-Leu (S1) and Cbz-Phe-His-Leu (S2), with a common product (His-Leu) by s-ACE at different values for the ratio of the initial concentrations of these substrates (i.e. sigma=[S2]0/[S1]0) demonstrated competition of these substrates for binding to the s-ACE molecule, i.e. binding of a substrate at one active site makes the other site unavailable for either the same or a different substrate. Thus the two domains within human s-ACE exhibit strong negative co-operativity upon binding of common inhibitors and in the hydrolysis reactions of tripeptide substrates.",

    "952": "Despite excellent antihypertensive drugs on the market, about 70% of all hypertensive patients do not have their blood pressure under control. This is due to problems of compliance, largely because of having to take drugs daily and side effects. We propose an antisense therapy for hypertension because antisense treatment can provide long-lasting, highly specific control of blood pressure. Antisense to oligonucleotides can be designed to inhibit genes that produce proteins known to be overactive in hypertension and that are proven targets of current drug treatments. These include beta1-receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1R). Antisense oligonucleotides are short (12-20 bases), single strands of DNA. They are designed to hybridize to specific mRNA and prevent translation of the target protein. Antisense inhibition of ACE, angiotensinogen or AT1R genes components of the renin-angiotensin system effectively reduce high blood pressure in animal models of hypertension. These include a genetic model (SHR) a surgical model (2KIC), and an environmental model (cold-induced hypertension). In all models, a single systemic administration of antisense decreased blood pressure by about 25 mmHg, and the effect could last up to 1 mo. No toxic effects of repeated antisense treatment were found. The results indicate that antisense therapy could be used for human hypertension and provide long-term protection that would increase compliance of patients.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are standard therapies for HF, although more than 10% of patients with HF are unable to tolerate these agents. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors may not provide complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the long term. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may block the RAS more completely than ACE inhibitors and are better tolerated, several large-scale ARB trials have been performed exploring their potential role in treating patients with symptomatic HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study (ELITE II) demonstrated no significant differences in morbidity and mortality between the ARB losartan and the ACE inhibitor captopril among elderly patients with HF. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) demonstrated reductions in hospitalizations for HF with the ARB valsartan when added to standard HF therapy, with no effect on mortality. Both trials suggested a potential negative interaction between ARB and beta-blocker therapy. The Candesartan in Heart failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program demonstrated significant reductions in morbidity and mortality with the ARB candesartan in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction, with or without ACE inhibitors and with or without beta blockers. Thus, the addition of ARBs to the treatment regimen of patients with symptomatic HF should be strongly considered.",

In the present investigation, we evaluated the effects of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and kinin B2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp3-D-Phe7]-BK, on the duration of survival after acute coronary artery ligation for 15 min in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The captopril treatment (16 and 32 ug/kg, i.v.) resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in survival time of SHR as compared with saline-treated control SHR. Kinin B2 receptors antagonist (4 ug/kg, i.v.) pretreatment abolished (p > 0.05) the beneficial effect of captopril on survival time as compared to saline-treated control SHR. Both the ligation of coronary artery and captopril treatment resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) of SHR as compared to the saline-treated control SHR. In addition, captopril administration caused a significant (p < 0.05) fall in the SBP, DBP and HR of SHR before ligation of the coronary artery (preligation). However, there was no significance (p > 0.05) in SBP, DBP and HR between saline- and kinin B2 receptor antagonist plus captopril-treated SHR during preligation. These finding might indicate that captopril possesses a cardioprotective property as demonstrated by increased in survival time of SHR. This beneficial effect of captopril is mediated via the kinin B2 receptor pathway because kinin B2 receptor antagonist pretreatment blocked the captopril-induced increase in survival time of SHR.", 
    "973": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules in the vasculature. However, when there is imbalance between their occurrence and antioxidant defense mechanisms, ROS can contribute to the vascular abnormalities that lead to hypertension. Evidence accumulated in the last decade strongly supports the notion that ROS are generated in the vasculature mainly by NAD(P)H oxidase in a mechanism that is angiotensin II-dependent. Activation of this enzyme leads to superoxide production and uncouples endothedial NO synthase (eNOS), which sustains oxidative stress while increasing the levels of tissue-damaging peroxynitrite. The latter can result in vascular dysfunction. NAD(P)H-dependent ROS formation, in particular H(2)O(2), could also contribute to vascular injury by sustaining NAD(P)H oxidase activation, promoting inflammatory gene expression, extracellular matrix reorganization, and growth (hypertrophy/hyperplasia) of vascular smooth muscle cells. The effect of ROS appears to be mediated by redox-sensitive targets such as tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, transcription factors, matrix metalloproteinases, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1, Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms and secreted factors such as cyclophilin A and heat shock protein 90-alpha. Redox-sensitive targets appear to play a central role in normal vascular function, but can also lead to remodeling of the vascular wall, increasing vascular reactivity and hypertension. Polymorphisms in the p22phox gene promoter could determine susceptibility to NAD(P)H-mediated oxidative stress in humans and animals with hypertension. Although ROS are strongly implicated in the etiology of hypertension, clinical trials with antioxidants are inconclusive regarding their effectiveness in treating the disease. New drugs with both antihypertensive action and antioxidant properties (Celiprolol, Carvedilol) offer promising results in the management of hypertension.", 
    "974": "In diabetes, oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications, and an early step of such damage is considered to be the development of an endothelial dysfunction. Hyperglycemia directly promotes an endothelial dysfunction inducing process of overproduction of superoxide and consequently peroxynitrite, that damages DNA and activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This process, depleting NAD+, slowing glycolsis, ATP formation and electron transport, results in acute endothelial dysfunction in diabetic blood vessels and contributes to the development of diabetic complications. These new findings may explain why classical antioxidants, like vitamin E, that work scavenging already formed toxic oxidation products, have failed to show beneficial effects on diabetic complications, and suggest new and attractive \"causal\" antioxidant therapy. New, low molecular mass compounds that act as SOD or catalase mimetics or L-propionyl-carnitine and lipoic acid, that work as intracellular superoxide scavengers, improving mitochondrial function and reducing DNA damage, may be good candidates for such strategy, and preliminary studies support this hypothesis. This \"causal\" therapy would also be associated with other promising tools such as LY 333531, PJ34 and FP15, which block protein kinase beta isoform, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and peroxynitrite, respectively. It is now evident that, statins, ACE inhibitors, AT-1 blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones have a strong intracellular antioxidant activity, and it has been suggested that many of their beneficial ancillary effects are due to this property. This preventive activity against oxidative stress generation can justify a large utilization and association of this compounds for preventing complications in diabetic patients where antioxidant defences have been shown to be defective.",

In contrast, acute ACE-inhibitor treatment was associated with a significant 2.0 times increased 3-months re-infarction risk (7.0 vs. 3.6%; RR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.8).

Apoptotic cells were identified by in situ end labeling using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method. Vascular structure was measured using a morphometric protocol and confocal microscopy and a pressurized artery system was used to study vascular functions. We found that a combined treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin lowered systolic blood pressure in both adult SHR and WKY rats and decreased medial thickness and volume and the number of smooth muscle cell layers in mesenteric arteries, as well as media-to-lumen ratio in the interlobular arteries from SHR but not in those from WKY rats. The number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells was higher in the mesenteric arteries from control WKY rats than control SHR and treatment increased the number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells in the arteries from both SHR and WKY rats. Treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin reduced ventricular weight in SHR and normalized the augmented contractile responses to norepinephrine but did not alter the contraction to electric field stimulation. Relaxation responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were not affected by the treatment. We conclude that a combined treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin lowered blood pressure and improved cardiac and vessel hypertrophy and vessel function. An increase in apoptotic smooth muscle cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying the structural improvement.", 
    "988": "The dynamic regulation of intravascular thrombus formation is central to our understanding of both acute and chronic atherosclerotic events. The initiation, modification and resolution of thrombus associated with eroded or unstable coronary plaques is critically dependent on the efficacy of endogenous fibrinolysis, a process that is itself reliant upon the cellular activation and function of the surrounding endothelium and vascular wall. Bradykinin is a vasodilator peptide that stimulates the endothelium to release the pro-lytic factor, tissue-type plasminogen activator and is released at sites of intravascular thrombus formation including the luminal surface of ruptured or eroded atheromatous plaques. Recent studies have provided important and novel insights into the contribution of bradykinin to the regulation of endogenous fibrinolysis and intravascular thrombosis in the peripheral and coronary circulations in vivo in man. Moreover, the pro-fibrinolytic effects of bradykinin are markedly augmented in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and may explain, at least in part, the established anti-ischaemic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with atherosclerosis. The development of novel agents that potentiate bradykinin and endogenous fibrinolysis, such as inhibitors of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, may provide future therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent cardiovascular disease.",

We determined the presence of ANG II precursor angiotensinogen (Angen), and the enzymes that convert it into ANG II, using functional, molecular biology, and immunocytochemical studies in rats. ANG II levels in the SMC were determined using ELISA. The IAS SMC generate ANG II at a rate severalfold higher than those from the adjoining smooth muscle of rectum (RSM). RT-PCR data show that IAS exclusively expresses significant higher levels of renin, Angen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). These data were confirmed using Western blot analyses and immunocytochemistry. In the IAS SMC, H-77 (10 microM; renin inhibitor) and captopril (1 microM; ACE inhibitor) decreased the basal as well as Angen-increased levels of ANG II. The following functional data corroborate the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the IAS tone. Angen produced concentration-dependent shortening of the IAS SMC that was inhibited by H-77 and captopril. In addition, H-77 or captopril caused a concentration-dependent fall in the IAS tone vs. nontonic tissues. Basal tone in IAS is partially under the autocrine control of cellular RAS evident by the expression of mRNA coding Angen, renin, and ACE and translation to the respective proteins in the SMC.",

    "1006": "This study was designed to compare the short-term (1-y) tolerability and antiproteinuric efficacy of enalapril and valsartan in patients with type 2 diabetes. Forty-two patients with normal renal function or early-stage nephropathy were recruited in Hong Kong and randomized to valsartan 80 mg/day or enalapril 5 mg/day; the doses were increased to 160 mg and 10 mg daily, respectively, as tolerated. Early-morning urine was analyzed for albumin and creatinine and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at baseline and 1 year after therapy began. Twenty-two patients were randomized to valsartan and 20 to enalapril. The 2 treatment groups were similar in terms of age, sex distribution, and duration of diabetes or hypertension. Blood pressure decreased to a similar extent (-2.5% to -5.0%) with each drug. Similarly, the 24-hour urinary albumin excretion decreased by 5% to 6% with each drug. The albumin-creatinine ratio in early-morning urine samples and plasma creatinine levels decreased in the valsartan group and increased in the enalapril group, but the difference was not significant. Plasma potassium levels were stable in both groups at the end of study. Cough was reported by 7 (35%) patients receiving enalapril and none of those receiving valsartan (P=.003). In conclusion, enalapril and valsartan both reduced blood pressure and albuminuria to a similar extent with 1 year of therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function or early-stage nephropathy. Fewer adverse events were reported with valsartan, but both drugs appear to be relatively safe.", 
    "1007": "Hypertension is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality; therefore, blood pressure (BP) lowering plays a central role in reducing the cardiovascular complications of hypertension, including stroke. Recent outcomes studies--Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension, Reduction of Endpoints in Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan, and the Irbesartan Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy Trial--suggest that some angiotensin II antagonists are associated with CV and renal effects beyond their ability to lower BP in patients with hypertension or diabetic nephropathy and may play a role in the prevention of new-onset type 2 diabetes. Angiotensin II antagonists are associated with a wide variety of vascular, cardiac, and renal effects, as well as molecule-specific effects independent of those induced by the angiotensin-I receptor. These actions may offer a mechanistic explanation for the outcome benefits observed in patients with hypertension or diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers may also have effects that are not completely explained by differences in the antihypertensive response to these agents, but the evidence is less robust. Collectively, these findings suggest that management of patients with hypertension, with or without diabetes or renal disease, should no longer be viewed as simply a matter of correcting elevated BP. Antihypertensive agents that possess CV benefits beyond their BP-reducing effects should be used to prevent the development of end-organ damage.", 
    "1008": "Four stereoisomers of a Phe-Ala silanediol dipeptide mimic have been evaluated as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and compared to ketone-based inhibitors reported by Almquist et al. One stereogenic center of the isomers was derived from the individual enantiomers of methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate, with separation of diastereomers after introduction of the second stereogenic center. The diastereomeric identities were established by X-ray crystallography of an intermediate. Inhibition of ACE by three of the silanediol diastereomers (IC(50) = 3.8-207 nM) closely paralleled that of the corresponding diastereomeric ketones (IC(50) = 1.0-46 nM). The fourth diastereomer, corresponding to the least inhibitory ketone (IC(50) = 3200 nM), exhibited an unexpected level of inhibition in the silanediol (IC(50) = 72 nM), suggesting an alternative mode of binding to the enzyme.", 
    "1009": "It is now established that the brain possesses a local renin-angiotensin system and that angiotensin II exerts multiple actions in the nervous system, including regulation of striatal dopamine release. Furthermore, angiotensin activates NADPH-dependent oxidases, which are a major source of superoxide, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure, have shown antioxidant properties in several tissues. Oxidative stress is a key contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we treated rats with intraventricular injections of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine and subcutaneous injections of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril to study the possible neuroprotective effect of the latter on the dopaminergic system and on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress. Rats treated with Captopril and 6-hydroxydopamine showed significantly less reduction in the number of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase) in the substantia nigra and in the density of striatal dopaminergic terminals than 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats not treated with Captopril. In addition, Captopril reduced the levels of major oxidative stress indicators (i.e., lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) in the ventral midbrain and the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. Our results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful for treatment of Parkinson's disease and that further investigation should focus on the neuroprotective capacity of these compounds.",

Blood pressure was equally controlled throughout the study period. 29 (40%) patients were withdrawn from the allocated therapy (Q 39%, A 36%, Q&A 47%). Because of the large crossover between trial arms, the data were re-analysed per protocol. The effect on preventing the need for renal replacement therapy then approached significance between the groups (p = 0.089) and the combined quinapril-containing groups were less likely than the amlodipine group to achieve the primary endpoint (p = 0.038), or the individual endpoints of renal replacement therapy (p = 0.030) or doubling creatinine (p = 0.051).",

The impact of BB therapy on all-cause mortality in CHF, in the absence (4.8%) and presence (95.2%) of ACE-I (or ARB), was determined from six trials of 13 370 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for BBs vs. placebo was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.02] in the absence of ACE-I or ARB at baseline, compared with a RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the presence of these agents. When ACE-Inhibitors were analysed in the same way (pre-BB), a RR of 0.89 (0.80-0.99) vs. placebo was observed in studies of >90 days. The impact of BB therapy on death or HF hospitalization in systolic CHF, in the absence and presence of ACE-I, was determined from three trials of 8988 patients.

Prospective studies directly comparing these agents are required to definitively address this issue.", 
    "1017": "Chronic kidney diseases are emerging as a global threat to human health. Renal replacement therapy by dialysis or renal transplantation prolongs survival in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and, in most cases, provides a good quality of life. In all wealthy countries, new patients on dialysis outnumber those who die, and the group of patients on renal replacement therapy is growing. The provision of adequate treatment to all is absorbing a large proportion of the health care budget and is being looked at with concern by policymakers. Because rationing of dialysis or deciding that some patients cannot be treated is out of the question, clinicians should be looking for ways to prevent the need for dialysis in as many patients as possible. Simple and inexpensive treatments are plausible and possibly effective. There is robust experimental evidence that proteinuria is responsible for interstitial inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, which thereby contributes to progressive renal function loss. Clinical studies and clinicopathologic correlations in patients with progressive nephropathies indicate that observations in experimental models are relevant to understanding human disease. Researchers have identified an important correlation between urinary protein excretion and rate of glomerular filtration rate decline in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic chronic nephropathy. Renoprotection is a strategy that aims to interrupt or reverse this process. The current therapeutic approach for proteinuric chronic nephropathies is based on blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers that limit proteinuria, and reduce glomerular filtration rate decline and risk of ESRD more effectively than other antihypertensive treatments. Full remission of the disease, however, is seldom obtained, particularly when pharmacologic intervention is started late. For those who do not respond, treatment procedures to achieve remission and/or regression must include a multimodel strategy to implement renoprotection. The role of lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation, should not be overlooked. A more concerted, strategic, and multisectorial approach, underpinned by solid research evidence, is essential to help reverse the increasing incidence of these chronic diseases, not just for a few beneficiaries, but equitably and on a global scale.",

The increases in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 were unaffected by NF-kappaB inhibition. The expression of ACE2, an enzyme that metabolizes angiotensins I and II, was decreased by 37%, and NF-kappaB inhibition abolished the decrease.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate cardiovascular and renal effects of addition of diuretic treatment to captopril (2 g/L, in drinking water), on survival, on the experimental model of heart failure. Rats were followed for 10 months after coronary ligation. Echocardiographic, hemodynamic, morphometry and renal function investigations were then performed on surviving rats. Survival (from 34 to 61%), diuresis and natriuresis were significantly improved compared to control group only in animals treated with a combination of captopril + furosemide. In treated group: cardiac dimensions were reduced with left ventricular fractional shortening significantly increased in combination group (from 22.4 to 28%); captopril + furosemide animals had highest heart rate and lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressures; body and heart weight were reduced, but kidney weight was significantly increased with furosemide (1.7 g in control vs. 2 g in capto + furo); plasma renin activity and angiotensin 1 were greatly increased, and moderately stimulated in control.

Therefore, the identification of risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia in CHF patients, close monitoring of serum potassium and determination of renal function before and after the initiation of combined therapy or after a dose increment, should be routinely performed.

Such studies have examined large numbers of patients with a wide representation of subgroups and demon-Welwyn strated equivalent benefits in all subsets. In so doing, there may be over-interpretation of the data leading to large-scale applicability of the findings to individuals who were not genuinely represented in the study populations. Most lipid-lowering studies have been unable to consider the possibility that optimal correction of dyslipidaemia would have been more effective than the use of a fixed dose of statins. Studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockade have produced contradictory findings regarding unique non-hypotensive beneficial CVD effects, and suboptimal control of mild hypertension was a frequent finding in the study populations. Scrutiny of concomitant therapy in studies that focus on a particular issue such as LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol or blood pressure supports the notion that benefits from the agent may be attenuated by other drugs. Widespread application of fixed doses of all these agents to at-risk cases will increase the incidence of inappropriate use and side effects. Clinical experience with modulators of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive diabetic renal disease confirms reduced efficacy, and more frequent deterioration of renal function than observed in clinical trials. Measurement of individual biomedical CVD risk factors along with overall risk estimation should continue to be the mainstay of clinical practice. This will allow appropriate case selection for different agents, optimisation of dosage or better assessment of compliance where treatment is less efficacious, and monitoring for adverse effects of therapy. Pragmatic individualisation of care should remain the basis for treating asymptomatic CVD risk factors.",

CHD included myocardial infarction and coronary death. In placebo-controlled trials, ACEIs decreased the risk of CHD (P<0.001), and CCBs reduced stroke incidence (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in CHD risk between regimens based on diuretics/beta-blockers and regimens based on ACEIs (P=0.46) or CCBs (P=0.52). The risk of stroke was reduced by CCBs (P=0.041) but not by ACEIs (P=0.15) compared with diuretics/beta-blockers. Because heterogeneity between trials was significant, we investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by metaregression. Examined covariates were the reduction in systolic blood pressure (BP), drug treatment (ACEIs versus CCBs), their interaction term, sex, age at randomization, year of publication, and duration of treatment. Prevention of CHD was explained by systolic BP reduction (P<0.001) and use of ACEIs (P=0.028), whereas prevention of stroke was explained by systolic BP reduction (P=0.001) and use of CCBs (P=0.042). These findings confirm that BP lowering is fundamental for prevention of CHD and stroke. However, over and beyond BP reduction, ACEIs appear superior to CCBs for prevention of CHD, whereas CCBs appear superior to ACEIs for prevention of stroke."
